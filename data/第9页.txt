It was originally developed for the purpose of conservation of soil from the effect of runoff, which is a major factor governing the soil erosion and its transport, in small agricultural watersheds. Since inception in 1956, its application has been extended to a number of areas such as infiltration, flood, drainage, and water availability, sediment yield, water quality and climate change studies. In an attempt to suggest an improved version, the effect of rainfall intensity (i.e., the ratio of rainfall to rain duration) and antecedent moisture, greatly affecting the runoff quantity but originally ignored, has been studied by postulating different variations of the method. The effect of rainfall intensity is considered by Models M1 and M2, an explicit form. Model M3 incorporates both initial soil moisture and rainfall intensity, and its explicit form (with constant model parameter lambda = 0.2) is M4. A comparative performance evaluation on a very large dataset containing 48,386 rainfall-runoff events of 140 USA watersheds using several indicators leads to the proposition of Model M3 and its further sensitivity analysis describes the model to be the most sensitive to the amount of input rainfall. The study not only supports the incorporation of storm intensity and initial soil moisture in the model formulation but also proposes an alternative version for rainfall-runoff studies required for enhanced water use efficiency through irrigation scheduling.

Projected changes in extreme rainfall and temperature events and possible implications for Cameroon's socio-economic sectors	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						CORDEX-CORE; ETCCDI; extreme events; global warming; heatwave; precipitation	DOWNSCALING EXPERIMENT CORDEX; CLIMATE MODELS; CENTRAL-AFRICA; CMIP5; SIMULATIONS; ENSEMBLE; UNCERTAINTY; INDEXES	Extreme events like flooding, droughts and heatwave are among the factors causing huge socio-economic losses to Cameroonians. Investigating the potential response of rainfall and temperature extremes to global warming is therefore critically needed for tailoring and adjusting the country's policies. Recent datasets have been developed for this purpose within the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CORDEX-CORE) initiative, at similar to 25 km grid spacing. These regional climate models were used to dynamically downscaled four global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), under the optimistic and pessimistic representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. These models were employed in this study for characterizing the response of Cameroon's extreme precipitation and temperature events to global warming, using seven indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. Under global warming, the maximum number of consecutive dry (wet) days' is expected to increase (decrease). However, the annual total rainfall amount is expected to increase, mainly due to the intensification of very wet days and daily rainfall intensity. Furthermore, the temperature-based indices reveal an increase (decrease) in the total annual hot (cold) days, and overall, changes intensify with increased radiative forcing. The high-mitigated low-emission pathway RCP2.6 features attenuated changes, and even sometimes adapts to reverse the sign of changes. Designing reliable policies to limit the risks associated with the above changes is required, as their socio-economic consequences are likely to include food insecurity, heat-related illness, population impoverishment, price rises and market instability.

The study was designed to support target (research) farmers by raising one part of their homestead to use for living and agricultural farming, with the other part excavated to store rainwater and use for aquaculture. The study selected two groups of control farmers: those with ponds and those without. The study was conducted in two phases (i.e., phase 1-pilot phase and phase 2-extended phase), with each year divided into three cropping seasons: summer, rainy, and winter. The study found that the research farmers' income was significantly higher from vegetables (both pilot and extended phases: p < 0.001), dike crops (both pilot and extended phases: p < 0.001), fish (both pilot and extended phases: p < 0.001), livestock (pilot phase: p < 0.01 and extended phase: p < 0.001), and poultry (pilot phase: p < 0.05 and extended phase: p < 0.001) compared to the control farmers. Moreover, the research supported the empowerment of women, which was not found in the control farms. Overall, the research program was embraced by the local communities as a very successful model. Furthermore, the study showed how waterlogging marginally affects very poor people, and that they can cope with this severe problem by adopting various farming practices. Therefore, the application of this research approach is suggested for similarly affected areas.	[Rahman, Md.

However, their effects on distributed hydrological simulations are currently poorly understood due to the lack of observed data on water use. To address this issue, we developed a model by using the Water and Energy Transfer between Soil, Plants, and Atmosphere (WetSpa) with water withdrawal and consumption modules, namely WetSpa-WW. Differently from previous studies roughly estimating water use, the observed withdrawal of surface water and groundwater, as well as industrial, domestic, and agricultural water consumption in sub-basins, were used ac-cording to the site-based measurements. This model was applied to the upper and middle reaches of the Weihe River Basin (UMWRB). Results show that: (1) The proposed WetSpa-WW improved simulation efficiency both of streamflow and actual evapotranspiration (AET), e.g., the relative error (RE) of AET decreased from 20.3 % to-6.43 %. (1=2) The RE of streamflow at the outlet of the basin increases from 10.5 % to 15.3 % without considering the spatial distribution of water use among sub-basins. (3) In the period of 2017-2020, the mean water withdrawal stood at 49.64 mm/a over the basin, resulting in a reduction of streamflow by 22.24 mm/a and an increase of actual evapotranspiration by 6.97 mm/a. This study demonstrates a great potential gain available to the distributed hydrological models integrating records of actual water use, rather than more widely used national statistics.

A promising water-conserving technology for paddy rice farming is the alternate wetting and drying irrigation system, established by the International Rice Research Institute. However, the strategy has still not been widely adopted, because water level measurement is challenging work and sometimes leads to a decrease in the rice yield. For the easy implementation of alternate wetting and drying among farmers, we analyzed a dataset obtained from a farmer's water management study carried out over a three-year period with three cropping seasons at six locations (n = 82) in An Giang Province, Southern Vietnam. We observed a significant relationship between specific water level management and the rice yield and greenhouse gas emissions during different growth periods. The average water level during the crop period was an important factor in increasing the rice yield and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The average water level at 2 days after nitrogen fertilization also showed a potential to increase the rice yield. The greenhouse gas emissions were reduced when the number of days of non-flooded soil use was increased by 1 day during the crop period. The results offer insights demonstrating that farmers' implementation of multiple drainage during whole crop period and nitrogen fertilization period has the potential to contribute to both the rice yield increase and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation.

Simulation experiments comparing nonstationary design-flood adjustments based on observed annual peak flows in the conterminous United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article							PEARSON TYPE-3 DISTRIBUTION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS METHODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; ATTRIBUTION ANALYSIS; ANNUAL MAXIMUM; TREND ANALYSIS; STATIONARITY; SCALE; DISTRIBUTIONS	While nonstationary flood frequency analysis (NSFFA) methods have proliferated, few studies have rigorously compared them for modeling changes in both the central tendency and variability of annual peak-flow series, also known as the annual maximum series (AMS), in hydrologically diverse areas. Through Monte Carlo experiments, we appraise five methods for updating estimates of 10-and 100-year floods at gauged sites using synthetic records based on sample moments and change trajectories of observed AMS in the conterminous United States (CONUS). We compare two methods that consider changes in both central tendency and variability -a Gamma generalized linear model estimated with weighted least squares and the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale, Shape (GAMLSS) -with a distribution-free approach (quantile regression), and baseline cases assuming stationarity or only changes in central tendency. 'Trend-space' plots identify realistic AMS changes for which modeling trends in both central tendency and variability were warranted based on fractional root mean squared errors (fRMSE). They also reveal statistical properties of AMS under which NSFFA models perform especially well or poorly. For instance, quantile regression performed especially well (poorly) under strong negative (positive) skewness. Although the nonstationary LP3 distribution accommodates most AMS with trends well, the sensitivity of NSFFA model performance to different sample moments and trends suggests the need for more flexibility in prescribing design-flood adjustments in the CONUS. A follow-up comparison of regional NSFFA models pooling at-site AMS would further illuminate NSFFA guidance, especially for AMS with properties less conducive to NSFFA modeling, such as positive skewness and increasing variability.

In this study, the performance of three deep learning algorithms, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Self-Attention LSTM models, were evaluated and compared against a baseline Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model for monthly streamflow prediction in the headwaters of the Texas Colorado River. The predictive performance of the models was assessed over the entire range of flow as well as for capturing the extreme hydrologic events (no-flow events and extreme floods) using a suite of model evaluation metrics. According to the results, the deep learning algorithms, especially the LSTM-based models, outperformed the ELM with respect to all evaluation metrics and offered overall higher accuracy and better stability (more robustness against overfitting). Unlike its deep learning counterparts, the simpler ELM model struggled to capture important components of the IRES flow time-series and failed to offer accurate estimates of the hydrologic extremes. The LSTM model (K.G.E. > 0.7, R-2 > 0.75, and r > 0.85), with better evaluation metrics than the ELM and CNN algorithm, and competitive performance to the SA-LSTM model, was identified as an appropriate, effective, and parsimonious streamflow prediction tool for the headwaters of the Colorado River in Texas.

Numerous methods have been introduced to estimate design floods, which include linear and non-linear techniques. Since flood generation is a non-linear process, the use of linear techniques has inherent weaknesses. To overcome these, artificial intelligence (AI)-based non-linear regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) techniques have been introduced over the last two decades. There are limited articles available in the literature discussing the relative merits/demerits of these AI-based RFFA techniques. To fill this knowledge gap, a scoping review on the AI-based RFFA techniques is presented. Based on the Scopus database, more than 1000 articles were initially selected, which were then screened manually to select the most relevant articles. The accuracy and efficiency of the selected RFFA techniques based on a set of evaluation statistics were compared. Furthermore, the relationships among countries and researchers focusing on AI-based RFFA techniques are illustrated. In terms of performance, artificial neural networks (ANN) are found to be the best performing techniques among all the selected AI-based RFFA techniques. It is also found that Australia, Canada, and Iran have published the highest number of articles in this research field, followed by Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India, and China. Future research should be directed towards identification of the impacts of data quantity and quality, model uncertainty and climate change on the AI-based RFFA techniques.

The Poyang Lake region has always been one of the most severe floods and droughts in East China. In order to explore the relationship between monsoon climate change and occurrence of drought/flood, this study rebuilt a high-resolution (similar to 10 yr) of temperature and aridity change history of the past 1000 years. Phytolith assemblages together with the climatic indices revealed 3 phases of paleoenvironmental changes over the last millennium: (1) Medieval Warm Period (MWP) during 900-1370 AD witnessed increased monsoon precipitation and frequent floods corresponding to strong El Nino-like state; (2) Little Ice Age (LIA) during 1370-1800 AD experienced severe droughts coupling with decreased monsoon precipitation and intensive La Nina-like state; (3) Current Warm Period (CWP) during 1800-2003 AD encountered highly frequent floods related to the increased monsoon precipitation modulated by strong El Nino-like state. Our results confirmed that there is a connection between solar irradiance, ENSO activity and monsoon precipitation in the subtropical East China. On interannual-decadal timescales, due to the modulation of ENSO on the location of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) and Meiyu Belt, the occurrences of droughts and floods affected by ENSO-related monsoon precipitation has significantly affected not only the sedimentary environment, but also human activities, which is significant for the prediction of future prevention of droughts and floods in the East Asian monsoon region against the background of global warming.

Although the impact of precipitation and temperature patterns on river flows is a well discussed topic in hydrology, few studies have focused on the relationship between peak discharges and standard Climate Change Indices (ETCCDI) of precipitation and temperature, widely used in climate research. It is of interest to evaluate whether these indices are relevant for characterizing and predicting floods in the Alpine area. In this study, a correlation analysis of the ETCCDI indices annual time series and annual maximum flows is presented for the Piedmont Region, in North-Western Italy. Spearman's rank correlation is used to determine which ETCCDI indices are temporally correlated with maximum discharges, allowing to hypothesize which climate drivers better explain the interannual variability of floods. Moreover, the influence of climate (decadal) variability on the tendency of annual maximum discharges is examined by spatially correlating temporal trends of climate indices with temporal trends of the discharge series in the last twenty years, calculated using the Theil-Sen slope estimator. Results highlight that, while extreme precipitation indices are highly correlated with extreme discharges at the annual timescale, with different indices that are consistent with catchment size, the decadal tendencies of extreme discharges may be better explained by the decadal tendencies of the total annual precipitation over the study area. This suggests that future projections of the annual precipitation available from climate models simulations, whose reliability is higher compared to precipitation extremes, may be used as covariates for non-stationary flood frequency analysis.

The antagonistic effects of variable environmental properties classify the forest response according to various tree compositions among different sites. The division of the forest response was assessed in 52 stands arranged into 26 types of 13 site management populations (MPs) in 5 areas in the Czech Republic territory. The assessment was performed using time-series multiple regressions of basal-area increment from pure immature stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), oaks (Quercus sp.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and willows (Salix sp.) dependent on the interpolated average temperatures, annual precipitation, atmospheric concentrations of SO2, NOx and O-3 and soil properties over the period 1971-2008 at p < 0.05. Site MPs differentiated the forest response to a greater extent than tree species. The response of the forests was significantly distributed by means of the montane, upland and waterlogged sites. The multiple determination index (r(2)) >= 0.6 indicated an adaptable tree increment but an interval of r(2) between 0.80-0.92 implied forest sensitivity to variability in environmental properties on non-waterlogged sites. The index r(2) < 0.6 suggested a fluctuating forest increment that reflects environmental variability inconsistently. The fluctuating increment most affected the spruce and pine stands grown from upland to submontane locations. Montane spruce stands, as well as rock pines, appeared to be one of the most sensitive ones to environmental change. Floodplain forests seemed as adaptable to variable environmental properties.

A large number of these critical assets cross or are adjacent to waterways and flood-plains and are therefore exposed to flood actions such as scour, hydrodynamic loading, and inundation, all of which are exacerbated by debris accumulations. These stressors are widely recognized as responsible for the vast majority of bridge failures around the world, and they are expected to be exacerbated due to climate change. While efforts have been made to increase the robustness of bridges to the flood hazard, many scientific and technical gaps remain. These gaps were explored during an expert workshop that took place in April 2021 with the participation of academics, consultants, and decision makers operating mainly in the United Kingdom and specializing in the fields of bridge risk assessment and management and flood resilience. The objective of the workshop was to identify and prioritize the most urgent and significant impediments to bridge flood resilience. In particular, the following issues, established at different levels and scales of bridge flood resilience, were identified and analysed in depth: (i) characterization of the effects of floods on different bridge typologies, (ii) uncertainties in formulae for scour depth assessment, (iii) evaluation of consequences of damage, (iv) recovery process after flood damage, (v) decision-making under uncertainty for flood-critical bridges, and (vi) use of event forecasting and monitoring data for increasing the reliability of bridge flood risk estimations. These issues are discussed in this paper to inform other researchers and stakeholders worldwide, guide the directions of future research in the field, and influence policies for risk mitigation and rapid response to flood warnings, ultimately increasing bridge resilience.

However, information on sources, mechanisms, and timescales of sediment delivery are lacking, particularly for wave-protected mesotidal estuaries. Here we show that marine sediment mobilized and delivered during coastal storms is a primary source to the North and South Rivers, a mesotidal bar-built estuary in a small river system impacted by frequent, moderate-intensity storms that is typical to New England (United States). On the marsh platform, deposition rates, clastic content, and dilution of fluvially-sourced contaminated sediment by marine material all increase down-estuary toward the inlet, consistent with a predominantly marine-derived sediment source. Marsh clastic deposition rates are also highest in the storm season. We observe that periods of elevated turbidity in channels and over the marsh are concurrent with storm surge and high wave activity offshore, rather than with high river discharge. Flood tide turbidity also exceeds ebb tide turbidity during storm events. Timescales of storm-driven marine sediment delivery range from 2.5 days to 2 weeks, depending on location within the estuary; therefore the phasing of storm surge and waves with the spring-neap cycle determines how effectively post-event suspended sediment is delivered to the marsh platform. This study reveals that sediment supply and the associated resilience of New England mesotidal salt marshes involves the interplay of coastal and estuarine processes, underscoring the importance of looking both up- and downstream to identify key drivers of environmental change.

Understanding of spatio-temporal evolution of wet-dry events collectively, their characteristics, and the transition (wet to dry and dry to wet) is therefore significant to identify and locate most vulnerable hotspots, providing the basis for the adaptation and mitigation measures. The Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB) in South Asia was selected as a case study, where the relevance of wet-dry events and their transition has not been assessed yet, despite clear evidence of climate change in the region. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at the monthly timescale was applied to detect and characterize wet and dry events for the period 1981-2014. The results of temporal variations in SPEI showed a strong change in basin climatic features associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at the end of 1997, with the prevalence of wet and dry events before and after 1997 respectively. The results of spatial analysis show a higher susceptibility of the monsoon-dominated region towards wet events, with more intense events occurring in the eastern part, whereas a higher severity and duration are featured in the southwestern part of the basin. In contrast, the westerlies-dominated region was found to be the hotspot of dry events with higher duration, severity, and intensity. Moreover, the surrounding region of the Himalaya divide line and the monsoon-dominated part of the basin were found to be the hotspots of rapid wet-dry transition events.

Projections of Hydroclimatic Extremes in Southeast Alaska under the RCP8.5 Scenario	EARTH INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Drought; Extreme events; Flood events; Downscaling	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; DROUGHT	Parts of southeast Alaska experienced record drought in 2019, followed by record daily precipitation in late 2020 with substantial impacts to human health and safety, energy resources, and fisheries. To help ascertain whether these types of events can be expected more frequently, this study investigated observed trends and projected changes of hydroclimatic extremes indices across southeast Alaska, including measures of precipitation variability, seasonality, magnitude, and type. Observations indicated mixed tendencies of interannual precipitation variability, but there were consistent trends toward warmer and wetter conditions. Projected changes were assessed using dynamically downscaled climate model simulations at 4-km spatial resolution from 2031 to 2060 that were compared with a historical period from 1981 to 2010 using two models-NCAR CCSM4 and GFDL CM3. Consistent directional changes were found for five of the analyzed indices. The CCSM indicated increased maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1; 12.6%), increased maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5; 7.4%), longer periods of consecutive dry days (CDD; 11.9%), fewer snow cover days (SNC; -21.4%) and lower snow fraction (SNF; -24.4%); for GFDL these changes were 19.8% for RX1, 16.0% for RX5, 20.1% for CDD, -21.9% for SNC, and -26.5% for SNF. Although both models indicated substantial snow losses, they also projected annual snowfall increases at high elevations; this occurred above 1500 m for CCSM and above 2500 m for GFDL. Significance testing was assessed at the 95% confidence level using Theil-Sen's slope estimates for the observed time series and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test for projected changes of the hydroclimatic extremes indices relative to their historical distributions.

A series of heavy rains that began on July 31st, 2018, battered the Hami prefecture of eastern Xinjiang, China for four days. These rains sparked devastating floods, caused 20 deaths, eight missing, and the evacuation of about 5500 people. This study examines the extreme rainfall event in a historical context and explores the anthropogenic causes based on analysis of multiple datasets (i.e., the observed daily data, the global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1, and the satellite cloud data) and several statistical techniques. Results show that this extraordinarily heavy rainfall was due mainly to the abnormal weather system (e.g., the abnormal subtropical high) that transported abundant water vapor from the Indian Ocean and the East China Sea crossed the high mountains and formed extreme rainfall in Hami prefecture, causing the reservoir to break and form a flood event with treat loss, which is a typical example of a comprehensive analysis of the extreme rainfall event in summer in Northwest China. Also, the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) value was 1.00 when the 2018 July-August RX1day (11.52 mm) was marked as the threshold, supporting the claim of a significant anthropogenic influence on the risk of this extreme rainfall. The results offer insights into the variability of precipitation extremes in arid areas contributing to better manage water-related disasters.

Biases are corrected according to the identified discrepancy between the probability distribution of the model run and that of the observed data in the historical period. The projections of 21 weather stations in Taiwan under 10 (2RCP x 5GCM) scenarios for the near-(2021-2040) and far-future (2081-2100) are derived. The frequently occurred short-duration storm events in some regions decrease, but they are still vulnerable to flood considering the existing drainage capacities. More specifically, the land-subsidence region in the central, the landslide-sensitive mountainous region in the north and central, the pluvial- and fluvial-flood prone region in the north, and the eastern regions with vulnerable infrastructures should be especially aware of long-duration extreme events. Associations of the rainfall intensity with the different return period as well as the duration are further analyzed. The short-duration extreme events will become stronger, especially for 1-h events in the northern region and 1 or 2-h events in both the southern and eastern regions. In addition, places without experiences of long-lasting events may experience rainfall amounts exceeding 500 mm should be alert. Adaptation measures such as establishing distributed drainage system or renewing hydrological infrastructures in the eastern region are suggested considering the near future projection, and in the central and the southern regions for far future as well. Our findings can assist adaptation-related decision-making for more detailed stormwater/water resource management.

In the steppe of Eastern Europe, amid dry conditions, Quercus robur occupies mostly riverine habitats and ravines. Here we study the climate sensitivity and drought vulnerability of a Q. robur population located at the rear edge of the species range, in the steppe of Ukraine. The population occupies two adjacent but clearly contrasting in their microclimatic conditions sites: a river floodplain and a steep-sloping river bank. We develop tree earlywood, latewood, and total ring width sitelevel chronologies and evaluate their relationship with regional climate variables and the local river's water level using response function analysis. We find that trees growing in the floodplain and at the steep river bank have exhibited slightly different growth patterns. The trees at the flooded site have benefited from water proximity, which facilitated their earlywood growth. These trees have responded positively to the current May and previous September precipitation and previous and current May temperatures. At the non-flooded site, the trees have experienced warm temperatures and the lack of precipitation in June. The extreme drought episodes have triggered a decrease in the latewood and total ring width in trees from both sites. We established that oak growth in the floodplain had been depressed by an unknown stressor around 1900, therefore limiting our ability to identify the more beneficial steppe habitat for Q. robur conclusively. Nevertheless, our results provide a dendrochronological evidence of Q. robur survival in a dry steppe environment and lend new insights into local microclimatic factors contributing to it.

Alpine soil microbial community structure and diversity are largely influenced by moisture content in the Zoige wetland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Zoige alpine wetland; Microbial community; High-throughput sequencing; 16S rRNA; Soil moisture	ORGANIC-CARBON; FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; TIBETAN PLATEAU; BACTERIAL; DEGRADATION; FRACTIONS; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; QUALITY; MARSH	The Zoige alpine wetland is one of the most sensitive ecosystems to global climate change. It is the largest alpine wetland in the world and currently suffers from serious drought and degradation. In this study, soil microbial communities of five soils with different moisture content were investigated by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. The results showed that soil acidity and the content of soil nutrients decreased with the decrease in soil moisture. The microbial richness indices (Chao1 and ACE) and diversity index (Shannon) were highest in the flooded wetland (FW) and lowest in the unflooded mound near the flooded wetland (UW). The relative abundance showed four dominated phyla among all the soil microbes in five soils: Proteobacteria (36.5%), Acidobacteria (26.1%), Actinobacteria (9.4%) and Bacteroidetes (5.8%). Moreover, Proteobacteria (51.4%) of UW was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of other soils, while Actinobacteria (1.6%), Gemmatimonadetes (0.9%) and Nitrospirae (0.03%) of UW were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those of other soils. Principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that soil samples of UW differed most from samples of other soils. Proteobacteria was positively correlated with water-soluble phosphorus, while Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were negatively correlated with total organic carbon and total nitrogen. Our findings revealed that soils in transitional unstable state from flooded to aridification had the lowest microbial diversity, and drought led to long-term changes in the microbial community in the Zoige wetland, which may cause further degradation of alpine wetland ecosystem functions.

Changes in Future Precipitation Mean and Variability across Scales	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Precipitation; Rainfall; Climate variability; Decadal variability; Interannual variability; Intraseasonal variability	CLIMATE VARIABILITY; DECADAL VARIABILITY; INCREASES; RAINFALL; TRENDS	Changes in precipitation variability can have large societal consequences, whether at the short time scales of flash floods or the longer time scales of multiyear droughts. Recent studies have suggested that in future climate projections, precipitation variability rises more steeply than does its mean, leading to concerns about societal impacts. This work evaluates changes in mean precipitation over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales using a range of models from high-resolution regional simulations to millennial-scale global simulations. Results show that changes depend on the scale of aggregation and involve strong regional differences. On local scales that resolve individual rainfall events (hours and tens of kilometers), changes in precipitation distributions are complex and variances rise substantially more than means, as is required given the well-known disproportionate rise in precipitation intensity. On scales that aggregate across many events, distributional changes become simpler and variability changes smaller. At regional scale, future precipitation distributions can be largely reproduced by a simple transformation of present-day precipitation involving a multiplicative shift and a small additive term. The "extra" broadening is negatively correlated with changes in mean precipitation: in strongly "wetting" areas, distributions broaden less than expected from a simple multiplicative mean change; in "drying" areas, distributions narrow less. Precipitation variability changes are therefore of especial concern in the subtropics, which tend to dry under climate change. Outside the tropics, variability changes are similar on time scales from days to decades (i.e., show little frequency dependence). This behavior is highly robust across models, suggesting it may stem from some fundamental constraint.

J	Oetzel, J; Oh, CH				Oetzel, Jennifer; Oh, Chang Hoon			A storm is brewing: Antecedents of disaster preparation in risk prone locations	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						disaster preparation; global survey; natural disaster; organizational learning; risk perception	NATURAL HAZARDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERCEPTION; DECISION; PREPAREDNESS; EXPERIENCE; MEDIATION; RESPONSES; BUSINESS; STRATEGY	Research Summary Research emphasizes the value of disaster preparation and the importance of experience in doing so, yet most companies fail to prepare. The antecedents of preparation are poorly understood, in part, because experience by itself only partly explains the story. To address these concerns, we developed two unique surveys: one from an international survey in 18 disaster-prone countries and another from a U.S. survey in New York City and Miami. We find that organizational experience with natural disasters increases preparedness for future hazards. Also, organizational learning from other businesses and organiztions positively mediates this relationship. Managers are more willing to learn from others in locations characterized by high-impact, low-frequency disasters. In areas with low impact, high frequency disasters, managers more likely misjudge the severity of natural disasters. Managerial Summary Despite the increasing frequency and severity of floods, storms, wildfires and other natural hazards, why do some firms in disaster-prone areas prepare while others do not? To investigate, we conducted two studies: an international survey in 18 disaster-prone countries and a U.S. survey in New York City and Miami. In both surveys, managers are more likely to prepare when their companies experienced prior disasters. Managers operating in locations characterized by high-impact, low-frequency disasters are more willing to learn from others. In contrast, managers in areas characterized by low impact, high frequency disasters, are more likely to prepare alone. Since effective disaster preparation typically entails working with, and learning from others, those companies that choose a go-it-alone strategy may misjudge disaster risk.

Hydrological Dynamics of the Congo Basin From Water Surfaces Based on L-Band Microwave	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Congo; flood; rainfall; SMOS; SWAF; water extent	SOIL-MOISTURE RETRIEVAL; AMAZON BASIN; RAINFALL; RIVERS; MODEL; CLIMATOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; INUNDATION; MULTIYEAR; ALTIMETRY	In this study, the hydrological dynamics of the Congo River Basin (CRB) have been analyzed. This is achieved using multiangular and dual-polarization passive L-band microwave signal from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite to estimate water surface extent dynamics from 2010 to 2017. The results provide new insights into the poorly characterized wetlands, peatlands, and floodplains dynamics of the CRB. We found that the mean flooded area for the entire CRB is equal to 89,408 +/- 20,623 km(2) corresponding to 2.39% of the entire basin. The results were compared with three land cover maps (European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative [ESA-CCI], International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme [IGBP], and Global Surface Water Occurrence [GSWO]) and the SWAMPS global dynamic water surfaces product. More inland waters were detected than the four previous products, except along the rivers. Floods and droughts during the last 10 years were also depicted. The knowledge about the CRB hydrological behavior was improved by analyzing the date of maximum floods, the time lag in days between precipitation, water surface extent, and river water height at the outlet of the nine major Congo subbasin. A lag of 67 +/- 3 days between rainfall and inundated areas was found in the Upper Congo (r = 0.89). In the Kasai subbasin, no time lag between rainfall and inundation was found (r = 0.86). The contribution of each floodplain to the Congo discharge was also evaluated.

The subsequent glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a significant threat to lives and livelihoods as they can cause catastrophic damage up to hundreds of kilometres downstream. Previous studies have reported the rapid expansion of glacial lakes and several notable destructive past GLOF events in the Mahalangur Himalaya, suggesting a necessity of timely and updated GLOF susceptibility assessment. Here, an updated inventory of glacial lakes across the Mahalangur Himalaya is developed based on 10-m Sentinel-2 satellite data from 2018. Additionally, the GLOF susceptibilities of glacial lakes (>= 0.045 km(2)) are evaluated using a multi-criteria-based assessment framework where six key factors are selected and analyzed. Weight for each factor was assigned from the analytical hierarchy process. Glacial lakes are classified into very low, low, medium, high, and very high GLOF susceptibility classes depending upon their susceptibility index based on analysis of three historical GLOF events in the study area. The result shows the existence of 345 glacial lakes (>0.001 km(2)) with a total area of 18.80 +/- 1.35 km(2) across the region in 2018. Furthermore, out of the 64 glacial lakes (>= 0.045 km(2)) assessed, seven were identified with very high GLOF susceptibility. We underline that pronounced glacier-lake interaction will likely increase the GLOF susceptibility. Regular monitoring and more detailed fieldworks for these highly susceptible glacial lakes are necessary. This will benefit in early warning and disaster risk reduction of downstream communities.

ASSESSMENT OF INUNDATION AREA AND WATER LEVEL OF THE TONLE SAP LAKE USING MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA BETWEEN 2008 AND 2018	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						composite index; Jason-2 and Jason-3 radar altimetry; lagging relationship; variation tendency; flood pulse	MEKONG RIVER-BASIN; SURFACE-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALTIMETRY; STORAGE; PRODUCTIVITY; HYDROPOWER; MISSIONS; IMPACTS; ENVISAT	As the largest freshwater lake located in the most controversial transboundary river in Asia, the Tonle Sap Lake is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world. However, uncertainty remains because of the inability to measure nonlinear inundation dynamics in remote lakes at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, let along the water levels. This research attempted to explore the reliability of radar altimetry data to detect the inland water level of inundation areas, like that of Tonle Sap Lake over the past decade. The results indicated that the Jason-2 and Jason-3 radar altimetry data were able to retrieve water level with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.9232 and confidence coefficient of 98%), and the composite index was proven to be the optimal method to identify inundation area of the Tonle Sap Lake compared to the single-band threshold method and modified normalized difference water index by applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Surface Reflectance products MOD09A1. The fluctuation trend of inundation area and water level were basically consistent with the precipitation, presenting a distinct lagging relationship. More important was the truth that the downstream water level had poor correlation with the upstream runoff both in flood period and non-flood periods (R-2 = 0.0542 and 0.2873, p < 0.01), which indicated that the upstream explorations over Lancang- Mekong River had little effects on the downstream water volume.

To evaluate land-use types variation and quantify its hydrological impact, this paper identified the temporal-spatial features and simulated the hydrological process of different land-use types over the last two decades (1990-2010) based on the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Meanwhile, the possible influence of land-use changes on streamflow in the next 30 years (2020-2050) was also considered. Results indicated that (1) land-use types mainly constituted of forest land, grassland and cultivated land, which had the largest decreasing rate of 17.34 km(2)/10a. At the same time, inter-conversion mainly conducted among the main land-use types and had a similar transfer structure for these two sub-periods (1990-2000, 2000-2010) during 1990-2010, with a more dramatic transformation in 2000-2010. (2) Simulated annual and monthly surface runoff did not vary greatly from 1990 to 2010 and presented a relatively uniform monthly distribution. At the same time, the increased vegetation coverage (forest land and grassland) can not only reduce surface runoff but also prevent peak flood with increasing and decreasing steeply. (3) Finally, hydrological variability to the future land-use change will not be intensive, which possibly related to the undeveloped regional economic and insignificant human activities. But it also needed some measures to maintain a balanced nature, such as the soil and water conservation measures and returning cultivated land to forest land and grassland.

Influence of soil microbiota on<i>Taxodium distichum</i>seedling performance during extreme flooding events	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Baldcypress; Dark septate endophytes; Hurricanes; Mutualism; Symbioses	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; DARK SEPTATE ENDOPHYTES; WATER TUPELO SWAMP; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA; SEEDLING GROWTH; HOST-PLANT; LEAF-AREA; COLONIZATION; BALDCYPRESS	Plant associations with soil microbiota can modulate tree seedling growth and survival via mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. It is uncertain, however, whether soil microbiota influence seedling growth of coastal trees when exposed to extreme flooding regimes. We evaluated the role of soil microbes in promoting baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) seedling performance under different inundation scenarios and determined the influence of flooding on the colonization ofin plantabeneficial microbes. Seedlings reared in sterile and non-sterile soil were exposed to three different flooding regimes historically experienced in Louisiana swamps. Seedling growth was assessed, and the colonization by beneficial symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrizhal fungi (AMF), and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was evaluated in harvested roots. Seedlings grown in sterile soil had six times higher growth than seedlings reared in non-sterile soil. As a result, we evaluated pathogen load in the roots by assessing oomycete colonization. Flooding influenced thein plantacolonization of DSE and oomycetes, but did not affect the colonization of mutualist AMF fungi. DSE and oomycetes were rarer in flooded conditions, while AMF remained abundant. Seedling biomass production was not correlated within plantafungal colonization or pathogen load. Soil microbiota can negatively influence baldcypress seedling growth, and no growth benefit was evidenced from the root colonization of mutualist fungi. Flooding can modify baldcypress-fungal interactions by diminishing colonization of DSE. Overall, baldycpress seedlings were more sensitive to the presence of microbiota than flooding, and thus restoration efforts should focus on having a better understanding of plant-microbe interactions in swamps.

Seagrass (<i>Zostera capensis</i>) bed development as a predictor of size structured abundance for a ubiquitous estuary-dependent marine fish species	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Flooding; Juvenile fish habitat; Rhabdosargus holubi; Sparidae; Submerged macrophytes	SOUTH-AFRICAN ESTUARIES; FRESH-WATER; RIVER FLOW; CORAL-REEF; KARIEGA ESTUARY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NURSERY ROLE; MANGROVE; MANAGEMENT; TEMPERATE	Episodic river flooding has the capacity to 'reset' estuaries and redirect these systems on a new path towards some sort of dynamic physical and biological equilibrium. A major river flood through the Kariega Estuary, South Africa, during 2012, provided an ideal opportunity to monitor the occupation of seagrass (Zostera capensis) beds by juveniles of the marine sparid Rhabdosargus holubi, post flood recovery. The estuary contained extensive dense submerged Z. capensis beds throughout the system prior to the flood, almost all of which was removed from the system as a result of the flood. Over the following four years there was a gradual recovery in the extent of cover of submerged Z. capensis beds, which by the end of 2015 had recovered to near the same levels of cover as the pre-flood conditions. In addition to the positive relationship between seagrass development and R. holubi abundance that was recorded, there was also a greater utilisation of this habitat type by the smaller (10-40 mm SL) compared to the larger (41-60 mm SL) juvenile size classes. This new finding emphasizes that occupation of particular estuarine nursery habitats by the juveniles of estuary-associated fish species may not necessarily be uniform and may change with age. The study also reinforces the changing nature of estuarine environments over time and highlights, once again, the importance of this habitat type for the most abundant estuary-dependent marine fish species on the African subcontinent.

Accordingly, significant floods that occur in these cities will trigger the simultaneous occurrence of flooding by river water and inland flooding. However, existing studies have focused on the impact of flooding by river water, inland flooding, and high tide in tidal rivers, and disaster mitigation measures focused on detailed flooding processes in such flooding areas have not been conducted thus far. This study focused on a tidal river, i.e., Katabira River of Yokohama city, one of Japan's metropolitan cities, to construct a simultaneous occurrence model of flooding by river water and inland flooding, including the impact of a high tide. Numerical analysis was conducted using this model, and the results show that the flooded area significantly changed from 0.004 to 0.149 km(2)according to the tide level of the estuary. Moreover, by simultaneously solving the calculation of flooding by river water and inland flooding, we found that there was a difference of 50 min between the occurrences of these floods. Therefore, we found that there is a possibility that, if evacuation is not conducted at the time of occurrence of inland flooding, evacuation during subsequent river-water flooding may not be possible. Based on these results, our proposed method was found to be useful for tidal rivers of metropolitan cities.

China's Nen River basin has experienced widespread conversion from forest to cropland in the past century, making it representative of similar global land use changes. We assessed organic carbon and nitrogen transport in this basin during 2018 and 2019, using water samples collected at one-hour intervals during the twelve flood events in two sub-basins (the Yalu and Yin rivers) dominated by forests and cropland, respectively. We also assessed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations from 19 sampling sites distributed throughout the Nen River basin, in combination with hydrological records, to investigate the impacts of land cover on riverine carbon and nitrogen fluxes. The forested Yalu river basin showed significantly higher DOC content and lower TDN content than Yin river basin. Riverine DOC concentrations during non-flood periods in the forested Yalu river basin were significantly higher than in the cultivated Yin river basin, but riverine TDN concentrations were lower. Throughout the Nen River basin and its sub-basins, riverine TDN content was proportional to cropland area. During the twelve flood events, riverine DOC and TDN varied widely over time in the Yin and Yalu river basins, possibly due to dilution effects of water originating from different land covers within the basins. Our results demonstrate that land cover is the principal cause of changes in riverine DOC and TDN content in this region.

J	Carriquiry, AN; Sauri, D; March, H				Noblega Carriquiry, Andrea; Sauri, David; March, Hug			Community Involvement in the Implementation of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDSs): The Case of Bon Pastor, Barcelona	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sustainable urban drainage system; urban stormwater management; community participation; stakeholders perception; Barcelona	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER MANAGEMENT; URBANIZATION; ADAPTATION	The persistence of urban floods and the inability of aging sewage infrastructure to deal with stormwater make sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDSs) one of the emerging paradigms in urban water management, in which stormwater is no longer a hazard but a resource. Although most of the global research has been done on the technical aspects of SUDSs, their social impacts are not always taken into consideration. The neighborhood scale that characterizes SUDSs creates a different governance system-compared to the old structures of flood risk management-characterized by decentralization practices and where communities gain a better position of negotiation and new responsibilities. The objective of this research is to recognize how the diverse stakeholders involved in SUDSs interact with each other and to look into the different levels of understanding SUDSs as a new alternative of stormwater infrastructure. In order to accomplish this task, the paper introduces the case of the neighborhood of Bon Pastor (Barcelona, Spain), which has gone through urban transformations over the past years, promoting the development of SUDSs in 2012. Empirical evidence was obtained from 10 semi-structured interviews with government, technicians, social organizations, and local community citizens as well as revision of existing policy documents and grey literature on SUDSs and historical documents on the development of the neighborhood. The results show how active the community was during the design process and afterward, as sustainability gradually became one of the main topics in the neighborhood to be incorporated in new developments. However, it also unveiled several issues related to maintenance and the ambiguity of the term SUDS for the different stakeholders involved.

An example of this challenge is the growing costs of publicly-funded flood defense in Britain and popular outcries during the regular occasions that the British government fails to protect property and land during heavy rains. Traditional approaches to institutional analysis suggest that flood management is either a public good that only the government is competent to provide or a private good to which individual landowners are ultimately responsible for supplying. We argue that an important cause of failure in flood management is mismatched property rights. This is where the scale of natural events and resources fail to align with the scale of human activities, responsibility and ownership. Moreover, the spatial dimensions of floods mean that their management is often appropriately conceptualized as a common pool resource problem. As a result, commons institutions as conceptualized and observed by Elinor Ostrom are likely to be major contributors to effective flood management. What governance process should decide the size and scope of these institutions? We argue that bottom-up responses to problems of mismatched property rights are facilitated within larger societies that are characterized by market processes. Moreover, the wider presence of price signals delivers to local communities essential knowledge about the cost of maintaining private property and the relative scarcity of the communal goods. We discuss how our theoretical positions align with experience in Britain and what the implications of our theoretical approach are for facilitating the development of better institutions.

Evaluating the capabilities of current numerical systems in predicting past events can bring extremely valuable contributions to the assessment of the information content available today with operational models. In the framework of the activities for the fiftieth anniversary of the extreme precipitation event that occurred in Italy in November 1966, this paper investigates its predictability using state-of-the-art global and regional ensemble simulations. The first goal is to assess if and how many days in advance, this event can be predicted by current European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global ensembles. A second goal is to evaluate the potential added value of running nested higher-resolution and convection-permitting ensembles. It is shown that ECMWF ensembles are able to provide valuable information up to 3 days before the event. Within this forecast range, convection-permitting simulations can provide more accurate estimations of precipitation maxima. However, the results indicate also a strong underestimation of rainfall amounts with both global and regional models even at short forecast range. To partially explain this shortcoming, we discuss how the scarcity of observations available in 1966 for the analysis process limits the quality of the ensemble initial conditions and we adopt a method to obtain more reliable ensemble forecasts. The paper concludes with a comparison with previous similar works; results indicate a gain in predictability of up to 12 hr with respect to numerical revisitations performed to mark the fortieth anniversary of the event.

To evaluate the impact of a GLOF in the hydrography and biological components of the plankton in the Baker Fjord, we assessed the relative contributions of terrigenous versus marine plankton carbon sources to the particulate organic matter (POM) in the fjord before and after a GLOF in the austral summer 2014. We also evaluated whether terrestrial carbon brought into the fjord by the river may reach higher trophic levels via a deposit-feeding organism the juvenile pelagic Munida gregaria. Over a 10-day period, hydrographic profiles, water samples for POM, and zooplankton samples were collected daily from three stations and two depths along the fjord's inner section. Samples of suspended POM and tissue from M. gregaria were analyzed for stable-isotope composition of carbon (C-13). The GLOF arrival produced a thermal front in the fjord, followed by an oscillation of the pycnocline; an abrupt increase in the total organic carbon content of POM, which was attributed to terrestrial input; and a concurrent peak in the abundance of M. gregaria, suggesting an aggregation response to the GLOF. Understanding GLOF effects on local hydrography, productivity, and food web structure provides valuable insight on the potential responses of fjord ecosystems in general to climate change-induced variability. Given present climatic trends in high-latitude zones, more frequent GLOFs might be expected in Patagonian fjords and channels as well as in other high-latitude basins.

Google Trends indicators to inform water planning and drought management	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						drought; England; Google Trends; indicator; Ireland; newspapers		Indicators are important tools for tracking the socio-environmental impacts of droughts and building resilience to climate change. We begin with an overview of metrics used for water planning and drought management, with particular emphasis on the UK. We explain how considerations of cost, immediacy, access, consistency, relevance, reliability and others denote the suitability of information for developing new indicators. We then demonstrate the potential of Google Trends (GT) online search data as drought indicators for England and Ireland. We show that search terms such as 'drought', 'water butt' and 'hosepipe ban' correlate significantly with conventional hydroclimatic data as well as with newspaper reports of various drought impacts during the period 2011-2022. GT data also show evidence of rising interest in water saving technologies, especially for outdoor water use. Meanwhile, online searches for 'Defra' and 'Environment Agency' have declined and are more often associated with flood episodes than droughts. Interest in water companies in England is more likely around hosepipe bans than water leakage (although this varies by company). We discuss the implications of these findings for targeting information campaigns, plus prospects for monitoring drought impacts and public sentiment in near real-time.

Rainak Khan; Razi, Mohammad Arfar			Disaster risk reduction in Bangladesh: A comparison of three major floods for assessing progress towards resilience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster risk reduction; Sylhet flood; DRR; Flood management; Bangladesh	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT	The modern disaster management approach is based on the disaster management cycle comprising four distinct components: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, and focuses on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and resilience. As a disaster -prone country, Bangladesh needed to evolve its policies to develop a strong disaster management system that builds resilience at the community level and ensures overall DRR. Frequent floods and policy failures drove changes, so analysis is needed to see if the policy shifts are productive and results -oriented. This study shows Bangladesh's shift to DRR by comparing human casualties and infrastructure/financial damage in the 1988, 2004, and 2022 floods. It analyzes Bangladesh's DRR efficiency over 34 years and the three major floods. Furthermore, it highlights the flood impacts to identify gaps and areas for improvement in building resilience. The study reveals that the current DRR approach in Bangladesh is adequate and well aligned with the vision of "Winning resilience together against all odds." The significant transition from a predominantly relief and recovery approach to an integrated, "people -centered" flood management strategy made the disaster management framework robust and capable of handling future disasters which is the prerequisite to reducing the risk, vulnerability and impact of disasters. Areas of improvement include coordinated efforts between government and non -government organizations and agencies, empowerment of local authorities, community -based capacity building, and strict monitoring and accountability of mismanagements, among others. Bangladesh has well -designed DRR strategies and plans in place. It must invest in DRR and implement a "Whole -of -Society" approach to build a resilient, sustainable nation.

The central government is, therefore, formulating a new strategy premised on adaption to natural environmental dynamics. For an achievable strategy that bridges the gap between plans and practice, it is important to understand what drives land-use changes at the farm level. Previous research developed and applied a multi-scale drivers framework in the highly flooded zone of the delta. The current study uses that same framework to investigate the land-use history and drivers of change in the salinity intrusion zone of this delta from 1975 to 2016. We interviewed 32 farmers in Tra Vinh Province and used transcript analysis to quantify the influence of the drivers that the farmers mentioned. We then compared the drivers of land-use change with those found earlier in the highly flooded zone. Results show more diversification of land uses and land-use changes in the salinity intrusion zone. Farmers here followed three main pathways: rice intensification, integrated farming of rice and vegetables/aquaculture, or intensive shrimp farming. Land-use changes were conditional on the regional infrastructure construction to preserve freshwater conditions.

Socio-economic context also emerged as an important driver, particularly trends and pressures from the community and markets.	[Thuy Ngan Le; van Halsema, Gerardo E.; Hellegers, Petra J. G.

Understanding how the population perceives the risk associated with air pollution is a crucial aspect to inform future policies and communication strategies. The aim of this study is to examine the association between air pollution concentrations and public risk perception of air pollution, also exploring socio-demographic patterns in the general population of Italy and Sweden. To this end, we derived 3-year PM10 average concentrations from ground monitoring stations and integrated with a population-based survey carried out in August 2021 in both countries. Relative perceived likelihood and impact on the individual were considered as domains of risk perception. In addition this, information on direct experience and socio-demographic factors were included as possible determinants of risk perception. Linear regression models were performed to examine the association of PM10 average concentrations at regional level and individual level factors with risk perception domains. In both countries, respondents who live in the most densely populated regions report a higher perceived likelihood of air pollution. Direct experience is the main driver of risk perception in both countries. Being male and smokers in Italy, older age and having left/centre-left political orientation in both countries are associated with a higher perceived likelihood and impact of air pollution. These findings will inform future health and environmental studies regarding the public risk perception of air pollution highlighting individual's awareness and the sociodemographic patterns.

For these reasons, precise forecasting, and announcement of weather disasters of a convective nature, from local to synoptic scales, is very important. The Novel Thunderstorm Alert System (NOTHAS) has shown outstanding results in forecasting and early warning of different modes of convection, including local hazards in mid-latitudes. In this study, an attempt has been made to apply this tool in the prediction of different atmospheric systems that occur in different climatic regions. The upgraded prognostic and diagnostic algorithm with adjusted complex parameters and criteria representative of tropical storms and tropical cyclones showed good coincidence with the available observations. NOTHAS showed skill and success in assessing the dynamics and intensity of Hurricane Ian, which hit the west coast of Florida on 30 September 2022 and caused great material damage and human losses. This advanced tool also detected the most intense-extreme Level-5 on 1 September 2021, over New York, when catastrophic flooding occurred within the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Likewise, the upgraded model configuration very correctly predicted the trajectory, modifications, and strength of super typhoon Nanmadol over Japan (19 September 2022), 24-48 h in advance, and super typhoon Noru over the Philippines (25 September 2022). The system showed the temporal and spatial accuracy of the location of the heavy rainfall and flash flood. In general, the obtained results for all evaluated cases are encouraging and provide a good basis for further testing, verification, and severe weather warnings and guidance for weather services worldwide.

Temporally-displaced Mississippi River spring flood pulse shows muted aquatic ecosystem response in estuarine waters: A climate change warning for coastal foodwebs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Estuary; Food web; Wetland; Nutrients	SEDIMENTS; QUALITY; DELTA; DIVERSIONS; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; BLOOMS; GROWTH; BASIN	Mississippi River water levels typically rise in the early spring after snow melt in the extensive watershed. However, in 2016, warm air temperatures coupled with high precipitation led to a historically early river flood pulse, resulting in the opening of a flood release valve (Bonnet Carre Spillway) in early January to protect the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The goal of this research was to determine the ecosystem response of this wintertime nutrient flood pulse on the receiving estuarine system and compare it to historical opening responses, which are generally several months later. Nutrients, TSS, and Chl a were measured along a 30 km transect in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary, before, during, and after the river di-version event. In the past, NOx concentrations were quickly reduced to below detection in the estuary in <4 weeks post -event accompanied by a moderate phytoplankton bloom. However, due to seasonal limitations (cold water temperatures and light limitation) during the 2016 event, NOx remained elevated for >2 months post-closure and Chl a values were low, indicating limited assimilation of nutrients into phytoplankton biomass. Consequently, much of the bioavailable nitrogen was denitrified by sediments and dispersed to the coastal ocean over time, limiting the transfer of nutrients into the food web by means of a spring phytoplankton bloom. An increasing warming trend in temperate and polar river watersheds is leading to earlier spring flood pulses, altering the timing of coastal nutrient transport, decoupled from conditions supporting primary production, which could significantly affect coastal food webs.

We test the hypothesis that the depth increase in a navigational channel in an estuarine region results in the amplification of the inland penetration of storm surge, thereby increasing the flood vulnerability of the region. We run numerical experiments using the Delft3D modeling suite (validated with observational data) with different historic channel depth scenarios. Model results show that channel deepening facilitates increased water movement into the lake-estuary system during a storm surge event. The inland peak water level increases by 37% in the presence of the deepest channel. Moreover, the peak volumetric flow rate increases by 291.6% along the navigational channel. Furthermore, the tidal prism and the volume of surge prism passing through the channel inlet increase by 487% and 153.3%, respectively. In our study, the presence of the deepest channel results in extra 56.72 km(2) of flooded area (approximately 12% increase) which is an indication that channel deepening over the years has rendered the region more vulnerable to hurricane-induced flooding. The study also analyzes the impact of channel deepening on storm surge in estuaries under different future sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios. Simulations suggest that even the most conservative scenario of SLR will cause an approximately 51% increase in flooded area in the presence of the deepest ship channel, thereby suggesting that rising sea level will cause increased surge penetration and increased flood risk.

Mitigating floods and attenuating surface runoff with temporary storage areas in headwaters	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						catchment management; flooding; nature-based solutions; runoff; temporary storage areas	SOIL HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; UPLAND LAND MANAGEMENT; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SUBSOIL COMPACTION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS; BELFORD CATCHMENT; MUDDY FLOODS; FRAMEWORK; CONSERVATION	Temporary storage areas (TSAs) represent a category of soft-engineered nature-based solutions that can provide dispersed, small-scale storage throughout a catchment. TSAs store and attenuate surface runoff, providing new additional storage during flood events. The need for such additional catchment storage will become more urgent as the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events increases due to climate change. Implementation of TSAs in headwater catchments is slowly gaining momentum, but practitioners still require further evidence on how such measures function during flood events. This review focuses on the role of relatively small-scale (<10,000 m(3)) TSAs in headwater catchments for flood risk management. It also explores the potential wider benefits for implementing these as part of an integrated catchment management approach. TSA flood mitigation effectiveness is primarily determined by the TSA's available storage prior to the event. At the local scale, this can be represented by the relationship between TSA inputs, outputs and total storage. Factors influencing the local functioning and effectiveness of TSAs are discussed, with potential considerations for optimizing future TSA design and management. Hydrological models have suggested that TSAs could be used to effectively attenuate high magnitude events. However, future considerations should involve addressing the lack of empirical evidence showing TSA catchment scale effectiveness and how local TSA functioning might change in time. Small-scale headwater TSAs offer a holistic and sustainable approach to catchment management that can deliver both local benefits to landowners and wider flood risk mitigation for society.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Sustainable Engineering of WaterScience of Water > Water ExtremesScience of Water > Hydrological Processes	[Roberts, Martyn T.; Wilkinson, Mark E.] James Hutton Inst, Environm & Biochem Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Roberts, Martyn T.; Geris, Josie] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Hallett, Paul D.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland	James Hutton Institute; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen	Roberts, MT (corresponding author), James Hutton Inst, Environm & Biochem Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland.	martyn.roberts@hutton.ac.uk	; Hallett, Paul/C-9233-2011	Geris, Josie/0000-0003-0159-0543; Roberts, Martyn/0000-0002-6011-956X; Hallett, Paul/0000-0001-7542-7832	Scottish Government's Hydro Nation Scholars Programme; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Sciences Analytical Services Division [2018-W-LS-20]; Environmental Protection Agency Ireland (EPA) [2018-W-LS-20] Funding Source: Environmental Protection Agency Ireland (EPA)	Scottish Government's Hydro Nation Scholars Programme; Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Sciences Analytical Services Division; Environmental Protection Agency Ireland (EPA)(Environmental Protection Agency Ireland (EPA))	Thanks to the Scottish Government's Hydro Nation Scholars Programme for funding MR to do this research.

An urban drought categorization framework and the vulnerability of a lowland city to groundwater urban droughts	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Review						Drought; Vulnerability; Urban areas; Groundwater drought; Damage sensitivity; Exposure	BUILDING DAMAGES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; FLOOD; PROPAGATION; METHODOLOGY; COMMUNITIES; HAZARD	Due to climate change, droughts will intensify in large parts of the world. Drought and its impacts on nature and agriculture have been studied thoroughly, but its effects on the urban environment is rather unexplored. But also the built environment is susceptible to droughts and estimation of its vulnerability is the first step to its protection. This article is focusing on assessing the vulnerability of a city to groundwater drought, using parts of the lowland city of Leiden, the Netherlands, as a case study. Using a new urban drought categorization framework, groundwater drought is separated from soil moisture drought, open water drought and water supply drought, as each has its own impacts. Vulnerability was estimated as the aggregation of drought exposure and damage sensitivity. Drought deficit and duration were used as exposure indicators. Both a Fixed and Variable threshold method was used to quantify these indicators. To quantify drought vulnerability weights were assessed for selected exposure and damage sensitivity indicators using an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with a small number of experts. Based on these weights the spatial variation in vulnerability for groundwater drought follows damage sensitivity patterns-rather than exposure ones. And, out of all damage sensitivity indicators used, 'land use', 'low income' and 'monuments' contributed the most to the spatial variation in vulnerability. Due to the fact that the number of drought experts' opinions in the AHP was limited these vulnerability results however remain uncertain. The proposed methodology however allows water managers to determine vulnerability of urbanized areas to groundwater drought, identify highly vulnerable areas and focus their mitigating actions.

Survey on the Application of Artificial Intelligence in ENSO Forecasting	MATHEMATICS			English	Review						climate disasters; ENSO forecasting; artificial intelligence; machine learning; deep learning	NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; EL-NINO; PREDICTION; MODEL; EVENTS; NETWORKS; CLIMATE; IMPACT	Climate disasters such as floods and droughts often bring heavy losses to human life, national economy, and public safety. El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important inter-annual climate signals in the tropics and has a global impact on atmospheric circulation and precipitation. To address the impact of climate change, accurate ENSO forecasts can help prevent related climate disasters. Traditional prediction methods mainly include statistical methods and dynamic methods. However, due to the variability and diversity of the temporal and spatial evolution of ENSO, traditional methods still have great uncertainty in predicting ENSO. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has gradually penetrated into all aspects of people's lives, and the climate field has also benefited. For example, deep learning methods in artificial intelligence can automatically learn and train from a large amount of sample data, obtain excellent feature representation, and effectively improve the performance of various learning tasks. It is widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and other fields. In 2019, Ham et al. used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in ENSO forecasting 18 months in advance, and the winter ENSO forecasting skill could reach 0.64, far exceeding the dynamic model with a forecasting skill of 0.5. The research results were regarded as the pioneering work of deep learning in the field of weather forecasting. This paper introduces the traditional ENSO forecasting methods and focuses on summarizing the various latest artificial intelligence methods and their forecasting effects for ENSO forecasting, so as to provide useful reference for future research by researchers.

Here, we evaluate how well 37 individual CMIP6 GCMs simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of 12 climate extremes over Australia by comparing the GCMs against gridded observations (Australian Gridded Climate Dataset). This evaluation is crucial for informing, interpreting, and constructing multimodel ensemble future projections of climate extremes over Australia, climate-resilience planning, and GCM selection while conducting exercises like dynamical downscaling via GCMs. We find that temperature extremes (maximum-maximum temperature -TXx, number of summer days -SU, and number of days when maximum temperature is greater than 35 degrees C -Txge35) are reasonably well-simulated in comparison to precipitation extremes. However, GCMs tend to overestimate (underestimate) minimum (maximum) temperature extremes. GCMs also typically struggle to capture both extremely dry (consecutive dry days -CDD) and wet (99th percentile of precipitation -R99p) precipitation extremes, thus highlighting the underlying uncertainty of GCMs in capturing regional drought and flood conditions. Typically for both precipitation and temperature extremes, UKESM1-0-LL, FGOALS-g3, and GCMs from Met office Hadley Centre (HadGEM3-GC31-MM and HadGEM3-GC31-LL) and NOAA (GFDL-ESM4 and GFDL-CM4) consistently tend to show good performance. Our results also show that GCMs from the same modelling group and GCMs sharing key modelling components tend to have similar biases and thus are not highly independent.

Understanding the potential change of compound floods is valuable for flood risk reduction. In this study, an integrated approach coupling the hydrological model and copula-based design of precipitation and storm tides was proposed to assess the compound flood risk in a coastal city-Haikou, China. The copula model, most-likely weight function, and varying parameter distribution were used to obtain the combined design values of precipitation and storm tides under the nonstationary scenario, which were applied to the boundary conditions of the 1D-2D hydrological model. Subsequently, the change of the bivariate return periods, design values, and compound flood risks of precipitation and storm tides were investigated. The results show that the bivariate return period of precipitation and storm tides was reduced by an average of 34% under the nonstationary scenario. The maximum inundation areas and volumes were increased by an average of 31.1% and 45.9% respectively in comparison with the stationary scenario. Furthermore, we identified that the compound effects of precipitation and storm tides would have a greater influence on the flood risk when the bivariate return period is more than 50 years, and the peak time lag had a significant influence on the compound flood risk. The proposed framework is effective in the evaluation and prediction of flood risk in coastal cities, and the results provide some guidance for urban disaster prevention and mitigation.

Therefore, interventions similar to NBS were used for a long time before this term was first introduced. Such pre-existing actions, to be considered as NBS, must meet the Global Standards formulated by the Union for Conservation of Nature Global Standards. One of these standards refers to the challenge-orientation of NBS. The aim of this study was to propose objective criteria that enable the assessment of the challenge-orientation of such interventions. To this end, a set of criteria referring to the seven societal challenges was presented. A Lublin city (Poland) case study was applied in relation to 24 types of interventions. The results showed that all of the analysed pre-existing actions met at least two of the challenges. The actions with the greatest challenge-orientation potential continuity for ecological networks are: protecting surface wetlands, public parks, allotment gardens, restoring waterbodies and maintaining floodplains, and the lowest potential are: creating nesting boxes for bats and insect hotels, installing apiaries and below-ground rainwater collection systems. The analysed interventions responded, to a greater extent, to challenges such as to human health, climate change adaptation and mitigation and ecosystem degradation/biodiversity loss, and, to the least extent, to food security and socioeconomic development Moreover, the study revealed that the scale of the pre-existing intervention type is too general to draw conclusions regarding its challenge-orientation: each piece of the intervention should be assessed separately in relation to the conditions in the local context.

Large-scale risk assessments generate invaluable inputs for prioritizing regions for the distribution of limited resources. High-resolution flood maps and accurate parcel information are critical for flood risk analysis to generate reliable outcomes for planning, preparedness, and decision-making applications. Large-scale damage assessment studies in the United States often utilize the National Structure Inventory (NSI) or HAZUS default dataset, which results in inaccurate risk estimates due to the low geospatial accuracy of these datasets. On the other hand, some studies utilize higher resolution datasets, however they are limited to focus on small scales, for example, a city or a Hydrological United Code (HUC)-12 watershed. In this study, we collected extensive detailed flood maps and parcel datasets for many communities in Iowa to carry out a large-scale flood risk assessment. High-resolution flood maps and the most recent parcel information are collected to ensure the accuracy of risk products. The results indicate that the Eastern Iowa communities are prone to a higher risk of direct flood losses. Our model estimates nearly $10 million in average annualized losses, particularly in large communities in the study region. The study highlights that existing risk products based on FEMA's flood risk output underestimate the flood loss, specifically in highly populated urban communities such as Bettendorf, Cedar Falls, Davenport, Dubuque, and Waterloo. Additionally, we propose a flood risk score methodology for two spatial scales (e.g., HUC-12 watershed, property) to prioritize regions and properties for mitigation purposes. Lastly, the watershed-scale study results are shared through a web-based platform to inform the decision makers and the public.

Study focus: The duality and complexity of hydrological behavior of karst systems pose challenges in precipitation-streamflow modelling, reliable hydrological models with high temporal resolution are warranted for predicting floods in humid flood-prone karst-dominated basins. This study proposes a grid-based distributed karst Xin'anjiang hydrological model (DK-XAJ), the model structure of each grid was developed using the conceptual Xin'anjiang model. Water exchange among each grid and the spatial heterogeneities of land use types and the karstification in each grid were considered. Information on two new linear reservoirs was added to represent the rapidconduit and slow-matrix underground flow to improve the karst dual-porosities, the range of the underground runoff partitioning parameter was estimated from the observed flood recessions. New hydrological insights: The DK-XAJ model demonstrated good successive hourly streamflow modelling performance with mean values of 0.84, 0.83, 0.28, and 0.88 for NSE, KGE, RRE, and R2, and results during validation of one nested interior grid without recalibration was also good. The results indicate that the DK-XAJ model can help obtain detailed results for successive streamflow processes, the peaks of floods under different magnitudes and the marked increase and recession of the flash floods can be accurately reproduced and depicted. The DK-XAJ model can therefore be considered a new tool for the prediction of sub-daily precipitation-streamflow and flood events in karst-dominated basins.

Recycling deep percolated water in continuously flooding irrigated rice fields to mitigate water scarcity	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Rice; Reusing percolating water; Irrigation; Water and energy productivity	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; DRYING IRRIGATION; USE EFFICIENCY; PADDY FIELDS; YIELD GAP; GROUNDWATER; PRODUCTIVITY; BALANCE; MODEL; REUSE	Rice is critical to maintaining nutritional demand and food security of many Asian and African nations. The high water demanding rice is traditionally cultivated with continuous flooding (CF) irrigation practices where 60-90% of applied water can be lost as deep percolation. Burgeoning pressures from other sectoral water demands often challenge flooding rice culture. Existing water conserving rice irrigation approaches are not widely accepted at farmers' level because of compromising yield and/or high operating cost. This study presents the efficacy of a subsurface interceptor system in recycling percolated water for re-irrigating rice fields. The system comprises a pump and filter PVC pipes buried one meter below an experimental rice plot (A) to intercept, store and recycle percolating water. Rice was cultivated in two other adjacent plots (B and C) without an interceptor arrangement where any lateral seepage was restricted in plot B, as did for plot A. There was no such measure for plot C representing a conventional rice field. It was found that plot A produced the highest yield (6.5 t/ha) using the lowest amount of water (650 mm). This could save similar to 50% of water needed for CF irrigated plot C where percolation was the main pathway of water loss (65%). Additional energy requirement for recycling intercepted water was overshadowed by the energy burden of pumping larger amount of water against higher system head for plot C. This led the recycling system to produce the highest irrigation water productivity (3.19 kg/m(3)) and energy productivity (8.86 kg/kWh).	[Rahman, Mohammed M.; Hasan, Shafee; Ahmed, Md Razu; Adham, A.

However, the detailed analysis of the contribution of urbanization to different quantiles of discharge is still lacking; particularly, less is known in watersheds that have been experiencing such large and rapid urbanization as those in China. Here, we focus on the Wenyu watershed, a fast urbanizing basin located in the Beijing metropolitan area. Using a statistical attribution framework, we examine the hydrological response to the increasing urbanization across a wide range of discharge quantiles, from low to high flows; moreover, we perform analyses at the seasonal scale to capture differences in the physical processes at play during the year. Results indicate that the selected GAMLSS (generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape) models can capture well the variability in streamflow in this highly urbanized basin, with the average Spearman correlation coefficients between observations and the median of the fitted models of 0.84, 0.79, and 0.81 in spring, summer, and winter, respectively. Overall, urbanization played a different role for the different seasons and discharge quantiles. More specifically, we find its strongest impact to be in winter and spring, and for low and median quantiles. The role of precipitation is the strongest in summer, and it increases as we move toward the upper tail of the discharge distribution, especially above the 55th percentile, for which precipitation is selected as the only important predictor. Recycled water, on the other hand, tends to play a more dominant role in winter and spring.

Children in rural areas face the most adversity since they are inadequately prepared, lacking in resources, and oblivious to their potential. Many children continue to turn to their parents or guardians for help in emergencies, however, the behavior, awareness, and preparedness of a child is equally important during an emergency. This paper takes a closer look at the physical, psychological, and educational vulnerabilities, as well as factors that influence the involvement of children in flood disaster-related activities (between 2010 and 2014) in selected disaster-hit rural communities of Pakistan. This study was based on interviews with a total of 100 school children from four selected regions and analysis was performed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate methods. The study results show that school children in Nowshera are more susceptible to disasters than the other districts, particularly due to their psychological, physical, and educational well-being. Nowshera has the highest percentage of children who are vulnerable to all three types of vulnerability. Damage to homes and emotional distress are significant predictors of psychological vulnerability, while proximity to disaster-prone areas, poor diet, and parental loss are important contributors to physical vulnerability. Children displacement, delayed enrolment, multiple relocations, and family instability are the main factors determining educational vulnerability. Our findings suggest that in addition to having improved building infrastructure, schools must engage in disaster management efforts to educate school children about the risks of disasters.

The isotopic compositions of twenty shallow freshwater lakes across the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze floodplain (MLY) were investigated in January and May of 2018. The lake-specific input water (delta(I)) and evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios were estimated to explore the specific lake hydrology across the MLY. Results showed that distinct isotopic enrichment trends in May compared with those in January, which was indicative of stronger evaporation in May. The delta O-18(I) values of specific lakes exhibited large variability across the MLY, which may be related to the watershed properties, such as watershed area and elevation, and rainfall. The estimated E/I ratios of lakes across the MLY were below 1, which suggested that these lakes (code 1-15) are flood-dominated in the middle reaches of Yangtze River where lakes are susceptible to Three Gorges Dams regulations. By contrast, the relatively lower variability of lake E/I ratios were observed from the Yangtze River Delta (code 17-20) because these lakes with developed river network systems are highly exchanged by artificial regulation. Our investigation of lake types and corresponding isotopic evolution patterns are likely typical of other floodplain landscapes and their identification could be used to better predict hydrological responses to ongoing climate change and artificial regulations by dams.

Projected climate change impacts will aggravate water availability, as well as flood risks, especially in urban areas. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been identified as key concepts to defuse the expected tensions within the Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) nexus due to their multiple benefits. In this paper, the authors outlined the theories and concepts, analyzed real-life case studies, and discussed the potential of NBS to address the future W-E-F nexus. For this purpose, we performed a systematic literature review on the theories of NBS that address the W-E-F nexus, and we summarized 19 representative real-life case studies to identify the current knowledge gaps and challenges. The quantitative and qualitative data was used to differentiate and discuss the direct and indirect potential benefits of NBS to the W-E-F nexus. The study further expanded on the challenges for the implementation of NBS and highlighted the growing possibilities in the context of circularity and the implementation of NBS in urban planning. It was concluded that the potential impacts of NBS on the WE-F nexus have been identified, but the quantitative effects have not been analyzed in-depth. Moreover, indicators are mostly single-purpose and not multipurpose, as required to fully characterize the W-E-F nexus and circularity holistically. Overall, there is a need to adopt systemic thinking and promote the multipurpose design of NBS.

In this study, we analyzed the sedimentary characteristics of the coastal storm and FF deposits at the Hoa Duan barrier, Thua Thien Hue, central Vietnam. Analyses of the sedimentary structures and properties (grain size distribution, composition, roundness, and sphericity) and loss on ignition revealed that the storm sediments were comprised of coarser grains with a low organic and carbonated content, and with sedimentary structures, including parallel and inclined landward lamination, multiple sets of normal and reverse grading, mud rip-up clasts, and sharp and erosional contacts (both top and bottom) with finer-grain layers. Conversely, the FF sediments had only fine to very fine grains, with dominant high organic and carbonate contents, and only exhibited sedimentary structures of sharp erosional top and bottom contacts with coarser-grained layers. The clearest differentiation to distinguish coastal storm layers from inland FF layers was obtained by plotting the mean grain size against the sorting. The results of optically stimulated luminescence dating suggested that two storm layers and one FF layer were deposited during the last 130 +/- 10 years. Moreover, two layers were deposited by storms and one by a FF prior to that (>130 +/- 10 years). The identification of the sedimentary diagnostic key of these two hazards can help to improve the understanding of the geomorphological evolution of the studied site and the other parts of this coastal region in order to remind the coastal community to prepare for future coastal hazards well.

Evaluating urban flood risk using hybrid method of TOPSIS and machine learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urban flooding; Hazard; Vulnerability; TOPSIS; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; RANDOM-FOREST; SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS; SPATIAL PREDICTION; GIS TECHNIQUES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODELS; VULNERABILITY	With the growth of cities, urban flooding has increasingly become an issue for regional and national governments. The destructive effects of floods are magnified in cities. Accurate models of urban flood susceptibility are required to mitigate this hazard mitigation and build resilience in cities. In this paper, we evaluate flood riskin Jiroft city, Iran, using a combination of machine learning and decision-making methods. Flood hazard maps were created using three state-of-the-art machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and boosted regression tree). The metadata supporting our analysis comprises 218 flood inundation points and a variety of derived factors: slope aspect, elevation, slope angle, rainfall, distance to streets, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, distance to urban drainages, urban drainage density, and curve number. We then employed the TOPSIS decision-making tool for urban flood vulnerability analysis, which is based on socio-economic factors such as building density, population density, building history, and socio-economic conditions. Finally, we derived an urban flood risk map for Jiroft based on flood hazard and vulnerability maps. Of the three models tested, the random forest model yielded the most accurate map. The results indicate that urban drainage density and distance to urban drainages are the most important factors in urban flood hazard modeling. As might be expected, areas with a high or very high population density are most vulnerable to flooding. These results show that flood risk mapping provide insights for priority planning in flood risk management, especially in areas with limited hydrological data.

The Penman-Monteith FAO56 (ETpmf) method has been recommended as the identical ET0 estimation model; nonetheless, it belongs to a vast climatic data requirement. There is an urgent need to discover an ideal alternate model for evaluating ET0 in particular places where all climatic data is insufficient. The performances of 15 empirical models were assessed to get the best alternative model by comparing it with the PMF-56 model. These 15 models were evaluated by employing a daily scatter plot and three well known numerical approaches: relative root-mean-square error, mean absolute error and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient in this study. Furthermore, a linear regression model was implemented to calibrate and validate the empirical models' performances throughout the 1981-2005 and 2006-2018 time intervals, separately. The outcomes displayed that the ETpmf rose primarily and declined later on a monthly period with the topmost amount in April and the lowermost amount in January. Overall, the Abtew model was the best alternate method showing the highest determination coefficient values more than 0.85 from January to December. In contrast, the Penman, WMO, Trabert, Valiantzas1, Valiantzas2, Valiantzas3 and Jensen-Haise models presented moderate performances with fewer inaccuracies. Afterwards, modification, the version of the above-described models every month has been upgraded deliberately related to actual. The Abtew model had simplicity in the computation process, only used maximum temperature and solar radiation data and linearly well connected to the PMF-56 model.	[Islam, Shakibul; Alam, A. K. M.

Uncertainty quantification and partition for multivariate risk inferences through a factorial multimodel Bayesian copula (FMBC) system	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological risk; Multivariate analysis; Uncertainty partition; Factorial analysis	RETURN PERIOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEI RIVER; DESIGN; SIMULATION; SCENARIOS; HYDROLOGY	In this study, a factorial multimodel Bayesian copula (FMBC) method is proposed to investigate various uncertainties in the copula-based multivariate risk models and further track the major contributors to the imprecise predictions for different risk indices. In FMBC, the copula models with different marginals and dependence structures will be firstly established with the parameter uncertainties being quantified by the adaptive Metropolis algorithm. A multilevel factorial analysis approach is then adopted to characterize the individual and interactive effects of marginals, copula functions and the associated parameter uncertainties on different risk indices. Moreover, a copula-based dependent sampling algorithm is proposed in the factorial analysis process to generate parameter samples under consideration of their correlation. The applicability of the FMBC approach is demonstrated through the multivariate flood risk analysis at two gauging stations in Wei River basin. The results indicate that extensive fluctuation exists in the inferences of multivariate return periods resulting from different marginal and dependence structures as well as the associated parameter uncertainties. For risk indices of the failure probabilities in AND and Kendall, their predictive variability can be mainly attributed to the uncertainties in model parameters and copula structure, with their total contribution more than 75%. In comparison, the failure probability in OR would be mainly influenced by the parameter uncertainty and also marginal structures, with their total contribution more than 80%. The copula structure would not have a visible effect on the failure probability in OR, with its contribution less than 5% for most scenarios. The obtained results can provide scientific support for reliable hydrological risk inferences within a multivariate context.

This study examines sediment availability, deposition rates, and elevation change in two types of tidally-dependent riparian wetlands to understand their ability to persist in the wake of rising sea level. Tidal marshes and riparian swamp habitats in blackwater and brownwater river systems were studied over a 32-month period between 2004 to 2007. Wetlands along the brownwater river system exhibited significantly greater and more variable deposition rates than those located along the blackwater river system (p < 0.05). The brownwater marsh lost -1.7 cm of elevation and the blackwater marsh lost -1.1 cm of elevation, while the brownwater swamp site had an increase of 7.0 cm and the blackwater swamp site exhibited an increase in elevation of 0.7 cm. Within the Cape Fear River Estuary, a combination of sediment availability, organic content, and wetland type (tidal brackish marshes, riparian freshwater swamp forests) are what most strongly influenced patterns of deposition but are strongly temporally and spatially influenced. Marshes in the Cape Fear River are losing elevation, while riparian swamps are, at the time of this study, maintaining their current elevation. Coastal tidal wetlands are under increasing pressure from climate change, sea-level rise, and urban development resulting in vertical drowning. Tidal marshes in the Cape Fear River are not able to maintain elevation, and riparian swamp forests may also be unable to as the magnitude of these pressures increase.

Among the most comprehensively debated research questions is the question of C-4 grassland expansion and its effects on community structure and dynamics. Here, we present compiled datasets of carbon isotopes from fossil tooth enamel and paleosol to evaluate how C-4 grasslands expanded and its apparent causes. The C-4 expansion has been argued to be around ca 8-7 Ma in the Siwalik sub-Group of Pakistan, but the later stages of C-3/C-4 proportion shifts on the Siwalik floodplains are less understood. We found that although C-4 expansion occurred during the late Miocene, C-3 vegetation never entirely disappeared but was persisted in pockets on floodplain up to the present, as indicated by the C-3 diet consumed by some herbivores. The expansion was further modulated by the microclimate in different regions. The same scenario can be seen in East Africa, South America and low-latitude North America where C-4 grasslands expanded rapidly in late Miocene most likely owing to decrease in global pCO(2). By contrast, C-4 plants did not expand in high-latitude North America and Palearctic regions during the past ca 17 Ma. Thus, we assume that C-4 plants expanded at low latitudes during the late Miocene owing to one major global factor (decreased pCO(2)) and perhaps other local microclimatic factors like paleofires.

Drought-tolerant coffee plants display increased tolerance to waterlogging and post-waterlogging reoxygenation	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Chlorophyll fluorescence; Hypoxia; Leaf gas exchange; Leaf damage; Photosynthesis; Plant mortality	INDUCED STOMATAL CLOSURE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; DIFFUSION CONDUCTANCE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; FLOODING STRESS; GAS-EXCHANGE; XYLEM SAP; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SEEDLINGS; CO2	Soil waterlogging negatively impacts plants due to reduced oxygen availability in the rhizosphere. Here we selected two Coffea canephora clones with contrasting tolerance to drought and oxidative stress to test whether they would also exhibit contrasting tolerance to waterlogging and post-waterlogging reoxygenation. Plants were exposed to six days of waterlogging followed by 40 days of reoxygenation. During waterlogging, both clones exhibited lower leaf gas exchange rate, electron transport rate and photochemical quenching as well as increased non-photochemical quenching; overall, these changes were stronger in the drought tolerant (DT) clones over the drought sentitive (DS) ones. Photosynthetic limitations were essentially linked to diffusional constraints regardless of clone. In both clones, declines in stomatal conductance were not associated with foliar ABA or ethylene levels, however stomatal conductance correlated with the plant hydraulic conductance. After reoxygenation, DT plants mostly recovered leaf function and plant mortality was less than 10%. Conversely, DS plants displayed very low water potentials after reoxygenation, which was accompanied by photosynthetic and membrane damage and 40% plant mortality. Our findings confirmed that the DT clone is less impaired by soil waterlogging and reoxygenation than the DS one. The differences between clones were more evident during the reoxygenation than during waterlogging, likely due to the drought experienced by the DS but not DT plants. Collectively, this information leads us to a common path to find new coffee genotypes with increased tolerance to both drought and waterlogging aiming at increased coffee sustainability under an ongoing climate changing scenario.

We analyzed survey data collected from 148 farmers using a binary logit model and descriptive statistics in order to identify the potential threats to agricultural production, and the coping strategies used by farmers in marshlands. Results showed that 65% of respondents were female, and 76% of all farmers claimed perceiving threats to agricultural production in marshes. The perceived potential threats to agriculture included floods, pest infestation (millipede, fall armyworm), crop theft, and unsecure land-holding status as well as the decrease in soil fertility. Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also led to the increase in prices of agricultural inputs (pesticides, seeds), and manure that has become increasingly rare and expensive due to the drastic reduction in livestock in that region weakened by several years of civil war and insecurity. In response, farmers were combining several adaptation strategies and these included drainage, mulching, manure application, and crop diversification used by farmers for, respectively, managing floods, maintaining soil fertility, and reducing crop failure. To cope with land scarcity, both female (75%) and male farmers (60%) claimed seeking for lands in highlands and renting extra plots in the same marshes or elsewhere. Despite the strategies implemented, there is still a need to strengthen farmers' knowledge of flood and pesticide management and promote the integrated pest management practices for a sustainable use of marshlands.

Deep Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Data for Real-Time Stormwater System Control and Flood Mitigation	WATER			English	Article						real-time control; reinforcement learning; smart stormwater systems; urban flooding	WATER-QUALITY; LEVEL; URBANIZATION; FORECASTS; WEATHER; STREAM; IMPACT; COAST	Flooding in many areas is becoming more prevalent due to factors such as urbanization and climate change, requiring modernization of stormwater infrastructure. Retrofitting standard passive systems with controllable valves/pumps is promising, but requires real-time control (RTC). One method of automating RTC is reinforcement learning (RL), a general technique for sequential optimization and control in uncertain environments. The notion is that an RL algorithm can use inputs of real-time flood data and rainfall forecasts to learn a policy for controlling the stormwater infrastructure to minimize measures of flooding. In real-world conditions, rainfall forecasts and other state information are subject to noise and uncertainty. To account for these characteristics of the problem data, we implemented Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), an RL algorithm that is distinguished by its capability to handle noise in the input data. DDPG implementations were trained and tested against a passive flood control policy. Three primary cases were studied: (i) perfect data, (ii) imperfect rainfall forecasts, and (iii) imperfect water level and forecast data. Rainfall episodes (100) that caused flooding in the passive system were selected from 10 years of observations in Norfolk, Virginia, USA; 85 randomly selected episodes were used for training and the remaining 15 unseen episodes served as test cases. Compared to the passive system, all RL implementations reduced flooding volume by 70.5% on average, and performed within a range of 5%. This suggests that DDPG is robust to noisy input data, which is essential knowledge to advance the real-world applicability of RL for stormwater RTC.

Lognormal, power-law, exponential, and truncated normal distributions have all been proposed for their frequency distributions. Although these frequency distributions have been obtained from many field observations and estimated from statistical models, problems associated with the complexity of sedimentary processes have remained. In this study, bed-thickness frequency distributions and the recurrence intervals of sediment-gravity-flow deposits intercalated in the Pleistocene lacustrine varved diatomite in southwest Japan were analyzed. The results reveal that the bed thicknesses of sediment-gravity-flow deposits induced by different mechanisms show different types of frequency distribution. For example, flood-induced sediment-gravity-flow deposits show power-law-like distributions, whereas such deposits caused by lake-slope-failure show lognormal distributions. The suggestion is that flood-induced types are deposited from floods having a power-law scale. However, the bed thicknesses of the deposits induced by lake-slope-failure do not purely reflect the event scale, because the lateral variation of their thicknesses reflects the depositional processes. The recurrence intervals of both types of event show Poisson-like distributions except for lake-slope-failure deposits at the slope-base section. Despite observed ranges, the distributions of lake-slope-failure deposits at the slope-base section have a high amount of zero value and the recurrence interval show exponentially decreasing. These results suggest that both events were generated randomly, despite different origins. In addition, the incompleteness of the records was also suggested from sediment bypass of a lake-slope-failure event at the slope-base section.

It gradually leads to impairment of ecologic as well as geomorphologic settings of a riverine ecosystem. Keeping this in view, the present study was designed to assess the contemporary evolution of the Indus River Estuary (IRE) under forced hydrological conditions. An account of transitions in the eco-geomorphologic response of the IRE was synthesized using satellite imageries from 1972 to 2016 and interpreted with the ground observations. Due to flow regulations, an 80% decrease in average annual flow and 50% dampening of flood peaks have altered its hydrological regime. These pronounced hydrological shifts have also played a significant role in the modulation of channel morphology. Similarly, the morphological configuration of the estuary like the length and width of the channel have also increased by 11% and 29%, respectively, and the rate of erosion was more than the deposition. After experiencing significant variations in the rate of lateral migration, the channel has started creeping in a south-eastern direction dominantly since 1993, with an average rate of migration of 44 m/yr. Correspondingly, the riparian landscape has also evolved coherently with a notable competition between bare land and the vegetative cover. Trade-offs between the river hydrology, channel morphology and landscape ecology were understood with a correlation matrix and interpreted with plausible causes. It would help the policymakers to assess the overall ecological health of the IRE and contribute the experts working on designing a framework for the study of system dynamics.

Building on recent statistically-based attribution studies, we project seasonal changes in the frequency of flood events at 286 U.S. Geological Survey gauging stations across the U.S. Midwest using projections of precipitation, antecedent wetness conditions and temperature as drivers. The projections of the covariates are obtained from two datasets obtained by down-scaling global circulation models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We focus on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 and on four different flood thresholds (i.e., from more common to less frequent flood events). We find that the frequency of flood events during the 21st century increases during spring at most of the analyzed gauging stations, with larger changes in the Northern Great Plains and regardless of the flood threshold value. Our findings also point to a projected increasing number of flood events during the winter, especially in the stations in the southern and western part of the domain (Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Michigan). A marked change in the frequency of flood events is not projected for the summer and fall.

These extremes have implications for the risk of flooding in sub-regional river basins during both colder and warmer climate states. Here, we present the first homogeneous millennium-long (800-2018 CE) time-series of diluvial storms for the Po River Basin, northern Italy, which is also the longest such time-series of monthly data for the entire Europe. The monthly reconstruction of damaging hydrological events derives from several types of historical documentary sources and reveals 387 such events, allowing the construction of storm severity indices by transforming the information into a monthly, quantitative, record. A period of reduced diluvial storms occurred in the ninth and tenth centuries, followed by a stormier period culminating in the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. More complex patterns emerge in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, with generally wetter and stormier conditions than during other centuries. From the seventeenth century onwards the number of damaging hydrological events decreases, with a return in recent decades to conditions similar to those prior to the thirteenth century The flood frequency tended to increase for all seasons during periods of low solar irradiance, suggesting the presence of solar-induced circulation changes resembling the negative phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability as a controlling atmospheric mechanism.

Study Focus: The study modelled the changes in water yield using regional, sub-regional and local climate conditions from modelling outputs at spatial resolutions of 44 km, 12 km and 0.002 km respectively to drive the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model at three time periods of land use land cover (LULC). Changes in historical water yield (simulated for 1986, 2002 & 2018 LULC using the mean climatic parameters from 1981-2010) and future scenario (simulated for 2018 LULC using the mean climatic parameters from 2020-2049) for annual, seasonal and monthly periods were assessed. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The results show that future annual water yield could change by -46%, -48%, +44% and -35% under the regional, sub-regional, local and ensemble mean of the climate scenarios respectively. Seasonal water yield from the ensemble mean of the future climate scenario was projected to decrease between 2-16 mm, with a mean decrease of 33.39% during the December-February season. There was no directional effect of spatial resolution on water yield. The future period could be impacted by both drought and flood. We recommend that re/afforestation should be encouraged to improve infiltration and reduce deforestation which was 2.27% per annum in the assessed period to prevent flood causing runoffs, while irrigation technology will help to improve resilience to drought.

This study focuses on GLOF hazard assessment in the Bhote Koshi Basin (BKB), where was highly developed glacial lakes and was intensely affected by the Gorkha earthquake. A new 2016 glacial lake inventory was established, and six unreported GLOF events were identified with geomorphic outburst evidence from GaoFen-1 satellite images and Google Earth. A new method was proposed to assess GLOF hazard, in which large numbers of landslides triggered by earthquake were considered to enter into outburst floods enlarge the discharge and volume of debris flow in the downstream. Four GLOF hazard classes were derived according to glacial lake outburst potential and a flow magnitude assessment matrix, in which 11 glacial lakes were identified to have very high hazard and 24 to have high hazard. The GLOF hazard in BKB increased after the earthquake due to landslide deposits, which increased by 216.03 x 10(6) m(3), and provides abundant deposits for outburst floods to evolve into debris flows. We suggest that in regional GLOF hazard assessment, small glacial lakes should not be overlooked for landslide deposit entrainment along a flood route that would increase the peak discharge, especially in earthquake-affected areas where large numbers of landslides were triggered.

Transient hyporheic zones occur in the riparian zone (bank storage or "lung model" exchange) during channel stage fluctuations. Recent studies show that soil pipes are widespread in stream banks and beneath floodplains, creating highly preferential flow between channel and riparian groundwater such that the traditional Darcy model of flow does not apply. We used MODFLOW with the conduit flow package to model a series of stream bank soil pipes and examined soil pipe density (number per m), length, diameter, height above baseflow water surface, connectivity, and matrix hydraulic conductivity on transient particle flow paths and total hyporheic exchange volume (i.e., bank storage) over the course of a peak flow (e.g., storm) event. We found that adding five soil pipes per meter more than doubled hyporheic volume. Soil pipe length was the most important control; adding one 1.5-m-long soil pipe caused a 73.4% increase in hyporheic volume. The effect of increasing soil pipe diameter on hyporheic volume leveled off at similar to 1 cm, as flow limitation switched from pipe flow to pipe-matrix exchange. To validate our approach, we used the model to successfully reproduce trends from field studies. Our results highlight the need to consider soil pipes when modeling, monitoring, or managing bank storage, floodplain connectivity, or hyporheic exchange.

In this research, coefficients of variation and concentration degree (i.e., C-v and C-d) and double mass curve (DDC) were adopted to examine the changes in water and sediment discharge and their relationships with precipitation. The contribution rates of climatic and anthropogenic factors to water and sediment discharge were assessed through comparisons between the measured and predicted values in the baseline and postbaseline periods in the basin. The main results were: (a) the water and sediment discharges of the basin showed a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2014, with peak points of C-v and C-d of sediment discharge of the basin in 2009 and 2010, respectively; (b) the precipitation had a major influence on water discharge variations, and the peak point of the DDC of the cumulative precipitation and sediment discharge was consistent with the cumulative water and sediment discharge; and (c) under annual and flooding season scales, the contribution rates of anthropogenic factors to water discharge were 63.060% and 70.457%, respectively. The contribution rates of anthropogenic factors on sediment discharge were 84.790% and 85.541%, respectively. The impacts of anthropogenic factors on water and sediment discharge were more significant than the impacts of precipitation, in which the construction and operation of cascade hydropower stations (CHS) were believed to play a crucial role.

J	Lemée, C				Lemee, Colin			Application of Item Response Theory to the Assessment of Coping in an Environmental Risk Situation: Perspectives and Limits	PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						Item response theory; maximum likelihood estimate; coping willingness; environmental coping; risk perception	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SAMPLE-SIZE; STRATEGIES; SCALE; RESILIENCE; VALIDATION; PERCEPTION; VALIDITY; LESSONS; FRANCE	Classical test theory does not have a clear superiority over the item response theory (IRT) framework, as these approaches are meant to address different kinds of objectives. However, the use of the IRT framework makes it possible to take into account two different parameters in the assessment of coping willingness: the extent to which individuals declare that they use the different strategies and the level of difficulty of these strategies. Also, the IRT framework is strong enough to cope with inconsistent behaviors or missing data and can take into account the social, legal, and cultural influences on the ability to cope of respondents. The data set used in this study was obtained from different areas at risk from coastal flooding located in France. The sample was composed of 315 adult participants (mean age = 47; standard deviation = 15). In the present case, it appeared that just 10 items from an initial pool of 23 were sufficient to assess active and passive coping willingness because these had a good discriminatory power. Also, it appeared that the estimation of participants' level of coping willingness was linked to their risk perception and anxiety toward the risk. This result has several implications. Firstly, if the IRT calibration is well performed, IRT can be used to compare scores across assessments with different properties and difficulties/locations. Also, the maximum likelihood estimate of participants' level of active and passive coping willingness using an IRT model makes it possible to study the links between coping willingness and other factors of interest.

Seasonal and Annual Rainfall Variability and Their Impact on Rural Water Supply Services in the Wami River Basin, Tanzania	WATER			English	Article						Wami River Basin; rural water supply; water points; water point mapping; time-series data	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION PATHWAYS; FUTURE CHANGES; TREND ANALYSIS; VULNERABILITY; SYSTEMS; TERM; SUSTAINABILITY; AVAILABILITY	In some parts of Africa, rainfall variability has resulted in widespread droughts and floods, thus posing a substantial challenge to water availability in rural areas, especially drinking water. Therefore, due to increasing water demands, increases in the population, and economic development, water supply systems are under constant stress. One of the critical uncertainties surrounding the effects of rainfall variability in Africa is the significant impact that it imposes on rural water supply services. The present study analyzes the trends in annual and seasonal rainfall time series in the Wami River Basin to see if there have been any significant changes in the patterns during the period 1983-2017 and how they affect the access to water supply services in rural areas. The study analyzes the trends of rainfall series of three stations using simple regression, Mann-Kendal Test and Sen's Slope Estimator. The water point mapping datasets were analyzed considering seasonal variation. The analysis showed a statistically significant positive trend in annual rainfall at Kongwa and March-April-May (MAM) seasonal rainfall at Dakawa. The maximum increase in annual rainfall occurred at Kongwa (5.3 mm year(-1)) and for MAM seasonal data at Dakawa (4.1 mm year(-1)). Water points were found to be significantly affected by seasonal changes, both in terms of availability and quality of water. There also exists a strong relationship between rural water services and seasons.

We examine whether this goal alone is sufficient for managing China's wetlands, for they constitute 10% of the world's total. Analyzing wetland changes between 2000 and 2015 using 30-m-resolution satellite images, we show that China's wetlands expanded by 27,614 km(2) but lost 26,066 km(2)-a net increase of 1,548 km(2) (or 0.4%). This net change hides considerable complexities in the types of wetlands created and destroyed. The area of open water surface increased by 9,110 km(2), but natural wetlands- henceforth "marshes"-decreased by 7,562 km(2). Of the expanded wetlands, restoration policies contributed 24.5% and dam construction contributed 20.8%. Climate change accounted for 23.6% but is likely to involve a transient increase due to melting glaciers. Of the lost wetlands, agricultural and urban expansion contributed 47.7% and 13.8%, respectively. The increase in wetlands from conservation efforts (6,765 km(2)) did not offset human-caused wetland losses (16,032 km(2)). The wetland changes may harm wildlife. The wetland loss in east China threatens bird migration across eastern Asia [2]. Open water from dam construction flooded the original habitats of threatened terrestrial species and affected aquatic species by fragmenting wetland habitats [3]. Thus, the "no net loss" target measures total changes without considering changes in composition and the corresponding ecological functions. It may result in "paper offsets" and should be used carefully as a target for wetland conservation.

Falling Trend of Western Disturbances in Future Climate Simulations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Asia; Baroclinic flows; Synoptic-scale processes; Climate change; Climate models	KUSH-KARAKORAM-HIMALAYA; INDIAN WINTER MONSOON; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; CMIP5; SEASONALITY; RAINFALL; MODELS; BASIN	Western disturbances (WDs) are synoptic-scale cyclonic weather systems advected over Pakistan and northern India by the subtropical westerly jet stream. There, they are responsible for most of the winter precipitation, which is crucial for agriculture of the rabi crop as well for as more extreme precipitation events, which can lead to local flooding and avalanches. Despite their importance, there has not yet been an attempt to objectively determine the fate of WDs in future climate GCMs. Here, a tracking algorithm is used to build up a catalog of WDs in both CMIP5 historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP) experiments of the future. It is shown that in business-as-usual (RCP8.5) future climate simulations, WD frequency falls by around 15% by the end of the twenty-first century, with the largest relative changes coming in pre- and postmonsoon months. Meanwhile, mean WD intensity will decrease, with central vorticity expected to become less cyclonic by about 12% over the same period. Changes in WD frequency are attributed to the projected widening and weakening of the winter subtropical jet as well as decreasing meridional wind shear and midtropospheric baroclinic vorticity tendency, which also explain the changes in intensity. The impact of these changes on regional precipitation is explored. The decline in WD frequency and intensity will cause a decrease in mean winter rainfall over Pakistan and northern India amounting to about 15% of the mean-subject to the ability of the models to represent the responsible processes. The effect on extreme precipitation events, however, remains unclear.	[Hunt, Kieran M.

These hydrological extremes depend greatly on changes in the meteorological parameters. The task of this research was to evaluate the impact of meteorological factors (snow water equivalent and heavy rainfall) on the formation of spring floods in the basins of the Nemunas, Lielupe and Venta rivers. Five Lithuanian rivers (Venta, Seuvis, M<umacron>a, Merkys and Zeimena) from these basins were analysed in detail. These rivers fall within the Western, Central and Southeastern hydrological regions of Lithuania. Long-time-series data for daily discharge, precipitation and thickness of snow cover from 12 meteorological and five hydrological gauging stations were used. The evaluation of the relation between these factors was carried out for two periods: 1961-1987 and 1988-2014. The relation between the maximum discharge of the spring flood, the maximum snow water equivalent before the flood and the precipitation amount 10 days before the flood was analysed by multiple regression analysis. The high correlation co-efficients between the observed and predicted maximum discharges of the spring flood for the created regression models fluctuated between 0.63 and 0.86. The verification of the selected regression model was performed with Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) software, which also showed a high correlation co-efficient (0.71). The applied methodology of this research could be used for better perception of flood-formation consequences in different hydrological regions of Europe.

The basin's hydropower reservoir storage, which may rise from similar to 2% of its mean annual flow in 2008 to similar to 20% in 2025, is attenuating seasonal flow variability downstream of many dams with integral powerhouses and large storage reservoirs. In addition, tributary diversions for off-stream energy production are reducing downstream flows and augmenting them in recipient tributaries. To help manage tradeoffs between dam benefits (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, domestic water supply, and navigation) and their consequences for livelihoods and ecosystems, we review observed and projected impacts on river flows along both the Mekong mainstream and its tributaries. We include the effects of diversions and inter-basin transfers, which prior reviews of flow alteration in the Mekong basin have largely neglected. We also discuss the extent to which concurrent changes in climate, water demand, and land use, may offset or exacerbate hydropower-induced flow alteration. Our major recommendations for assessing hydrological impacts in the Mekong and other basins undergoing rapid hydropower development include synchronizing and integrating observational and modeling studies, improving the accuracy of reservoir water balances, evaluating multi-objective reservoir operating rules, examining hydropeaking-induced flow alteration, conducting multi-dam safety assessments, evaluating flow indicators relevant to local ecosystems and livelihoods, and considering alternative energy sources and reservoir sedimentation in long-term projections. Finally, we strongly recommend that dam impact studies consider hydrological alteration in conjunction with fish passage barriers, geomorphic changes and other contemporaneous stressors.

According to the framework, the deprived social groups and ethnic minorities are often more exposed to environmental risks and hazards due to their disadvantaged situation, and due to the lack of representation and political power. To manage the impacts of injustices and to include the citizen in the decision-making processes, proper information is needed on local attitudes and decision-making processes. Therefore, this study sought to (i) identify the main factors shaping the attitudes towards environmental injustices and (ii) to analyse the attitudes and perception of the various social groups and (iii) to identify the main factors which are shaping the attitudes and actions of those who were affected by the floods of 2001 and 2010 through the use of decision tree method. The data for the predictive model was acquired from a questionnaire survey conducted in two disadvantaged and flood-hit Hungarian regions. Based on the survey data, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted, which resulted in three principal components; fear, social change, and change in the built environment. The study focused only on the elements of the "fear principal component", due to the decision tree tool homogenous groups identified in relation to this component. Our analysis showed that ethnicity has a determinative role in the emergence and the level of fear from floods; the Roma respondents expressed a significantly higher level of fear than others.

Therefore, to effectively respond to disasters caused by precipitation in South Korea, climate change information using a climate model with an improved spatial resolution is required. This study classified sub-regions with homogeneous characteristics in South Korea using transformed gridded precipitation observation datasets. Then, high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) with a 12.5 km horizontal resolution, which are known to simulate added value well in simulating future projections of South Korea, were bias-corrected, and future changes in the precipitation means and extremes were analyzed using these RCMs. The classified precipitation sub-regions in South Korea reasonably reflected the observed distribution of precipitation, depending on latitude and topography. The future precipitation characteristics of the classified precipitation sub-regions were predicted using bias-corrected RCMs. While the annual precipitation is projected to increase relative to the present in most grids for all future periods, the RCP8.5 scenario for the mid-twenty-first century is projected to decrease in the north of the central region. Intensified warming in the late twenty-first century is predicted to considerably increase the mean precipitation intensity and magnitude of the high-intensity extreme precipitation in all the precipitation sub-regions. As these results can lead to increased hydrological disasters, this study will help to prepare practical countermeasures for precipitation changes on regional and local spatial scales in South Korea.

Although, climate field schools (CFS) are conducted with the aim of empowering farmers with knowledge on the various agricultural practices, little attention has been devoted to building the capacity of smallholder farmers to facilitate adoption of appropriate CSAPs. Given the effects of climate change on agriculture, it is fundamental for agricultural sustainability to answer the question that has hardly benefited from empirical analysis in previous land use studies, which is: Do CFS build farmers' capacity to adopt CSA in flood prone areas? Cross-sectional data from 600 rural farm households in south Bangladesh is used and the recursive bivariate probit (RBP) is applied to address this knowledge gap. The results reveal that participation in CFS increases the probability of a farmer's soil salinity consciousness by 25% and eventually improves the probability to adopt climate-smart agricultural practices by 20%. We also analyzed the spillover effects of CFS participation on CSA adoption and found that there is a strong spillover effect which has important implications on the cost effectiveness and sustainability of the program. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence demonstrating that participatory approaches stimulate adoption of appropriate CSAPs by building farmers' capacity in recognizing the existing climate risk hotspots.

The water quality is assessed using physicochemical parameters and requires manual collection. Moreover, physicochemical parameters are insufficient for water quality monitoring as heavy rainfalls and abundance of air pollutants cause water pollution. Thus, considering natural factors as influencing parameters and the latest technology for easy and global coverage for sampling, water quality monitoring is modified. This study investigates Rawal watershed with (a) physicochemical, (b) air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and (c) meteorological variables like wind speed for June 2018 to September 2022. Correlation and regression analysis are performed. The results show negative correlations for NO2 with total dissolved solids (TDS) (ranging, 0.51-0.85), turbidity (range, 0.53-0.65), pH (range, 0.5-0.75), and dissolved oxygen (DO) (range, 0.5-0.82), and positive correlation with electric conductivity (EC) (range, 0.54-0.85). The regression analysis with LightGBM, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) is applied with air pollutants, and meteorological parameters taken as independent variables giving root-mean-square error (RMSE) (ranging, 0.015-0.18). MLP gave an RMSE of 0.18 and 0.003 for TDS and pH, respectively. SVM performed well for DO, turbidity, and EC with RMSE ranging from 0.015 to 0.027. Moreover, floods on August 2022 are taken as a case study.

This paper aims to investigate the specializa-tion and study level-dependent differences concerning multi-hazard risk perception and hazard -related education insights of future potential specialists in natural hazard-induced risk manage-ment and tourism reconstruction. These differences were explored by applying a multi-layer questionnaire on 547 Geography and Tourism students and graduates from two universities in Iasi City (Romania) and Novi Sad (Serbia), and performing descriptive and differential statistical analyses. The statistically significant differences that emerged refer to estimations of the impact level of the Covid-19 pandemic and of other natural hazards at different spatial scales and on dif-ferent socio-economic activities, on the training/career of the respondents, and to the hazard -related education improvements. Up to date, none of the papers in the existing literature inte-grate both the Covid-19 pandemic and the co-occurrent natural hazards as objects of students' perception, which makes the present study a starting point for such research endeavours.

In Southeast Asia, many hydro-dams, which significantly alter the hydrology, have been built, but little is known about the influences of dams on wetland inundations. In this study, we quantified the characteristics of inun-dations and related the alterations to the dams by distinguishing them from influences of climate variabilities and local human activities. A multi-sensor approach using Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and MODIS was devised to delineate the weekly inundations of 362 Southeast Asian wetlands from 2014 to 2021. The four hydrological characteristics (cyclical pat-terns, trends, intra-annual variability, and amplitude of inundations) were quantified, and the alteration of the charac-teristics caused by dams was separated from climate variabilities and local human activities using correlation analysis and logistic regression models. The results found that cyclical patterns, trends, intra-annual variability, and amplitude of wetland inundations changed significantly over the period, but the magnitudes vary significantly depending on their geographic locations with respect to the dams. Findings showed that dams critically affect the wetlands even though dams are located distantly from the dams. This indicates that wetlands should be monitored and conserved for reduc-ing the influences of dams. This study advances our understanding of the effects of dams on wetlands by using the multi-sensor approach and distinguishing them from climate variabilities and local human activities.

Moreover, variability in the extreme temperature values was also analyzed as they would significantly impact the extreme climatic events in the form of heatwaves, floods, and droughts. A total of 200 time series were evaluated to analyze the variations in the annual and seasonal T-min and T-max, out of which significant trends were detected in 77 (38.5%) and 138 (69%) time series using the MK and ITA methods, respectively. Therefore, many significant trends were ignored in previous studies as none used the ITA method to detect temperature variabilities. Seasonal results showed the obvious significant increasing trends for the spring T-min and T-max, indicating an increased risk of early flooding due to aggravated glacier/snow melting. At the same time, decreasing trends were more obvious during the summer and winter seasons for T-min and vice versa for T-max. Moreover, extreme maximum temperatures, i.e., T(max)10p and T(max)90p, exhibited widespread significant increasing trends. In contrast, downward trends were identified for T(min)10p and T(min)90p, indicating an increment in the distribution of mean daily temperature towards extreme events. Hence, such variations in the extreme temperatures indicate an enhanced risk of extreme events in the form of heatwaves, floods, and prolonged droughts, which may significantly impact future water resources development projects.

Aside from the geotechnical characteristics of the terrain, placing it vulnerable to sediment loss from the impact of ocean waves, steady sea level rise is also responsible for its recession and accretion at different locations. Because of the severe retreat and repetitive flooding cases reported in the area, this study investigated the hydrodynamics nearshore and under some potential sea levels. The coast was divided into three sectors. A numerical model was set up using MIKE 21/3 coupled (hydrodynamic and spectral wave) model to present the area's first sea level assessment and prediction simulations. Results revealed that the central sector has the highest water levels and ranges during the simulated period and the highest water levels after sea level rise projections. In addition, the rate of increase in sea level is highest in the western and eastern sectors, respectively, where they closely border the central sector. Nevertheless, the coast's elevation and slope analysis indicated that the eastern sector is the most vulnerable to sea level rise. The study presents details of factors that influence the region's morphology and amplify the risks of its hydrodynamic processes, particularly during the spring tide. Hence, this study captures the events along the coast in order to point out the areas of future risk.

Drought conditions were assessed using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI), while the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) method was used to simulate flooding at four stations. The SPI results indicated that the amount of rainfall within the catchment area is near to normal, ranging from 64% to 75%, with some extremely wet exceptions which may cause flash floods. The RAI results also indicated that the amount of rainfall within the catchment area is near to normal, but the extremely wet category obtained the largest percentage (ranging from 36% to 50%) and the very wet category had the lowest percentage (ranging from 9% to 36%). The simulated flooding, using SCS, tended to slightly underestimate the observed streamflow, while the performance showed some weaknesses when the observed flooding was less than 1 m(3)/s. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency showed higher performance at closer rainfall stations to the outlet, with values of 0.92 and 0.94. Distant stations simulated floods that showed a lower level of efficiency, with values of 0.77 and 0.81. Given the fact that hydrological extremes (dry and wet conditions) are connected, the findings of the two indices and the SCS method are consistent and suitable for monitoring drought and flood events under climate change.

J	Jiang, LC; Tajima, Y; Wu, LH				Jiang, Lechuan; Tajima, Yoshimitsu; Wu, Lianhui			Application of Particle Swarm Optimization for Auto-Tuning of the Urban Flood Model	WATER			English	Article						particle swarm optimization; urban flood model; auto-tuning	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; IMPACTS; NETWORK; RISK; CITY	Reliable time-efficient prediction of urban floods is one of the essential tasks for planning of disaster prevention and mitigation measures. A key challenge of urban flood models is to obtain reliable input data. While geometric data can be directly measured, some other data, such as roughness and head loss of each flow system, are not easy to measure. This study proposes a novel approach for the auto-tuning of these unmeasurable data based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this paper, we first performed a sensitivity analysis of the present urban flood model to find important parameters, which dominantly determine the predictive skills of the present urban flood model. We then developed a PSO-based auto-tuning system for estimation of these parameters. The entire computation domain was evenly split into square segments, and optimum values of these parameters were determined in each segment. The capability of this method was confirmed by comparisons of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, normalized root-mean square error, Kling-Gupta efficiency, and Akaike Information Criteria. As a result, it was found that important parameters for the present urban flood model were Manning's roughness of the pipeline and a coefficient for determination of the discharge from the ground surface to sewer pipelines. It was also found that the present PSO-based auto-tuning system showed reasonably good performance in tuning these parameters, which clearly improve the predictive skills of the present urban flood model.

The prevalence of river and canal encroachments has a direct impact on population growth. However, the impacted population appears to be unaware of its negative consequences. To this end, we aimed to investigate the past and present canal scenarios with a focus on canal encroachment as the influencing factor in Ulipur upazila (highly vulnerable) of northern Bangladesh. To examine the impact of this encroachment, the Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI), Adaptive Capacity Index (ACI) and Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) were used. Our results showed signs of narrowing of the canal structure of Ulipur upazila in 1982 and 1992, while satellite images from 2002 and 2012 showed the presence of encroachment in the middle and lower parts of the canal. The FVI value for Hatia union was 0.703, indicating that this area was highly vulnerable to flooding. According to the ACI, the Pandul union has a high capacity to cope with flood impact, while the Hatia union has less capacity to cope with flood impact. Conversely, Hatia's union EVI value was 72.8, denoting a high economic vulnerability. Canal encroachments will have negative consequences for these impacted unions. It is critical to reduce the flooding and economic vulnerabilities associated with canal encroachments. It is found that canal excavation is very important for controlling flood water and reducing the damage caused by flooding.

Nevertheless, existing numerical models have shortages in accuracy, efficiency and revealing potential relationships. Thus, for providing an accurate and efficient statistical model as a fundamental tool for investigating the effects of changing environment on the YPRLS, we developed the Yangtze-Poyang water exchange statistic (YPWES) model. In this study, the YPWES model was employed to simulate the water exchange in the YPRLS from 1971 to 2016 and improve our understanding of the backflow from the river to lake (BRL) in the YPRLS.New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Based on a physic-based lumped framework, the established YPWES model is basically more accurate and efficient than nine existing models. Meanwhile, 93% of the BRL event will occur when the value of discharge identification function (DIF) is 9.2-10.0 m, while the threshold range of the DIF corresponding to the BRL event occurrence was smaller after 2003 because the discharge-stage relationship changes with the Yangtze River streamflow when the BRL event occurs. Our work provides a valuable model and may help to investigate the cause and influence of the water exchange in the YPRLS.

CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Residential real estate markets; Asset prices; Sea level rise; Flood risk	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; CHANGE ADAPTATION; PRICES; INSURANCE; HAZARDS; VALUES; COST; INFORMATION; AMENITIES; IMPACT	This research tests if contemporary house prices reflect the flood vulnerability of properties. In particular, future sea level rise is likely to expose properties to flood risk that are currently considered safe from these adverse events. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising of statutory rating valuation information and sales transactions, a hedonic framework is applied to estimate the potential price effects of current flood risk and future sea level rise. A valuation discount effect is identified for properties in known flooded areas while sea level rise has no detectable effect on valuations or sales data. The lack of a sea level rise discount in this analysis may be due to the absence of clear and comprehensive information on sea level rise available to home purchasers, myopic buyer behaviour, relatively affordable insurance premiums in areas not yet affected and no concrete plans for requiring buyers and owners to contribute to community or dwelling adaptation costs. Our results also indicate that buildings are in a significantly worse state of maintenance and repair if they are located in both current flood zones and areas that are likely to be under water when sea levels rise further. Generally, the lack of a price discount highlights that purchasers may be under-prepared for the future challenges and implications of sea level rise and the ancillary effects of future flooding, inundation and storm surges.

In order to deal with the damage caused by urban flood effectively, it is increasingly important to accurately predict and characterize the information of the flood in cities. In recent years, the rise of machine learning methods provides a new technical means for flood prediction. In this study, Naive Bayes (NB) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm were used to forecast the waterlogging point and the waterlogging process at the waterlogging point respectively to achieve the goal of predicting the whole process of urban waterlogging. Compared with the actual result, the four evaluation indexes (P, R, A and F-1) of the NB classification models are 91%, 90.5%, 98.9% and 90.7% respectively, and the three regression indexes (MAE, MRER and RMSE) of the RF regression model were respectively 0.95%, 9.53% and 1.21%. The results demonstrated that the prediction result of NB model for waterlogging point is reliable, and the process of waterlogging predicted by RF model is also consistent with the actual situation, which verify the validity and applicability of the NB model and RF model. This research is expected to provide scientific guidance and theoretical support for urban flood disaster mitigation and relief work.

Currently, climate change is leading to more frequent and intense rain events, which cause flooding episodes, thereby altering soil redox equilibria and contaminants stability. We evaluated the potential release of Zn and Cd (two of the most common inorganic contaminants) and the factors regulating their solubility and speciation in two heavily contaminated soils representative of a Zn-mining area. The soils were flooded under aerobic (for 24 h) and anaerobic (for 62 days) conditions using mesocosm experiments, sequential extractions, and geochemical modelling. Leaching trials under aerobic conditions showed a high release of Zn and Cd (10 times the legislative limits), with metals possibly migrating via water infiltration or runoff. Under anaerobic conditions Zn and Cd were initially released. Then, solution concentrations decreased gradually (Zn) or sharply (Cd) until the end of the experiment. Sequential extractions and multisurface modelling indicated that both metals precipitated mainly as carbonates. This was confirmed by a geochemical multisurface modelling, which also predicted the formation of sulphides after 60 days in one soil. The model calculated metals to be preferentially complexed by organic matter and well predicted the observed soil solution concentrations. The results showed that during flooding episodes contaminants could be promptly transferred to other environmental compartments. The use of multisurface modelling coupled with laboratory experiments provided useful indications on the potential release and speciation in case of anoxic conditions.

A Random Forest (RF) model was chosen to capture the relationship between the change in 100-year return period flow up- and downstream of different dams and dam parameters available in the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database. The results showed that: (1) the RF model showed a greater accuracy in terms of Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (0.92 in training and 0.88 in testing) than a benchmark Multiple Linear Regression model (0.68 in training and 0.61 in testing); (2) Dam inflow, upstream catchment area, and long-term average discharge at reservoir location were the three most important factors for dam outflow; (3) flood attenuation effect indices (FAI) for >1400 dams over the CONUS were derived with the proposed method. To further validate the accuracy of the FAI, a new module considering flood attenuation effects was developed for the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model and two dams in the CONUS were selected to compare simulated flooded area against Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps. The result showed that the overestimation in flood hazard maps caused by not taking dams into account can be significantly corrected using the FAI and the enhanced LISFLOOD-FP model. We conclude that the proposed methodology is a valid approach to describe the impact of dams on design floods, thereby improving the accuracy of flood hazardmaps, especially in ungauged areas.

NEW APPROACH TO ENHANCE THE INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH THE COLLABORATIVE FLOOD-serv PLATFORM IN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						flood risk management; Danube Delta; flood awareness; decision support systems		Floods are extreme events that appear a lot more often nowadays and are becoming a severe problem considering their effects. Studies and hydraulic models show that the intensity and frequency of such events will increase due to climate change, increasing thus the extent of their effects. In order to improve the knowledge on the effects of floods and to minimise the damage, a European team of experts implemented the Horizon 2020 project, Flood-Serv (Public FLOOD Emergency and Awareness SERVice). Within this project, IT specialists, researchers and flood risk management practitioners collaborated to develop the FLOOD-serv System, a multicomponent, integrated, pro-active and personalised citizen-centric public service application that will enhance the involvement of the citizen and will harness the collaborative power of ICT networks (networks of people, of knowledge, of sensors), to raise awareness on flood risks and to enable collective risk mitigation solutions and response actions. For a better approach, the project tested the services in 5 'pilot cities' in five countries. The platform is built based on a complex user requirements assessment process collecting information about flood risk models based on the EU Floods Directive, flood scenarios, GIS Data, new sensor data, legal and socio-economic information, and the concrete needs and work processes of partner cities. The final form of the platform and its components support and improve the flood risk management in the test areas and also provide vital information on long term monitoring of relevant sensor data.

To quantitatively analyze the characteristics of water level variations in 2006 and 2011, a new calculation method was proposed, and the daily water level and discharge from 1955-2016 were collected in this study. The findings are as follows: in 2006 and 2011, the water level in the dry season significantly increased, but that in the flood season obviously decreased compared with the levels in 1978 and 1986. Here, we described this phenomenon as "no low-water-level in dry season, no high-water-level in flood season". Based on the calculation method, the contributions of climate variability and the Three Gorges Dam operation to water level variations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were calculated, and the contributions indicated that climate variability was the main reason for the phenomenon of "no low-water-level in dry season, no high-water-level in flood season" instead of flood peak reduction in the flood season and drought runoff implementation in the dry season, which are both induced by TGD.

This lagoon in central Japan is under a complicated climate system influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), and strong typhoon events. Diatom assemblages and chemical components of a 1.3 m sediment core suggest historical events of rapid salination and cyclical ecosystem shifts accompanied by monsoon condition changes. Most research has indicated that Lake Hamana changed from a freshwater lake to a brackish lagoon because of the Meio earthquake in 1498 CE. However, based on results from the diatom assemblage and chemical components, this salination occurred because of changes in the Hamana paleoriver flow, and this change happened before the earthquake, around the mid-15th century. Furthermore, it is clear that Lake Hamana was an oligohaline lagoon before salination. The lithology of the lake sediments and the diatom assemblage changed during the LIA; sand, water, and total diatom contents decreased. However, the relative abundance of marine diatom taxa increased during the LIA. These changes were introduced by a weakening EASM coupled with low precipitation under low solar activity during the LIA. Several flood events represented by freshwater diatom taxa and magnetic susceptibility peaks co-occurred with strong El Nino events during the LIA. It is inferred that this strong El Nino during the LIA induced frequent typhoons causing floods in central Japan.

The impact of human activities (e.g. extensive mowing once a year or low stress grazing) on the habitat in this area is low. The disturbances are caused by natural conditions such as melting snow, precipitation and brackish sea water and the presence of flood is supported by flat relief. The aim of the current study was to describe the Chilopoda and Diplopoda assemblages of semi natural meadows and to find out the effect of habitat conditions on these invertebrates. On the 12 studied meadows we sampled and analysed soil invertebrates by using pitfall traps in the non-flooded and flooded areas of meadows. The individuals of 10 Chilopoda species and 15 Diplopoda species, which assemblages were more abundant and diverse in the non-flooded areas of meadows with trees and bushes nearby, were collected on semi natural meadows in Matsalu. Only a few species were represented in abundance on studied meadows including Leptoiulus proximus, L. cibdellus, Julus terrestris, J. scanicus. The species Pachymerium ferrugineum, Schendyla nemorensis, Julus terrestris, J. scanicus, Leptoiulus cibdellus, Xestoiulus laeticollis were also found in the areas flooded with brackish water. The activity density and species richness of Chilopoda and Diplopoda were significantly lower in the flooded areas of the meadow after flood water withdrawal compared to the non-flooded areas of the same meadows.

The Xynthia storm hit the French Atlantic coast on the 28th of February 2010, causing large floods and damages from the Gironde to the Loire estuaries. Blind separation of the tide components and of the storm signature was achieved while using both a singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). A correlation of 0.98/0.97 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.21/0.28 m between the tide gauge records of Socoa and our estimates of the sea surface height (SSH) using the SSA and the CWT, respectively, were found. Correlations of 0.76 and 0.7 were also obtained between one of the modes from the SSA and atmospheric pressure from a meteorological station and a mode of the SSA. Particularly, a correlation reaches to 0.76 when using both the tide residual that is associated to surges and atmospheric pressure variation.

Current rice farming, water resources and micro-irrigation	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Review						Micro-irrigation; rice farming; water resources and availability; water use efficiency	ORYZA-SATIVA L.; SPRINKLER IRRIGATION; AEROBIC RICE; INTENSIFICATION SRI; FLOOD IRRIGATION; SOUTHEASTERN QUEENSLAND; SAVING IRRIGATION; USE EFFICIENCY; DRYLAND RICE; CROP GROWTH	Rice is the staple food for half of the world's population, and rice farming is a livelihood for millions of farmers in Asia. In India, it provides an individual with 32% of the total calorie and 24% of the total protein daily. This crop is mostly grown in puddled soil by transplanting, and flood irrigation is practised by farmers. Water or irrigation input to transplanted rice typically ranges from 1000 to 2000 mm depending upon the growing season, climatic condition, soil type and hydrological conditions. Facing water scarcity and climate change, reducing water requirement of this crop is a challenge. Out of 42.75 million hectare (m ha) rice area, only 25.12 m ha is under irrigation. Regarding water resources, depletion of groundwater is alarming in the north Indian states. On the other hand, it is under-utilized in eastern India. Micro-irrigation, i.e. sprinkler and drip methods have been used with the aim of minimizing water use and enhancing water use efficiency of rice. In addition, evidence-based scientific understandings on micro-irrigation for rice have been elucidated in this article. The potential of drip or sprinkler irrigation to rice on water saving as well as scientific insight and critical appraisal have been expounded on reasons of yield reduction. This comprehensive treatise would facilitate the formulation of strategies or policies on efficient management of water or irrigation for rice cultivation.	[Mandal, K. G.; Thakur, A. K.; Ambast, S.

J	Neise, T; Diez, JR				Neise, Thomas; Diez, Javier Revilla			Adapt, move or surrender? Manufacturing firms' routines and dynamic capabilities on flood risk reduction in coastal cities of Indonesia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Adaptation; Manufacturing firms; Flood; Routines; Indonesia	MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND SUBSIDENCE; SEMARANG; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES; EVOLUTION; CAPACITY; JAKARTA; CITY	Many manufacturing firms collocate within coastal urban areas in Indonesia. At these locations, they are severely affected by the most occurring environmental hazard, floods. Although research on firms' adaptation to environmental hazards is burgeoning, the focus still lies on damage evaluation, support for disaster relief, or on how firms can support the community. Despite the fact that floods are a recurrent and aggravating stressor for firms, particularly in developing countries, a clear understanding of how firms develop adaptation strategies and which rationales determine their strategy has been sparsely addressed. Therefore, this paper derives flood adaptation strategies from the literature and empirically test them on flood-prone manufacturing firms in Jakarta and Semarang. Based on 67 in-depth interviews, we demonstrate that firms' routines (i.e., behavioral pattern) and dynamic capabilities (i.e., competencies) determine the adaptation strategies of manufacturing firms in Jakarta and Semarang. The study shows that firms' flood adaptation strategies differ regarding business size and between both cities. Particularly, it is detected that large and medium-sized firms can adapt more effectively to floods, while small firms face difficulties due to inferior routines and dynamic capabilities. This shortcoming jeopardizes their general business viability. Overall, the paper emphasizes the imperative for a deeper understanding of firms' adaptation strategies since viable firms are an essential player to strengthen the social welfare, economic development, and ecological conservation in flood-prone areas.

The ups and downs of the Missouri River from Pleistocene to present: Impact of climatic change and forebulge migration on river profiles, river course, and valley fill complexity	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							GLACIAL ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; LOESS DEPOSITION; GREAT-PLAINS; MISSISSIPPI; LAURENTIDE; HISTORY; QUARTZ; AGE	The Missouri River is a continent-scale river that has thus far escaped a rigorous reporting of valley fill trends within its trunk system. This study summarizes evolution of the lower Missouri River profile from the time of outwash in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until establishment of the modern dominantly precipitation-fed river. This work relies on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, water-well data, and a collection of surficial geological maps of the valley compiled from U.S. Geological Survey EDMAP and National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergrads projects. Mapping reveals five traceable surfaces within valley fill between Yankton, South Dakota, USA, and Columbia, Missouri, USA, that record two cycles of incision and aggradation between ca. 23 ka and ca. 8 ka. The river aggraded during the LGM to form the Malta Bend surface by ca. 26 ka. The Malta Bend surface is buried and fragmented but presumed to record a braided outwash plain. The Malta Bend surface was incised up to 18 m between ca. 23 ka and ca. 16 ka to form the Carrolton surface (ca. 16 ka to ca. 14 ka). The Carrollton surface ghosts a braided outwash morphology locally through overlying mud. Aggradation followed (ca. 14 ka to ca. 13.5 ka) to within 4 m of the modern floodplain surface and generated the Salix surface (ca. 13.5 to ca. 12 ka). By Salix time, the Missouri River was no longer an outwash river and formed a single-thread meandering pattern. Reincision at ca. 12 ka followed Salix deposition to form the short-lived Vermillion surface at approximately the grade of the earlier Carrolton surface. Rapid aggradation from ca. 10 ka to ca. 8 ka followed and formed the modern Omaha surface (ca. 8 ka to Present). The higher Malta Bend and Omaha profiles are at roughly the same grade, as are the lower Carrolton and Vermillion surfaces. The Salix surface is in between. All surfaces converge downstream as they enter the narrow and shallow bedrock valley just before reaching Columbia, Missouri. The maximum departure of the profiles is 18 m near Sioux City, Iowa, USA, at similar to 100 km downstream from the James Lobe glacial input near Yankton, South Dakota. Incision and aggradation appear to be driven by relative changes in input of sediment and water related to glacial advance and retreat and then later by climatic changes near the Holocene transition. The incision from the Malta Bend to the Carrolton surface records the initial breakdown of the cryosphere at the end of the LGM, and this same incisional event is found in both the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. This incisional event records a "big wash" that resulted in the evacuation of sediment from each of the major outwash rivers of North America. The direction and magnitude of incision from the LGM to the modern does not fit with modeled glacioisostatic adjustment trends for the Missouri Valley. Glaciotectonics likely influenced the magnitude of incision and aggradation secondarily but does not appear to have controlled the overall timing or magnitude of either. Glaciotectonic valley tilting during the Holocene, however, did likely cause the Holocene channel to consistently migrate away from the glacial front, which argues for a forebulge axis south of the Missouri Valley during the Holocene and, by inference, earlier. This is at least 200 km south of where models predict the Holocene forebulge axis. The Missouri Valley thus appears to reside in the tectonic low between the ice front and the forebulge crest. The buffer valley component of incision caused by profile variation could explain as much as 25 m of the total similar to 40 m of valley incision at Sioux City, Iowa. The Missouri Valley also hosted a glacial lobe as far south as Sioux City, Iowa, in pre-Wisconsinan time, which is also a factor in valley excavation.

The main goal of our study was to identify the effect of external (e.g. climate changes, tectonics) and internal controls (e.g. sediment transport, deposition, vegetation cover) on the evolution of meandering rivers flowing through sedimentary basins using the example of the lower Drava River (Europe, Hungary/Croatia). Field research was conducted along a 50-km-long section of the valley. Sedimentary data from boreholes and corings, 35 km of ground-penetrating radar surveys and analyses of digital maps were conducted to reconstruct channel planform changes. Traces of four meander belts were identified, and 39 AMS radiocarbon dates were used to distinguish the chronology of the fluvial events. The evolution of the lower Drava River comprised alternating periods of deposition (formation of aggrading meander belt) and avulsions. The channel belts were formed owing to upstream sediment delivery and floodplain storage. Changes in climate humidity and the occurrence of high flows influenced the planform of the meanders within particular channel belts. The oldest channel was active at least similar to 40 000 cal. BP before being reworked by subsequent meanders active between the Late Pleniglacial (30 000-14 700 cal. BP) and Late Glacial (similar to 11 000 cal. BP) periods. The channel belts shifted to the south in the Holocene, between similar to 11 000 and 250 cal. BP due to the presence of a thrust fault situated diagonally to the Drava Valley. Results show channel width, channel belt width and the surface area of point bar deposits increased in the succeeding generations of meanders and that the style and sedimentary architecture of the channel belts were dominantly dependent on autogenic controls, that is, sediment delivery, aggradation and erosional events (e.g. formation of chute cut-offs).

Large-scale seasonal forecasts of river discharge by coupling local and global datasets with a stacked neural network: Case for the Loire River system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Forecast; River discharge; Stacked LSTM; Deep learning; Big data; Loire Bretagne Basin	MODELS	Accurate prediction of river discharge is critical for a wide range of sectors, from human activities to environmental hazard management, especially in the face of increasing demand for water resources and climate change. To address this need, a multivariate model that incorporates both local and global data sources, including river and piezometer gauges, sea level, and climate parameters. By employing phase shift analysis, the model optimizes correlations between the target discharge and 12 parameters related to hydrologic and climatic systems, all sampled daily. In addition, a stacked LSTM - a more complex neural network architecture - is used to improve information extraction ability. Exploring river dynamics in the Loire-Bretagne basin and its surroundings, the investigation delves into predictions in daily time steps for one, three, and six months ahead. The resulting forecast features high accuracy and efficiency in predicting river discharge fluctuations, showcasing superior performance in forecasting drought periods over flood peaks. A detailed examination on data used highlights the significance of both local and global datasets in predicting river discharge, where the former dictates short-term predictions, while the latter drives long-range forecasts. Seasonally extended forecasting confirms a strong connection between the forecast leading time and the shift in data correlation, with lower correlation at a lag of 3 months due to seasonal changes affecting forecast quality, compensated by a higher correlation at a longer lag of 6 months. Such mutual effect in this multi-time-step forecasting improves the predictive quality of a six-month horizon, thus encourages progress in long-term prediction to a seasonal scale. The research establishes a practical foundation for effectively utilizing big data to leverage long-term forecasting of environmental dynamics.	[Vu, M.

Advanced monitoring of soil-vegetation co-dynamics reveals the successive controls of snowmelt on soil moisture and on plant seasonal dynamics in a mountainous watershed	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						hillslope; snow impact; soil moisture; vegetation growth; seasonal dynamic	ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEMS; HETEROGENEITY; GROUNDWATER; SATELLITE; SNOWPACK; RUNOFF	Evaluating the interactions between above- and below-ground processes is important to understand and quantify how ecosystems respond differently to atmospheric forcings and/or perturbations and how this depends on their intrinsic characteristics and heterogeneity. Improving such understanding is particularly needed in snow-impacted mountainous systems where the complexity in water and carbon storage and release arises from strong heterogeneity in meteorological forcing and terrain, vegetation and soil characteristics. This study investigates spatial and temporal interactions between terrain, soil moisture, and plant seasonal dynamics at the intra- and inter-annual scale along a 160 m long mountainous, non-forested hillslope-to-floodplain system in the upper East River Watershed in the upper Colorado River Basin. To this end, repeated UAV-based multi-spectral aerial imaging, ground-based soil electrical resistivity imaging, and soil moisture sensors were used to quantify the interactions between above and below-ground compartments. Results reveal significant soil-plant co-dynamics. The spatial variation and dynamics of soil water content and electrical conductivity, driven by topographic and soil intrinsic characteristics, correspond to distinct plant types, with highest plant productivity in convergent areas. Plant productivity in heavy snow years benefited from more water infiltration as well as a shallow groundwater table depth. In comparison, low snowpack years with an early first bare-ground date, which are linked to an early increase in plant greenness, imply a short period of saturated conditions that leads to lower average and maximum greenness values during the growing season. Overall, these results emphasize the strong impact of snowpack dynamics, and terrain and subsurface characteristics on the heterogeneity in plant type and seasonal dynamics.

The impact, especially on erosion and sedimentation, is likely to be exacerbated in regions dominated by high rainfall patterns such as monsoons. This study analyzed the hydrological responses of LULC changes in terms of streamflow (SF) and sediment yield (SY) in a monsoon-dominated tropical watershed, the Periyar River Watershed (PRW) in Kerala, India. This watershed drains an area of 4793 km(2) characterized by an average monsoon rainfall of 2900 mm from June to November. The watershed hydrology and sediment dynamics were simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the impact assessment at the watershed outlet and the sub-watershed level. Historical LULC data were analyzed for 1988, 1992, 2002, and 2016 using the maximum likelihood method, and future LULC changes were projected for 2030, 2050, 2075, and 2100 using the Markov chain-cellular automata technique. Between 1988 and 2016, the urban area increased by 4.13 percent, while plantation and forest coverage decreased by 1.5 percent. At this rate, by 2100, the urban area is expected to grow by 16.45% while plantations and forest area will shrink by 13.7% compared to 1988. The effects of these changes on SF and SY were found to be minimal at the watershed outlet; however, at the spatial scale of sub-watersheds, the changes varied up to 70% for surface runoff and 200% for SY. These findings highlight the potential impacts of LULC changes in a monsoon-dominated watershed and may contribute to the development of successful LULC-based watershed management strategies for prevention of flooding and sediment loss.

This study aims to build an urban flood warning system for reducing the impact of flood disasters. A great number of storm-induced rainfall data were collected in Taipei, Taiwan, and the corresponding 2-D inundation maps were simulated for illustrating urban rainfall-flood inundation processes. We proposed a novel urban flood forecast methodology framed by machine learning and statistical techniques to mine the spatial-temporal features between rainfall patterns and inundation maps for making multi-step-ahead regional flood inundation forecasts. The proposed methodology (PCA-SOM-NARX) integrated the advantages of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NARX). PCA was used to extract principal components representing the different spatial distributions of urban inundation. SOM was used to cluster high dimensional inundation datasets to form a two-dimensional topological feature map. NARX was used to establish multi-step-ahead flood forecast models for the next hour at a 10-minute scale. The results show that the PCA-SOM-NARX approach not only produced more stable and accurate multi-step-ahead forecasts on flood inundation depth but was also more indicative of the spatial distribution of inundation caused by torrential rain events, compared to the SOM-NARX approach (the benchmark). The results demonstrate the proposed methodology can adequately grasp the inundation status associated with different rainfall distributions to reliably and accurately forecast regional flood inundation depths, which can help decision makers respond to flooding earlier and mitigate flood disasters.

As a result, hydrological and hydrodynamic models have recently shown a broad application prospect in urban flood simulating and forecasting. For the area with rich inland rivers, urban water resources can be effectively regulated and redistributed through river networks and hydraulic structures scheduling. However, the lack of research on the effect of scheduling becomes a major limitation in model applications. Based on a coupled hy-drodynamics model, the current study simulates the flooding response to the combined rainstorm and scheduling scenarios and analyzes the river overflow at the community scale. The result indicated that three local regions in the Jin'an study area are inundated easily. The locations near Qinting Lake were more sensitive to the water regulation rules than others. In the model of control on Qinting Lake, section A is more sensitive to the schedule control than section B, while for section A, the water level increased by 1.44% under the return period (RP) (10 a), and the rate changed to 2.64% under the RP (100 a). The differences in inundation from various scenarios are relatively small. In the mode of joint discharge rules under RP (50 a), the water level changed by 4.77% in section A and 1.24% in section B. The simulation at the community scale considers the overflow process, and the results indicated that the total inundation area decreased by 12.8 ha under joint schedules. The significant effects to alleviate urban inundation mainly come from the decreased flood overflow from the channel, but not from the flooding nodes. This study provides promising references for urban flood management.

In order to better define the medium- and long-term (annual to decadal) implications of these threats, existing dendrochronological data were supplemented by several hundred tree-ring analyses from 14 hitherto unstudied living tree stands in five catchments; these were combined to compile a regional picture of the location, extent, and timing of major prehistoric reforestation episodes on the floodplains of the area. These episodes correspond well with known dates of large earthquakes in the area (ca. 1400, ca. 1620, 1717 and 1826 AD), and their extents are thus interpreted to reflect the sediment deliveries resulting from coseismic landsliding into mountain valleys, and their reworking by rivers to generate widespread avulsion, aggradation, floodplain inundation and forest death. This regional aggradation picture can underpin anticipation of, and planning for, the medium- to long-term societal impacts of future major West Coast earthquakes. The source location of the next major earthquake in the region is unknown, so any of the Westland floodplains could be affected by extensive, up to metre-scale river aggradation, together with avulsion and flooding, in its aftermath, and these could continue for decades. Re-establishment and maintenance of a functioning economy under these conditions will be challenging because roads, settlements and agriculture are mostly located on the floodplains. The differences in floodplain vegetation between prehistoric and future episodes will affect the rapidity and distribution of aggradation; response and recovery planning will need to consider this, together with the impacts of climate changes on river flows.

J	Zeman-Kuhnert, S; Thiel, V; Heim, C				Zeman-Kuhnert, Sebastian; Thiel, Volker; Heim, Christine			Effects of Weather Extremes on the Nutrient Dynamics of a Shallow Eutrophic Lake as Observed during a Three-Year Monitoring Study	WATER			English	Article						cyanobacterial blooms; eutrophication; nutrient dynamics; SRP release; weather extremes	CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS; CONCENTRATING MECHANISMS; PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; WATER; SEDIMENTS; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; PESTICIDES; NITROGEN	The formation of algal and cyanobacterial blooms caused by the eutrophication of water bodies is a growing global concern. To examine the impact of extreme weather events on blooms, eutrophication-related parameters (e.g., water temperature, nitrate, ammonium, nitrite, and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP)) were quantitatively assessed monthly over three years (2017-2019) at Lake Seeburg (Central Germany), a shallow eutrophic lake with regular cyanobacterial blooms. In addition, SRP concentrations in sediment pore water were assessed monthly for one year (2018). The monitoring period included a three-day extremely heavy rain event in 2017 as well as a severe drought in summer 2018. No such extreme weather conditions occurred in 2019. After the heavy rain event in 2017, anoxic water containing high levels of ammonium and SRP entered the lake from flooded upstream wetlands. This external nutrient spike resulted in a heavy but short (3 weeks) and monospecific cyanobacterial bloom. A different situation occurred during the exceptionally hot and dry summer of 2018. Especially favored by high water temperatures, SRP concentrations in sediment pore waters gradually increased to extreme levels (34.4 mg/L). This resulted in a strong and sustained internal SRP delivery into the water column (69 mg/m(2)center dot d(-1)), which supported the longest-lasting cyanobacterial bloom (3 months) within the three-year monitoring period. Subsequent biomass decay led to oxygen-depleted conditions in the bottom waters, elevated ammonium, and, later, nitrate concentrations. Our observations demonstrate the particular effects of extreme weather events on nutrient dynamics and the phytoplankton composition in the lake. As the frequency and intensity of such events will likely increase due to climate change, their impacts need to be increasingly considered, e.g., in future remediation strategies.

Climate change results in more extreme weather events such as flooding and higher temperatures, potentially leading to an increase in As release and biotransformations. Here, we investigated the effects of flooding and temperature on As release, bio-methylation and biovolatilisation from As-rich soils with different pH and source of As (one acidic and anthropogenic (Salanfe) and one neutral and geogenic (Liesberg)). Flooded soils incubated at 23 degrees C for two weeks showed a -3-fold (Liesberg site) and -7-fold (Salanfe site) increase in the total As concentration of soil solution compared to those incubated at 18 degrees C. Methyl-and thio-As species were found in the acidic soil and soil solution. High temperatures enhanced thiolation and methylation although inorganic As was predominant. We also show that volatile As fluxes in-creased more than 4-fold between treatments, from 18 +/- 5 ng/kg/d at 18 degrees C to 75 +/- 6 ng/kg/d at 23 degrees C from Salanfe soil. Our results suggest that high As soils with acidic pH can become an important source of As to the surrounding environment according to realistic climatic scenarios, and that biovolatilisation is very sensitive to increases in temper-ature. This study provides new data and further justifies further investigations into climate-induced changes on As release and speciation and its links to important factors such as microbial ecology and sulfate or iron biogeochemistry. Synopsis: In the studied Swiss soils, elevated temperature increases arsenic mobility through volatilisation and methylation.

However, the water-sediment synergistic relationship, which refers to the degree of intervention between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season, must be further analyzed. This study proposed the concept of the synergy degree between water and sediment based on the discipline of synergetics created by Haken (Haken, 1983). The flood and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season and the measured water-sediment coordination levels were adopted in this study to obtain their synergy degree by taking as an example the largest and most continuous region from the Huangfu River to the Jialu River in the coarse sand source regions of the Loess Plateau. The results of this investigation are as follows. The degree of synergy between runoff and suspended sediment transport was below 0.722 from 1958 to 2016. Approximately 70% of the flood events in the five river basins had poor degrees of synergy between the flow and sediment processes in the flood season. Moreover, the synergy degrees of the water-sediment relationship were relatively low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season due to the low order degrees of these two process subsystems. The low synergistic relationship between these two subsystems shows that the coordination and buffering abilities between the flood and suspended sediment transport processes were weak. These findings demonstrate the successful adoption of synergetics to ascertain the water-sediment synergistic relationship and also provided critical information for designing water conveyance systems with high sediment concentrations for irrigation in the coarse sand source regions of the Loess Plateau, China.

The Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach offers a revolutionary change in using heightened flow rates and large capacities of water to our advantage, while also disguising the attenuated water into the urbanized environment. This research explores the result of integrating several SuDS devices in management trains with the sole purpose of significantly reducing overall water quantity. It will compare and contrast and prove how SuDS is more dependable than the conventional pipe-based drainage system that is characterized by its ability to remove water to the outflow quickly. Furthermore, in order to determine how a SuDS device is implemented into the natural environment, a case study was conducted at a residential area in Gibside View, Winlaton in Gateshead. The research exhibits how the newly implemented Detention basin had to be retrofitted into the already inadequate drainage system that once lived there; all in thought of alleviating the significant flooding events that were once reported to have occurred prior. As a verification method in terms of effectiveness, a questionnaire was conducted through convenient and purposive sampling at the Case Study location; data was accumulated door-to-door inside a 300 m radius of the detention basin and received about 180 valid responses. The results showed persistence of respondents who detailed flooding events prior to installing the Detention basin, who then recognised a fundamental change in the minimization of water quantity and flooding issues. The results of this research showed why Detention Basins continue to be identified as one of the most successful water reduction-based SuDS devices available for development nationwide implementation.

Low impact development (LID) measures are a storm management technique designed for controlling runoff in urban areas, which is critical for solving urban flood hazard. Therefore, this study developed an exploratory simulation-optimization framework for the spatial arrangement of LID measures. The proposed framework begins by applying a numerical model to simulate hydrological and hydrodynamic processes during a storm event, and the urban flood model coupled with the source tracking method was then used to identify the flood source areas. Next, based on source tracking data, the LID investment in each catchment was determined using the inundation volume contribution ratio of the flood source area (where most of the investment is required) to the flood hazard area (where most of the flooding occurs). Finally, the resiliency and sustainability of different LID scenarios were evaluated using several different storm events in order to provide suggestions for flooding prediction and the decision-making process. The results of this study emphasized the importance of flood source control. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the impact of inundation volume transport between catchments on the effectiveness of LID measures, a regional relevance index (RI) was proposed to analyze the spatial connectivity between different regions. The simulation-optimization framework was applied to Haikou City, China, wherein the results indicated that LID measures in a spatial arrangement based on the source tracking method are a robust and resilient solution to flood mitigation. This study demonstrates the novelty of combining the source tracking method and highlights the spatial connectivity between flood source areas and flood hazard areas.

Muell.), is a keystone tree species of lowland semi-arid floodplain ecosystems in south-eastern Australia. E. largiflorens woodlands are of high conservation value and threatened by climate change-induced drought and irrigation water diversions due to their location on upper floodplain areas where flood frequency has declined. Water requirements of E. largiflorens have not been well quantified using empirical data. Accordingly, knowledge gaps exist in relation to volumes of environmental water required to maintain and improve ecological condition for disconnected floodplain woodlands. To further assist conservation and water resource management, we tested the use of drip irrigation to provide a variety of water regimes to experimental plots in order to monitor tree responses. Water was provided via irrigation delivery across four regimes representing known volumes of water, referred to as an environmental water provision, applied over a 22-week period for two Austral summers. Benefits to trees were identified by measuring transpiration and plant water status using sap flow sensors and a Scholander pressure chamber, respectively. Results indicate that volumes of 0.3, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.8 ML increased transpiration and improved plant water status in comparison to a control, with delivery recommended to commence early autumn. Greater volumes (1.4 ML), substantially increased transpiration and improved water status, especially when delivered at a rate of similar to 25 mm week(-1) compared to a monthly 'burst' which broadly represented natural, sporadic summer rainfall in the region. For an environmental watering provision of 25 mm week(-1), similar to 178 ha of E. largiflorens woodland can be watered with a 1 GL environmental water allocation. The study methods presented are relevant worldwide and our results further the collective understanding of the benefits environmental water provides to E. largiflorens.

Based on historical statistical data from yearbooks and bulletins, the overall characteristics of cropland damage by AMDs during 1978-2018 were analyzed using a pre-whitening procedure and a Mann-Kendall trend test at yearly and provincial scales in China. The results showed that drought was the most severe, with an average covered area of 22.2 million ha and an affected area of 11.2 million ha every year during 1978-2018, followed by flood, hail, and LTF. A decreasing trend was observed in covered area and affected area by drought, flood, and hail, while only LTF showed an increasing trend. On provincial scale, more than 70% of the covered area by AMDs was induced by drought and flood in most provincial districts. In all provincial districts of northern China, more than 50% of the covered area was induced by drought. In most provincial districts of southern China, more than 40% of the covered area was induced by flood. Hail disasters were prominent in Xinjiang, with significant increasing trends among all parameters. Compared with the other three AMDs, LTF covered and affected the smallest cropland area, but significant increasing trends were observed in the northwest and middle parts of China. The results of this study systematically display the characteristics of damage to cropland by four main AMDs, which are critical and necessary for disaster risk reduction and adaptive strategy development.

High variance in community structure and ecosystem carbon stocks of Fijian mangroves driven by differences in geomorphology and climate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Mangroves; Fiji; Community structure; Ecosystem carbon stocks; Geomorphology	INTERSECT METHOD; ZONE FORESTS; ARID-ZONE; STORAGE; SERVICES; MARINE; ISLAND	Mangrove ecosystems are particularly important for small island developing states of the Pacific, such as Fiji, which are at the forefront of the impacts of climate change. This is because of the ability of mangroves to mitigate storm surges and floods as well as their high carbon sequestration and storage capacity. However, there are few detailed studies on the spatial variation in mangrove structure and carbon stocks in Fiji, and this information is essential to support decision making by government and communities, enabling the development of effective mitigation and adaptation responses. We assessed mangrove forest structure in contrasting regions around Fiji's largest island, Viti Levu, within sites managed by indigenous (iTaukei) Fijians. Mangroves of the Ba, NadmgaNavosa, and Rewa and Tailevu regions showed high variance in both structural complexity and ecosystem carbon stocks. Levels of variation were similar to that observed globally due to variable geomorphological and biophysical settings related to omgraphic rainfall, freshwater influx, tidal amplitude and cyclonic disturbances. High biomass, structurally complex forests occur on the wetter south-east coast (e.g. the Rewa Delta), while structurally uniform scrub mangroves dominate large areas of mangroves along the north-west (e.g. the Ba Delta) and west coast (e.g. the Tuva Delta). Mangroves of the Ba region displayed considerable damage from tropical cyclones, particularly in taller vegetation. All mangrove sites assessed were important reservoirs of carbon, with results when scaled to the spatial extent of mangroves in Fiji revealing that ecosystem carbon storage is disproportionate to area and equates to 73.3% of the carbon held within terrestrial rainforests, despite occupying just 7.3% of the total area. This underscores the importance of mangroves as valuable carbon sinks in Fiji and the need to develop incentives for improved conservation and restoration.

Anthropogenic and climate controls on vegetation changes between 1500 BCE and 500 CE reconstructed from a high-resolution pollen record from varved sediments of Lake Mondsee, Austria	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY			English	Article						European Alps; Lake sediments; Vegetation change; Archaeological cultures; Floods; Beech forest	HOLOCENE FLOOD FREQUENCY; LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; NORTH-ATLANTIC; EUROPEAN ALPS; HUMAN IMPACTS; HISTORY; VARIABILITY; SUIGETSU; DYNAMICS; BAIKAL	This study reports a precisely dated pollen record with a 20-year resolution from the varved sediments of Lake Mondsee in the north-eastern European Alps (47 degrees 49'N, 13 degrees 24'E, 481 m above sea level). The analysed part of core spans the interval between 1500 BCE and 500 CE and allows changes in vegetation composition in relation to climatic changes and human activities in the catchment to be inferred. Intervals of distinct but modest human impact are identified at ca. 1450-1220, 740-490 and 340-190 BCE and from 80 BCE to 180 CE. While the first two intervals are synchronous with prominent salt mining phases during the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age at the nearby UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hallstatt, the last two intervals fall within the Late Iron Age and Roman Imperial Era, respectively. Comparison with published records of extreme runoff events obtained from the same sediment core shows that human activities (including agriculture and logging) around Lake Mondsee were low during intervals of high flood frequency as indicated by a higher number of intercalated detrital event layers, but intensified during hydrologically stable intervals. Comparison of the pollen percentages of arboreal taxa with the stable oxygen isotope and potassium ion records of the NGRIP and GISP2 ice cores from Greenland reveals significant positive correlations for Fagus and negative correlations for Betula and Alnus. This underlines the sensitivity of vegetation around Lake Mondsee to temperature fluctuations in the North Atlantic as well as to moisture fluctuations controlled by changes in the intensity of the Siberian High and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) regime.

The formation of large supraglacial lakes poses risks for glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Therefore, it is important to monitor the movement of glaciers and to analyze their spatiotemporal characteristics. In this study we take Cuolangma glaciers in the central Himalayas as study targets, where glacier No.1 is a lake-terminating debris-covered glacier and glacier No.2 is a land-terminating debris-covered glacier. The 3D deformation time series is firstly estimated by using the Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subsets (PO-SBAS) based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets spanning from January to December 2018. Then the horizontal and vertical time series displacements are obtained to show their spatiotemporal features. The velocities of glacier No.1 in horizontal and vertical direction were up to 16.0 +/- 0.04 m/year and 3.4 +/- 0.42 m/year, respectively, and the ones of the glacier No.2 were 12.0 +/- 0.07 m/year and 2.0 +/- 0.27 m/year, respectively. Next, the correlation between the precipitation and the surface velocity suggests that the glacier velocity does not show a clear association with daily precipitation alone. Finally, the debris-covered glaciers evolution is evaluated which shows that the tongue of the glacier No.1 is wasting away and the transition of glacier No.2 from land-terminating to lake-terminating is a probable scenario in the later period of glacier wastage. This research can significantly serve for glacier multidimensional monitoring and the mitigation of hazardous disaster caused by debris-covered glaciers in the central Himalayas.

Floods increase carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in agricultural streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; greenhouse gases; land use; respiration; sediment	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; HEADWATER STREAMS; LAND-USE; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SURFACE WATERS; TECHNICAL NOTE; CO2; DYNAMICS	Changes in climate are causing floods to occur more often and more intensely in many parts of the world, including agricultural landscapes of southern Wisconsin (U.S.A.). How flooding and greater flood frequency affect stream carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes and concentrations is not obvious. Thus, we asked how diffusive fluxes of CO(2)and CH(4)varied over time, particularly in response to floods, in agricultural streams, and what were likely causes for observed flood responses. We measured concentrations and diffusive fluxes of CO(2)and CH(4)at 10 stream sites in mixed agricultural and suburban catchments in southern Wisconsin (U.S.A.) during the growing season (March-November) in a year that experienced multiple floods. Habitat, hydrologic, and water chemistry attributes were also quantified to determine likely drivers of changes in gas concentrations and fluxes. Habitat and water chemistry, as well as CO(2)and CH(4)concentrations and fluxes were temporally erratic and lacked any seasonality. Carbon dioxide and CH(4)concentrations and fluxes were higher during floods along with increased water velocity, turbidity, and dissolved organic carbon and decreases in dissolved oxygen, soft sediment depth, and macrophyte cover. Increased gas concentrations and fluxes were probably due to flushing of gases from soils, respiration of organic matter in the channel, and increased gas exchange velocities during floods. Flooding alleviated both supply and transfer limits on CO(2)and CH(4)emissions in these agricultural streams, and frequent and prolonged flooding during the growing season led to sustained high emissions from these streams. We hypothesise that such persistent increases in emissions during floods may be a common response to high precipitation periods for many agricultural streams.

Changes in runoff and sediment load of the Huangfuchuan River following a water and soil conservation project	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						flood season; runoff; sediment composition; sediment load	LOESS PLATEAU; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YELLOW-RIVER; LAND-USE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; VEGETATION TYPES; DRIVING FORCES; MIDDLE REACHES; EROSION; STREAMFLOW	In this study, we analyzed changes in the water and sediment properties in the Yellow River during the flood season, which is the period with the largest runoff yield and sediment load in this river.The aim of this study was to understand the impact of water and soil conservation measures during this crucial season, and we focused on the Huangfuchuan drainage basin as the study region. We analyzed factors including the precipitation, runoff and sediment yield, and suspended sediment grain-size distribution during each of the flood seasons in 1986 to 1990 (P1) and 2006 to 2010 (P2).The results showed that most of the precipitation during the flood season was concentrated in the southeastern part of the basin.The mean flood season precipitation was similar in the two periods, with 260.1 mm and 256.9 nun in P1 and P2, respectively, but the frequency of floods in the basin decreased by 59.4% during P2. Compared with P1, the mean flood volume, sediment load, and duration during P2 decreased by 52.17%, 68.57%, and 1.52%, respectively.The composition of the sediments in the Huangfuchuan drainage basin was dominated by the presence of silts, which represented 61.2% and 96.6% of the total sediments in P1 and P2, respectively. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the water and sediment conditions in the Huangfuchuan drainage basin during the flood season have improved over time, with a more homogeneous suspended sediment composition, more concentrated water and sediment processes, and decreases in the flood frequency, volume, and sediment transport. Our results indicate the effectiveness of river basin regulation, and they may be used as a reference for treatment of the main sediment production areas in the Yellow River.	[Xie, M.

In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of beaver dam building in relation to surface water dynamics and thermokarst landforms using sub-meter resolution satellite imagery acquired between 2002 and 2019 for two tundra areas in northwestern Alaska. In a 100 km(2)study area near Kotzebue, the number of dams increased markedly from 2 to 98 between 2002 and 2019. In a 430 km(2)study area encompassing the entire northern Baldwin Peninsula, the number of dams increased from 94 to 409 between 2010 and 2019, indicating a regional trend. Correlating data on beaver dam numbers with surface water area mapped for 12 individual years between 2002 and 2019 for the Kotzebue study area showed a significant positive correlation (R-2= 0.61; p < .003). Beaver-influenced waterbodies accounted for two-thirds of the 8.3% increase in total surface water area in the Kotzebue study area during the 17 year period. Beavers specifically targeted thermokarst landforms in their dam building activities. Flooding of drained thermokarst lake basins accounted for 68% of beaver-influenced surface water increases, damming of lake outlets accounted for 26%, and damming of beaded streams accounted for 6%. Surface water increases resulting from beaver dam building likely exacerbated permafrost degradation in the region, but dam failure also factored into the drainage of several thermokarst lakes in the northern Baldwin Peninsula study region, which could promote local permafrost aggradation in freshly exposed lake sediments. Our findings highlight that beaver-driven ecosystem engineering must be carefully considered when accounting for changes occurring in some permafrost regions, and in particular, regional surface water dynamics in low Arctic and Boreal landscapes.

Salt Marsh Migration Potential at Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA) in Response to Sea-Level Rise	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; transgression; flooding; coastal	SURFACE ELEVATION; ATLANTIC COAST; TIDAL MARSH; LANDWARD MIGRATION; VEGETATION CHANGE; BARRIER-BEACH; FOREST; IMPACT; ISLAND; VARIABILITY	Salt marshes can adjust to sea-level rise (SLR) through vertical elevation gain and horizontal expansion into terrestrial environments. The latter depends on the topography of adjacent uplands and the availability of suitable substrate for halophyte colonization. Within Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS), calculations of marsh migration potential in response to 1-m of SLR were completed using ArcGIS (version 10.4) based on real-time kinematic GPS marsh elevations, local tide data, land-use, and upland topography derived from 2011 LIDAR scans of CCNS. These estimates were combined with marsh-loss predictions from a previous study within their present-day footprint under the same SLR scenario. The results suggest that individual marshes will respond quite disparately, as dictated by their position in the tidal frame, adjacent terrestrial slopes, land-use, and barrier-beach losses. Most sites are expected to gain or lose relatively small amounts of marsh area under few or no migration constraints. However, there could be a large increase (similar to 144-240 ha) at one site and an almost a complete loss at another (similar to 260-290 ha). Where migration was constrained to slopes <= 1%, opportunities for marsh expansion diminished the most-even more so when barrier-beach losses are simulated. Overall, losses at five marsh sites were offset by gains at Hatches Harbor and Pleasant Bay, Massachusetts, such that the total area of salt marsh actually increases with 1-m of SLR, except under the strictest slope constraints. Changes in the spatial distribution and total extent of salt marsh within the CCNS will influence both the quality and quantity of ecosystem services they provide. For coastal land managers, understanding the potential for overland marsh migration is critical for the kind of land-use planning that accommodates these transitioning salt marshes.

J	Ostrowski, P; Falkowski, T				Ostrowski, Piotr; Falkowski, Tomasz			Application of Remote Sensing Methods to Study the Relief of Lowland River Valleys with a Complex Geological Structure-A Case Study of the Bug River	WATER			English	Article						floodplain; landforms; close-range remote sensing; airborne laser scanning (ALS); bathymetric mapping; sub-alluvial bedrock; Bug River valley	FLUVIAL GEOMORPHOLOGY; CHANNEL; FLOODPLAIN; FLOW; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; VEGETATION; RESPONSES; STATE; BED	River valleys of the Central European Lowlands are the zones of the highest dynamics of morphogenic processes. In the case of areas affected by glacial processes, despite their lowland nature, often they also have a complex geological structure. Sub-alluvial bedrock, composed of erosion-resistant deposits, commonly forms morphological protrusions within them. Their presence significantly affects both the course of flood flows and the valley floor relief. Effective forecasting of fluvial processes in such valley reaches requires conducting research within the entire geomorphologically active zone, both in the channel and the floodplain. The effectiveness of such research should be enhanced by simultaneous use of several different remote sensing methods, including short-range remote sensing. The verification of this hypothesis was the aim of the presented works. Such methods were used in the study of morphodynamics of a Bug valley reach. This area is characterized by a complex geological structure. High-resolution multispectral satellite images (VHRs) and a digital elevation model (DEM) based on aerial laser scanning (ALS) were used to examine the terrain relief. The morphology of the river channel itself was determined based on a series of bathymetric measurements made by a research team. Due to induced climate change and increasing maximum flow values, it can be assumed that the effect of a geological structure in the Central European Lowlands will play an increasing role. The threat and losses associated with floods will also increase. Rational flood prevention requires improvement of remote sensing research methods in lowland river valleys, especially those with complex geological structures. The valley reach presented in this article is an example of such a landform.

J	Azizian, A; Brocca, L				Azizian, Asghar; Brocca, Luca			Determining the best remotely sensed DEM for flood inundation mapping in data sparse regions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; TOPOGRAPHIC DATA; ASTER-GDEM; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; 30-M RESOLUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SRTM; RIVER; VALIDATION; IMPACT	One of the most essential inputs in flood inundation mapping is the geometric description of the floodplains and river channel that often derives from the digital elevation models (DEMs). By increasing the satellite-based technologies during the past 30 years, several DEM sources ranging from fine-resolution and accurate, but costly, to low-cost and low-resolution have been developed. In most parts of the world, especially developing countries and data sparse regions, the coarse resolution DEMs is the only available data set for hydraulic modelling and flood inundation mapping. This research addressed the usefulness and efficiency of the recently released Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) DEM in flood inundation mapping using 1D Hydrologic Engineering Centre- River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model. In addition, other DEM sources such as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM-90 m), SRTM-30 m, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER-30 m) are used to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of remotely sensed DEMs for flood inundation mapping. Findings indicate that using ALOS-30m for hydraulic simulation approximately leads to the similar results as well as ground-based DEM (GDEM). For example, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in simulating mean Water Surface Elevation (WSE) and mean inundated extents based on this dataset, within the cross-sections, is lower than 8% and 13% for SojasRood river, respectively, while for Sarbaz river these values are 9% and 2%. Moreover, in both rivers, SRTM-30 m relative to ASTER-30 m and SRTM-90 m DEMs presents better results in deriving the geometric model and hydraulic simulation. Also, Hydraulic modelling based on ASTER-30 m, even relative to SRTM-90 m as a coarser resolution DEM, shows a significant discrepancy compared to GDEM. Moreover, in both rivers, the MAPE in predicting inundated extents, within the reaches, is higher than 38%.

However, actually AMFS are frequently generated by distinct flood generation mechanisms (FGMs), which are controlled by the interaction between different meteorological triggers (e.g., thunderstorms, typhoon, snowmelt) and properties of underlying surface (e.g., antecedent soil moisture and land-cover types). To consider the possibility of two FGMs in flood frequency analysis, researchers often use the two-component mixture distributions (TCMD) without explicitly linking each component distribution to a particular FGM. To improve the mixture distribution modeling in seasonally snow covered regions, an index called flood timescale (FT), defined as the ratio of the flood volume to peak value and chosen to reflect the relevant FGM, is employed to classify each flood into one of two types, i.e., the snowmelt-induced long duration floods and the rainfall-induced short-duration floods, thus identifying the weighting coefficient of each component distribution beforehand. In applying the FT-based TCMD to model the AMPS of 34 watersheds in Norway, ten types of mixture distributions are considered. The design floods and associated confidence intervals are calculated using parametric bootstrap method. The results indicate that the FT-based TCMD model reduces the uncertainty in the estimation of design floods for high return periods by up to 40% with respect to the traditional TCMD. The improved predictive ability of the FT-based TCMD model is attributed to its explicit recognition of distinct generation mechanisms of floods, thereby being able to identify the weighting coefficient and FGM of each component distribution without optimization.

Cooperation on water resources has been determined as one of the key priority areas in the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism, but there are no details of targets. In order to establish the priorities of water cooperation under the mechanism, we adopted nine categories to classify the objectives of 87 water cooperation events based on the Lancang-Mekong Water Cooperative Events Database' from 1995 to 2015. Based on the occurrence of cooperative events, cooperative objectives, cooperative scales, and approaches to cooperation, we conducted statistical, correlation, and text analyses. Our analyses indicated the following results: under the impact of economic conditions inside and outside the river basin, full cooperation appeared more difficult than bilateral and multilateral cooperation. Each of the partners adopted different preferences for cooperation targets. Cooperation with more definite objectives was easier to establish than cooperation with broader and more complex objectives. The potential objectives for water cooperation were navigation, hydropower, joint management, data sharing, flood control and water use. Because hydropower development is controversial, and because water cooperation is avoided by most existing regional cooperation mechanisms due to its complexity, we suggest the following priority areas for water cooperation in the Lancang- Mekong River Basin. 1) Navigation and flood control/drought relief are attractive objectives for all the riparian countries across the whole watershed. 2) Data sharing should be a priority for cooperation in the watershed due to its laying the foundation for the equitable and reasonable utilization of transboundary waters. 3) Hydropower is an objective best implemented mainly through bilateral cooperation, and on tributaries.

A global meta-analysis of rice experimental data was conducted to assess changes in emissions of GHGs (CH4 and N2O) and global warming potential (GWP) in response to improvements through 12 field management practices. The results indicated that changes in GWP were mainly attributed to CH4 emission even though N2O emission was significantly affected by conversion of field management practices. Specifically, GWP per unit rice plant area (area-scaled) was significantly increased by 20.1%, 66.2%, and 84.5% with nitrogen (N) fertilizer input, manuring, and residue retention (P < 0.05), along with significant increments in area-scaled CH4 emission under the above management practices by 8.9%, 60.4%, and 91.8%, respectively (P< 0.05). Due to the significant increase in rice yield, a decreasing trend for GWP per unit rice yield (yield-scaled) was observed with N fertilizer input. In addition, CH4 and GWP decreased significantly at both area- and yield-scale under non-flooding irrigation but with a reduction in rice yield by 3.3% (P < 0.05). Improvement in rice variety significantly enhanced crop yield by 15.3% while reducing area-scaled GWP by 27.7% (P< 0.05). Furthermore, other management practices, such as application of herbicides, biochar, and amendments (non-fertilizer materials) reduced yield-scaled GWP while increasing rice yield. Thus, changes in field management practices have the potential to balance the trade-offs between high yield and low emission of GHGs. However, in-depth studies are needed to determine the interactions between field management practices and site-specific soil/climate conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The costly and less environmentally friendly grey infrastructure is not always the most adequate solution to resolve urban pluvial flooding issues. The combination of grey and blue-green infrastructures, also called hybrid infrastructure, has been considered a promising solution for urban stormwater management. Existing approaches for identifying suitable hybrid solutions frequently rely on global multi-objective optimization algorithms. We developed a pre-screening method that decomposes a drainage network into clusters of pipes connected to sub-catchments, based on pipe hydraulic characteristic that allows for the impact of infrastructure combinations (blue-green and grey) to be mapped. Four impact matrices are proposed to map the total, local, upstream, and downstream flood reduction of all possible blue-green, grey, and hybrid solutions. Using an urban catchment in Guangzhou (China) as a case study, results showed that such an exercise could identify prime candidate locations for blue-green and grey infrastructure while filtering out ineffective locations for flood reduction. Furthermore, the impact matrices enabled the identification of flood zones where blue-green infrastructure could handle flood mitigation without the need of local grey infrastructure upgrades. As such, they are not only useful for quick screening of suitable interventions for each flooded zone, but can also potentially serve as a priori knowledge before diving into the data and computationally expensive process of finding the most effective flood mitigation solutions.

River low flows constrain transport and water supply for agriculture, industry and society, and flood events are known to cause material damage and human loss. However, under-standing changes in the frequency and magnitude of hydrological extremes is associated with great uncertainty due to the limited number of gauge observations. Here, we compile a tree-ring network to reconstruct the July-September baseflow variability of the Morava River from 1745 to 2018 CE. An ensemble of reconstructions was produced to assess the impact of calibration period length and trend on the long-term mean of reconstruction estimates. The final estimates represent the first baseflow reconstruction based on tree rings from the European continent. Simulated flows and historical documentation provide quantitative and qualitative validation of estimates prior to the 20th century. New hydrological insights for theregion: The reconstructions indicate an increased variability of warm-season flow during the past 100 years, with the most extreme high and low flows occurring after the start of instrumental observations. When analyzing the entire reconstruction, the negative trend in baseflow displayed by gauges across the basin after 1960 is not unprecedented. We conjecture that even lower flows could likely occur in the future considering that preinstrumental trends were not primarily driven by rising temperature (and the evaporative demand) in contrast to the recent trends.

Employing stochastic frontier analysis (SFA), the research estimates the technical efficiency in rice production of 2394 farmers from the 2018 Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) dataset. The findings indicate that the average technical efficiency of rice production among these farmers is 78.99%. Exposure to natural disasters and pest infestations leads farmers to reduce their investments in rice production, resulting in decreased technical efficiency, lower yields, and reduced profitability. Among the various disasters, droughts have the most significant adverse impact on technical efficiency in rice production. The results highlight the limited capacity of farmers to cope with the challenges posed by natural disasters in rice production. The study emphasizes the importance of providing timely support to farmers, fostering resilience within the context of rice farming, and enhancing agricultural sustainability in Vietnam. To address these challenges effectively, policymakers are advised to prioritize facilitating farmers' access to agricultural insurance. Additionally, encouraging income diversification among farmers becomes crucial to ensuring provisions in the case of income loss from rice production due to natural disasters or pest infestations. Moreover, measures such as promoting climate-smart agricultural practices, improving water management infrastructure, establishing early warning systems, and emphasizing pest and disease control measures can be implemented to mitigate losses resulting from natural disasters and pest infestations.

Floodplain Management in North Carolina	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION			English	Article							LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION; COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; DAMAGE; FLOODS; POLICY; LEVEL	Problem, research strategy, and findingsLimiting housing and infrastructure in flood-prone places has long been recognized as critical to managing long-term risk. However, due to the difficulty of tracking development at small spatial scales, little empirical research has been conducted to explain differences between communities' floodplain development patterns. We analyzed new construction across 5 million parcels in the state of North Carolina to develop standardized measures of floodplain development and evaluated the relationships between flood risk management effort and development outcomes. Statewide, for every property removed through buyouts from 1996 to 2017, more than 10 new residences were built in floodplains. At the community level, indicators of flood risk management effort (participation in the Community Rating System and use of buyouts) did not consistently align with floodplain development outcomes. Based on a sample of urban and suburban counties, we found more than 75,000 acres of vacant floodplain land currently zoned for development. Although we did not capture the full range of flood risk mitigation practices, results indicate that local development policies often run counter to efforts to limit long-term risk.Takeaway for practiceLand use planning and floodplain management have the potential to play a larger role in flood risk mitigation. Modifying federal programs to more strongly disincentivize floodplain development could enhance local regulation and minimize future flood exposure. Given extensive undeveloped floodplain land and projected climate change, additional effort to manage development is needed to limit increases in flood risk.Keywordsclimate change adaptation, flood risk, natural hazards	[Hino, Miyuki; BenDor, Todd K.

Impact of precipitation and evaporation change on flood runoff over Lake Baikal catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Lake Baikal catchment; Floods; River flow changes; Water balance; Precipitation	LEVEL REGIME; WATER; VARIABILITY; PERMAFROST; PHOSPHORUS; GENERATION; SEDIMENT; MOISTURE	This paper addresses the nexus of climate change and variability, soil moisture and surface runoff over the Lake Baikal catchment. Water level and distribution of dissolved and suspended matter over Lake Baikal are strongly affected by river inflow during rain-driven floods. In this study, we evaluate river flow changes at 44 streamflow gauges as well as related precipitation, evaporation, potential evaporation and soil moisture obtained from the ERA5-Land dataset. Based on Sen's slope trend estimator, Mann-Kendall non-parametric test, and using dominance analysis, we estimated the influence of meteorological parameters on river flow during 1979-2019. We found a significant correlation between the precipitation elasticity of river flow and catchment characteristics. Half of the gauges in the eastern part of the Selenga River basin showed a significant decreasing trend of average and maximum river flow (up to -2.9%/year). No changes in the central volume date of flood flow have been found. The reduction in rainfall amount explains more than 60% of runoff decrease. A decrease in evaporation is observed in areas where precipitation decrease is higher than 0.8%/year. Catchments, where the precipitation trends are not as substantial, are associated with increasing evaporation as a result of the increasing potential evaporation. Negative precipitation trends are accompanied by negative trends of soil moisture. Finally, the study reveals the sensitivity of catchments with steep slopes located in humid areas to precipitation change.

Here, vegetation cover and composition were monitored using 30 permanent plots along transects through 8 years (2012-2019) FWS program in central Iran's sandy clay loam soil. Vegetation evaluation was performed annually. At the end of the experiment, soil sampling was performed from the plots to study soil-vegetation relationships using principal component analysis (PCA). An area adjacent to the FWS area was also considered as a control. Based on the results, the FWS significantly changed the vegetation characteristics and improved some valuable species. The largest changes in vegetation occurred during 3-4 years of FWS. Cover and density of perennial species increased by 240% and by 144%, respectively. Also, cover and density of annual species showed a decrease of 23% and 46%, respectively after 8 years. Moreover, the cover and density of the forbs increased, while cover and density of the grasses decreased. Shannon richness and Margalef diversity indices increased in first 4-5 years and then showed a decrease during the last three years of FWS program. Based on the PCA results, clay, organic matter, soil moisture, saturation percent, porosity were correlated with cover/density/biomass of plant species after 8 years FWS program. Overall flood spreading caused changes in vegetation development, and managers should be aware of the greater undesirable change in vegetation in future as a result of continuing FWS.

However, weather prediction remains an imperfect science, and as such, it is not unusual for meteorologists to prioritize accuracy over consistency or vice versa. There is considerable debate within the literature about whether (and how) inaccuracies and/or inconsistencies in forecasting will affect end-user trust in future warnings. Hurricane Dorian presented the opportunity to explore the intersection between these concepts as its messaging was at times both inaccurate (e.g., then-President Donald J. Trump indicated the storm would directly affect the state of Alabama) and inconsistent (i.e., both the storm's forecasted intensity and track changed over time). Two research projects were undertaken in Atlantic Canada: the first utilized semi-structured interviews to examine the ways that ECCC meteorologists (n = 6) perceived the needs of their end-users during the storm. There was considerable concern that changes in the storm's forecasted track and intensity would negatively influence public response. The second project utilized a large sample questionnaire (n = 1218) to examine ways that end-users searched for, shared, and responded to storm-related information. Despite changes in the storm's track and intensity as it approached Atlantic Canada, as well as the international news coverage of Sharpiegate, respondents overwhelmingly agreed that the storm was well forecasted and its impacts were well predicted. The implications for this (seemingly) contradictory response are explored in the context of probabilistic forecast potential.

In recent decades, China has experienced more frequent natural disasters as a result of climate change. Although the spatial and temporal changes in natural disasters for individual catastrophic activities are well understood, the impact of several disasters on cereal crop productivity and subsequent quality loss remains unknown. Furthermore, due to the key significance of cereal in China's daily diet, a decrease in cereal quality, namely protein, will have a detrimental effect on nutrient supply. To better understand the relationship between natural disasters and cereal crop food quality in China, we used province-level data from 1988 to 2020 to construct a dataset of natural disasters, crop production, and protein contents of cereal crops (rice, wheat, and maize). Our findings suggest that activities in areas affected by natural disasters have decreased dramatically since the 21st century, with changes in areas affected by such disasters varying by province. Between 1988 and 2020, the total protein losses from grain and straw harvests due to natural disasters were 11.93 and 391.27 million tons. Overall, the annual mean total protein loss in maize, rice, and wheat was 4,982.26, 5,055.4, and 4,200.34 thousand tons, respectively. Although was responsible for half of the protein losses in more than half of the provinces. Drought and floods accounted for 80% of the total area affected by all natural disasters.

This study aimed to investigate the influencing mechanisms of flooding on C:N:P stoichiometry in different terrestrial ecosystems, which mainly focused on abiotic factors and their linkages with biotic factors. A global meta-analysis of 69 published studies (885 paired observations) was conducted to examine the effects of flooding on the C:N:P stoichiometry of plants, soil and microorganisms in different terrestrial ecosystems. The collected data included broad variations in climate parameters and flooding durations. Flooding was found to significantly elevat the C and N contents of the whole ecosystem. The responses of overall (across plant-soil-microorganism) C, N and P contents to flooding were pronounced among different ecosystem types or components. Flooding markedly increased the ratios of overall C:N, C:P and N:P ratios by 9.7%, 20.1% and 7.4%, respectively. Flooding with a short duration elevated the overall C:P ratio more than C:N and N:P ratios. Flooding regulated the ecosystem components of C and N, with both elements were also being affected by duration times and climate parameters to some extent. These results provide new insights into understanding the impacts of extreme climate events on ecosystem nutrient turnover under the circumstance of global climate change.

Soils will be among the most affected components of terrestrial ecosystems, especially in contaminated areas. In this study we investigated if changes in climate conditions (air temperature and soil moisture) affect the toxicity of historically metal(loid)contaminated soils to the invertebrate Folsomia candida, followed by an assessment of its recovery capacity. Ecotoxicity tests (assessing survival, reproduction) were performed in field soils affected by metal(loid)s under different climate scenarios, simulated by individually changing air temperature or soil moisture conditions. The scenarios tested were: standard conditions (20C + 50% soil water holding capacity-WHC); increased air temperature (daily fluctuation of 20-30C + 50% WHC); soil drought (20C + 25% WHC); soil flood (20C + 75% WHC). Recovery potential was assessed under standard conditions in clean soil. Increased temperature was the major climate condition negatively affecting collembolans performance (decreased survival and reproduction), regardless of metal(loid) contamination. Drought and flood conditions presented less pronounced effects. When it was possible to move to the recovery phase (enough juveniles in exposure phase), F. candida was apparently able to recover from the exposure to metal(loid) contamination and/or climate alterations. The present study showed that forecasted climate alterations in areas already affected by contamination should be considered to improve environmental risk assessment.

With climate change and growing urbanisation, floods are expected to become more frequent and severe in the future. Hydrodynamic models are powerful tools for flood hazard assessment but face numerous challenges, especially when operating at a large scale. The downside of discretising an area using a fine mesh yielding more accurate results, is the expensive computational cost of simulations. Moreover, critical input information such as bathymetry (i.e, riverbed geometry) are required but cannot be easily collected by field measurements or remote sensing observations. During the past few years, the development of sub grid models has gained a growing interest as these enable faster simulations by using coarser cells and, at the same time, preserve small-scale topography variations within the cell. In this study, we propose and evaluate a modelling framework based on the shallow water 2D model with depth-dependent porosity enabling to represent floodplain and riverbed topography through porosity functions. To enable a careful and meaningful evaluation of the model, we set up a 2D classical model and use it as a benchmark. We also exploit ground truth data and remote sensing derived flood inundation maps to evaluate the proposed modelling framework and use as test cases the 2007 and 2012 flood events of the river Severn. Our empirical results demonstrate a high performance and low computational cost of the proposed model for fast flood simulations at a large scale.

BP based on a radiocarbon-dated sediment stratigraphy of Lago di Vedana. This age fosters the importance of hydroclimatic triggers in the light of accelerating global warming with a predicted increase of precipitation enhancing the regional predisposition to large landslides. Moreover, a layer enriched in allochthonous organic and minerogenic detritus dating to the same wet period is interpreted as response to a younger and yet unidentified mass wasting event in the catchment of Lago di Vedana. Rock debris of the Monte Peron Landslide impounded the Cordevole River valley and created a landslide-dammed lake. Around AD 1150, eutrophication of this lacustrine ecosystem started with intensified human occupation - a process that ended 150 years later, when the river was diverted back into its original bed. Most likely, this occurred due to artificial opening of the river dam. In consequence, Lago di Vedana was isolated from an open and minerogenic to an endorheic and carbonaceous lacustrine system. After a monastery was established nearby in AD 1457, a second eutrophication process was initiated due to intensified land use linked with deforestation. Only in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, deposition of organic matter decreased coinciding with climatic (Little Ice Age) and cultural changes. Conversational measures are the likely reasons for a trend towards less eutrophic conditions since AD 1950.

China and Southeast Asia are the most populous areas in the world, and their water resources are deteriorating day by day. We focus on five representative cities such as, Beijing, Jakarta, Hanoi, Kathmandu and Manila to investigate water-environmental problems with the ultimate goal of providing recommendations for sustainable urban water management. The study found that (1) the water environment of all cities has been polluted to varying levels, while the pollution has improved in Beijing and Jakarta, and the situation in other regions is severe. (2) The aquatic biodiversity has reduced, and its pollution is mainly caused by organic pollutants and decreasing river flow. In addition, numerous people live in megacities without access to clean surface water or piped drinking water, which greatly increases the use of groundwater. Further, frequent floods in the world leads to serious damage to urban infrastructure and further deterioration of water environment quality. To address these problems, countries and organizations have begun to construct wastewater treatment plants and develop water-saving technology to ensure healthy and sustainable development of water environment. The results and practical recommendations of this study can provide scientific insights for future research and management strategies to address water quality challenges during ongoing policy debates and decision-making processes.

J	Mallik, P; Ghosh, T				Mallik, Piyashee; Ghosh, Tuhin			Impact of climate on tea production: a study of the Dooars region in India	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							CHANGE PROJECTIONS; MODELS; RELIABILITY; YIELD	The Dooars region of West Bengal in India is a major tea producing region that contributes around 25% of the national tea yield. Changes in weather patterns along with the increased frequency of drought, storms, flood, etc. are likely to affect the tea industry adversely as tea production is reliant on the climate of the tea-growing region. In spite of the tea industry being the primary contributor of the Dooars economy, to date, the impact of climatic variables on tea yield in Dooars region remains unexplored. Here, we have developed a panel dataset that includes monthly data of the tea gardens of Dooars region over a 10-year period and statistically analysed the effects of climatic variables including temperature, precipitation, drought intensity, magnitude of warm-wet condition and precipitation intensity on tea yield. Overall, our seasonal analysis suggested that higher temperature during summer and monsoon seasons affected tea yield. Contrastingly, higher temperature during winter months and summer and winter rainfall were found to be beneficial for the increase in tea yield. An excessive and sporadic rainfall and a combination of hotter and wetter weather condition during monsoon months had a detrimental effect on tea yield. Finally, projections using climate models under different emission scenario predicted reduction of monsoon production under extreme carbon emission. The analyses and predictions of our study will be beneficial for tea garden managers of Dooars region in particular and northern India in general in adopting strategies to prevent the tea plantations from being affected due to climate change.

J	Zisopoulou, K; Panagoulia, D				Zisopoulou, Kalomoira; Panagoulia, Dionysia			An In-Depth Analysis of Physical Blue and Green Water Scarcity in Agriculture in Terms of Causes and Events and Perceived Amenability to Economic Interpretation	WATER			English	Article						blue water; green water; scarcity; climate; water availability; inadequate water accessibility; climate uncertainty; land use land cover change; population	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; LAND-USE CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION EVENTS; GROUNDWATER LEVEL RESPONSE; FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; NORTH-AMERICAN; GLOBAL CLIMATE; RIVER-BASIN; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; PLANETARY BOUNDARIES	An analytical review of physical blue and green water scarcity in terms of agricultural use, and its amenability to economic interpretation, is presented, employing more than 600 references. The main definitions and classifications involved and information about reserves and resources are critically analyzed, blue and green water scarcity are examined along with their interchange, while their causal connection with climate in general is analyzed along with the particular instances of Europe, Africa, Asia and the WANA region. The role of teleconnections and evaporation/moisture import-export is examined as forms of action at a distance. The human intervention scarcity driver is examined extensively in terms of land use land cover change (LULCC), as well as population increase. The discussion deals with following critical problems: green and blue water availability, inadequate accessibility, blue water loss, unevenly distributed precipitation, climate uncertainty and country level over global level precedence. The conclusion singles out, among others, problems emerging from the inter-relationship of physical variables and the difficulty to translate them into economic instrumental variables, as well as the lack of imbedding uncertainty in the underlying physical theory due to the fact that country level measurements are not methodically assumed to be the basic building block of regional and global water scarcity.

During our palaeo-hydrological investigations, two units of palaeoflood slackwater deposits (SWD) were found on the river banks in the Maqu-Oula reach along the mainstream of the Yellow River on the northeast (NE) Tibetan Plateau. A series of samples were taken from the sediment profiles at Taiwuruo (TWR) and Daerqiong (DEQ) sites for laboratory analysis. Grain-size distribution and micro-morphological characteristics of quartz grains indicate that these well-sorted SWD units were derived from the suspended sediment load in floodwater. They have recorded two episodes of overbank flooding in the Yellow River source area. Using the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating technique, the first episode of overbank flooding was dated to 13.6-13.0 ka and correlated with the Bolling-Allerod warm interval of the last deglaciation. The second episode occurred at 11.0-10.0 ka, that is, the early Holocene. In a warm-humid climate, these overbank flooding episodes may have resulted from the accelerated melting of mountain glaciers and snow over the headwaters of the alpine and subalpine regions on the NE Tibetan Plateau. These results are important in facilitating an in-depth understanding of the hydro-climatic response of the Tibetan Plateau to global climate warming occurring presently.

Lateral sediment erosion with and without the non-dense root-mat forming seagrass <i>Enhalus</i> <i>acoroides</i>	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Coastal erosion; Coastal defence; Root systems; Seagrass; Enhalus acoroides; Ecosystem services	WAVE ATTENUATION; SALT MARSHES; VEGETATION; MANAGEMENT; RETENTION; ACCRETION; MEADOWS; GRASS; SCALE; ZONE	Coastal areas are at increasing risk from flooding and erosion due to coastal development and climate change. Seagrass meadows, like other coastal ecosystems, can stabilise sediments, indirectly reducing coastal erosion. There is evidence that seagrass can reduce both the erosion of seabeds and lateral erosion of seagrass cliffs. However, these previous studies have only considered seagrass species whose below-ground biomass form dense root mats. This study aimed to investigate whether Enhalus acoroides, a species which does not form root mats, reduces lateral erosion rates of seagrass cliffs. To do this, samples of E. acoroides collected in sandy sediments within Xincun Bay China were transplanted into a wave flume. Lateral erosion rates were measured under exposure to waves for five cliff heights over 1 h. There was an interaction between cliff height and time on the rate of erosion, with higher erosion rates earlier in the experiment for larger cliff heights. The cores with the E. acoroides persisted longer than unvegetated cores, regardless of cliff height, but this result was not assessed statistically due to constraints in the analyses. The below-ground biomass of E. acoroides samples in this study was higher than values previously reported in the literature. Overall, these results suggest that non-dense root-mat forming seagrass species may not provide equivalent sediment stabilisation as dense root-mat-forming species, likely due to the reduced binding structure of the roots in species such as Enhalus.

Flood and drought have been increasing due to global climate changes and these extreme water-related events often affect crop productions globally. This study aims to develop a growth simulation model that correspond to sequential soil water status by revealing morph-physiological related responses on the chili pepper (Capsicum spp.). Two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse and nine treatments were established between dry and waterlogged soil conditions by using a slope field with sand. Results showed leaf water potential and stomatal conductance decreased with increasing soil water stress level. On the other hand, chili pepper increased total chlorophyll content and decreased chlorophyll a/b ratio to compensate the redaction of the leaf area as a response to soil water stress. Moreover, high air vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation condition influenced their morph-physiological traits as environmental stress coupled with soil water stress. A multiple regression model for estimating shoot dry weight (SDW) using plant height (PH) and soil plant analysis development (SPAD) was developed (SDW = 0.131 PH + 0.047SPAD - 2.408). It showed a high coefficient of determination (R-adj(2) = 0.836). This model is certainly useful for estimating SDW under wide range soil water statuses and vapor pressure deficit conditions.

Sensing Earth and environment dynamics by telecommunication fiber-optic sensors: an urban experiment in Pennsylvania, USA	SOLID EARTH			English	Article							INVERSION	Continuous seismic monitoring of the Earth's near surface (top 100 m), especially with improved resolution and extent of data both in space and time, would yield more accurate insights about the effect of extreme-weather events (e.g., flooding or drought) and climate change on the Earth's surface and subsurface systems. However, continuous long-term seismic monitoring, especially in urban areas, remains challenging. We describe the Fiber Optic foR Environmental SEnsEing (FORESEE) project in Pennsylvania, USA, the first continuous-monitoring distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber array in the eastern USA. This array is made up of nearly 5 km of pre-existing dark telecommunication fiber underneath the Pennsylvania State University campus. A major thrust of this experiment is the study of urban geohazard and hydrological systems through near-surface seismic monitoring. Here we detail the FORESEE experiment deployment and instrument calibration, and describe multiple observations of seismic sources in the first year. We calibrate the array by comparison to earthquake data from a nearby seismometer and to active-source geophone data. We observed a wide variety of seismic signatures in our DAS recordings: natural events (earthquakes and thunderstorms) and anthropogenic events (mining blasts, vehicles, music concerts and walking steps). Preliminary analysis of these signals suggests DAS has the capability to sense broadband vibrations and discriminate between seismic signatures of different quakes and anthropogenic sources. With the success of collecting 1 year of continuous DAS recordings, we conclude that DAS along with telecommunication fiber will potentially serve the purpose of continuous near-surface seismic monitoring in populated areas.

Vested Interest Theory may contribute to this knowledge base, suggesting that one's vested interest may significantly influence appropriate coping behaviors, as it is has been shown to enhance the relation between attitudes and self-relevant behaviors. The theory's utility is investigated in an environmental risk context. Here, we replicate previous research findings showing that citizens in high-risk areas perceived higher risk and stronger intentions to cope with it when vested interest perceptions were salient. Furthermore, the current studies investigate the behavioral effect of vested interest on coping with an environmental risk (flooding): results showed that vested interest significantly mediated the past experience-coping behaviors relationship. In Study 1's mediation analysis (Rome and Vibo Valentia, Italy, N = 466), past experience of flood risk enhanced vested interest in flood risk, which in turn increased volunteering for flood prevention activities, thereby mitigating risk. In Study 2 (N = 391), the same mediation effect was replicated in the Timis region, a high flood risk area in western Romania. These results shed light on literature inconsistencies on this topic, providing insights for the theoretical understanding of the relationship between past experience of a given risk and related coping behaviors, possibly shedding light to the risk perception paradox. These insights may drive effective intervention strategies to enhance people's behavioral coping with environmental risks.

The Yangtze River Basin is a region with frequent meteorological disasters and is affected by south-east and south-west monsoons. With a dense population, the economy in the middle and lower reaches of the basin has rapidly developed, and the agricultural economy has made significant contributions to China. Therefore, it is of far-reaching significance to study the influence of meteorological disasters in the Yangtze River Basin. Using information diffusion theory, this research analyses the impacts of five frequent natural disasters (floods, drought, convective storms, low temperatures, and typhoons) on selected areas from 2001 to 2006 (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Chongqing, Sichuan, Yunnan, Tibet, and Qinghai). Three agricultural indicators: affected area (A), covered area (C), and demolished area (D), are adopted to illustrate the economic losses caused by natural disasters. The method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework is used to calculate the weights of the five disaster categories. The results are that Shanghai is severely affected by typhoons; Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Chongqing, Tibet, and Hunan are under the highest pressure of floods; Yunnan and Qinghai are under the strongest influence of droughts. Generally, agriculture production in the Yangtze River Basin is greatly affected by flood and drought disasters. Finally, some suggestions for dealing with meteorological disasters are proposed.

Hundreds of thousands of people and their homes were affected by mass floods in 2016 and 2017. However, the quantification of social vulnerability to such calamities has not been examined, although this is critical to achieve more efficient response and recovery. In this context, we shed light on an influential mechanism in order to measure social vulnerability to flooding in both rural and urban areas. We developed the multi-facet composite social vulnerability index (MFCSVI) by considering 31 robust variables drawn from five main components including sociodemographic, physical, financial, health, and social networks, as well as related social capital factors. We investigated 21 local administrative units by covering 405 affected households through a household survey. The results demonstrate diverse situations of social vulnerability to flooding between and within regions. The households from Kuruwita are significantly less vulnerable compared to those from Elapatha and Colombo. Our research provides empirical insight for policy makers who are interested in gauging social vulnerability and planning efficient solutions for response and recovery. Especially, this study contributes to the existing body of vulnerability research by elaborating traditional measures of social vulnerability by applying highly detailed survey data and various weight schemes of influential factors for the vulnerability assessment. Also, regional disparity between rural and urban areas is obviously worth to note for Sri Lankan vulnerability assessment.

Bayesian Model Averaging of Climate Model Projections Constrained by Precipitation Observations over the Contiguous United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Satellite observations; Bayesian methods; Optimization; Climate models; Ensembles	MEASURING MISSION TRMM; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; CMIP5; FLOODS; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; WEATHER	This study utilizes Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a framework to constrain the spread of uncertainty in climate projections of precipitation over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We use a subset of historical model simulations and future model projections (RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We evaluate the representation of five precipitation summary metrics in the historical simulations using observations from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites. The summary metrics include mean, annual and interannual variability, and maximum and minimum extremes of precipitation. The estimated model average produced with BMA is shown to have higher accuracy in simulating mean rainfall than the ensemble mean (RMSE of 0.49 for BMA versus 0.65 for ensemble mean), and a more constrained spread of uncertainty with roughly a third of the total uncertainty than is produced with the multimodel ensemble. The results show that, by the end of the century, the mean daily rainfall is projected to increase for most of the East Coast and the Northwest, may decrease in the southern United States, and with little change expected for the Southwest. For extremes, the wettest year on record is projected to become wetter for the majority of CONUS and the driest year to become drier. We show that BMA offers a framework to more accurately estimate and to constrain the spread of uncertainties of future climate, such as precipitation changes over CONUS.	[Massoud, E.

The barriers have gates that are open most times except during storms. As an example of the assessment process for a barrier, an integrated assessment of two barrier options for the coastal city of Boston, located in the northeastern USA, is presented. The assessment also included a comparison to shore-based adaptation options such as elevated walkways, playing fields, and open space. While harbor-wide barriers in Boston could manage storm coastal flooding with perhaps minimal environmental impacts and moderate impacts on harbor users such as shipping, their cost-effectiveness is low. Their operational lives are limited by a rapidly increasing annual number of gate closures over time as sea level rises-placing considerable mechanical stresses on them. With low potential to adapt or adjust a barrier once it is in place, there are limited opportunities to respond to the uncertainties of climate change over time. The alternative of a wide spectrum of shore-based, district-level solutions using nature-based solutions located on the waterfront, however, has the potential for high cost-effectiveness and several key advantages. These solutions have the potential to incorporate multiple levels of protection, manage storm and tidal coastal flooding, provide flexibility and adaptability, offer co-benefits, endure for long operational lifetimes, and cause minimal impacts to the environment and harbor users.

Oral history and field measurements suggested that at least six major GLOFs have occurred in the region since 1921. A remote sensing analysis confirmed the occurrence of the six GLOFs mentioned by informants, including two smaller flood events not mentioned that had occurred at some point before 1962. A numerical simulation of the Nangama GLOF suggested that it was triggered by an ice/debris avalanche of some 800,000 m(3)of material, causing a surge wave that breached the terminal moraine and released an estimated 11.2 x 10(6)m(3)+/- 1.4 x 10(6)m(3)of water. Debris from the flood dammed the Pabuk Khola river 2 km below the lake to form what is today known as Chheche Pokhari lake. Some concern has been expressed for the possibility of a second GLOF from Nangama as the result of continued and growing landslide activity from its right lateral moraine. Regular monitoring of all lakes and glaciers is recommended to avoid and/or mitigate the occurrence of future GLOF events in the region. Collectively, the paper demonstrates the benefits and utility of interdisciplinary research approaches to achieving a better understanding of past and poorly documented GLOF events in remote, data-scarce high mountain environments.

New cities are appearing in desert areas while existing cities and villages within the Nile floodplain are growing and pushing agricultural areas into the desert. To enable control and planning of the urban transformation, these rapid changes need to be mapped with high precision and frequency. Urban detection in rural areas in optical remote sensing is problematic when urban structures are built using the same materials as their surroundings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-temporal classification approach based on satellite data fusion and artificial neural networks. We applied the proposed methodology to data of the Egyptian regions of El-Minya and part of Asyut governorates collected from 1998 until 2015. The produced multi-temporal land cover maps capture the evolution of the area and improve the urban detection of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Sentinel-2 Prototype Land Cover 20 m map of Africa and the Global Human Settlements Layer from the Joint Research Center (JRC). The extension of urban and agricultural areas increased over 65 km(2) and 200 km(2), respectively, during the entire period, with an accelerated increase analysed during the last period (2010-2015). Finally, we identified the trends in urban population density as well as the relationship between farmed and built-up land.

Here, we performed soil/plant translocation experiments in Shanyu tidal marsh, China, and examined the effects of elevated and reduced frequencies of inundation on nitrogen cycling over a period of 90 days. Our results indicated that soil ammonia levels (14.35-25.37 mg N kg(-1)) showed similar responses to changes in inundation frequency, whereas after 60 days of elevated inundation frequency, nitrate levels (0.32-1.52 mg N kg(-1)) were lower by 42.72% compared with the initial levels, although there were no significant changes in nitrate levels in response to reduced inundation frequency. After 90 days, both nitrification and denitrification rates were observed to correspond to naturally occurring hydrological gradients, showing increases of 564.49% and 108.82%, respectively, in response to elevated inundation frequency, and decreases of -77.83% and -94.92%, respectively, in response to reduced inundation frequency. Moisture, Fe(II), Fe(III), electrical conductivity, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plants were identified prominent factor contributing to the observed changes in nitrification and denitrification. Our findings highlight the likelihood of changes in nitrification and denitrification in response to short-term elevation or reduction inundation frequency.

Analysis and quantification of potential consequences in multirisk coastal context at different spatial scales (Normandy, France)	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Consequences; Element at risk; Spatial scale; Weighting; Multi-criteria	HAZARD RISK-ASSESSMENT; MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; FLOOD RISK; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; NATURAL HAZARDS; PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; ENGLISH-CHANNEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLASH-FLOOD; RANKING	Coastal environment with high interaction between nature and societies is subject to multi-hazard interaction such as landslides, flood or cliff retreat. These territories are characterized by numerous elements at risk located in valley bottoms, front sea or at the outlets of small dry watershed. The aim is to quantify the potential consequences of EaR by integrating multiple hazards exposure at various scale analyses. To quantify the element at risk, three steps have been required. First, an initial rank has been attributed to each class of element at risk at three different scales analysis. Second, the potential consequences are weighted according to environmental dimension. Third, the consequences are combined with a linear combination of criteria in GIS environment. At medium-scale analysis, element at risk highlighted is built-up areas, national road, railway, lifeline and urban centers. At large-scale analysis, consequences concern any kind of house, apartment and complex located on multiple exposure areas. At local scale, consequences concern buildings located on multiple exposure areas with one floor in mixed materials and built after 1980. Thus, this method proposes an approach with multiple scales analysis and by integrating multiple exposure areas to quantify potential consequences. With the environmental dimension in element at risk analysis, it is an intermediate step to traditional risk analysis and, more specifically multirisk analysis without considering in this case the spatial and temporal dimension of hazards.

Direct and indirect responses to warming are expected to vary along the marsh elevation gradient, making ecosystem responses to warming at this marine-terrestrial ecotone uncertain. The Marsh Ecosystem Response to Increased Temperatures (MERIT) experiment was established in 2018 on the North Sea coast of Germany. Experimental plots are evenly distributed over three elevational marsh zones (pioneer, low marsh, and high marsh) and include three temperature treatments (ambient, +1.5(degrees)C, +3.0(degrees)C). MERIT's novel design combines active warming (horizontal surface warming cables and vertical soil warming pins) with passive, partially covered domes. For performance assessment, temperature deltas between ambient and warmed plots were calculated and evaluated at seasonal, daily, and diurnal timescales. We used Linear Mixed Models with Residual Maximum Likelihood for evaluating warming treatment effects and constraining environmental factors. MERIT was effective at ecosystem warming in this high-energy environment both above- and belowground. Mixed models show that warming treatment dominates temperature differences belowground and at the soil surface, along with factors such as wind speed, flooding duration, and solar radiation. Aboveground warming was lower than belowground warming, but the dome design minimized issues seen in other open-top chamber experiments. The combination of passive aboveground warming with feedback-controlled active surface and belowground heating provides a setup for understanding warming effects on tidal ecosystems without altering the natural impacts of wind, radiation, and tidal inundations at high-energy coastlines. Our design creates opportunities to expand future warming experiments to remote locations and technically challenging environments.

Plum Island Estuary, Massachusetts (PIE MA) salt marshes are socio-environmental ecosystems experiencing two such climate stressors: sea level rise (SLR) and the mud fiddler crab Minuca pugnax (= Uca pugnax Smith) range expansion. Salt marshes are important sources of ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services. Uncertainties remain, however, whether SLR and the fiddler crab range expansion will affect PIE ecosystem functioning and services over time by changing marsh area. We, therefore, determined in this study: (1) to what degree PIE marshes provide residents with cultural ecosystem services (e.g., recreation); (2) whether SLR and the fiddler crab range expansion influence marsh area; and (3) whether policy measures influence the direction of marsh services in the face of SLR and multiple potential impacts of range expanding fiddler crabs. We developed a system dynamics model, parameterized with data from stakeholder surveys, the IPCC Report, and a literature review. We modeled low, moderate, and high SLR both with fiddler crabs enhancing marsh erosion and growth, and with and without mitigation strategies on marsh area and recreation. The multi-stressor effects of fiddler crab erosion enhancement and high SLR rates decreased marsh area by 2250. Future losses to marsh area caused declines in recreational days. Policy interventions (e.g., erosion reduction and tidal flood mitigation) largely mitigated these losses. Fiddler crab marsh growth by itself also strongly mitigated the effects of SLR. These results provide critical transdisciplinary insight for residents, scientists, and practitioners working to enhance PIE sustainability, and for researchers studying how to support environmental sustainability at scale.

The Pannonian-Carpathian Basin is particularly affected by the increasing frequency of hazardous hydrological events. Agricultural production, which is a highly significant economic sector in the region, is particularly vulnerable to these unfavourable climatic conditions. Changes in precipitation patterns and soil moisture levels can lead to reduced crop yields, while floods can pollute water sources and erode fertile soil. Mapping of Inland Excess Water (IEW), also known as ponding water or waterlogged areas, is crucial for informed decision-making, damage compensation, risk management, and future prevention planning. Remote sensing technology and machine learning have been demonstrated to be valuable tools for the mapping of IEW. The 2014 floods in Southeastern and Central Europe serve as a reminder of the importance of effective flood risk management. This study used a Geographical Information System (GIS) and a Semi-automated Classification Processing (SCP) tool to process high-resolution RapidEye satellite images from the 2014 floods in the Srem region of Serbia. The Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) classification model was used to produce a map of IEW. The SAM model achieved an overall accuracy of 92.68 %. The study found that IEW affected approximately 2.90 % or 99.59 km(2) of the territory in Srem. The obtained maps can be used by responsible water management agencies to prevent and control excessive inland water.

However, the Basin also faces enormous challenges related to sustainable water management in agriculture as driven by both drought and flood. In this special issue, we collected 64 articles across the Basin to improve our understanding of agricultural water management needs and demonstrate efficacies of management practices to improve the water management. The articles present exciting research on regional soil water storage and dynamics, soil moisture conservation in rain-fed agriculture, crop water demand, irrigation effects, water-nutrient coupling, water management and soil salinity, soil and nutrient losses, groundwater science and management. Findings of studies revealed: (1) the importance of mulching, drip and negative pressure irrigation, water and nutrient coupling (i.e., fertigation) in achieving both crop production and environmental protection objectives; (2) emerging research for better understanding of regional water resources and allocation of the water resources among different agricultural land uses and cropping systems, new approaches for conserving water and soil and mitigating soil salinity, system-level integrated rainfall and irrigation management, and improved knowledge on groundwater quantity and quality management; and (3) need of future research to understand processes and efficiencies of management practices in variable landscapes and cropping systems and variable and changing climates, and system-level linkages and analyses of water balance - soil water availability and conservation - water and soil losses - agricultural and environmental sustainability.

With increasing water scarcity in many regions and increasing frequency of extreme flooding in other regions, there is a need to improve predictive capacity, to collect a large amount of information on key hydrological variables such as flows or water stocks in lakes and floodplains and to best combine these data with hydrological and hydrodynamic models. Most of the world's water demand relies on continental surface waters (rivers, lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs) while less on underground aquifers and seawater desalination. However, ground-based hydrological survey networks have steadily and drastically decreased worldwide over the last decades. In this context, current remote sensing techniques have been widely used by several countries for water resource monitoring purposes. In this paper, we present such remote sensing techniques, in particular satellite altimetry and imagery, and discuss how they became essential for the study of the water cycle and hydrological phenomena on a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Large lakes, rivers and wetlands play a major role in the global water cycle and are also markers, integrators and actors of climate change at work on Earth. We show several examples chosen from the literature that perfectly highlight both current scientific and societal issues, as well as the crucial role of space techniques to monitor terrestrial surface waters.

The agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to disaster response, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the indirect effects of different disasters and measuring the effectiveness of agricultural adaptation measures for coping and recovery. Here, we presented a compiled dataset of multiple disasters and employed an agent-based multiregional input-output model to simulate the day-by-day direct and indirect losses caused by floods, storms, droughts, typhoons, and frosts in China's interregional supply chain network. Our findings revealed that the consecutive 200+ di-sasters in 2016 resulted in direct losses of $71.7 billion and indirect losses of $45.6 billion, equivalent to 0.67% and 0.42% of China's total GDP, respectively. Floods emerged as the most economically devastating disaster, accounting for over 70% of the total supply chain losses. The agricultural sector played a significant role, ac-counting for 18.0% of the total indirect losses. Remarkably, agricultural adaptation measures demonstrated the potential to reduce disaster losses by up to 20% across diverse scenarios. Our study enhances understanding of the superimposed economic impacts of multiple natural disasters occurring in China in one whole year rather than merely aggregating the individual impacts of each disaster, which provides a new perspective for exploring the indirect economic losses caused by the frequent occurrence of disasters. Our study also provides valuable insights to develop effective disaster adaptation strategies, enhance supply chain resilience, and promote sustainable economic development in vulnerable sectors and regions within the context of complex climate conditions in the future.

Due to its hidden belowground life cycle, complex host symbiosis, and yet unknown distribution, cultivation of the enigmatic species has only recently been achieved at some plantations in France. A sustainable production of WTs under future climate change, however, requires a better ecological understanding of the species' natural occurrence. Here, we combine information from truffle hunters with a literature review to assess the climatic, edaphic, geographic, and symbiotic characteristics of 231 reported WT sites in southeast Europe. Our meta-study shows that 75% of the WT sites are located outside the species' most famous harvest region, the Piedmont in northern Italy. Spanning a wide geographic range from similar to 37 degrees N in Sicily to similar to 47 degrees N in Hungary, and elevations between sea level in the north and 1000 m asl in the south, all WT sites are characterised by mean winter temperatures > 0.4 degrees C and summer precipitation totals of similar to 50 mm. Often formed during past flood or landslide events, current soil conditions of the WT sites exhibit pH levels between 6.4 and 8.7, high macroporosity, and a cation exchange capacity of similar to 17 meq/100 g.

In this context, the use of hydrological models is becoming increasingly important, specifically in the Aguenza watershed. A multitude of hydrological models are available to make very efficient modeling, and from this perspective, a comparative approach was adopted using two models with different characteristics. Streamflow simulations were carried out continuously at daily time steps using GR4J and ATHYS (2002-2011). The latter was used also to simulate rainfall-runoff events (1984-2014). Simulation results using the distributed model are very efficient compared to those obtained by the lumped model "GR4J", which shows the disadvantages of neglecting the hydrological processes during a hydrological study. However, a remarkable improvement was observed in the general appearance of the resulting hydrographs and the performance parameters after using the distributed model ((Calibration: NSE, RSR, and PBIAS increased successively by 8%, 6%, and 45.2%); (Validation: NSE, RSR, and PBIAS increased successively by 6%, 4%, and 8.9%)). In terms of flood event simulations, a good concordance between observed and simulated discharge was observed (NSEmedian = 0.7), indicating its great reliability for simulating rainfall-runoff events in semi-arid and data-scarce regions. This research highlights the importance of using hydrological models, specifically the distributed model ATHYS, for the better management of water resources in semi-arid regions with frequent flooding events.

Therefore, the country needs to be resilient to the natural calamities it faces yearly. The research aimed to determine the factors that affect the protective behavior of Filipinos during natural disasters by integrating protective motivation theory, the theory of planned behaviors, and ergonomic appraisals, and by adding variables such as knowledge and geographical perspectives. PLS-SEM was used to determine the significant factors that affect protective behavior. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 302 Filipinos in the Philippines through a digital survey using Google forms. The analysis showed that the intention to prepare is the most significant factor affecting their protective behavior, followed by macro and physical ergonomics. Aside from this, attitudes, perceived severity, self-efficacy, response efficacy, response cost, and subjective norms were found to influence their intention to prepare significantly. Furthermore, understanding natural calamities significantly influences an individual's perceived severity. However, the geographical perspective, perceived vulnerability, perceived behavioral control, and cognitive ergonomics were found to have an insignificant influence on protective behavior for natural calamities. The study findings could be used as a basis for household units or the national government to build disaster management plans and resilience programs. Aside from this, it can also be used by researchers as a basis for exploring other areas that may affect the protective behavior of individuals to prepare for natural calamities worldwide.

In this study, 36 000 Landsat images of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) were collected, and a multiple index (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, i.e. MNDWI, NDVI and EVI) method was used to identify open-surface water bodies in the flood and dry seasons during 1990-2020. Our results showed that during these 30 years, YRB surface waters were characterized by spatial and seasonal heterogeneities. The open-surface water coverage in the upper and middle reaches of the YRB was 8.74 parts per thousand and 4.24 parts per thousand, respectively, less than the average coverage in the whole YRB of 9.45 parts per thousand. Surface water area was significant larger in flood seasons than in dry seasons, while during 1990-2020, the surface water area increased by 27.5% in the flood season and by 58.9% in the dry season, reaching 7239.2 km(2) (flood season) and 6654.8 km(2) (dry season) in 2020. Meanwhile the seasonal variation has decreased. Climate factors (winter temperature and summer precipitation) positively correlated with open-surface water only in the source region of the YRB. In other regions, anthropic factors (e.g. water conservation projects) strongly affected open-surface water bodies by increasing their spatial area overall and decreasing seasonal differences in their coverage.

J	Zheng, JX; Huang, GR				Zheng, Jiaxuan; Huang, Guoru			Towards flood risk reduction: Commonalities and differences between urban flood resilience and risk based on a case study in the Pearl River Delta	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood resilience; Flood risk; PSR model; Extension catastrophe progression method; Pearl River Delta	VULNERABILITY; METHODOLOGY; EXPANSION; DYNAMICS; HAZARD; SYSTEM; INDEX; CHINA; MODEL	Despite traditional measures to prevent disasters, climate change and urbanization increase flood risk. Thus, flood resilience has attracted increased global concern. Understanding the commonali-ties and differences between flood resilience and risk is arguably important for flood risk reduc-tion. However, these factors have been seldom reported in previous studies, and discussions on the role of flood resilience in flood risk analysis, assessment, and management are lacking. In this study, the association between flood resilience and risk is discussed using a case study in the Pearl River Delta. Flood resilience is quantified using a pressure-state-response (PSR) model, while flood risk is assessed based on the hazard-vulnerability framework and the extension catastrophe progression method. The implications of considering flood resilience in flood risk analysis, assess-ment, and management are proposed. The results suggest that the overall flood resilience (risk) in the study area is greater (lower) than that in the highly urbanized areas, and areas with low (high) flood resilience (risk) are mainly concentrated within the highly urbanized areas. Indices extracted from human society and highly related to human activities have the same attributes in both frameworks, while indices associated with climate and geography contribute to the two con-cepts differently. Flood resilience supplements the concept of flood risk, and can be incorporated into risk assessment as an index. Moreover, pre-disruption (post-disaster) measures should follow flood risk (resilience) assessment, and strategies that foster flood resilience should be included in flood risk management. This study provides references for flood resilience improvement and risk mitigation.

The purpose of this research is to examine the trend and character of urban precipitation in the world's most densely inhabited metropolis. From 1981 to 2020, 40 years of monthly and annual precipitation data from 50 major metropolitan cities throughout the world, based on population statistics, were analysed. The monthly and annual precipitation analysis was done using a homogeneity test, shifting point test, non-parametric Modified Mann Kendall test, and also through computing the magnitude of the trend using Sen's slope estimate. According to the findings of the study, the most homogeneous data was obtained in May (90 %) and the least in September (74%). In 2002, the highest number of breakpoints were found in July (9 cities) and August (8 cities). The month of January has the largest significant positive trend (10 cities) whereas annually it has 20 cities. The monthly maximum of the significant negative trend was discovered in February (4 cities) and annually in 2 main cities. In November, the maximum positive and minimum positive Sen's slope values were found to be 82% and 56%, respectively. The findings of this study are important for future water resource projections, flood or drought predictions, and engineering, scientific, industrial, agricultural, and social studies. The goal of this research is to come up with a good plan for dealing with urban flash floods and droughts as precipitation acts as the key parameter of the hydrological cycle.

As the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables all-time monitoring regardless of bad weather conditions, it fits far better than passive optical sensors to delineate submerged areas during flood events. However, the universal, rapid, and accurate detection of flood extent remains a challenge. Drawing inspiration from the analysis of time-series variation in representative ground objects caused by flood events, as observed in a dual-polarized SAR time series over a hydrological year, we construct a novel window-based variation model. This model can be used to capture both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations of flood features across different polarization modes. Subsequently, we introduce an unsupervised flood-mapping framework that integrates spatiotemporal flood features extracted by fuzzy-based methods. Given the distinct backscatter value of short vegetation, a flooded short vegetation (FSV) activation model is designed and performed to enhance flood-mapping accuracy in complex regions. The proposed method, tested on the 2020 East Dongting Lake flood in China, surpasses three unsupervised flood-mapping methods and two deep-learning methods in terms of quantitative evaluation and visual performance. The uncertainty of our proposed framework is tested through parameter sensitivity analyses, comparisons with flood-mapping results from other sensor images, and extensive experiments on floods at different locations and times, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness, stability, and universality.

As a result, the productivity of important staple crops needs to be boosted by ca. 43%. Against the mosaic of global climate change and shifting arable land ranges, plant and soil sciences play a primordial role in finding solutions to the internationally shared challenges of ensuring sustainable agricultural and biomass production. However, to effectively meet these challenges and demands, knowledge obtained from essential plant and soil sciences must be connected to innovative applications in agriculture and plant cultivation. Particularly with the increase and severity of abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, soil organic matter, nutrient poverty, heavy metals, extreme temperatures, and floods. Hence, sustainable biological practices such as biostimulants that boost plant yield, quality or even novel functionality, and tolerance to abiotic stresses should be exploited to improve agricultural production. Thus, the biostimulants segment is very promising with a growth rate of over 12%. This effervescence explains the growing interest of scientists and industrialists to find new sources of plant biostimulants targeting specific agronomic needs. This review focuses on (i) the impact of abiotic stresses on crop growth and tolerance and their response mechanisms, (ii) the main categories of biostimulants (compost, humic substances, protein hydrolysate, seaweed extract, chitosan, inorganic compounds, and microorganisms (i.e. endophytes, AMF, and PGPR)), (iii) the application methods and mode/mechanisms action of biostimulants, (iv) mechanisms of plant tolerance by microbes in interaction with organic and inorganic fertilizers, and (v) the main constraints noted limiting the use of biostimulants.

In this study, generalized additive models (GAM) are combined with a nonlinear canonical correlation analysis (NLCCA) procedure to estimate extreme rainfall quantiles at ungauged sites in the Wei River basin on the Loess Plateau. Also, the single inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation, NLCCA-backpropagation (BP), and NLCCA-radial basis function (RBF) models were used as comparative methods for testing the efficiency of the NLCCA-GAM model. Because meteorological data are generally lacking in rainfall-ungauged basins, data at ungauged sites was interpolated by IDW interpolation when NLCCA delineated homogeneous regions. Results of validation indicated that maximum daily rainfall quantiles in the Loess Plateau were well estimated by NLCCA-GAM-based regional frequency analysis, implying the NLCCA-GAM is a useful tool for estimating design extreme rainfall in ungauged basins. Results of comparison demonstrated that NLCCA-GAM was more robust and better reflected the nonlinear relationship between explanatory and response variables in the region than did comparative approaches. In addition, it was found that the NLCCA-GAM approach made full use of the data from sites in homogeneous regions to mine the valuable nonlinear correlation between ungauged and gauged sites and estimate extreme rainfall quantiles at ungauged sites.

In this study, we developed an approach for integrating water temperature simulations into a habitat model to assess the impact of both hydro- and thermopeaking on the availability of suitable fish habitats. We focused on the habitat requirements of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a semi-natural braided floodplain along the Moesa River (Southern Switzerland) in early summer. First, we defined different scenarios (with and without hydropeaking) based on the local hydrological and meteorological conditions. Second, we used a two-dimensional depth-averaged hydro- and thermodynamic model to simulate the spatial distributions of water depth, flow velocity, and water temperature. Third, we applied generalized preference curves for juvenile brown trout to identify hydraulically suitable habitats, and developed a new index to assess the availability of thermally suitable habitats. Finally, we quantified the extent to which hydraulically and thermally suitable habitats overlap in space and time. During both base and peak flow phases, most of the hydraulically and thermally suitable habitats are located in the side channels. High flow conditions combined with strong cold-thermopeaking lead to a higher thermal heterogeneity. However, disconnected habitats originate in the dewatering zone, increasing the risk of stranding as well as thermal stress. By helping to better understand the effects of thermopeaking on the availability of fish habitats, our approach could contribute to the design and evaluation of ecological restoration in hydropeaking rivers.

As snow cover influences soil freezing dynamics, it has been hypothesized that reduced snow cover due to warmer winters might intensify soil freezing. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis. Drawing upon observed snow depth and soil temperature data collected from six research farms across Southern Canada over various time spans from 1989 to 2020, the root zone water quality model, integrated with the simultaneous heat and water model (RZ-SHAW), was calibrated and validated. The potential influence of warmer winter on shifts in soil frost dynamics was evaluated by estimating soil freezing dynamics for each farmland site under various air temperature scenarios using the RZ-SHAW model. Soil frozen depth in the eastern Canada sites increased with increasing air temperature in some years but decreased under the highest air temperature increases of 3.5 degrees C. The monthly relationship between snow depth and soil frozen depth was determined through partial correlation analysis. Snow was most effective in alleviating soil freezing in the months of January and February, a period when snow cover depth was least affected by warming air temperatures. This study suggests that the hypothesis of increasing soil frozen depth under global warming-induced snow cover reduction holds true in conditions where soil energy lost through reduced snow cover outweighed the soil energy gained through warmer air temperature.

Developing a shared understanding of the science related to risk is crucial for diverse individuals to collaboratively manage disaster consequences. Mental models, or people's psychological representation of how the 'world works', present a valuable tool to achieve this. Potential applications range from developing effective risk communication for use in short-warning situations to community co-development of future communication protocols for the co-management of risk. A diverse range of tools, in diverse fields, have thus been developed to elicit these mental models. Forty-four articles were selected via inclusion criteria from 561 found through a systematic search. We identified a wide range of direct and indirect elicitation techniques (concept, cognitive, flow, information world, knowledge, mind, and fuzzy cognitive maps, and decision influence diagrams) and interview-based techniques. Many used multiple elicitation techniques such as free-drawing, interviews, free-listing, sorting tasks, attitudinal surveys, photograph elicitation, metaphor analysis, and mapping software. We identify several challenges when designing elicitation methods, including researcher influence, the importance of external visualization, a lack of evaluation, the role of 'experts', and ethical considerations due to the influence of the process itself. We present a preliminary typology for elicitation and analysis and suggest future research should explore methods to assess the evolution of mental models to understand how conceptualisations change through time, experience, or public education programs. These lessons have the potential to benefit both science and disaster risk communication activities, given best practice calls for mutually constructed understanding.	[Doyle, Emma E.

Thresholds in Road Network Functioning on US Atlantic and Gulf Barrier Islands	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						barrier island; development; flooding; network analysis; network robustness; road network	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SYSTEMS; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; IMPACTS; TRANSPORTATION; CONNECTIVITY; METHODOLOGY; PERCOLATION	Barrier islands predominate the Atlantic and Gulf coastlines of the USA, where population and infrastructure growth exceed national trends. Forward-looking models of barrier island dynamics often include feedbacks with real estate markets and management practices aimed at mitigating damage to buildings from natural hazards. However, such models thus far do not account for networks of infrastructure, such as roads, and how the functioning of infrastructure networks might influence management strategies. Understanding infrastructure networks on barrier islands is an essential step toward improved insight into the future dynamics of human-altered barriers. Here, we examine thresholds in the functioning of 72 US Atlantic and Gulf Coast barrier islands. We use digital elevation models to assign an elevation to each intersection in each road network. From each road network we sequentially remove intersections, starting from the lowest elevation. We use the maxima of the second giant connected component to identify a specific intersection-and corresponding elevation-at which functioning of the network fails, and we match the elevation of each critical intersection to local annual exceedance probabilities for extreme high-water levels. We find a range of failure thresholds for barrier island road network functioning, and also find that no single metric-absolute elevation, annual exceedance probability, or a quantitative metric of robustness-sufficiently ranks the susceptibility of barrier road networks to failure. Future work can incorporate thresholds for road network into forward-looking models of barrier island dynamics that include hazard-mitigation practices for protecting infrastructure.

These conditions carry a certain level of risk for reliable electrical power delivery. Various atmospheric hazards endanger the operation of power systems, where the most significant are thunderstorms, wildfire events, and floods which can cause various ranges of disturbances, faults, and damages to the power grid, or even negatively affect the quality of life. By utilizing a weather monitoring and early warning system, it is possible to ensure a faster reaction against different weather-caused fault detections and elimination, to ensure a faster and more adequate preparation for fighting extreme weather events, while maintaining overhead line protection and fault elimination. Moreso, it is possible to bypass overhead lines that have the highest risk of unfavorable meteorological events and hazards, and reroute the energy, thus providing electricity to endangered areas in times of need while minimizing blackouts, and consequently, improving the quality of human life. This paper will present an analysis of the various risks of atmospheric phenomena, in the meteorological and climate context, and discuss various power system components, the power system control, operations, planning, and power quality. A concept with the main functionalities and data sources needed for the establishment of an early warning weather hazard system will be proposed.

In this study, we compile instrumental precipitation and streamflow records across California to quantify trends in hydroclimatic variability across spatial, temporal, and seasonal domains. We use the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution to examine whether any trends in variability are driven primarily by extreme low or high rainfall or streamflow events. Our analysis shows that there is a statistically significant positive trend in precipitation variability that is driven by long-term increases to the 90th percentile through most of California during winter (January-March), which has been steadily increasing since the mid-20th century. In contrast, significant positive streamflow trends are seen in winter, spring (April-June), and summer (July-September) and are driven by changes to both the 10th and 90th percentiles. Moreover, we found that there is a decreasing trend in fall (October-December) hydroclimatic variability, particularly over central California, that is related to declining values in the 90th percentile in both precipitation and streamflow. Our results suggest that California's hydroclimate has been under a continually heightened state of volatility, leaving the state vulnerable to hydroclimatic extremes and elevated risk of associated compound events (floods, landslides, fires). Thus, water resources managers will need to incorporate this increased volatility into their planning for public and agricultural water supply, while being aware of the higher risks for wildfires and floods as well as the disproportionate and lasting impact on vulnerable ecosystem structures.

A Combined Approach for Monitoring Monthly Surface Water/Ice Dynamics of Lesser Slave Lake Via Earth Observation Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Lakes; Earth; Remote sensing; Artificial satellites; Monitoring; Rivers; Synthetic aperture radar; Landsat-8; lesser slave lake; monthly dynamic changes; sentinel-1; surface water areas; threshold-based classification	INDEX NDWI	Surface water/ice dynamic monitoring is crucial for many purposes, such as water resource management, agriculture, climate change, drought, and flood forecasting. New advances in remote sensing satellite data have made it possible to monitor the surface water/ice dynamics both spatially and temporally. However, there are many challenges when using these data, such as the availability of valid imagery, cloud contamination issues for Landsat-8, and sensitivity of Sentinel-1 C-band to wind speed, topography, and others. A combined methodology using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was proposed to create monthly change maps at 30-m spatial resolution for the Lesser Slave Lake in Alberta, Canada, for the period 2017-2020. The potentials of multispectral indices for Landsat-8, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and modified NDWI (MNDWI) as well as the Sentinel-1 SAR backscattering coefficients (VV-VH) and normalized difference polarized index (NDPI) for separating water/ice from the land were investigated. The results obtained from satellite data with historical discharge and water level measurements for the lake were compared. Furthermore, the results show that the MNDWI and VH are the most effective indices for creating the change maps. The overall accuracies achieved for MNDWI and VH are 92.10% and 68.86% for cold months and 99.88% and 98.49% for warm months, respectively.

Ecosystem Response Through a Resilience Lens: Do Differences in the Illinois River Over 150 Y Indicate Regime Shifts?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						regime shifts; rivers of the Anthropocene; trophic status; food web character; stable isotopes	FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; STABLE-ISOTOPE VALUES; LONG-TERM; FISH COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; TROPHIC POSITION; EVERGLADES; RESTORATION; DELTA-N-15; PRESERVATION	Most of the world's large river ecosystems are subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors including climate change, disconnection between the main river channel and floodplain, flow regulation, and land-use modification. Viewed through a resilience lens, these ecosystems are potentially in a new regime, exhibiting a different structure, function, and set of feedbacks. We investigated the trophic status and food web character response to anthropogenic stressors over 150 years in the Illinois River. Differences in stable isotope ratios, community niche space, basal resource contribution to higher levels in the food web, mean trophic position of fish functional feeding guilds, and food chain length among four stressor phases suggest changes in ecosystem function in the Illinois River. Moreover, the river did not return to pre-stressor conditions following watershed-wide restoration efforts. Differences in trophic status and food web character also varied between the upper- and lower-river zones of the Illinois River over time. This spatial divergence further highlights the complexity of responses to multiple stressors in this ecosystem. Overall, differences in trophic status and food web character suggest a shift to a new regime-an Anthropocene regime-and one that has a reduced capacity to absorb additional disturbances. Given human pressures are a global issue, our results based on a 150 years data set, could assist in the management of riverine landscapes that face regime shifts due to human stressors.

Climate change adaptation and livelihood diversification among rural smallholder households in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Improved varieties; Livelihood diversification; Multivariate probit; Salinity; Simpson's diversity index	CROP-LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION; FOOD SECURITY; RIVER DELTA; FARMERS; DETERMINANTS; AGRICULTURE; SALINITY; ADOPTION; CHOICE	While it is known that the threat of climatic stresses induces rural smallholders to diversify their livelihood strategies, a consensus has not been reached as to what type of stress induces which strategy, especially in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. Primary data were obtained from randomly selected 405 households producing rice (Oryza sativa L.) in three provinces in the MDR. Simpson's diversity index was used to assess the level of diversification, multivariate probit regression was utilized to examine the factors affecting farmers' adoption of livelihood strategies, and tobit regression was employed to examine the factors influencing the extent of farmers' diversification. The index showed relatively low levels of livelihood diversification in the study area. The results of the multivariate probit regression analysis of four livelihood strategies indicated that farmers who were exposed to drought or flood were more likely to cultivate conventional rice varieties than newer cultivars, likely because the newer varieties accessible in the study areas were of the resource-using type that were high-yielding under favorable conditions but susceptible to environmental stresses. Furthermore, those prone to salinity intrusion tended to engage in off-farm income opportunities. In addition, the results of the tobit regression analysis exhibited significant effects of asset endowment, extension services, public transport availability, agricultural inputs, and cooperative membership on the extent of livelihood diversification. To enhance rural livelihoods in the MDR, intervention programs should ensure to provide the resource-saving type of improved varieties as well as promote off-farm employment in salt-affected areas.

Spread of an Aquatic Invasive Plant, <i>Iris pseudacorus,</i> Following Replacement of a Hydraulic Structure	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION			English	Article						best management practices; dam removal; invasive macrophyte; spread; wetland	SALT-MARSH; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; WETLAND; ISLAND	Freshwater ecosystems are heavily modified by hydraulic structures (embankments, dams, dikes, causeways, etc.). International efforts to restore freshwater ecosystems, along with increased stress on hydraulic structures due to climate changeinduced flooding, extreme rain events, and sea-level rise, have resulted in increased incidences of breaching and removal of these structures. However, modification of hydraulic structures can facilitate the dispersal of aquatic invasive species. Such an unintended outcome became apparent following the replacement of an ageing earthen dam at Greenburn Lake (South Pender Island, British Columbia) that appears to have facilitated the spread of Iris pseudacorus (Yellow flag iris) into previously uninvaded wetland habitat. While best practices to prevent this plant's downstream dispersal were implemented, the observed spread offers several practical recommendations to mitigate this risk in similar projects. We recommend that aquatic invasive species be explicitly considered prior to construction as part of an environmental impact assessment. Specifically, the spread of I. pseudacorus could have been mitigated through 1) enhanced efforts to clean machinery and equipment, 2) timely off-site disposal of organic material and sediment containing reproductive propagules, 3) cutting and smothering of I. pseudacorus within the work area at minimum three months before construction, 4) shifting timing of construction to fit within ecologically defined work windows that minimize the spread of I. pseudacorus seeds, and 5) use of physical barriers to capture suspended and buoyant propagules. The utilization of similar methods may reduce the spread of aquatic invasive plants during the maintenance or removal of other hydraulic structures.

Eroding Cascadia-Sediment and solute transport and landscape denudation in western Oregon and northwestern California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							LONG-TERM EROSION; COSMOGENIC NUCLIDES; COAST RANGE; CHEMICAL DENUDATION; MASS-BALANCE; FORE-ARC; FUNCTIONAL-RELATIONSHIPS; NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; ROAD CONSTRUCTION; PHYSICAL EROSION	Riverine measurements of sediment and solute transport give empirical basin-scale estimates of bed-load, suspended-sediment, and silicate-solute fluxes for 100,000 km(2) of northwestern California and western Oregon. This spatially explicit sediment budget shows the multifaceted control of geology and physiography on the rates and processes of fluvial denudation. Bed-load transport is greatest for steep basins, particularly in areas underlain by the accreted Klamath terrane. Bed-load flux commonly decreases downstream as clasts convert to suspended load by breakage and attrition, particularly for softer rock types. Suspended load correlates strongly with lithology, basin slope, precipitation, and wildfire disturbance. It is highest in steep regions of soft rocks, and our estimates suggest that much of the suspended load is derived from bed-load comminution. Dissolution, measured by basin-scale silicate-solute yield, constitutes a third of regional landscape denudation. Solute yield correlates with precipitation and is proportionally greatest in low-gradient and wet basins and for high parts of the Cascade Range, where undissected Quaternary volcanic rocks soak in 2-3 m of annual precipitation. Combined, these estimates provide basin-scale erosion rates ranging from similar to 50 t . km(-2) . yr(-1) (approximately equivalent to 0.02 mm . yr(-1)) for low-gradient basins such as the Willamette River to similar to 500 t . km(-2) . yr(-1) (similar to 0.2 mm . yr(-1)) for steep coastal drainages. The denudation rates determined here from modern measurements are less than those estimated by longer-term geologic assessments, suggesting episodic disturbances such as fire, flood, seismic shaking, and climate change significantly add to long-term landscape denudation.

We present a statistical hypothesis-testing perspective on this model identification challenge and contribute a mechanism identification framework that combines: (i) Bayesian estimation of posterior probabilities of individual mechanisms from a given ensemble of model structures; (ii) a test statistic that defines a "dominant" mechanism as a mechanism more probable than all its alternatives given observed data; and (iii) a flexible modeling framework to generate model structures using combinations of available mechanisms. The uncertainty in the test statistic is approximated using bootstrap sampling from the model ensemble. Synthetic experiments (with varying error magnitude and multiple replicates) and real data experiments are conducted using the hydrological modeling system FUSE (7 processes and 2-4 mechanisms per process yielding 624 feasible model structures) and data from the Leizaran catchment in northern Spain. The mechanism identification method is reliable: it identifies the correct mechanism as dominant in all synthetic trials where an identification is made. As data/model errors increase, statistical power (identifiability) decreases, manifesting as trials where no mechanism is identified as dominant. The real data case study results are broadly consistent with the synthetic analysis, with dominant mechanisms identified for 4 of 7 processes. Insights on which processes are most/least identifiable are also reported. The mechanism identification method is expected to contribute to broader community efforts on improving model identification and process representation in hydrology.

However, these numerical simulators produce outputs with low spatial resolution that exhibit difficulties representing precipitation events accurately. This is mainly due to computational limitations on the spatial resolution used when simulating multi-scale weather dynamics in the atmosphere. To improve the prediction of high resolution precipitation we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using input data from a reanalysis product, that is comparable to a climate model's output, but can be directly related to precipitation observations at a given time and location. Further, our input excludes local precipitation, but includes model fields (weather variables) that are more predictable and generalizable than local precipitation. To this end, we present TRU-NET (Temporal Recurrent U-Net), an encoder-decoder model featuring a novel 2D cross attention mechanism between contiguous convolutional-recurrent layers to effectively model multi-scale spatio-temporal weather processes. We also propose a non-stochastic variant of the conditional-continuous (CC) loss function to capture the zero-skewed patterns of rainfall. Experiments show that our models, trained with our CC loss, consistently attain lower RMSE and MAE scores than a DL model prevalent in precipitation downscaling and outperform a state-of-the-art dynamical weather model. Moreover, by evaluating the performance of our model under various data formulation strategies, for the training and test sets, we show that there is enough data for our deep learning approach to output robust, high-quality results across seasons and varying regions.

The landscape was covered with volcaniclastic materials that destroyed the ecosystem but, at the same time, preserved the traces of former environmental conditions. This study provides-for the first time-a pollen sequence reconstructing the environmental evolution and the plant landscape of the Sarno floodplain between 900 and 750 cal bc and ad 79, i.e. before and during the foundation of the city, and during its life phases. Previous geomorphological studies revealed that the portion of the Sarno floodplain under the "Pompeii hill" was a freshwater backswamp with patchy inundated and dry areas. Palynology depicts a thin forest cover since the Early Iron Age, suggesting an open environment with a mosaic of vegetation types. The local presence of Mediterranean coastal shrubland, hygrophilous riverine forest and mesophilous plain forest is combined with the regional contribution of mountain vegetation through the sequence. Oscillations between inundated and wet ground characterized the studied area until the ad 79 eruption. Such a natural environment shows anthropogenic traits since pre-Roman times: pasturelands, cultivated fields and olive groves, which probably occupied drier soils. The most important change in the land use system was the introduction of cabbage cultivation in the fourth century bc and its intensification from the second century bc, when Roman influence grew. The presence of tree crops and of ornamental trees reveals the opulence of the Imperial age until the catastrophic eruption.

However, currently available flood inventories are based on single-sourced data and often neglect underreported or less impactful flood events. Furthermore, traditional archives store flood events only at sparse geographic points, which significantly limits their further applicability. Also, few publicly available archives contain all-inclusive records of potential natural flooded area over time. To tackle these challenges, we construct two types of multisourced flood event inventories (MFI) for all river basins across the contiguous United States covering the period 1998-2013 on daily and subcatchment scales, which is publicly available at . These archives integrate flood information from in situ observations, remote sensing observations, hydrological model simulations, and five high-quality precipitation products. The first inventory (MFI-Actual) includes all actual floods that occurred in the presence of flood protection infrastructures, while the second, "natural (undefended) " inventory (MFI-Natural) reconstructs the possible "historical " floods without flood protection, which could be more directly influenced by climate variation. In the proposed two inventories, 2,755 and 4,661 flood events were estimated, respectively. MFI-Natural reconstructed 1,597 floods in ungauged basins, and recovered 608 extreme streamflow events in gauged subcatchments where floods would have happened if there were no flood protection. There is an average of four upstream dams located in these flood-recovered subcatchments, which indicates that modern flood defenses efficiently prevent significant flooding from extreme precipitation in many catchments over the country.</p>	[Huang, Zhijun; Wu, Huan; Nanding, Nergui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhijun; Wu, Huan; Nanding, Nergui] Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhijun; Wu, Huan; Nanding, Nergui] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhijun; Wu, Huan; Nanding, Nergui] Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Huan; Adler, Robert F.] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Schumann, Guy; Kettner, Albert] Univ Colorado, Dartmouth Flood Observ, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Schumann, Guy] Remote Sensing Solut Inc, Barnstable, MA USA; [Schumann, Guy] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Gourley, Jonathan J.] NOAA, Natl Severe Storms Lab, Norman, OK 73069 USA	Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai); University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Bristol; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA	Wu, H (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Wu, H (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Wu, H (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Wu, H (corresponding author), Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Wu, H (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.	wuhuan3@mail.sysu.edu.cn	Gourley, Jonathan J/C-7929-2016; Schumann, Guy J/V-8342-2017; Adler, Robert/AHD-5560-2022; Wu, Huan/ABF-6130-2020; Nanding, Nergui/AAC-2092-2019; Kettner, Albert/ABI-7635-2020	Nanding, Nergui/0000-0002-3912-2107; Kettner, Albert/0000-0002-7191-6521	National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604300]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41861144014, 41775106, U1811464]; Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies [2020B1212060025]; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams [2017ZT07X355]	National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Province Key Laboratory for Climate Change and Natural Disaster Studies; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams	The authors thank the four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Assessing the mortality risks of populations due to flooding is important and necessary for risk management and disaster reduction. Thus, this paper develops a method for assessing global mortality risks due to river flooding. Global historical annual death tolls are first estimated during the historical period 1986-2005 (T-0) by using available mortality vulnerability functions of river flooding. Then, the best vulnerability function is selected according to lower root mean square errors (RMSE) and the differences in the multi-year mean (DMYM) values. Next, the adjustment coefficient K (c) for each country (region) is calculated to use in the revision of the selected vulnerability function. Finally, the mortality risks are estimated based on an adjusted vulnerability function. As a case, the paper assessed and analysed the global mortality risks due to river flooding during 2016-2035 (2030s) and 2046-2065 (2050s) for the combined scenario of the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2), and the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario. The results show that the estimation errors of the death tolls in most countries (regions) decrease after adjusting the vulnerability function. Under the current defense capacity and vulnerability level, the average annual death tolls of RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5 in the 2030s will increase by 1.05 times and 0.93 times compared with the historical period. They will increase 1.89 and 2.20 times, respectively for the two scenarios during 2050s. High-risk areas are distributed in the south-eastern Eurasia.

The Khentii is the right English translation from Mongolian) Mountain Range of northeastern Mongolia. The peatlands were examined through their physical and chemical properties, diatom assemblages, and radiocarbon dating. In the Terelj River basin, the high contents of organic matter and biogenic silica and the dominant benthic diatom assemblages such as Eunotia praerupta, Pinnularia borealis, and Navicula mutica in the peat deposits indicate the warm and humid climates in the late Holocene. The high accretion rate of 0.97 mm/yr in the peatland records the intensive erosion in the surrounding landscape and deposition in the peatland due to increased precipitation and runoff in the humid climate since 0.5 cal. ka BP. In the Tuul River basin, the high content of mineral fractions and diatom assemblages dominated by benthic species Cymbella proxima, Encyonema silesiacum, and planktonic species Cyclotella ocellata in the peat deposits show a transition from humid to arid climates at 0.9 cal. ka BP. The accretion rate of 0.56 mm/yr in the peatland on the paleo-floodplain indicates strengthened erosion in the peatland over the past similar to 1000 years. This study in the southern Khentii Mountain Range provides new descriptive insights to extend the underestimated Mongolia's peat studies, and it would be a useful proof-of-concept study for future detailed paleo-environmental analyses.

This study seeks to operationalize social capital within the context of two disaster-prone settings - Burkina Faso and Niger. Burkina Faso and Niger are two landlocked countries located in the Sahel region of West Africa. They are prone to frequent stressors including drought, flooding, and insect invasions. Secondary data from a representative cross-sectional household survey of 2492 households conducted in May 2015 were re-analyzed. The analysis compared three methods most commonly employed in the literature against a new method and compared each operationalization of social capital. This study identified latent class analysis, asan appropriate method for this context. Selection criteria included method limitations, dataset constraints, interpretability, and the amount of variance the classes contributed to an outcome of interest, food security. The three classes had both a significant and positive association with food security (p < 0.01). Appropriate operationalization was also determined by examining the semipartial R-2 of each method. The latent class analysis index had an increment of 0.0064 (Household Food Insecurity Access Scale) and 0.0065 (Dietary Diversity Score), p < 0.001, the highest contribution of all models tested. These findings demonstrate approximate equivalence of findings using different methods; however, latent class analysis may be most appropriate given this context.

Lam] serves as a sustainable food source and ensures nutrition security in the face of climate change. Recently, farmers have developed increased interest in replacing rice with sweetpotato in paddy fields for higher income. However, sweetpotato is more susceptible to flooding stress than other abiotic stresses including drought and salinity. Here, we selected flooding tolerant sweetpotato cultivars based on biochemical characterization. Young seedlings of 33 sweetpotato cultivars were subjected to flooding stress for 20 days, and Yeonjami (YJM) was identified as the most flooding tolerant sweetpotato cultivar. Plant growth and biochemical characteristics of YJM were compared with those of Jeonmi (JM), a flooding sensitive sweetpotato cultivar. Under flooding stress, YJM showed higher content of chlorophyll and lower inhibition of plant height and fibrous root length than JM. Biochemical characterization revealed that although malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents were increased in fibrous roots of both cultivars, the amount of increase was 4-fold lower in YJM than in JM. Additionally, leaves of YJM showed higher ascorbate pemxidase activity than those of JM under flooding stress. Our results suggest that high membrane stability and antioxidant capacity are important flooding tolerance factors in sweetpotato. Furthermore, several flooding tolerance-related genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, fermentation, and cell wall loosening showed earlier induction and higher transcript levels in YJM leaves and fibrous roots than in JM tissues under flooding stress. Thus, phenotypic and biochemical characterization suggests that YJM could be used as a flooding tolerant sweetpotato cultivar.

High-impact weather events including periods of extreme temperature or extreme precipitation are frequently associated with adverse effects on human health. This study evaluates the impact of extreme weather events on injuries across New Hampshire. A set of five daily extreme weather metrics (EWMs) was analyzed: daily maximum temperature <= 32 degrees F (0 degrees C), daily maximum temperature >= 90 degrees F (32 degrees C), daily maximum temperature >= 95 degrees F (35 degrees C), daily precipitation >= 1 '', and daily precipitation >= 2 ''. Exposure to these EWMs was defined by linking the population within 10 miles of nine weather stations distributed across the state. Injuries were defined as hospitalizations categorized as: all-cause injury, vehicle accidents, accidental falls, accidents due to natural and environmental causes (including excessive heat, excessive cold, exposure due to weather conditions, lightning, and storms and floods), accidental drowning, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The associations between all injury categories and all EWMs as well as daily maximum temperature and daily precipitation were explored. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between the four strongest exposure-outcome pairs linking maximum temperature to all-cause injury-, vehicle accident-, accidental fall-, and heat-related hospital visits. Results indicate that daily maximum temperature (>90 degrees F) was most strongly associated with heat-related hospital visits and was also associated with all-cause injury-related hospital visits. Future work should include further analysis of cold weather metrics and incorporate these findings into public health planning and response efforts.

The focus has been concentrated towards reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel based energy systems. It is necessary to build a commercially viable CO2 sensor with high reliability. The gas-sensing field has shifted from using a cumbersome gas-reference electrode to solid-state electrochemical devices because they can be employed to detect CO2 in real-time overcoming the limits of widely used IR-based CO2 sensors. Here, solid electrolytes and mixed conducting semiconductor-based gas sensors for various gaseous species including CO2 are reviewed. The study on semiconducting metal oxides (SMOs) has been pushed forward as a most viable option for commercializing monolithic all-solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. Among SMOs, the perovskite-type metal oxides are considered as one of the promising structures for next-generation greenhouse gas sensors due to their remarkable thermal and chemical stability. This article also includes the fundamental understanding of essential factors that govern the electrical signals in all-solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

The discovery of non-native kelp washed up on Antarctic beaches led us to question the permeability of these barriers to species dispersal. According to the literature, over 70 million kelp rafts are afloat in the Southern Ocean at any one time. These living, floating islands can play host to a range of passenger species from both their original coastal location and those picked in the open ocean. Driven by winds, currents and storms towards the coast of the continent, these rafts are often cited as theoretical vectors for the introduction of new species into Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. We found non-native kelps, with a wide range of "hitchhiking" passenger organisms, on an Antarctic beach inside the flooded caldera of an active volcanic island. This is the first evidence of non-native species reaching the Antarctic continent alive on kelp rafts. One passenger species, the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea, is found to be an invasive and ecologically harmful species in some cold-water regions, and this is its first record from Antarctica. The caldera of Deception Island provides considerably milder conditions than the frigid surrounding waters and it could be an ideal location for newly introduced species to become established. These findings may help to explain many of the biogeographic patterns and connections we currently see in the Southern Ocean. However, with the impacts of climate change in the region we may see an increase in the range and number of organisms capable of surviving both the long journey and becoming successfully established.

Although the characterization of these physical hazards has improved, it is people's behavior that will ultimately determine the impact on communities. This study adds to our understanding of how people may respond to various adaptation options and policies, using a household survey in New York City, New York, neighborhoods affected by Hurricane Sandy. We investigate previously overlooked factors that may influence intended household adaptive behavior, such as single-action bias, a cognitive trade-off that households make between adaptation options, whereby taking a small (and often less effective measure) may strongly discourage uptake of a more protective measure. Through a novel application of discrete choice experiments in the coastal adaptation context, we simulate plausible future conditions to assess potential adaptation under climatic and nonclimatic stressors. Our findings suggest that single-action bias plays a substantial role in intended coastal adaptation, whereby the odds of homeowners who have already implemented a modest-cost measure to insure and relocate in the future are 66% and 80% lower, respectively. The odds of homeowners to relocate are also similar to 1.9, similar to 2.2, and similar to 3.1 times as great if their peers relocate, nuisance flooding becomes a frequent occurrence, and property values fall substantially, respectively. We find that renters' motivation to relocate is largely driven more by external issues such as crime, gentrification, and economic security than by flood hazard.

Management of minimum lake levels and impacts on flood mitigation: A case study of the Yahara Watershed, Wisconsin, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Flood exposure assessment; Lake level management; Hydrologic model; Ecosystem services	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON BALANCE; RIVER-BASIN; MODEL; ECOSYSTEM; SYSTEM; SCALE; RISK; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY	Lake level regulation is commonly used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risk in watersheds with linked river-lake systems. In this study, we first assess exposure, in terms of both population and land area, to flooding impacts in the Yahara Watershed's chain of four lakes in southern Wisconsin as affected by minimum lake level management. A flooding exposure assessment shows that the areas surrounding the upstream lakes, Mendota and Monona, have dense urban areas with high populations that are exposed to flooding; Waubesa has low elevations along its lakeshore, resulting in a large potential flooding area; and the most downstream lake, Kegonsa, has a large area of surrounding cropland that is exposed to flooding but impacts a limited population. We then use a linked modeling framework of a land surface model (Agro-IBIS) and a hydrologic-routing model (THMB) to simulate daily lake level over a study period of 1994-2013 in the Yahara Watershed with different minimum lake level management strategies. Modeling results show that the peak lake levels and corresponding exposed land area and population to flooding will decrease under a lower target minimum lake level. However, at the same time, the number of days that the lake level is below winter minimum will increase, which may adversely affect ecosystem health. In addition, our sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing target minimum lake levels will help mitigate flood risk in terms of both flood magnitude and frequency. Nevertheless, this must be balanced against the need to maintain adequately high lake levels for ecosystem services and recreational functions of the lakes.

Studies regarding the effect of storm surge inundation on buildings and human lives, especially when it comes to relatively low-threat level events, have been few, however. In this research, storm surge load impact around coastal residential areas was quantitatively assessed, through fine-resolution numerical modelling. Meso- and street-scale simulation results for a storm surge event in Nemuro, Japan, were comprehensively validated against observations and field measurements, and the simulation results showed good accuracy for sea level, significant wave height and inundation area. A fine-resolution, street-scale coastal flood simulation was carried out with individual and grouped buildings, created with a building block model, and the results showed the significant role of buildings by realistically capturing inundation dynamics. Hydrodynamic results showed that coastal flood impact on buildings was insignificant (consistent with surveys). Lastly, the potential flood impact on people in the streets was investigated, using five human instability equations, where the most pessimistic results showed average values between 0.0 and 0.2 (max 0.6-0.7), and slightly below 0.4 for children and the elderly, respectively. These values indicated that threat levels during the Nemuro storm event were low, which corresponded with observations (no fatalities). This study framework could be applied wherever an accurate local storm surge threat estimate was required.

This paper proposes an approach to improve the flood control operation for cascade reservoirs by minimizing flood control risk. A framework of reservoir flood control operation coupled with risk assessment (RFCORA) and the corresponding RFCORA model are proposed to reduce risk. The model contains three sub-modules. A real-time reservoir flood control operation simulation module is developed, in which a flood discharge control chart is used to determine the flood magnitude, and flood release is obtained by operation rules. Entropy-weighted fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is applied to assess the risk level in the flood risk assessment module. Finally, the flood release is updated according to the developed outflow adjustment optimization module aimed at minimizing flood control risk by combing future inflow information. In addition, another model without outflow adjustment optimization is set to be a comparative experiment. The water system of the Upper Yellow River is selected as a case study to verify the model. The results show that the framework and RFCORA model developed in this paper can decrease the time duration in the highest risk level without increasing the maximum water level and maximum outflow of reservoirs. The approach proposed in this paper based on flood control operation and flood risk assessment can be extended to flood mitigation in other water systems in similar situations.

Projecting Changes in Expected Annual Damages From Riverine Flooding in the United States	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; RISK; 21ST-CENTURY; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; BENEFITS; COSTS; CMIP5	Inland flood risk in the United States is most often conveyed through maps of 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) or "100-year" floodplains. However, monetary damages from flooding arise from a full distribution of events, including floods both larger and smaller than the 1% AEP event. Furthermore, floodplains are not static, since both the frequency and magnitude of flooding are likely to change in a warming climate. We explored the implications of a changing frequency and magnitude of flooding across a wide spectrum of flood events, using a sample of 376 watersheds in the United States where floodplains from multiple recurrence intervals have been mapped. Using an inventory of assets within these mapped floodplains, we first calculated expected annual damages (EADs) from flooding in each watershed under baseline climate conditions. We find that the EAD is typically a factor of 5-7 higher than the expected damages from 100-year events alone and that much of these damages are attributable to floods smaller than the 1% AEP event. The EAD from flooding typically increases by 25-50% under a 1 degrees C warming scenario and in most regions more than double under a 3 degrees C warming scenario. Further increases in EAD are not as pronounced beyond 3 degrees C warming, suggesting that most of the projected increases in flood damages will have already occurred, for most regions of the country, by that time. Adaptations that protect against today's 100-year flood will have increasing benefits in a warmer climate by also protecting against more frequent, smaller events.

The Power of Environmental Observatories for Advancing Multidisciplinary Research, Outreach, and Decision support: The Case of the Minnesota River Basin	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; NITRATE REMOVAL; FINE SEDIMENT; WATER-QUALITY; CRITICAL ZONE; NETWORK; CHANNEL; DYNAMICS; LANDSCAPES	Observatory-scale data collection efforts allow unprecedented opportunities for integrative, multidisciplinary investigations in large, complex watersheds, which can affect management decisions and policy. Through the National Science Foundation-funded REACH (REsilience under Accelerated CHange) project, in collaboration with the Intensively Managed Landscapes-Critical Zone Observatory, we have collected a series of multidisciplinary data sets throughout the Minnesota River Basin in south-central Minnesota, USA, a 43,400-km(2) tributary to the Upper Mississippi River. Postglacial incision within the Minnesota River valley created an erosional landscape highly responsive to hydrologic change, allowing for transdisciplinary research into the complex cascade of environmental changes that occur due to hydrology and land use alterations from intensive agricultural management and climate change. Data sets collected include water chemistry and biogeochemical data, geochemical fingerprinting of major sediment sources, high-resolution monitoring of river bluff erosion, and repeat channel cross-sectional and bathymetry data following major floods. The data collection efforts led to development of a series of integrative reduced complexity models that provide deeper insight into how water, sediment, and nutrients route and transform through a large channel network and respond to change. These models represent the culmination of efforts to integrate interdisciplinary data sets and science to gain new insights into watershed-scale processes in order to advance management and decision making. The purpose of this paper is to present a synthesis of the data sets and models, disseminate them to the community for further research, and identify mechanisms used to expand the temporal and spatial extent of short-term observatory-scale data collection efforts.

A sustainable water-food-energy plan to confront climatic and socioeconomic changes using simulation-optimization approach	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Water-food-energy nexus; Simulation-optimization approach; Green criterion; A multi-reservoir optimization system; Uncertainties	PROGRAMMING MODEL; RESOURCES; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; UNCERTAINTY; CRITERION; DESIGN; RISK	The provision of reliable water resources, safe grain production, and sustainable energy supply can be deemed as key guarantees for economic growth and human living improvement, but which have been challenged by imbalance relationship between increasing demand and limited supply capacity. In this study, a sustainable water-food-energy plan has been developed to conduct an optimal framework into a multiple water-reservoir system for confronting regional natural and artificial damages such as water deficit, food crisis and electric insufficient contemporarily. A simulation-optimization approach has been proposed to handle multiple uncertainties due to climatic and socioeconomic changes. The proposed approach has advantages of reflecting the climatic change in a lumped and conceptual way; meanwhile, it is effective to deal with socioeconomic uncertainties regarded as probability and possibility distributions, reducing the risk of decision-making with Green criterions. The developed water-food-energy plan with simulation-optimization approach can be applied to a real case study of Jing River, China. The obtained results of water-food-energy shortage, optimal water allocation-food production energy generation, flood control, and system benefit under various policy-scenarios can be identify comprehensive water-food-energy alternatives in a multi-reservoir optimization system. Meanwhile, the results associated with credibility confidence, risk-averse attitude parameter and robustness coefficient can support the generation of a water-food-energy plan with a robust manner. It can support the improvement of water supply, irrigative production, energy generation, industrial pattern adjustment, flood risk control, supply capacity at a regional view, with aim to achieve sustainability of human activities and resource-energy conservation.

Plants, water and humans: pollen analysis from Holocene archaeological sites on Sai Island, northern Sudan	PALYNOLOGY			English	Article						Pollen; River Nile; Sudan; Upper Nubia; Sai Island	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; HUMID PERIOD; VEGETATION; SAHARA; RECORDS; NUBIA; EVOLUTION; AFRICA; PALEOECOLOGY	The paper reports on a synthesis of pollen analyses and main archaeobotanical studies carried out on Early, Middle and Late Holocene sites from Sai Island in the Nile River (ancient Upper Nubia, present northern Sudan). Multidisciplinary archaeological studies focused on the transitions from hunting-fishing-gathering to pastoralism and later to agro-pastoralism in this area. New palynological data were obtained from two sites located on the eastern side of the island: an Early Holocene occupational level of a 'Khartoum Variant' foraging site (8-B-10C, Level 2; c. 7600-7200 BC), and a Middle/Late Holocene site dating to the Pre-Kerma/Kerma period (8-B-10A; the later phase is dated c. 1800-1600 BC). These data integrate the results obtained from two other sites located on the western side of the island (sites 8-B-76 and 8-B-81). Despite the poor preservation of pollen, the integration of data from the studied sites provides information on the environmental changes and potential for plant exploitation in the eastern Sahelian-Saharan region. A substantial environmental diversity between the west and east sides of Sai Island emerges, revealing that in the late Early Holocene and first part of the Middle Holocene the land near the river was characterised by a mosaic of habitats, with dramatic floods on the eastern side and seasonal dried-up areas on the western side. This region supplied water even during the dry climatic phases and provided humans with mosaic habitats within short distances, giving access to plants (useful for food and other purposes) which lived in swamps and marshes, wooded savannahs, grasslands or desert savannahs.

Varietal effects on methane intensity of paddy fields under different irrigation management	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						AWD; carbon footprint; farmers compensation; greenhouse gases; lowland rice	RICE FIELDS; EMISSION; PATTERNS; CULTIVATION	Alternate wetting and drying irrigation (AWD) has been shown to decrease water use and trace gas emissions from paddy fields. Whereas genotypic water use shows little variation, it has been shown that rice varieties differ in the magnitude of their methane emissions. Management and variety-related emission factors have been proposed for modelling the impact of paddy production on climate change; however, the magnitude of a potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by changing varieties has not yet been fully assessed. AWD has been shown to affect genotypic yields and high-yielding varieties suffer the greatest loss when grown under AWD. The highest yielding varieties may not have the highest methane emissions; thus, a potential yield loss could be compensated by a larger reduction in methane emissions. However, AWD can only be implemented under full control of irrigation water, leaving the rainy seasons with little scope to reduce methane emissions from paddy fields. Employing low-emitting varieties during the rainy season may be an option to reduce methane emissions but may compromise farmers' income if such varieties perform less well than the current standard. Methane emissions and rice yields were determined in field trials over two consecutive winter/spring seasons with continuously flooded and AWD irrigation treatments for 20 lowland rice varieties in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Based on the results, this paper investigates the magnitude of methane savings through varietal choice for both AWD and continuous flooding in relation to genotypic yields and explores potential options for compensating farmers' mitigation efforts.

Here, we use thousands of manual measurements of the water equivalent of the snow cover (SWE) from almost 30 stations between 1,200 and 2,900 m a.s.l. from four long-term monitoring programs (earliest start in 1937) in the center of the European Alps to derive daily SWE based on snow depth data for each station. The inferred long-term daily SWE time series were analyzed regarding spatial differences, as well as potential temporal changes in variability and seasonal averages during the last 7 decades (1957-2022). The investigation based on important hydro-climatological SWE indicators demonstrates significant decreasing trends for mean SWE (Nov-Apr) and for maximum SWE, as well as a significantly earlier occurrence of the maximum SWE and earlier disappearance of the continuous snow cover. The anomalies of mean SWE revealed that the series of low-snow winters since the 1990s is unprecedented since the beginning of measurements. Increased melting during the accumulation period below 2000 m a.s.l is also observed-especially in the most recent years-as well as slower melt rates in spring, and higher day-to-day variability. For these trends no regional differences were found despite the climatological variability of the investigated stations. This indicates that the results are transferable to other regions of the Alps.

Calculating the Environmental Impacts of Low-Impact Development Using Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment: A Review of Model Applications	LAND			English	Review						L-THIA; low-impact development; performance modeling; green infrastructure; urbanization; runoff; pollutant loading	LAND-USE CHANGE; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; WATER-QUALITY; OPTIMAL SELECTION; SURFACE RUNOFF; LID PRACTICES; THIA MODEL; URBANIZATION; GIS; PLACEMENT	Low-impact development (LID) is a planning and design strategy that addresses water quality and quantity while providing co-benefits in the urban and suburban landscape. The Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA) model estimates runoff and pollutant loadings using simple inputs of land use, soil type, and climatic data for the watershed-scale analysis of average annual runoff based on curve number analysis. Using Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, we screened 303 articles that included the search term "L-THIA", identifying 47 where L-THIA was used as the primary research method. After review, articles were categorized on the basis of the primary purpose of the use of L-THIA, including site screening, future scenarios and long-term impacts, site planning and design, economic impacts, model verification and calibration, and broader applications including policy development or flood mitigation. A growing body of research documents the use of L-THIA models across landscapes in applications such as the simulations of pollutant loadings for land use change scenarios and the evaluation of designs and cost-effectiveness. While the existing literature demonstrates that L-THIA models are a useful tool, future directions should include more innovative applications such as intentional community engagement and a focus on equity, climate change impacts, and the return on investment and performance of LID practices to address gaps in knowledge.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate water quality patterns based on changes in the aquatic environment. Eight multifunctional weirs (MWs) previously constructed in the Nakdong River, South Korea, have disrupted the river flow and increased the residence time by artificial floodgate control, thereby converting the river into a series of lakes. This study evaluates water quality in the Nakdong River using principal component analysis (PCA), the water quality index (WQI) and trophic state index (TSI), and self-organizing map analysis. The PCA identified that, following the construction of the MWs, nitrogen and phosphorus-based nutrients were the major water quality variables. Analysis via WQI and TSI confirmed that the amount of pollutants increased toward the downstream area. During the dry season, a continuous degradation in water quality occurs due to reduced water quantity and stagnated flow. Meanwhile, nutrients flow into the river in the form of nonpoint sources during rainfall accelerated eutrophication of the river after the monsoon period. The results of this study confirmed the influence of the formation of stagnant waters caused by MW construction on overall water quality.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Floods in urban areas greatly impair the serviceability of the transport system and cause disruption to commuting. However, little is known about the commute response under various rainfall scenarios in developing country cities despite the uncertainty of climate change. A high-resolution flood modeling module and a commute simulation module were integrated to examine the impact on commuting under floods. Flood maps under three rainfall scenarios with increasing rainfall intensity and duration were obtained, and road vulnerability was assessed considering the speed drop. We innovatively employed location-based service big data to perform commute simulation under floods based on the shortest time cost principle. The results show that a large amount of passable but affected commuters become disconnected commuters as the rainfall intensity increases. Also, commute loss of each traffic zone would not increase linearly, which means that the emphasis and strategy of disaster prevention and mitigation are not the same in different rainfall scenarios. We integrated hot spots of flood exposure, road vulnerability, and commuting loss and found that there was inconsistent spatial distribution between the three indicators. This indicates that areas need to take different measures according to the local damage characteristics. This work studied the relationship between severe weather conditions and commuting activity performance at the city level and has important practical guiding significance for building resilient cities.

Here we use the first Swiss Federal Forest Law (1876) as a case example, which was established to protect mountain forests as a natural means of protection against natural hazards, particularly floods. We briefly summarize the current relevant scientific knowledge on (i) reasons for reforestation in mountains and how the law may have contributed, (ii) forest effects on hydrological regimes and their protection service against floods, and (iii) other watershed changes affecting both reforestation and the forest-runoff interaction. We then present insights from a case study on the Upper Rhone catchment, which lead us to develop a methodological approach based on interdisciplinary collaboration among social and natural sciences to gain the needed data to answer the question of whether a forest protection law can serve as a means of flood protection. Specifically, we found that a data interpolation method is key to answering this question given data are at different scales and resolutions and suggest modeling to fill gaps. Such methods and collaborations are key for basing environmental laws and policies in current scientific knowledge and effectively manage ecosystems and their services.

Over the past 20 years, the region has experienced extensive and rapid land cover changes that may have exceeded the adaptability of geese, and have led to suitable goose habitat area loss, thereby, reducing the stability of the geese population. In order to identify the suitable goose habitat areas in this region, based on ensemble modeling and satellite tracking data, in this study, we simulated the spatial distribution changes in the suitable goose habitat areas over the past 20 years. The results showed that the suitable goose habitat areas had suffered varying degrees of loss, among which, the lesser white-fronted goose had the greatest suitable goose habitat area loss of over 50%. Moreover, we found that wetlands, lakes, and floodplains were the key components of suitable goose habitat areas, and the categories (land use) showed significant differences in different periods (p < 0.01). This may be one of the main reasons for the decrease in suitable goose habitat areas. The results of this study provide an important reference for the adaptive management and protection of geese in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

Due to the world's growing population, land-use alteration is frequently practiced meeting global demand. However, land-use changes combined with climate change have resulted in extreme hydrological changes (i.e., flooding and drought) in many areas. The state of Iowa has experienced several flooding events over the last couple of decades (e.g., 1993, 2008, 2014, 2016, 2019). Also, agribusiness is conducted across 85% of the state. In this research, we present a comprehensive assessment for agricultural flood risk in the state of Iowa utilizing most up-todate flood inundation maps and crop layer raster datasets. The study analyzes the seasonal variation of the statewide agricultural flood risk by focusing on corn, soybean, and alfalfa crops. The results show that over $230 million average annualized losses estimated at statewide considering studied crop types. The crop frequency layers and corn suitability rating datasets are investigated to reveal regions with lower or higher productivity ratings. The study founds nearly half a million acres of cropland is under 2-year return period flood zone. Additionally, a data-driven flood model, Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), is used to analyze performance against the FEMA maps. We found that the HAND flood maps performed with the correlation of 0.93 and 0.94 for 100-year and 500-year flood events regarding to the FEMA maps.

A recent catastrophe (Chamoli flash flood) indicates its complex nature. Therefore, cross-linking of lake formation processes is essential. Our study describes the probability of glacial lake formation on a pixel basis for the Himalayan glaciers using logistic regression. Here, we used three causative factors, viz., climate, glacial and topographic, to determine how a future trigger of climate changes may affect the glacial and topographic parameters, which may generate new lakes. A total of 10,056 Himalayan glaciers were considered here for glacial lake formation probability mapping. Logistic regression analysis exhibits that precipitation, surface texture, slope, plan curvature, temperature and profile curvature yielded maximum weightage accordingly towards lake formation probability with an accuracy of 79% in receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC). In our results, central Himalayan glaciers were found to be more prone to lake formation, with 5.73% of pixels coming under a higher probability zone (>0.8 probability), followed by eastern (4.45%) and western (1.82%) parts. The lower part of the clean glacier and the higher part of the ablation area for highly debris-covered glacier gave a higher probability of lake formation. In the case of medium debris-covered glaciers, the lake formation probability decreases with an increase in distance from the end of the ablation area.

To counteract this phenomenon, archaeologists and cultural heritage experts have relied upon rescue archaeology practices generally limited to fieldwork methodologies, while remote sensing of satellite imagery remains under-considered. To bridge this gap, we build on a multidisciplinary collaboration exploring the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and open access multispectral satellite imagery, for quantifying the archaeological evidence located within a prospective reservoir area before dam construction. Based on previous research by Marchetti (2020) claiming the necessity for ad hoc protocols to document and monitor the impact of dams on cultural heritage, we selected two complementary situations: the planned dam of Halabiyeh in Syria and the under construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. These case studies were analyzed with state-of-the-art methodologies to develop a feasible workflow that may contribute to fostering the use of satellite imagery in operational contexts such as those represented by these particular cases, and be replicated by archaeologists in other areas. The workflow is designed to be integrated to ground-truthing methodologies into two dedicated protocols named Pre-Construction Archaeological Risk Assessment (PCARA) and Pre-Flooding Rescue Archaeological Program (PFRAP) which could eventually become a standard procedure for rescue archaeology in dams areas.

Runup parameterisations allow a rapid assessment of coastal vulnerability at a regional to global scale, however these formulations are primarily developed for beaches. Hydrodynamic forcing and reef geometry are key parameters for the estimation of coastal flooding in reef environments. The present study aims to develop runup parameterisations for an idealised 2DV reef-lined coast profile using a widely validated nonlinear non-hydrostatic numerical model (SWASH). The numerical model is employed to simulate different combinations of wave conditions, water levels, and reef geometries. A machine learning (ML) approach, in the form of genetic programming, is used to identify the most suitable predictors for wave runup based on the numerical results. Analysis of runup results suggests that runup parameterisations can be improved for reef environments by incorporating the crest elevation, lagoon width, reef flat depth, and forereef slope. A dimensional and non-dimensional parameterisation that include reef geometry are presented. Further research efforts should be devoted to incorporate the effects of bed roughness and three-dimensional processes in this framework that were not taken into account in the present work.

A drought is generally characterized by a precipitation deficit, and its negative impact can be amplified by the simultaneous occurrence of a heat wave. More recent studies have highlighted the multicharacteristics of compound droughts and heat waves, which may call for improved efforts on assessing the impact of compound extremes. In this study, a compound drought and heat wave magnitude index (CDHMI) is built to characterize the severity of compound extremes in the Huai River basin (HRB) during 1961-2017. The CDHMI considers the impact of both drought/extreme heat conditions and the duration of drought/extreme heat. In addition, the magnitude index has been graded according to the degree of severity to detect the most drastic extreme compound events. The results show that from 1961 to 2017, mild and moderate events occurred more often than severe events. A significant increase in all compound events was observed from 2003 to 2017. Compound drought and heat wave events, especially in drought status, have increased significantly with the global climate warming in recent decades. The assessment of the impact for compound drought and heat wave events over the HRB needs to be improved in the context of global climate changing. Therefore, the CDHMI can be used to accurately assess the risk of compound droughts and heat waves.

The Effect of Antagonist Abiotic Stress on Bioactive Compounds from Basil (<i>Ocimum basilicum</i>)	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						abiotic stress; basil; bioactive compounds; green leaf volatiles; photosynthesis; volatile organic compounds	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; ESSENTIAL OIL CONSTITUENTS; DROUGHT STRESS; SWEET BASIL; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; SECONDARY METABOLITES; STOMATAL CLOSURE; LEAF VOLATILES; ABSCISIC-ACID	Featured Application: The volatile organic compounds emission from plants could be used as an indicator of stress. Drought and flooding are some of the most common stressful conditions for plants. Due to the recent climate changes, they can occur one after another. This study is focused on the effect of antagonistic abiotic stress such as drought and flooding on the different metabolites from Ocimum basilicum leaves. Six-week-old plants of Ocimum basilicum were exposed to drought or flooding stress for 15 days, followed by antagonist stress for 14 days. The assimilation rates decrease drastically for plants under consecutive stresses from 18.9 to 0.25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) starting at day 3 of treatment. The stomatal conductance to water vapor g(s) was also reduced from 86 to 29 mmol m(-2) s(-1). The emission of green leaf volatiles compounds increases from 0.14 to 2.48 nmol m(-2) s(-1), and the emission of monoterpenes increased from 2.00 to 7.37 nmol m(-2) s(-1). The photosynthetic pigment concentration (chlorophyll a and b, and beta-carotene), the flavonoid content, and total phenolic content decrease for all stressed plants. The results obtained in this study could indicate that the water status (drought and/or flooding) directly impacts basil plants' physiological parameters and secondary metabolites.

Estimation of the Niger River cross-section and discharge from remotely-sensed products	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Lateral-method; Mixed-method; Niger River; Satellite imagery; Satellite altimetry	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEST-AFRICA; SATELLITE; ALTIMETRY; ELEVATION; RUNOFF; IMPACT; IMAGES; BASIN	Study region: The Niger River basin (NRB) at Niamey, West Africa. Study focus: Two approaches to estimate the cross-section of rivers based solely on satellite im-agery (or digital elevation model, DEM) and altimetry for a large data-deficient region are pro-posed. These approaches are the "lateral-method" (LM), which directly provides the cross-sections, and the mixed method (MM), which incorporates a DEM with topography/bathymetry. The LM consists of following the river water lateral evolution on either side of a centerline using daily Planet Scope imagery, while the riverbed is estimated using satellite altimeters. The MM is based on the riverbed estimated from altimetry during the recession period, and the banks' heights are extracted from a DEM. River discharge was estimated at four cross-sections over a reach of 30 km at Niamey. An evaluation of the estimated discharge using in-situ discharge at Niamey hydrometric station presents a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.93 and a relative bias of 3.3 %. New hydrological insights for the region: The proposed method is feasible for other rivers in the Sahelian zone and supports a better understanding of surface water hydrology. For example, the estimated discharge at four cross-sections at a river reach of 30 km at Niamey was used to observe downstream flow gains. Nevertheless, the role of uncertainties and other contributions (e.g., evaporation losses) on the observed gains deserves further investigation.	[Lamine, B. O. M.; Ferreira, V.

The alpine bullhead is an established bioindicator of water quality in mountain streams, which can be adversely affected by an increased propensity for flash flooding. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of flash flooding on the variation of chemical elements found in the skull of alpine bullheads, with a focus on inter-annual effects. Their bone tissue reflects an increased concentration of K and Cl and a decreased concentration of biogenic Cr, Zn, and Mo, absorbed mainly through the gills, for up to 2 years following a flood. During autumn, following a summer flash flood, the amount of Mn and Fe present in skull tissues of fish was found to have increased, tapering off again over the following year. These metals are predominantly ingested by bullheads while feeding. The lack of specific types of biogenic concentration in the water may be critical to the definition of presence/absence patterns, as populations were shown to decline 2 to 3 years post-flood. Pre-alpine streams are particularly susceptible to this type of flooding. The decreases in biogenic elements and increase of K and Cl exhibited in bullhead tissues indicate that a negative ecological footprint due to flash floods can still be observed several years following the event.

The results show that: (1) There were 242 locust plague years in the Xiang-E-Gan region during the Ming and Qing dynasties, with an average of one outbreak every 2.25 years. The Qing dynasty suffered more than the Ming dynasty, and Hubei Province was affected more seriously than Jiangxi Province and Hunan Province. Locust plagues mostly occurred from March to August, and autumn locust plagues occurred more frequently than summer locust plagues. (2) The sixteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth centuries were periods of successive outbreaks, with 4.13 locust plague years and 10.75 affected counties per decade. The spatial heterogeneity and aggregation of locust outbreaks were significant, and the plain area was affected more seriously and continuously. (3) Low temperature promoted the outbreak of locust plagues, especially during the period of high occurrence, and the outbreaks cannot indicate the previous year's temperature. Compared with floods, the relationship between droughts and locust plague was closer, and large-scale climate change may also affect locust outbreaks. (4) Long-term natural disasters multiplied the food price and food prices lagged behind disasters. Epidemics were often accompanied by locust plagues, forming a typical chain of agricultural disasters that did great harm to the society.

Thus, it is crucial to determine the sea-level variation at the local scale to support coastal hazard assessment and related management policies. In this work we focus on sea-level change along the Emilia-Romagna coast, a highly urbanized, 130 km-long belt facing the northern Adriatic Sea, by analyzing data from three tide gauges (with data records in the last 25-10 years) and related closest grid points from CMEMS monthly gridded satellite altimetry. The results reveal that the rate of sea-level rise observed by altimetry is coherent along the coast (2.8 +/- 0.5 mm/year) for the period 1993-2019 and that a negative acceleration of -0.3 +/- 0.1 mm/year is present, in contrast with the global scale. Rates resulting from tide gauge time series analysis diverge from these values mainly as a consequence of a large and heterogeneous rate of subsidence in the region. Over the common timespan, altimetry and tide gauge data show very high correlation, although their comparison suffers from the short overlapping period between the two data sets. Nevertheless, their combined use allows assessment of the recent (last 25 years) sea-level change along the Emilia-Romagna coast and to discuss the role of different interacting processes in the determination of the local sea level.

Although various flood susceptibility models have evolved to mitigate flood hazards in different parts of the world, model performances vary according to the peculiarity of the study area and conditioning factors. Therefore, specialized studies are essential to determine model performances for specific locations. This study develops an integrated spatial multi-criteria decision-making model to classify flood susceptibility in Ibadan, Nigeria. For the improvement of the weighting accuracy of the flood causative criteria, Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) was integrated with GIS for the weight computation and overlay process. Ten flood causative factors were evaluated using the AHP and FAHP models. Results indicate rainfall, runoff, and distance to stream as the most significant flood causative factors with FAHP and AHP weights of 22%, 18%, 16%, and 23%, 23%, 18%, respectively. The FAHP and AHP maps identified the southern region as the most susceptible, with the FAHP also highlighting the susceptibility of the central region. The models' accuracies were validated by overlaying the AHP and FAHP maps with locations of previous flood occurrences in the study area. The Fuzzy AHP map had a 91% alignment with the historical flood locations while the AHP model produced a 45% match, confirming the higher accuracy of the FAHP model and suitability for flood susceptibility mapping in Nigeria and other West African cities.

Daily and seasonal variation of the surface temperature lapse rate and 0°C isotherm height in the western subtropical Andes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Chile; 0 degrees C isotherm; high density sensor network; mountains; temperature lapse rate; warm events	AIR-TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN SLOPES; SUMMER PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CENTRAL CHILE; URBAN-GROWTH; WORLD MAP; NORTHERN; SANTIAGO; IMPACT	The spatial distribution of surface air temperatures is essential for understanding and modelling high-relief environments. Good estimations of the surface temperature lapse rate (STLR) and the 0 degrees C isotherm height (H0) are fundamental for hydrological modelling in mountainous basins. Although STLR changes in space and time, it is typically assumed to be constant leading to errors in the estimation of direct-runoff volumes and flash-floods risk assessment. This paper characterizes daily and seasonal temporal variations of the in-situ STLR and H0 over the western slope of the subtropical Andes (central Chile). We use temperature data collected during 2 years every 10 min by a 16 sensors network in a small catchment with elevations ranging between 700 and 3,250 m. The catchment drains directly into Santiago, the Chilean capital with more than seven million inhabitants. Resulting values are compared against those obtained using off-site, operational data sets. Significant intra- and inter-day variations of the in-situ STLR were found, likely reflecting changes in the low-level temperature inversion during dry conditions. The annual average in-situ STLR is -5.9 degrees C/km during wet-weather conditions. Furthermore, STLR and H0 estimations using off-site gauges are extremely sensitive to the existence of gauging stations at high elevations.

After 1980s, the Yellow river water presented a significant reduction, what caused the decrease of the Yellow river discharge had been debated in academic circles. We proceeded with runoff generation mechanisms to explain this phenomenon. We built saturation excess runoff and infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms for rainfall-runoff simulation in Jingle sub-basin of Fen River basin on the Loess Plateau, to reveal the influence of land use change on flood processes and studied the changes of model parameters under different underlying conditions. The results showed that the runoff generation mechanism was mainly infiltration-excess overland flow, but the flood events of saturation-excess overland flow had an increasing trend because of land use cover change (the increase of forestland and grassland areas and the reduction of cultivated land). Some of the model parameters had physical significances,such as water storage capacity (WM), infiltration capacity (f), evapotranspiration (CKE), soil permeability coefficient (k) and index of storage capacity distribution curve (n) showed increasing trends, and index of infiltration capacity distribution curve (m) showed a decreasing trend. The above results proved the changes of runoff generation mechanism from the perspective of model parameters in Jingle sub-basin, which can provide a new perspective for understanding the discharge reduction in the Yellow River basin.

Here, we investigated spatial variations in C-hydrolyzing enzyme activities, soil C contents in different fractions [i.e. labile and recalcitrant carbon (LC and RC)] from 6 sites with four different elevations at two soil depths (0-10cm and 10-30cm) in riparian zones of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. At region scales, the SOC, RC contents, and RC/SOC (RIC) generally showed decreasing tendency from the upstream to the downstream. The C-hydrolyzing enzyme activities were higher in the midstream compared to other sites, which did not correspond well with the changing trend of SOC content, but matched with the spatial variation in LC content. At ecosystem scales, the RC and RIC declined with decreased elevations, but the LC showed opposite trend. Whereas, the four C-hydrolyzing enzyme activities and the specific enzyme activities were corresponded well with the changing trend of LC content. Soil C contents and enzyme activities were generally higher in top soil than deep soil across sites and elevation zones. These results reveal that the LC is the tightest factor in regulating C-hydrolyzing enzyme activities, whereas the soil C quality (i.e. RIC) and flooding collectively drive C-hydrolyzing enzyme activities possibly by affecting decomposition rates of SOC in the riparian zones.

The stability of the general conditions prevailing in its surrounding was crucial to ensure this vital link between north and south and east and west. However, any imbalance would be the precursor of a harmful domino effect to these environments, where the natural vulnerabilities are combined to a worsening socioeconomic congestion. In both banks, efforts are made not to give way to the fragile balance of water availability and risks. Here, we show that the amount and recurrence of extreme rainfall events contradict with current management scenarios. Our pixel-based assessment of the rain components extracted from the African Rainfall Climatology product reveals an annual increase in the total amount of rainfall and extreme rainfall events. A spatial and a trend analysis of the studied rainfall components were carried out to determine their spatial patterns and magnitude. The cumulative annual rainfall alone will not mean if a year is dry or wet. A wet year can experience great periods of drought, which will have serious repercussions on the socioeconomic and ecological levels. In addition, the increased occurrence of extreme rains can produce floods, intensifying land degradation processes, loss of biodiversity, water availability and economic growth. Decision-makers should be aware that current models of territorial management will not be able to cope with this change and that interdisciplinary cohesion and cross-border actions are the most appropriate solution.

Floods are recognized as a leading source of consequences to society, including disruption of critical functions in urban areas, and to the environment. Consideration of the interplay between services providers ensuring urban functions is essential to deal with climate dynamics and associated risks. Assessment of resilience to multiple hazards requires integrated and multi-sectoral approaches embracing each strategic urban sector and interactions between them. A common limitation resides in the limited data and tools available for undertaking these complex assessments. The paper proposes a methodology to undertake the spatial characterization of the flood related hazards and exposure of both essential functions and services providers in urban areas, in the context of limitations in data and in ready-to-use tools. Results support the resilience assessment of these hazards, taking into account interdependencies and cascading effects. The approach is applied to Lisbon city as the study case. Results are promising in demonstrating the potential of combining data and knowledge from different sources with dual modelling approaches, allowing us to obtain trends on the magnitude of effects of climate scenarios and to assess potential benefits of adaptation strategies. Quantification of the effects is reached, but results need to be assessed together with the underlying levels of uncertainty. The methodology can facilitate dialogue among stakeholders and between different decision levels.

Due to the fluctuation in rainfall and surface water availability, riparian plants usually exposed to two different seasons throughout the year: a dry season and a rainy season. However, water use patterns among riparian plants are still poorly understood in the tropical monsoon region. In this study, we used stable isotope techniques (delta D and delta O-18) coupled with MixSIAR model to identify the water sources for riparian plants in a tropical forest of SW China. The results showed an apparent seasonal variation in water use patterns for most trees, and the spatial variations were less pronounced between the terrace and floodplain sites. Among most riparian trees, deep soil (below 50cm) was the main water source in the dry season, and shallow soil (above 15cm) was the primary water source during the rainy season. However, there was no change in water source for herbs and other shallow-rooted species with the fluctuation in water availability. This result indicates that shallow-rooted plants (i.e., herbs and seedlings) struggle for their survivability in a riparian ecosystem because of the water scarcity in shallow soil during the dry season. Thus, lower rainfall and/or extended dry period may affect the productivity and sustainability of riparian vegetation under a future climate change scenario.

Changes in Extreme Precipitation in the Northeast United States: 1979-2014	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Atmosphere; Extreme events; Flood events; Rainfall; Climate change; Climate variability	HEAVY PRECIPITATION; SECULAR TRENDS; EVENTS; INDICATORS	Extreme precipitation can have significant adverse impacts on infrastructure and property, human health, and local economies. This paper examines recent changes in extreme precipitation in the northeast United States. Daily station data from 58 stations missing less than 5% of days for the years 1979-2014 from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network were used to analyze extreme precipitation, defined as the top 1% of days with precipitation. A statistically significant (95% confidence level) increasing trend of the threshold for the top 1% of extreme precipitation events was found (0.3 mm yr(-1)). This increasing trend was due to both an increase in the frequency of extreme events and the magnitude of extreme events. Rainfall events >= 150 mm (24-h accumulation) increased in frequency from 6 events between 1979 and 1996 to 25 events between 1997 and 2014, a 317% increase. The annual daily maximum precipitation, or the highest recorded precipitation amount in a given year, increased by an average of 1.6 mm yr(-1), a total increase of 58.0 mm. Decreasing trends in extreme precipitation were observed east of Lake Erie during the warm season. Increasing trends in extreme precipitation were most robust during the fall months of September, October, and November, and particularly at locations further inland. The analysis showed that increases in events that were tropical in nature, or associated with tropical moisture, led to the observed increase in extreme precipitation during the fall months.

Process-Based Quantification of the Role of Wildfire in Shaping Flood Frequency	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						compound event; flood frequency analysis; post-wildfire floods; process-based approaches	WATER REPELLENCY; OVERLAND-FLOW; FIRE; CLIMATE; FOREST; RISK; CALIFORNIA; INTENSITY; RUNOFF; INFILTRATION	Moderate to high severity wildfire can abruptly alter watershed properties and enhance extreme hydrologic responses such as debris flows and floods. The compounding effects of wildfire on flood hazard, represented here via flood frequency analysis (FFA; e.g., 100-year flood) are of growing importance. Standard statistical FFA approaches are ill-suited to examining this issue because wildfire-affected flood peak observations are limited in number and violate the assumption of independent and identically distributed events. Here, we developed a process-based FFA framework that integrates a stochastic rainfall generator, wildfire simulation, inverse modeling, and a physics-based hydrological model to directly simulate the impacts of wildfire on FFA. We applied this framework in the upper Arroyo Seco watershed in Southern California, which experienced Moderate to high burn during the 2009 Station Fire. An FFA analysis, performed with simulated peak flows from the first year since fire demonstrates the 100-year flood can be three times larger than simulations that only consider peak flows in non-fire-affected years. On the other hand, coupling process-based FFA with stochastically simulated wildfire events and watershed's time-varying hydrologic recovery yields "fire continuum FFA", a concept introduced here for the first time. Fire continuum FFA accounts for multiple wildfires within very long synthetic time series. Variability in upper tail flood peaks is substantially higher in fire continuum results as compared with pre-wildfire FFA. This result highlights the importance of wildfire inter-arrival time and post-wildfire recovery processes, both of which are expected to change as a result of climatic change and evolving fire management strategies.

Here we synthesize 443 studies and apply multilevel mixed-effects metaregression analyses to compare the responses of 187 non-native and 1,852 native animal species across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems to different types of EWE. Our results show that marine animals, regardless of whether they are non-native or native, are overall insensitive to EWEs, except for negative effects of heatwaves on native mollusks, corals and anemone. By contrast, terrestrial and freshwater non-native animals are only adversely affected by heatwaves and storms, respectively, whereas native animals negatively respond to heatwaves, cold spells and droughts in terrestrial ecosystems and are vulnerable to most EWEs except cold spells in freshwater ecosystems. On average, non-native animals displayed low abundance in terrestrial ecosystems, and decreased body condition and life history traits in freshwater ecosystems, whereas native animals displayed declines in body condition, life history traits, abundance, distribution and recovery in terrestrial ecosystems, and community structure in freshwater ecosystems. By identifying areas with high overlap between EWEs and EWE-tolerant non-native species, we also provide locations where native biodiversity might be adversely affected by their joint effects and where EWEs might facilitate the establishment and/or spread of non-native species under continuing global change. A synthesis of 443 studies across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems reveals differences in the responses of non-native and native animal species to heatwaves, cold spells, storms, floods and droughts, and prompts discussion of how such extreme events may facilitate success of non-native species.

Climate change is driving a major increase in precipitation and flooding across this rural and often under-resourced region, effects complicated by the ongoing legacies of white settlement and the changes it wrought to area streams, including the burial of floodplains in sediment displaced off area hillslopes. As managers work to consider how to "restore" Driftless streams, riparian vegetation-grass versus trees-has become a central and surprisingly controversial node. Current stream restoration practice typically includes the removal of riparian trees, though that practice has come under increasing criticism. Grounded in more than 5 years of qualitative and biophysical fieldwork in the region, we build from interviews gathered with 18 Driftless Area stream restoration managers from 2018 to 2020 to point to the ways that managers leverage arguments about erosion, flooding, habitat, and angler access, among other things, in service of grass and trees. Indexing the surface flows and underflows of this restoration debate, we introduce the rhetorical concept of the proxy debate to argue that debates about grass versus trees are tethered to competing perspectives on scale, temporality, and dynamism, surficial distractions from much deeper anxieties about what a stream is and should be. We turn to the ways that these distractions serve to further distance the stream restoration enterprise from acknowledging the ongoing human and hydrologic legacies of settler colonialism, and we close by suggesting that careful attention to rhetorical power-both to what arguments say and do, and to what they elide-offers a tentative first step toward restoring lands and relations by questioning what is taken for granted and what lies beneath.

Traditional centralized UDS have been found ineffective in mitigating the uncertainty of future flood risks. Consequently, the need to explore resilient alternatives, such as decentralized UDS, has gained importance. Of particular interest is the coupled approach of grey infrastructure (GREI) and low-impact development (LID), which merges the drainage capabilities of GREI with the versatility and sustainability of distributed green infrastructure. However, there are limited studies assessing the environmental and economic impacts of both centralized and decentralized LID-GREI UDS using integrated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods. This study, using Zhujiang New Town, Guangzhou, China, as a case study, found that decentralized UDS outperformed centralized UDS from both environmental and economic perspectives, mainly due to smaller pipeline scale and lower maintenance frequency. Furthermore, though the LID-GREI UDS showcased more substantial environmental impacts and higher economic costs compared to GREI UDS, the hydrological benefits obtained from LID operation can counteract part of these environmental impacts. In a unique perspective, this study considers the payback periods for centralized and decentralized LID-GREI UDS, estimating them to be 70 and 55 years respectively, when taking economic implications and hydrologic benefits into an overall consideration. Overall, the findings underscore that the LID-GREI UDS, particularly the decentralized LID-GREI, presents a more sustainable and cost-effective strategy for mitigating pluvial flooding compared to GREI UDS. This study provides comprehensive insights into effective and cost-efficient strategies for alleviating urban flooding vulnerabilities through UDS design and implementation.

Unfortunately, the instrumental weather record only extends over the last 100-150 years depending upon location. It is thus desirable to develop paleo-storm proxies to extend the tropical cyclone record to hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Overwash sand deposits, sediment grain size, and various geochemical parameters (e.g., & delta;13C, & delta;15N, C/N) have been applied successfully for coastal lake sediments. We present here another potential proxy candidate, the natural radionuclide 210Pb. With a 22.2-year half-life, 210Pb age dating is often used to calibrate other proxies over essentially the same period as the instrumental storm record. We hypothesize here that trends in the 210Pb profiles, in addition to providing chronological information, can provide independent records of storm deposits in some situations. To illustrate how 210Pb may serve as an additional storm proxy, we present data from sediment cores collected from the Chao Phraya Delta (Upper Gulf of Thailand), an area characterized by a rapidly retreating shoreline. Some of the 210Pb profiles mark sedimentary layers with anomalously low excess 210Pb activities interspersed between layers with significant excess activities. We suggest that these layers may result from rapid deposition offshore of older storm-eroded shoreline material. The estimated ages of these 210Pb-deficient layers match, within estimated uncertainties, years when typhoons or tropical storms are reported to have severely eroded the nearby Thai coastline. The matching of the time scales of 210Pb and recorded tropical cyclones, both about 100-150 years, allows this approach to be used to explore for storm deposits and tune geochemical and other proxies for extended study over time scales of several decades or longer.

This study uses two hydraulic models including Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and LISFLOOD-FP to simu-late floods in two basins (Kashkan and Missouri) with different topographies (mountain and plain terrain). The impacts of different parameters like input resolutions, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), roughness coefficient, and modeling techniques on flood simulation are examined. Results indicate that the performance of the models varies based on topography, input resolutions, and modeling approach. Indeed, the 2D modeling of both models in different topography types leads to better results compared to 1D/2D modeling. In Kashkan basin, HEC-RAS and LISFLOOD-FP models simulate floodplain flow with accuracies of 74% and 70%, respectively, and the ac-curacies of the models in Missouri basin are 80% and 84%, respectively. Although both models, particularly HEC-RAS with ALOS 30 m, can provide reasonable results, with an accuracy of 74% for Kashkan and 63% for Missouri basin, LISFLOOD-FP can perform better (about 4% higher accuracy) than HEC-RAS with a higher resolution of DEM (3DEP) in Missouri basin with significantly lower computational costs. In addition, the performance of the two models significantly decreases using ASTER DEM in plain topography. Results confirm that HEC-RAS out-performs LISFLOOD-FP in coarser resolution DEMs, while LISFLOOD-FP performs better in plain topography, which requires higher resolution DEMs. Despite the low sensitivity of the two models to roughness coefficients, the variability of the LISFLOOD-FP simulations is smaller than HEC-RAS. This work uses the best setting and factors to simulate floodplain zones, which is valuable for flood risk and hazard assessment to reduce and manage damages and losses.

Moreover, enhanced monsoonal precipitation has increased runoff and transport of allochthonous material to the lakes. Consequently, water levels are rising, modifying the spatial distribution and composition of local aquatic biota. To infer these environmental and biological changes in recent decades, a 30-cm-long sediment core, representing the past similar to 160 years, from Nam Co, an endorheic lake, was analyzed for subfossil chironomid assemblages and sediment geochemistry. In total, 25 chironomid morphotypes were identified. Nineteen were considered as non-rare taxa (abundances >= 2%) and six as rare taxa (abundances <2%). Since 1956 ce, higher chironomid richness (S = 19) is evident compared to the previous 100 years. The simultaneous decrease in the abundance of profundal Micropsectra radialis-type and increase of both Chironomus and Procladius, taxa adapted to more eurytopic and slightly warmer water bodies, indicate increasing water temperatures and intensified primary productivity. The dominance of littoral chironomid assemblages reflects increasing lake water levels, flooded shorelines and expansion of littoral areas driven by increased precipitation and glacial meltwater input both resulting from the increase in air temperatures. This scenario is confirmed by increases in total nitrogen and Zr/Rb ratios, indicating higher productivity and coarser grain size as a consequence of increased runoff via the Niya Qu. These hydrological changes have resulted in a positive water balance that can be linked to an increase in moisture supply from the Indian summer monsoon and glacier melt, reflecting increasing temperatures and precipitation since 1956 ce, ultimately driven by anthropogenic warming.

A Random Forest-Based Multi-Index Classification (RaFMIC) Approach to Mapping Three-Decadal Inundation Dynamics in Dryland Wetlands Using Google Earth Engine	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						random forest; Google Earth Engine; inundation mapping; Landsat; spectral indices; wetlands	DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; MACQUARIE MARSHES; SURFACE-WATER; LANDSAT DATA; TIME-SERIES; RIVER; FLOODPLAIN; FLOW; MODIS; NDWI	Australian inland riparian wetlands located east of the Great Dividing Range exhibit unique, hydroecological characteristics. These flood-dependent aquatic systems located in water-limited regions are declining rapidly due to the competitive demand for water for human activities, as well as climate change and variability. However, there exist very few reliable data to characterize inundation change conditions and quantify the impacts of the loss and deterioration of wetlands. A long-term time record of wetland inundation maps can provide a crucial baseline to monitor, assess, and assist the management and conservation of wetland ecosystems. This study presents a random forest-based multi-index classification algorithm (RaFMIC) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently construct a temporally dense, three-decadal time record of inundation maps of the southeast Australian riparian inland wetlands. The method was tested over the Macquarie Marshes located in the semiarid region of NSW, Australia. The results showed a good accuracy when compared against high-spatial resolution imagery. The total inundated area was consistent with precipitation and streamflow patterns, and the temporal dynamics of vegetation showed good agreement with the inundation maps. The inundation time record was analysed to generate inundation probability maps, which were in a good agreement with frequently flooded areas simulated by a hydrodynamic model and the distribution of flood-dependent vegetation species. The long-term, time-dense inundation maps derived from the RaFMIC method can provide key information to assess the condition and health of wetland ecosystems and have the potential to improve wetland inventory with spatially explicit water regime information. RaFMIC can be adapted over other dryland wetlands, as an effective semiautomated method of mapping long-term inundation dynamics.

J	Di Maio, F; Marchetti, S; Zio, E				Di Maio, Francesco; Marchetti, Stefano; Zio, Enrico			A framework of sensitivity analysis for the performance assessment of safety barriers impacted by NaTech accidents	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION			English	Article						NaTech; Safety barriers; Sensitivity analysis; Value of Information; CVaR; Beta measure	EVENTS; ARAMIS	Hazardous Natural events can cascade into Technological accidental scenarios (so called NaTech accidents). The occurrence of these accidents can degrade the performance of the preventive and mitigative safety barriers installed in the technological plants. Such performance degradation is typically assessed by expert judgement, without considering the effect of the magnitude of the natural hazard, nor its increasing frequency of occurrence in view of climate change. In this work, a novel sensitivity analysis framework is developed to identify the safety barriers whose performance degradation is most critical and thus needs careful modeling for realistic risk assessment. The framework is based on the calculation of a set of sensitivity measures, namely the Beta, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and the Value of Information (VoI), ? and their use to prioritize the safety barriers with respect to the need of: ? accounting for performance degradation during an accidental scenario; ? planning investments for further characterization of the safety barrier performance. An application is shown with respect to a case study of literature that consists of a chemical facility equipped with five safety barriers (of three different types, active, passive and procedural). NaTech scenarios can occur, triggered by floods and earthquakes. The results obtained with the Beta measure indicate that two-out-of-five barriers (one active and one passive) deserve accurate modelling of the performance degradation due to natural events. An additional outcome is that in the case study considered, both CVaR and VoI rank the passive barrier as the most effective in mitigating the sce-narios escalation: therefore, this barrier is the one for which the decision maker could decide to invest resources for improving the characterization of its performance to obtain a more realistic assessment of the risk.

Urban fluvial systems are highly complex, depending on a myriad of interacting variables. Numerous hydraulic models are available for analyzing urban flooding; however, meeting the demand of high spatial extension and finer discretization and solving the physics-based numerical equations are computationally expensive. Computational efforts increase drastically with an increase in model dimension and resolution, preventing current solutions from fully realizing the data revolution. In this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, machine learning (ML) methods including the emerging deep learning (DL) to quantify urban flooding considering the lower part of Darby Creek, PA, USA. Training datasets comprise multiple geographic and urban hydraulic features (e.g., coordinates, elevation, water depth, flooded locations, discharge, average slope, and the impervious area within the contributing region, downstream distance from stormwater outfalls and dams). ML Classifiers such as logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are used to identify the flooded locations. A Deep neural network (DNN)-based regression model is used to quantify the water depth. The values of the evaluation matrices indicate satisfactory performance both for the classifiers and DNN model (F-1 scores- 0.975, 0.991, 0.892, and 0.855 for binary classifiers; root mean squared error- 0.027 for DNN regression). In addition, the blocked K-folds Cross Validation (CV) of ML classifiers in detecting flooded locations showed satisfactory performance with the average accuracy of 0.899, which validates the models to generalize to the unseen area. This approach is a significant step towards resolving the complexities of urban fluvial flooding with a large multi-dimensional dataset in a highly computationally efficient manner.

Methods: Starting in April 2018, the Texas Flood Registry (TFR) invited residents to complete an online survey regarding their experiences with Hurricane Harvey and subsequent flooding events. Starting in April 2020, participants nationwide were invited to complete a brief online survey on their experiences during the pandemic. This study includes participants in the TFR (N = 20,754) and the COVID-19 Registry (N = 8568) through October 2020 (joint N = 2929). Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between expo-sure to flooding events and the economic and mental health impacts of COVID-19. Results: Among COVID-19 registrants, 21% experienced moderate to severe anxiety during the pandemic, and 7% and 12% of households had difficulty paying rent and bills, respectively. Approximately 17% of Black and 15% of Hispanic households had difficulty paying rent, compared to 5% of non-Hispanic white households. The odds of COVID-19 income loss are 1.20 (1.02, 1.40) times higher for those who previously had storm-related home damage compared to those who did not and 3.84 (3.25-4.55) times higher for those who experienced Harvey income loss compared to those who did not. For registrants for whom Harvey was a severe impact event, the odds of having more severe anxiety during the pandemic are 5.14 (4.02, 6.58) times higher than among registrants for whom Harvey was a no meaningful impact event. Conclusions: Multiple crises can jointly and cumulatively shape health and wellbeing outcomes. This knowledge can help craft emergency preparation and intervention programs.

This paper investigates the precipitation variations of the Yangtze Delta Megalopolis by using precipitation reanalysis data under conditions of dynamic urban sprawl. Compared with current precipitation characteristic analyses, which are often based on a limited number of ground rainfall stations, the approach followed in this study comprises a grid-based statistical method using large sets of samples with a uniform distribution and a same representative grid area. This novel approach of dynamic sampling is applied in this study to overcome the temporal and spatial inconsistency of stationary sampling. This approach allows to examine the impact of urbanization on regional precipitation characteristics. The Yangtze Delta Megalopolis (YDM) region, one of the most developed regions in China, was selected as a case study to evaluate the impact of urbanization on subsequent precipitation features. The results reveal that the annual total precipitation (TP) and the maximum daily precipitation (MDP) in both urban and non-urban areas of the YDM region generally have increased during the past 30 years. Hence, the region has become increasingly humid. Extrema of annual MDP and TP show obvious spatial characteristics, in which most maxima are located in the southern part of YDM while minima are more concentrated in the northern part. This newly developed approach has potentials for application in studies where underlying surface features exhibit rapid alterations. The findings of this case study provide relevant information for planning and design of regional water resources management, flood risk management, and planning of the urban drainage system of the YDM region.

We take advantage of a natural field experiment in the semi-arid to arid Henry Mountains, Utah, USA: large spatial differences in bed and bank vegetation are found along some alluvial channels due to localized perennial springs caused by aquicludes in the underlying bedrock. Airborne LiDAR topography and flood modeling are used to constrain channel morphology, vegetation density, and flow velocity at different flood discharges for three spring-fed reaches along intermittently flowing streams. The spatial distribution of vegetation quantitatively influences both the magnitude and direction of channel adjustment. Reaches with abundant bed vegetation are significantly wider (by an average of approximate to 50%), with shallower flows and lower velocities, than reaches with little bed vegetation. Reaches with dense channel bank vegetation are approximate to 25% narrower and approximate to 25% deeper than sparsely vegetated reaches. We interpret that sediment grain size influences the spatial distribution of vegetation within spring reaches, but that bank vegetation may be more important than grain size for "threshold" width adjustments. Widths, depths, and velocities are fairly insensitive to whether local hydraulic roughness is parameterized in terms of local vegetation density or is assumed spatially constant, suggesting that the underlying "bare earth" topography of the channel bed and banks exerts more control on local flow than does local vegetation density in this landscape.

Therefore, based on precipitation and temperature data for the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), as well as teleconnection indices (i.e., Nino3.4, North Pacific Index [NPI], Southern Oscillation Indices [SOI], and Pacific Decadal Oscillation [PDO]), the causal relationship between the teleconnection indices and the dry/wet changes was analyzed and explored using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) from 1961 to 2018. Based on the findings, precipitation significantly increased in the upper and lower reaches of the YRB, with a maximum increase of 8 mm/a, and decreased in the middle reaches, with a maximum decrease of 4 mm/a. Further, the temperature in the entire YRB increased, with a maximum increase of 0.04 degrees C/a. The drought characteristics derived from SPI in the YRB were more uniform in spatial distribution from 1961 to 2018, with small local differences and the largest proportion of mild droughts in different drought classes; however, for those from SPEI in the YRB, local differences in spatial distribution and the largest proportion of moderate droughts in different drought classes were found. Finally, both linear and nonlinear causality between the teleconnection indices and the wet/dry changes in the YRB were significant to some extent, especially for NAO, Nino 3.4, and PDO. These causalities between the wet/dry changes and the teleconnection indices were also more significant for short periods. Related studies are important for assessing the driving forces of dry-wet changes in the YRB.

However, much less is known about how people perceive these environments and their importance for non-material aspects of human well-being. As climate change and sea-level rise render these environments increasingly vulnerable, there is a need to better understand how saltmarshes are valued. This is because these values influence-and are influenced by-the ways in which people interact with places and therefore gain well-being benefits from them. These values also shape management decisions, which in turn affect the well-being of people and environment. To address this need, we use a multimodal qualitative approach (mobile interviews, photo elicitations, mapping and word association) to explore the values held in connection to saltmarshes at two Welsh case study sites: the Taf Estuary in Carmarthenshire and the Mawddach Estuary in Gwynedd. We find that saltmarshes are ambiguous places, not having one obvious meaning, and being open to more than one interpretation. They are both known and unknown; valued and (literally) overlooked. We suggest that this ambiguousness is related to both the physical characteristics of saltmarshes, which change and shift on short and long time-scales, as well as to the ways in which people (can) relate with them. We discuss how ambiguity renders saltmarshes as places of exclusive, privileged human-nature relationships, and reflect on the implications of our findings for human well-being and the management of threatened environments. We also consider how multimodal, in-depth and place-based methods such as ours provide ways in which to explore the more intangible and changeable values associated with particular habitats.

Sixty years of data, from 1960-2019, are used to track the changes to the flood pulse there. We find that minimum water levels over 2010-2019 increased by up to 1.55 m at Kratie and maximum water levels decreased by up to 0.79 m at Prek Kdam when compared to 1960-1991 levels, causing a reduction of the annual flood extent. Concurrently, the duration of the flooding season has decreased by about 26 d (Kampong Cham) and 40 d (Chaktomuk), with the season starting later and ending much earlier. Along the Tonle Sap River, the average annual reverse flow from the Mekong to the Tonle Sap Lake has decreased by 56.5 %, from 48.7 km(3) in 1962-1972 to 31.7 km(3) in 2010-2018. As a result, wet-season water levels at Tonle Sap Lake dropped by 1.05 m in 2010-2019 compared to 1996-2009, corresponding to a 20.6 % shrinkage of the lake area. We found that upstream contributors such as current hydropower dams cannot fully account for the observed decline in flood pulse. Instead, local anthropogenic causes such as irrigation and channel incision are important drivers. We estimate that water withdrawal in the Cambodian floodplains is occurring at a rate of (2.1 +/- 0.3) km(3) yr(-1). Sediment decline and ongoing sand-mining operations have also caused channel erosion. As the flood pulse is essential for the ecological habitats, fisheries and livelihoods of the region, its reduction will have major implications throughout the basin, from the Tonle Sap system to the Vietnamese Mekong Delta downstream.

The frequent variation in the hydrological and meteorological variables poses a higher probability of dam failure, highlighting the need to improve pertinent risk assessment approaches to predict failure risks, considering the uncertain states of such variables. Bayesian networks (BN) analysis has been a key risk assessment tool for decades; however, BN's static acyclic nature is a recognized drawback. In this paper, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) is coupled with a BN model to enable the dynamic assessment of dam failure risk. In this respect, BN is used to represent the interrelation among the system variables and simulate the propagation of uncertainties throughout the system, whereas the CTMC is adopted to describe the continuous transition of the system variables over their respective states. To demonstrate its applicability, the developed coupled BN-CTMC model was employed to predict the probability of failure of the Daisy Lake Dam in the province of British Columbia, Canada, under the uncertainty of reservoir water level, inflow, and wind speed states. The developed BN-CTMC modeling approach can aid in the development of reliable dam operation schemes and risk mitigation strategies through (1) adequately representing the propagation of the hydrological (e.g., inflow and reservoir water level) and meteorological (e.g., wind speed) variable uncertainties through dam system dynamical processes; (2) effectively quantifying dam failure risk under different operational conditions and failure scenarios; (3) accurately specifying the critical periods of dam system operational safety; and (4) providing in-depth understanding of the relationships between the dam system's failure and associated variables over time.

Additionally, sea level rise (SLR) can cause reduction and redistribution of wetlands across the low-lying coastal landscape. This study applied a coupled storm surge and waves model to the Chesapeake Bay regions that are prone to SLR. Two historical storms of low and high wind intensity were simulated for current and potential future sea-level and land cover conditions. The future scenarios incorporated projections of local SLR and land use due to potential reduction and changes in coastal wetlands. Simulated flood depths were used in depth-damage functions to estimate prospective property damages, and were combined with population density information to estimate potential number of people at risk. The results showed that, depending on storm intensity, the total flooded area can increase from the baseline by 1.3-2.3 times in the minimum SLR scenario, and by 2.1-4.7 times in the maximum SLR scenario. The maximum SLR was estimated to cause approximately $5.8 billion to $8.6 billion in additional damages and potentially to affect 1-1.2 million people more than the number affected in current conditions. Results also suggest that the low-intensity storm was projected to have greater impacts in the future than the high-intensity storm today, indicating that even relatively weak storms may cause considerable damage to coastal communities in a future with SLR. Finally, flooding, property damage, and the number of people affected in the future scenarios were exacerbated by wetlands reduction and change-in other words, the protective services currently provided by natural lands in coastal areas can be diminished in the future with SLR.

Geospatial technologies such as satellite remote sensing are helpful to identify such vegetation dynamics. This paper investigates the landfall impact of Hurricane Irma on canopy cover in the Santa Fe River Basin (Florida), which occurred in August 2017. Specifically, this study explores the effect of Hurricane Irma on vegetation dynamics via biophysical and biochemical features during the pre and post hurricane landfall. The geospatial analysis compares a suite of remote sensing spectral indices including enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and global vegetation moisture index (GVMI). It is noticeable that paired spectral indices such as EVI-LST, GVMI-LST, LAI-LST, EVI-GVMI, EVI-LAI, LAI-FPAR, EVI-FPAR, and LAI-GVMI reflecting the dependent relationships between biophysical and biochemical features reveal varying level of logistic trends under Irma landfall impact. In addition, the evolution of these biophysical and biochemical features associated with the vegetation cover was analyzed in terms of the functional capacity over grassland, evergreen forested land, deciduous forested land, and agricultural land, to understand watershed response following Irma landfall. The functional capacity of the ecosystem reduced in terms of EVI and LAI over these four land-over patterns due to the landfall of Hurricane Irma. The interactions between agricultural land variation and flooding impact before and after the hurricane landfall further entail human impact on natural system in a food-water nexus.

In this area, rice is the main annual crop and the main revenues source for farmers. However, Italian climatic condition led to a traditional cultivation characterized by continuous flooding, causing emissions of methane into the atmosphere due to the organic matter fermentation in anaerobic conditions, and, consequently, a high environmental impact. The water conditions of paddy fields also affect heavy metals uptake by rice plants. In this context, this study focuses on the evaluation of environmental impact and of heavy metal content in paddy rice, and it may represent an important step in mitigating the environmental impact of rice production. In detail, this study quantifies the environmental benefits related to the adoption of an alternative water management characterized by an additional aeration period during stem elongation. To this purpose, field trials were carried out and the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was applied with a cradle-to-farm gate perspective. The potential environmental impact of the production of two rice varieties (Camaroli and Caravaggio) was analysed in terms of 12 different impact categories and dehulled rice grain were analysed for arsenic and cadmium content. Alternative flooding decreases CH4 emissions in all cases evaluated (from 15% to 52%), resulting in a reduction in the climate change impact of rice cultivation (from 12% to 32%). Furthermore, the alternative water management does not influence grain yield and it reduces all the other environmental impact categories in 2 out of 4 cases. Regarding the heavy metals contents, the arsenic content in the grain decreases in all alternative scenarios, whereas the cadmium content increases, while remaining well below the legal limits.

Like many islands in the Pacific Ocean, the coastal population of New Caledonia is exposed to tsunamis triggered by powerful earthquakes. Intersecting exhaustive population data with high-resolution building location data within a user-defined coastal fringe is an accurate means of geolocating vulnerable residents, and an important step towards disaster risk reduction. This paper presents a mixed methodology built on GIS-based dasymetric techniques for assessing, classifying, and mapping population distribution in New Caledonia, with the aim of quantifying and ranking the areas most vulnerable to tsunami-related hazards. Results reveal that 33% of the population, inclusive of previously unmapped precarious housing, lives between sea level and the 10 m elevation contour in well-defined clusters. A pilot field survey of 412 respondents was additionally conducted in the capital Noume ' a (66% of the nation's population) to assess tsunami awareness, risk perception, and risk-related behavioral patterns among the ethnically and demographically diverse population. By further mapping the spatial association between coastal population concentrations, the perceived natural shielding capacities of coral reefs and mangroves, and the benefits of alarm siren networks, the study delivers a comprehensive assessment of the country's disaster preparedness, with policy recommendations for the future. The methodology is transferable to other types of hazards and other insular settings where civil security and risk-management organizations acquire and curate reliable primary data but may also need guidelines for transforming them into serviceable disaster risk reduction methods and policies.

J	Farahmand, H; Dong, SJ; Mostafavi, A				Farahmand, Hamed; Dong, Shangjia; Mostafavi, Ali			Network analysis and characterization of vulnerability in flood control infrastructure for system-level risk reduction	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Risk reduction; Network analysis; Vulnerability; Flood control network; Flood	HYDROLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE; COASTAL MEGACITIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; PROPAGATION; TRANSPORT; SEDIMENT; DRAINAGE; ASSETS	The number of catastrophic events such as extreme rainfalls and hurricanes has been growing. These events pose a major threat to the life safety and economic prosperity of urban regions. Flood control networks play a pivotal role in mitigating the risk associated with the stormwater generated by extreme rainfalls and hurricanes. The objective of this study is to propose a framework to examine the vulnerability in flood control infrastructure networks. This framework applies graph theory concepts and tools to define a vulnerability index for flood control network components (e.g., channels and rivers). The topological attributes of flood control networks are used to determine the vulnerability index based on structural attributes of flood control networks. First, a flood control network is modeled as a directed graph and storage facilities are incorporated into the network. Second, co-location exposure, upstream channel susceptibility, and discharge redundancy are characterized as important vulnerability attributes of a channel in flood control network. Then, these three characteristics are formulized based on the topological attributes of the network and characteristics of channels. The vulnerability index is then determined based on the three vulnerability characteristics. The proposed vulnerability index can be used to evaluate the impact of different risk reduction policies on flood control network vulnerability and determine the optimal mitigation strategies aiming at flood risk reduction, such as widening vulnerable channels, placement of storage facilities in the network or increasing the redundancy of the network. The framework is implemented on two watersheds in Harris County (Texas, USA) and the results' implications for decision-making in infrastructure management and hazard mitigation planning are discussed. The results highlight the capability of the proposed graph-based framework to inform flood risk reduction through evaluation of the vulnerability of infrastructure networks.

Glacial lake expansion and the corresponding volume increase play major roles in GLOFs as well as climate change. Furthermore, mass movement and dam conditions play a major role in the GLOF initiation process. Recently, because of global warming, glacial lakes in the central Himalayas have been expanding rapidly. Owing to a lack of systematic assessment and meticulous field surveys, people living downstream are at great risk of GLOFs. Comprehensive investigations and assessment of the relationships among lake expansion, lake dam conditions, and GLOF risk are urgently needed. In this study, we surveyed Jialong Co, a typical end-moraine dammed lake in Poiqu River in the central Himalayas by using Landsat and Sentinel satellite images from the past 32 years, field work, and depth measurements using an unmanned surface vessel on August 28, 2020. The results showed that Jialong Co had experienced slow-quick-slow expansion, increasing in area from 0.13 +/- 0.03 to 0.60 +/- 0.02 km(2). The lake bathymetric map revealed that the lake volume was (3.75 +/- 0.38) x 10(7) m(3) in 2020. Lake expansion occurred in the area from which the mother glacier retreated, indicating a close connection between the lake and its mother glacier and revealing that topography controlled the lake expansion process. Furthermore, thorough field work revealed that outlet dynamics and external water erosion are vulnerable elements in the disaster chain that initiate and affect the GLOF hazard of Jialong Co. Overall, this case study could help scholars understand the expansion mechanism of end-moraine dammed lakes and aid in hazard assessment of glacial lakes in the central Himalayas.

Satellite image-based investigation of the seasonal variations in the hydrological connectivity of a large floodplain (Poyang Lake, China)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological connectivity; Remote sensing; Floodplain wetland; Poyang Lake; River-lake system	YANGTZE-RIVER FLOW; WATER INDEX NDWI; WETLAND CONNECTIVITY; TROPICAL FLOODPLAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INUNDATION; SYSTEM; CATCHMENT; DYNAMICS; QUALITY	Hydrological processes of floodplains in large river-lake systems are subjected to strong flood pulses from catchment flows and lake inundations. Hydrological connectivity (HC) is one of the important characteristics of floodplains that can be used to provide evidence of mass and energy transport that influences the health of ecosystems and the biological productivity of floodplain water bodies. This study used geostatistical methods in combination with remote sensing data (2000-2015) to investigate the hydrological connectivity in a complex river-lake floodplain (Nanji Wetland National Natural Reserve) of the Poyang Lake floodplain, which is naturally connected to the middle Yangtze River. The geomorphic characteristics of the study area were characterized by the connection of surface water bodies including rivers, wetlands, sub-lakes and main lake. Results of this research indicated the apparent seasonal shifts of the dominant hydrological factors that affect the spatial-temporal changes of HC. In particular, we find that the main lake stage plays a dominant role in determining the hydrological connectivity during the lake's flooding and receding periods. We also find the existence of a threshold that causes an abrupt change of HC, i.e., if the main lake stage is below this threshold, the whole system becomes weakly hydrologically-connected. This threshold is related to the local topography, but has ecological implications for the entire floodplain system. The outcomes of this research provide an improved understanding of the hydrological behaviour of the catchment-floodplain-lake system. Considering the encountering of consistent drought of the lakes in the middle Yangtze River, this work may help clarify the intensity of the drought impacts on the ecologically important floodplains, and also assist in optimizing the interactions between the lake and the Yangtze River.

A predictive model for seasonal pond counts in the United States Prairie Pothole Region using large-scale climate connections	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Prairie Pothole Region; canonical correlation analysis; predictive model; pond count	SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; NORTH-DAKOTA; WATER LEVELS; WETLANDS; HYDROLOGY; SST	The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), located in central North America, is an important region hydrologically and ecologically. Millions of wetlands, many containing ponds, are located here, and they serve as habitats for various biota and breeding grounds for waterfowl. They also provide carbon sequestration, sediment and nutrient attenuation, and floodwater storage. Land modification and climate change are threatening the PPR, and water and wildlife managers face important conservation decisions due to these threats. We developed predictive, multisite forecasting models using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for pond counts in the southeast PPR, the portion located within the United States, to aid in these important decisions. These forecast models predict spring (May) and summer (July) pond counts for each region (stratum) of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's pond and waterfowl surveys using a suite of antecedent, large-scale climate variables and indices including 500 millibar heights, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Models were developed to issue forecasts at the start of all preceding months beginning on March 1st. The models were evaluated for their performance in a predictive mode by leave-one-out cross-validation. The models exhibited good performance (R values above 0.6 for May forecasts and 0.4 for July forecasts), with performance increasing as lead time decreased. This simple and versatile modeling approach offers a robust tool for efficient management and sustainability of ecology and natural resources. It demonstrates the ability to use large-scale climate variables to predict a local variable in a skilful way and could serve as an example to develop similar models for use in management and conservation decisions in other regions and sectors of the environment.

The research to date shows a considerable potential of NBS to address the current challenges related to climate change and geo-hydrological risks. Despite significant interest in NBS by researchers and practitioners, knowledge concerning their practical implementation, monitoring, and evaluation is still lacking. This is particularly true for large-scale NBS. The present paper discusses how such solutions can be implemented in the context of hydro-meteorological risk reduction in small Mediterranean catchments with a strong tourist vocation. The work presented here is situated within the RECONECT Project (Regenerating ECOsystems with Nature-based solutions for hydro-meteorological risk rEduCTion), which aims to contribute to a European reference framework on NBS by demonstrating, upscaling, and replicating large-scale NBS in rural and natural areas. The Italian case study of RECONECT is the Portofino Natural Regional Park, which represents a unique natural landscape element with high ecologic, social, and economic (touristic) value, which is threatened by a range of geo-hydrological hazards, such as flash floods, hyper-concentrated floods, shallow landslides, rockfalls, and storm surges. This paper also presents details of NBS interventions in two pilot catchments (San Fruttuoso and Paraggi) visited by thousands of tourists throughout the year. It addresses some of the key aspects related to monitoring meteorological and hydrological processes, as well as remote sensing activities (i.e., LiDAR surveys), which are necessary for the identification of critical-instability areas along waterways and the reconstruction of dry stone walls. Lastly, a discussion of relevant mitigation and adaptation strategies that are potentially replicable at national and international levels is also provided.

It is a crucial variable of various economic and process-based models. Rice is grown under irrigated triple- and double-rice cropping systems and a rainfed single-rice cropping system in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). These rice cropping systems are adopted according to the geographical location and water infrastructure. However, little work has been done to map triple-cropping of rice using Sentinel-1 along with the effects of water infrastructure on the rice cropping intensity decision. This study is focused on monitoring rice cropping patterns in the An Giang province of the VMD from March 2017 to March 2018. The fieldwork was carried out on the dates close to the Sentinel-1A acquisition. The results of dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1A data show a strong correlation with the spatial patterns of various rice growth stages and their association with the water infrastructure. The VH backscatter (sigma degrees) is strongly correlated with the three rice growth stages, especially the reproductive stage when the backscatter is less affected by soil moisture and water in the rice fields. In all three cropping patterns, sigma degrees VV and sigma degrees VH show the highest value in the maturity stage, often appearing 10 to 12 days before the harvesting of the rice. A rice cropping pattern map was generated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of Sentinel-1A data. The overall accuracy of the classification was 80.7% with a 0.78 Kappa coefficient. Therefore, Sentinel-1A can be used to understand rice phenological changes as well as rice cropping systems using radar backscattering.

J	Saha, TK; Pal, S				Saha, Tamal Kanti; Pal, Swades			Exploring physical wetland vulnerability of Atreyee river basin in India and Bangladesh using logistic regression and fuzzy logic approaches	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Physical wetland vulnerability; Fuzzy logic; Logistic regression and hydraulic model	HIERARCHY PROCESS AHP; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; FREQUENCY RATIO; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOODPLAIN INUNDATION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; IMPACT; GIS; MANAGEMENT	In spite of the immense ecological importance of the wetland, wetland habitats are losing their existence in the floodplain regions. In the present study, we have explored the nature of the physical vulnerability of wetland using logistic regression (LR) and fuzzy logic (FL) approaches for both pre and post-dam periods. LR is selected because initial vulnerable is identified and FL is used to explore the best possible alternative interwoven relation among the parameters. Seven parameters like (Water presence frequency (WPF) map, Flood inundation map (2d hydraulic model) (FIM), Frequency of pixel being non permanent (NPW), Agriculture presence frequency (APF) map, Fragmentation of wetland (FoW), Normalized differences built-up index (NDBI), and Wetland changes (WC)) are employed for this study. Result reveals that 9.97 and 8.99% wetland areas were under high and very high vulnerability as per LR model but it is increased to 23.35% and 12.52% in post-dam period. Similarly, as per FL model, very high vulnerable wetland habitat is increased from 9.93% to 25.28%. Sensitivity analysis using Kappa coefficient and Receiver operating curve shows the validity of the models. About 31-68% flow reduction in Atreyee river in post-dam period, squeezing of 25.80% active flood-prone zone, agricultural extensions are identified as the major reasons behind growing wetland vulnerability. Vulnerable wetland habitat will automatically reduce productivity and service capability of the wetland ecosystem. Cause optimization may be the vital step for reducing the vulnerability. Ecological flow estimation and downstream release of water can play a decisive role for arresting the growing trend of vulnerability.

The literature highlights that, despite the intensive research efforts to date, there is a lack of a commonly accepted hazard assessment framework that supports decision-making to limit their negative effects and contribute to the protection of cultural heritage. In this paper a general method for assessing the intensity of multiple hazards on cultural resources is developed and applied. The proposed method utilizes a) the capabilities of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), b) open geospatial hazard data and c) an original 7-step integrated method developed in this research. Key features of the proposed method are its ability to consider and synthesize intensities of both quantitative hazards such as earthquake, Hood and hazards expressed on a qualitative scale, such as wildfire and landslide. The proposed method is applied to assess the exposure of 918 cultural resources of the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece, to earthquake, Hood, landslide, sea level rise, wildfire, soil erosion and industrial-technological accident and develop an aggregate multi-hazard intensity index (mhii) for each of the cultural resources in this region. The proposed method can be applied to hazard intensity assessment for resources other than cultural, such as the human capital of a region, infrastructure, environment, and economic facilities. This provides researchers, scientists, and managers of cultural sites with a tool to set priorities for the design of appropriate mitigation strategies to reduce the negative impacts of hazards.

We extend prior research by investigating the association between multiple disasters and the risks of selfharm and suicide longitudinally in a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of adolescents 14 to 15 years to 18-19 years of age. Natural disasters were identified through parental self -reports for the local area. Different types of multiple disaster exposures were investigated including compound disasters (two or more disasters occurring in the last 12 months), cascading disasters (a disaster that leads to another disaster in the subsequent wave) and consecutive disasters (multiple disasters within the last two years or over an eight -year period). Using 8,714 person -waves of data from 2,908 adolescents, findings from random effect models suggest that parental reports of fire or floods increase the risk of self -harm ideation, self -harm, and suicidal ideation. Compound disasters of fire/flood and drought were also associated with increased risk of suicidal thoughts. Cascading disasters of drought followed by fire/flood increased the risks of self -harm but recurrent consecutive droughts were associated with lower risks of suicidal ideation. Australian adolescents are exposed to high rates of natural disasters that increase the risk of self -harm and thoughts of self -harm and suicide. Climate change will increase risk of natural disaster exposure for all countries. Despite these increased risks, there was resilience to disaster exposure particularly in the case of recurrent drought suggesting that youth, families and communities may well develop protective strategies to support mental health.

Flood inundation mapping is critical for better understanding which areas are prone to flooding and identifying emerging floods. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and timeliness of the production of these maps. In this study a new architecture, named Explainable Flood Inundation Mapping Network (XFIMNet) is presented, which is an explainable deep learning segmentation model for producing flood inundation maps from both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral optical images. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models is performed, where the versatility of the model is demonstrated, in that it achieves superior performance across both image types, while the SOTA models are less consistent. The models are further evaluated with only the red, green, and blue (RGB) bands of the Sentinel-2 images, demonstrating that the full 13-band image is the superior choice for training a deep learning model. XFIMNet achieves an Intersection Over Union (IOU) of 0.59 with SAR images, 0.7 with optical, and 0.47 with the RGB bands, outperforming each of the SOTA models, as well as providing the most detailed and accurate visual segmentation mask, with minimal increase in the computation time for training or inference. The findings of this study highlight that XFIMNet is not only able to provide the most accurate segmentation mask but also prioritizes the most appropriate features when making decisions across both image types.

Among the different nature-based solutions, multilayer bluegreen roofs have been widely recognized for their high capacity of reducing runoff generation from rooftops, and their additional storage layer enables to collect water, which could be reused for different purposes. However, the quality of the collected water in a multilayer blue-green roof and the influence that the additional storage layer has on it have not been analysed yet. Following this knowledge gap, we investigated the potential benefits of a multilayer blue-green roof installed in Cagliari, with respect to a traditional roof. The outflow triggered by artificial irrigation and natural rainfall events was analysed, both from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Results confirm the high contribution of multilayer blue-green roofs in mitigating runoff generation, which is however influenced by antecedent soil moisture and water level conditions. The outflow from the multilayer blue-green roof presents lower suspended solids and heavy metals concentrations than from a traditional roof. On the other hand, Carbon Oxigen Demand (COD) concentrations in the multilayer blue-green roof outflow exceed the limits defined by the Italian regulations (125 mg/l) for water discharge or reuse, partially due to the high residence time in the storage layer. Specific treatments could be planned to reuse the collected water for urban purposes.

J	Jang, BJ; Jung, IT				Jang, Bong-Joo; Jung, Intaek			Development of High-Precision Urban Flood-Monitoring Technology for Sustainable Smart Cities	SENSORS			English	Article						disaster response; flood monitoring; IoT; pure flow energy; radar sensor; urban flood	MODELS	Owing to rapid climate change, large-scale floods have occurred yearly in cities worldwide, causing serious damage. We propose a real-time urban flood-monitoring technology as an urban disaster prevention technology for sustainable and secure smart cities. Our method takes advantage of the characteristic that water flow is regularly detected at a certain distance with a constant Doppler velocity within the radar observation area. Therefore, a pure flow energy detection algorithm in this technology can accurately and immediately detect water flow due to flooding by effectively removing dynamic obstacles such as cars, people, and animals that cause changes in observation distance, and static obstacles that do not cause Doppler velocities. Specifically, in this method, the pure flow energy is detected by generating a two-dimensional range-Doppler relation map using 1 s periodic radar observation data and performing statistical analysis on the energy detected on the successive maps. Experiments to verify the proposed technology are conducted indoors and in real river basins. As a result of conducting experiments in a narrow indoor space that could be considered an urban underpass or underground facility, it was found that this method can detect flooding situations with centimeter-level accuracy by measuring water level and flow velocity in real time from the time of flood occurrence. And the experimental results in various river environments showed that our technology could accurately detect changes in distance and flow speed from the river surface. We also confirmed that this method could effectively eliminate moving obstacles within the observation range and detect only pure flow energy. Finally, we expect that our method will be able to build a high-density urban flood-monitoring network and a high-precision digital flood twin.

This was achieved by applying the Hydrological models (HEC-1and HMS) program using a unit Hydrograph namely SCS-CN. The drainage system and the identification of sub-basins were established using SRTM DEM, 90 m resolution. The maximum daily rainfall per year was investigated and determined for various return times using the statistical analysis tool Hyfran. Results reveal that the peak discharge (Qp) and flood volume value (Qv) of the Heliopolis watershed are 686.8 m3/s and 48039.8 m3, respectively. The obtained results for the various recurrence times during the regression periods of 5 and 100 years, reveal that the peak flood inflow of the Heliopolis basin ranged between 19.47 and 742.16 m3/s and the flood volume ranged between 1,295,110 and 53,752,968 m3. This shows that these valleys move a significant volume of water to be released into the mainstream. The recognition and forecasting of the degree of dangerous rain events can help planners and decision-makers in finding flooded areas before the future development of the new settlements.

Accurate prediction of floods is essential to mitigating flood losses in coastal cities. Physically based models cannot satisfy the demand for real-time prediction for urban flooding due to their computational complexity. In this study, we proposed a hybrid modeling approach for rapid prediction of urban floods, coupling the physically based model with the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model. A hydrological-hydraulic model was used to provide sufficient data for the LightGBM model based on the personal computer storm water management model (PCSWMM). The variables related to rainfall, tide level, and the location of flood points were used as the input for the LightGBM model. To improve the prediction accuracy, the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model are optimized by grid search algorithm and K-fold cross-validation. Taking Haidian Island, Hainan Province, China as a case study, the optimum values of the learning rate, number of estimators, and number of leaves of the LightGBM model are 0.11, 450, and 12, respectively. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of the LightGBM model on the test set is 0.9896, indicating that the LightGBM model has reliable predictions and outperforms random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). From the LightGBM model, the variables related to tide level were analyzed as the dominant variables for predicting the inundation depth based on the Gini index in the study area. The proposed LightGBM model provides a scientific reference for flood control in coastal cities considering its superior performance and computational efficiency.

The initiative relies on low-impact development (LID) techniques to integrate ecosystem conservation and urban development, with the aim to maintain or restore natural landscapes and their water regulating capacity as a way to mitigate urban flooding and associated pollution while augmenting water supply. While the country prepares for SCD demonstration and upscaling after pilot implementation since 2014, the initiative is subject to a design deficit in policy implementation that has received little consideration in both the literature and the policy arena but that negatively affects the effectiveness of SCD and its long run impact as intended by the policy. In this paper, we examine the design deficit by mapping and analyzing the policy implementation for SCD in the framework of theory of change (TOC). We present key conditions for individual components in SCD implementation to deliver causal pathways from program inputs to long-term impacts, with identified issues characterizing the design deficit. We provide an overview of the literature on SCD to shed some light on current research while identifying knowledge gaps. The paper proposes and justifies the framework of ecosystem services as an innovative design tool to deliver a systematic approach needed to address the design deficit, paving the pathways for SCD from inputs to impacts fully developing the policy potential for green urban transition with resilience and sustainability.

Wicked Environmental Problems in Banado La Estrella: Floods and Water Pollution of the Pilcomayo Basin and their Impact on Indigenous and Rural Communities	WETLANDS			English	Article						Gran Chaco; South America; Hydrosocial relations; Toba / Qomle'ec / Qom people	PLATA RIVER-BASIN; PROCHILODUS-LINEATUS; RIO-PILCOMAYO; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRAN-CHACO; EL-NINO; CONTAMINATION; POPULATION; DYNAMICS; TOBA	The Pilcomayo River is unique in several ways, including its massive sediment load, one of the world's largest alluvial fans, and a constantly changing channel that occasionally blocks and overflows over vast areas. Most of the northern half of the Province of Formosa (Argentina) is covered by the vast wetland system known as the Banado La Estrella, in the middle Pilcomayo basin. Due to repeated obstructions of the channel that functioned as the border between Argentina and Paraguay, the Banado La Estrella expanded from the 1920s until the 1990s, when both nations agreed to the Pantalon project: They divided the river in two out of concern over losing complete access to resources like water and fish. Since then, the middle Pilcomayo basin has been subject to constant engineering works to prevent further changes (dams, channel construction, and dredging), and efforts to promote conservation and ecotourism such as its declaration as one of the 7 New Natural Wonders of Argentina. This article analyzes three environmental problems of the middle Pilcomayo basin and Banado La Estrella that mainly affect rural and indigenous communities. Using the conceptual framework of wicked problems, we state that these issues are often conceptualized or explained in contradictory ways, both within and between different social groups. Also, they do not present straightforward solutions, but are best addressed with more democratic and bottom-up approaches. Finally, we suggest that science's function should be to contribute to basin resilience by enhancing these approaches and informing decisions while preserving complexity in the discussion.

Life-stage-dependent effects of multiple flood-associated stressors on a coastal foundational species	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; Crassostrea virginica; early life stages; flooding; larvae; multiple stressors; oyster reef; restoration; salinity; settlement; water quality	OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; MARINE INVERTEBRATE; OYSTER LARVAE; CARBONIC-ACID; FRESH-WATER; MORTALITY; SALINITY; SURVIVAL; GROWTH	Global changes in precipitation patterns have increased the frequency and duration of flooding events. Freshwater inflows into estuaries reduce salinity levels and increase nutrient inputs, which can lead to eutrophication and impaired water quality. Oysters are important ecosystem engineers in coastal environments that are vulnerable to co-occurring environmental stressors associated with freshwater flooding events. Successful recruitment is necessary to maintain adult oyster populations, but early life stage responses to multiple stressors are not well understood. Flood-associated stressor conditions were observed near oyster habitats at multiple locations across the northern Gulf of Mexico during peak recruitment months in the spring and summer of 2021. In the laboratory, we examined the interactive effects of acidification, hypoxia, and low salinity on larval and juvenile life stages of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) to better understand the impact of flooding events on oyster development and survival. Salinity stress in isolation reduced larval growth and settlement, and decreased survival and growth at the juvenile stage. Hypoxia was more stressful to oyster larvae than to juveniles, whereas low pH had negative effects on juvenile growth. There were no synergistic effects of multiple flood-associated stressors on early oyster life stages and effects were either additive or predicted by the salinity stress response. The negative impacts of flooding disturbances on recruitment processes in benthic populations need to be considered in restoration planning and flood control mitigation strategies as the frequency and intensity of extreme freshwater events continue to rise worldwide.

We analyze 7 years of continuous data gathered from eight geophone plates at a monitoring station in the glacier-fed Sulden/Solda River (South Tyrol, Italy) to estimate the bedload flux at 1-min scale. Sixty-five bedload samples were used to derive the calibration equations adopted to quantify the transported bedload mass. The signal power is proposed as a more effective metric than threshold-based impulses for calculating bedload masses. Results show (a) a remarkable variability of bedload rates for the same value of flow discharge, (b) the joint effect of storm-driven flood events and seasonal changes in sediment supply on bedload rates, and (c) the strong impact of climatic factors (i.e., temperature and snow cover) on bedload fluxes. Moderate bedload rates occurring in late spring/early summer are likely related to the mobilization of riverbed sediments, while sustained bedload transport during melt flows in July-August-corresponding to the effective bedload discharge range-is associated with the activation of glacial and proglacial sediment sources. The data set shows a complex climatic control on bedload transport at the basin scale, where precipitation, air temperature, and snow cover determine flow and glacier melting dynamics. These findings suggest how the effects of climate change in the Alps likely will lead to an increase in peak bedload rates in a context of declining annual bedload yields as melt flows will progressively reduce in the next decades.

An objective decision needs to be made for the choice of the modeling tools. However, this decision is complex because all parts of the process have inherent uncertainty. This paper provides a model selection with a filter sequence for flood forecasting applications in data scarce regions, using Kenya as an example building on the existing literature, concentrating on six aspects: (i) process representation, (ii) model applicability to different climatic and physiographic settings, (iii) data requirements and model resolution, (iv) ability to be downscaled to smaller scales, (v) availability of model code, and (vi) possibility of adoption of the model into an operation flood forecasting system. In addition, we review potential models based on the proposed criteria and apply a decision tree as a filter sequence to provide insights on the possibility of model applicability. We summarize and tabulate an evaluation of the reviewed models based on the proposed criteria and propose the potential model candidates for flood applications in Kenya. This evaluation serves as an objective model preselection criterion to propose a modeling tool that can be adopted in development and operational flood forecasting to the end-users of an early warning system that can help mitigate the effects of floods in data scarce regions such as Kenya.

J	Wang, J; Hu, YF; Li, ZH				Wang, Ji; Hu, Yufeng; Li, Zhenhong			A New Coherence Detection Method for Mapping Inland Water Bodies Using CYGNSS Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GNSS-R; CYGNSS; DDM; coherence; inland water detection; false alarms	SPACEBORNE GNSS-REFLECTOMETRY; SOIL-MOISTURE; AMAZON BASIN; COVER; CONGO; DISCHARGE; OCEAN; RIVER; MAP	Inland water is an important part of the Earth's water cycle. Mapping inland water is vital for understanding surface hydrology and climate change. Spaceborne global navigation satellite systems reflectometry (GNSS-R) has been proven to be an effective technique to detect inland water bodies. This paper proposes a new method to map inland water bodies using the delay-Doppler map (DDM) measurements provided by the GNSS-R platform Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS). In this new method, we develop a refined power ratio to identify the coherence in DDM caused by the inland water. Processed with an image segmentation method, the refined power ratio is then applied to discriminate the permanent inland water bodies from the land. Using CYGNSS data over the Amazon Basin and the Congo Basin in 2020, we successfully generated water masks with a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees. Compared with the reference optical water masks, the overall detection accuracy in the Amazon Basin is 94.48% and the water detection accuracy is 92.23%, and the corresponding accuracies in the Congo Basin are 96.12% and 93.16%, respectively. Compared with the previous DDM power-spread detector (DPSD) method, the new method's false alarms and misses in the Amazon Basin are reduced by 17.1% and 9.1%, respectively, while the false alarms and misses in the Congo Basin are reduced by 10.2% and 22%, respectively. Moreover, our method is proven to be useful for detecting short-term flood inundation.

We reconstructed the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of a lake site in North China Plain during the mid-Holocene warm period, in order to provide reference data for assessing possible futures changes in the ecological environment in the context of ongoing climate change. The reconstruction is based on the chronology, sedimentology and pollen assemblages of two sedimentary sequences from the Lake Baiyangdian area, which are used to determine the regional vegetation composition and paleotemperature of the hinterland of the North China Plain during the mid-Holocene. The results show that the extent and distribution of Lake Baiyangdian varied due to river channel changes, which also affected the sedimentary facies and the patterns of erosion and accumulation. The pollen assemblages from the lacustrine deposits are derived from the entire catchment of Lake Baiyangdian and they reflect regional patterns of climatic and environmental change. During the mid-Holocene, mixed broadleaf-coniferous forest dominated the western mountains and hills, intrazonal grassland developed on the alluvial fans, and lake-swamp-floodplain environments developed in the hinterland of the North China Plain. Statistical analysis of the modern distribution and climate thresholds of Ceratopteris were used to estimate the mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean January temperature (MJaT) of the Lake Baiyangdian area during the mid-Holocene, which were respectively 3.5 degrees C and 7.7 degrees C higher than today. Our findings provide a scientific basis for landscape reconstruction and paleoclimate modelling in North China.

Effects of Reversal of Water Flow in an Arctic Floodplain River on Fluvial Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						carbon dioxide; methane; Arctic rivers; permafrost; riverine carbon; streamflow	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; CARBON-DIOXIDE; HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY; PERMAFROST CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GAS-EXCHANGE; WIND-SPEED; METHANE; LAND; STREAMS	When organic matter from thawed permafrost is released, the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs), like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in Arctic rivers will be influenced in the future. However, the temporal variation, environmental controls, and magnitude of the Arctic riverine GHGs are largely unknown. We measured in situ high temporal resolution concentrations of CO2, CH4, and oxygen (O-2) in the Ambolikha River in northeast Siberia between late June and early August 2019. During this period, the largely supersaturated riverine CO2 and CH4 concentrations decreased steadily by 90% and 78%, respectively, while the O-2 concentrations increased by 22% and were driven by the decreasing water temperature. Estimated gas fluxes indicate that during late June 2019, significant emissions of CO2 and CH4 were sustained, possibly by external terrestrial sources during flooding, or due to lateral exchange with gas-rich downstream-flowing water. In July and early August, the river reversed its flow constantly and limited the water exchange at the site. The composition of dissolved organic matter and microbial communities analyzed in discrete samples also revealed a temporal shift. Furthermore, the cumulative total riverine CO2 emissions (36.8 gC-CO2 m(-2)) were nearly five times lower than the CO2 uptake at the adjacent floodplain. Emissions of riverine CH4 (0.21 gC-CH4 m(-2)) were 16 times lower than the floodplain CH4 emissions. Our study revealed that the hydraulic connectivity with the land in the late freshet, and reversing flow directions in Arctic streams in summer, regulate riverine carbon replenishment and emissions.

Management of Urban Waters with Nature-Based Solutions in Circular Cities-Exemplified through Seven Urban Circularity Challenges	WATER			English	Article						blue-green infrastructure; climate change and mitigation; sustainable water management; urban circularity challenges; water reuse	EXTENSIVE GREEN ROOFS; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; FLOOD RISK; ENERGY; FRAMEWORK; WASTE; REUSE; INFRASTRUCTURE	Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been proven to effectively mitigate and solve resource depletion and climate-related challenges in urban areas. The COST (Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action CA17133 entitled "Implementing nature-based solutions (NBS) for building a resourceful circular city" has established seven urban circularity challenges (UCC) that can be addressed effectively with NBS. This paper presents the outcomes of five elucidation workshops with more than 20 European experts from different backgrounds. These international workshops were used to examine the effectiveness of NBS to address UCC and foster NBS implementation towards circular urban water management. A major outcome was the identification of the two most relevant challenges for water resources in urban areas: 'Restoring and maintaining the water cycle' (UCC1) and 'Water and waste treatment, recovery, and reuse' (UCC2). s Moreover, significant synergies with 'Nutrient recovery and reuse', 'Material recovery and reuse', 'Food and biomass production', 'Energy efficiency and recovery', and 'Building system recovery' were identified. Additionally, the paper presents real-life case studies to demonstrate how different NBS and supporting units can contribute to the UCC. Finally, a case-based semi-quantitative assessment of the presented NBS was performed. Most notably, this paper identifies the most typically employed NBS that enable processes for UCC1 and UCC2. While current consensus is well established by experts in individual NBS, we presently highlight the potential to address UCC by combining different NBS and synergize enabling processes. This study presents a new paradigm and aims to enhance awareness on the ability of NBS to solve multiple urban circularity issues.

However, some taxa and regions worldwide still lack studies to verify this relationship. Phyllostomidae is the most ecologically diverse family of mammals worldwide, encompassing a great proportion of the species of mammals and bats across the Amazon forest. Even though the Amazon seems to be a homogeneous landscape with an unlimited supply of water, it presents a high variation in vegetation types and proximity to large bodies of water. In our study, we have analyzed the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and proximity to large bodies of water in the structure of phyllostomid assemblages (Chao-estimated species richness and capture rates). We have found that an increase in landscape heterogeneity associated with large bodies of water and representative flooded forest increase species richness. In addition, more heterogeneous landscapes in the presence of water have presented a higher abundance of bats. Our findings might be related with the small niche widths of phyllostomids, which could have promoted specialization in some landscape features, while the presence of water could have promoted an increase in food availability (insects and fruits), leading to an increase in phyllostomid richness and abundance. This is important information for planning where to place protected areas in the northeastern portion of the Amazon, while taking into account the consequences of drought and deforestation close to water bodies on the local phyllostomid fauna, and the maintenance of the ecosystem services provided by a higher bat diversity.

Based on the sedimentology of Dakangpu Layer, it is helpful to get a deeper understanding of the living environment of the "Jehol Biota." Varves are highly developed in the Dakangpu Bed of lower Cretaceous Yixian Basin in western Liaoning, China, supplying reliable and high-quality proxies to explore the palaeoclimate. This paper reconstructs the palaeo-lake environment and palaeoclimate, using petrography, facies associations, varves components, and geochemistry. Detailed petrographic studies helped to recognize 11 lithofacies which were grouped into two facies associations: Shallow lake and deep to semi-deep lake sequences. The delicate structure of varves in the Dakangpu Bed were divided into two categories: Clastic and endogenic. Additionally, two sub-types of clastic varves have been discovered, with distinct components, thickness, and distribution in vertical sequence. Nineteen representative samples of varves reveal that rare earth and trace elements have a similar change trend. The composition, formation, and preservation of the varves in the Dakangpu Bed depicted a deep lake, with stratified water and oxygen-depleted bottom layer environment. The U/Th ratios and V/Cr ratios are in the ranges of 0.37-1.55 and 0.97-10.47 respectively, supporting the redox environment's minor fluctuation. The varve thickness, flood frequency, sporopollenin collections, and geochemical data indicated that precipitation and humidity decreased gradually in the sedimentary period, and the climate changed to warmer and drier, with fluctuations in the middle to later periods.

Unprecedented heavy rainfall event over Yamunanagar, India during 14 July 2016: An observational and modelling study	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change impacts; extreme rainfall; extremes; forecasting; hazards; mesoscale convective system; modelling; NWP; precipitation	EXTREME PRECIPITATION EVENT; FLASH-FLOODING STORM; STEEP EDGE; SIMULATION; UTTARAKHAND; WESTERN; PARAMETERIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; CONVECTION; PREDICTION	Extreme rainfall events have posed several serious threats to many populated and urbanized areas in the world including the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, accurate predictions of their intensity and areas of influence are important for flood-prone risk assessments. On 14 July 2016, heavy to exceptionally heavy rainfall occurred in Yamunanagar (30.16 degrees N, 77.29 degrees E), located in the state of Haryana in North India, which led to widespread disruption of communication, electricity, inundation of houses, and so forth. The present paper aims at examining observational, synoptic, thermo-dynamical, and numerical features associated with this devastating rainfall episode. The analysis found that during extreme rainfall episodes, a trough in mid-tropospheric westerlies and a strong low-level atmospheric monsoonal flow seem to have strongly interacted with each other, creating a strong convergence zone near study areas that led to a severe rainstorm. The quasi-stationary supercells were also noticed due to continuous moisture incursions from the Bay of Bengal and orographic uplift over the Himalayas near Yamunanagar. A deep layer of wind shear interacts dynamically with the convergence zone and leads to a potential rainstorm. Thermodynamic indices indicate high instability over the heavy rainfall area. The dynamics of this event were studied in detail by using three-dimensional variational data assimilation within the weather research and forecasting model, configured with triple two-way nesting domains (27, 9, and 3 km). The model results show that the weather research and forecasting model satisfactorily captures the quantitative precipitation (300 mm) in 24 h over the Yamunanagar region as compared with observation (365 mm).

Therefore, research on urban flood risks has greatly increased over the past decade, with studies focusing on reducing the risk of flood disaster. From 2012 to 2020, the impervious underlying surface has increased, and the permeable underlying surface has decreased annually in Kunming City. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of continuous changes in the urban underlying surface on flood disasters in the Runcheng area south of Kunming City from 2012 to 2020. We constructed a two-dimensional flood model to conduct flood simulations and flood risk analysis for this area. The relationship between the permeability of the underlying surface and urban flood risk was simulated and analyzed by varying the urban underlying surface permeability (0-60%). The simulation results show that the model can accurately simulate urban waterlogging, and the increase in urban waterlogging risk is related to the underlying surface permeability. Urban flood risk decreases with the increase in permeable underlying surface. The increase rate of flood risk in the part with permeability of 0-35% is greater than that the part with permeability of 35-60%, that is, when the permeability of underlying surface is lower than 35%, the flood risk rate will be higher. We demonstrated the impact of the urban underlying surface permeability on the risk of urban flood disasters, which is useful for urban planning decisions and urban flooding risk controls.

Freshwater wetland plants respond nonlinearly to inundation over a sustained period	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						A-Ci curve; Cyperaceae; flooding; fructose; glucose; light curve; marsh; Poaceae; sucrose	EVERGLADES NATIONAL-PARK; PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSES; SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; EMERGENT MACROPHYTES; GROWTH-RESPONSES; EXCHANGE; FLORIDA; HYDROPERIOD; STRATEGIES	Premise Wetland plants regularly experience physiological stresses resulting from inundation; however, plant responses to the interacting effects of water level and inundation duration are not fully understood. Methods We conducted a mesocosm experiment on two wetland species, sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) and muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes), that co-dominate many freshwater wetlands in the Florida Everglades. We tracked photosynthesis, respiration, and growth at water levels of -10 (control), 10 (shallow), and 35 cm (deep) with reference to soil surface over 6 months. Results The response of photosynthesis to inundation was nonlinear. Specifically, photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) declined by 25% in sawgrass and by 70% in muhly grass after 1-2 months of inundation. After 4 months, A(max) of muhly grass in the deep-water treatment declined to near zero. Inundated sawgrass maintained similar leaf respiration and growth rates as the control, whereas inundated muhly grass suppressed both respiration and growth. At the end of the experiment, sawgrass had similar nonstructural carbohydrate pools in all treatments. By contrast, muhly grass in the deep-water treatment had largely depleted sugar reserves but maintained a similar starch pool as the control, which is critical for post-stress recovery. Conclusions Overall, the two species exhibited nonlinear and contrasting patterns of carbon uptake and use under inundation stress, which ultimately defines their strategies of surviving regularly flooded habitats. The results suggest that a future scenario with more intensive inundation, due to the water management and climate change, may weaken the dominance of muhly grass in many freshwater wetlands of the Everglades.

Understanding runoff generation mechanisms in urban areas helps identify the impacts of urbanization on runoff response and better simulate urban floods. However, in most urban hydrological models, urban surfaces are coarsely classified into impervious and pervious ones, which likely ignores differential rainfall-runoff responses of different urban surfaces and leads to large discrepancies between simulated and observed runoff. Here we developed the TVGM_Urban model, a new urban hydrological model based on the time variant gain model (TVGM), that represents nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationships for different urban surfaces. We applied the model to the Fenghuangcheng region of Shenzhen City, China and compared the results to those of two commonly used urban hydrological models: the Horton infiltration and Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCSCN) model. For each of these models, we conducted model uncertainty analysis using the GLUE method. The results showed that the TVGM_Urban model outperformed the other two models in terms of total runoff and peak flow. This could be due to the consideration of different land covers and both saturation excess and infiltration excess runoff generation in the TVGM_Urban model. In addition, the uncertainty analysis indicated better performance of the TVGM_Urban model in reducing structural uncertainty and prediction uncertainty. This study highlights the need to account for detailed land covers and different runoff generation mechanisms in urban hydrological modeling.

Comparative risk assessment of phosphorus loss from "deep phosphorus stocks" in floodplain subsoils to surface waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Riparian buffer zone; Risk indicator; Degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS); Soil phosphorus sorption capacity (SPSC); Water-soluble phosphorus; Molar Fe; P	SOIL TEST PHOSPHORUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; LEGACY PHOSPHORUS; WETLAND SOILS; RELEASE; RIPARIAN; MOBILIZATION; PHOSPHATE	Phosphorus (P) loss from soil may trigger freshwater eutrophication and endanger supply with drinking water regionally. The present paper aims at encouraging discussion and development of sophisticated strategies for risk assessment of P loss from soils of riparian buffer zones (RBZ) as a prerequisite for targeted and effective mit-igation of such P losses and their effects on freshwater eutrophication. We use data from a case study on RBZ soils in Germany to compare the performance of different environmental indicators of a risk for P loss from soil. Our data suggest that RBZ soils are temporarily sinks or sources for P. The spatial hotspots of P loss are the topsoils and the deep P stocks (labile P enriched in RBZ subsoils below on average 87.5 cm depth). We discuss four aspects to be considered conceptually and methodologically in the assessment of a risk for P loss from RBZ soils: (1) spa-tial heterogeneity and spatial bias; (2) temporal heterogeneity and temporal bias; (3) conceptual bias caused by different dynamics of individual P fractions; and (4) adequacy of threshold values. To minimize bias, we propose to assess risk for P loss from RBZ soils using a geospatial, temporally resolved sampling strategy, site-specific or regional threshold values, and a P fractionation approach. For this purpose, we introduce PdHCl as a risk indicator, which is not susceptible to very short-term dynamics (in contrast to water-soluble P). (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Role of forested land for natural flood management in the UK: A review	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						canopy modeling; catchment modeling; hydrological modeling; interception loss; natural flood management	RAINFALL INTERCEPTION; RIPARIAN FOREST; WATER-BALANCE; ANALYTICAL-MODEL; SPRUCE FOREST; IMPACT; TRANSPIRATION; PLYNLIMON; CATCHMENT; CANOPY	Natural flood management (NFM) is the use of natural processes and environments to mitigate flood risk by reducing and delaying peak flood. This review introduces the concept and history of NFM and looks at the current state of research into the potential for using different types of woodland to fulfill the aims of NFM. Four woodland types (catchment, cross-slope, floodplain, and riparian) are discussed with reference to studies carried out, mainly in the United Kingdom, to determine the relative merits of each type and their effectiveness in mitigating flood risk. We then discuss how trees interact with the hydrological cycle, along with a discussion of modeling methods which seek to determine the amount of water intercepted by different types of forest cover. We find that while there is some evidence that carefully planned and managed woodland can mitigate flood risk, the published data for this evidence base is somewhat sparse. This may be either due to the long timescales needed for comprehensive studies or the relative infancy of the research on NFM. More research needs to be carried out in each of the four woodland types, especially in the UK, as policy makers are increasingly looking towards nature based solutions to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. The concept of a combined canopy/hydrological model which can be scaled from stand to watershed level and incorporate different types of woodland is suggested as it would be beneficial in guiding woodland creation policy in the future, both at the local and regional scales.

Using a coupled model of long-term peatland dynamics (Holocene Peat Model, HPM-Arctic), we quantify the potential loss of carbon with future climate warming for six sites with differing climates and permafrost histories in Northwestern Canada. We compared the net carbon balance at 2100 CE resulting from new productivity and the decomposition of active layer and newly thawed permafrost peats under RCP8.5 as a high-end constraint. Modeled net carbon losses ranged from -3.0 kg C m(-2) (net loss) to +0.1 kg C m(-2) (net gain) between 2015 and 2100. Losses of newly thawed permafrost peat comprised 0.2%-25% (median: 1.6%) of "old" C loss, which were related to the residence time of peat in the active layer before being incorporated into the permafrost, peat temperature, and presence of permafrost. The largest C loss was from the permafrost-free site, not from permafrost sites. C losses were greatest from depths of 0.2-1.0 m. New C added to the profile through net primary productivity between 2015 and 2100 offset similar to 40% to >100% of old C losses across the sites. Differences between modeled active layer deepening and flooding following permafrost thaw resulted in very small differences in net C loss by 2100, illustrating the important role of present-day conditions and permafrost aggradation history in controlling net C loss.

Isotopic evidence for axial tree stem methane oxidation within subtropical lowland forests	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						carbon cycle; climate change; greenhouse gases; methane (CH4); methanogens; methanotrophy; wetland forest	LIVING TREES; STABLE-ISOTOPES; NITROUS-OXIDE; EMISSIONS; CARBON; FRACTIONATION; HYDROGEN; WATER; FLUX; TRANSPORT	Knowledge regarding mechanisms moderating methane (CH4) sink/source behaviour along the soil-tree stem-atmosphere continuum remains incomplete. Here, we applied stable isotope analysis (delta C-13-CH4) to gain insights into axial CH4 transport and oxidation in two globally distributed subtropical lowland species (Melaleuca quinquenervia and Casuarina glauca). We found consistent trends in CH4 flux (decreasing with height) and delta C-13-CH4 enrichment (increasing with height) in relation to stem height from ground. The average lower tree stem delta C-13-CH4 (0-40 cm) of Melaleuca and Casuarina (-53.96 parts per thousand and -65.89 parts per thousand) were similar to adjacent flooded soil CH4 ebullition (-52.87 parts per thousand and -62.98 parts per thousand), suggesting that stem CH4 is derived mainly by soil sources. Upper stems (81-200 cm) displayed distinct delta C-13-CH4 enrichment (Melaleuca -44.6 parts per thousand and Casuarina -46.5 parts per thousand, respectively). Coupled 3D-photogrammetry with novel 3D-stem measurements revealed distinct hotspots of CH4 flux and isotopic fractionation on Melaleuca, which were likely due to bark anomalies in which preferential pathways of gas efflux were enhanced. Diel experiments revealed greater delta C-13-CH4 enrichment and higher oxidation rates in the afternoon, compared with the morning. Overall, we estimated that c. 33% of the methane was oxidised between lower and upper stems during axial transport, therefore potentially representing a globally significant, yet previously unaccounted for, methane sink.

Insight into the multi-decadal effects of floods on aquatic macroinvertebrate community structure in the Murray River using distributed lag nonlinear models and counterfactual analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Long-term monitoring; Delayed effects of floods; Successional changes in ecological communities; Coarse and large woody debris; Environmental flows	LARGE WOODY DEBRIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAM; HABITAT; DETRITUS; DISTURBANCE; RECOVERY; INVERTEBRATES; COLONIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY	We describe the multi-decadal delayed effects of flood on macroinvertebrate community structure using 33 years of monitoring data on macroinvertebrates, water quality, and climate, and 51 years of hydrological data, spanning 2300 km of the Murray River, Australia. We used distributed lag nonlinear models in a four-step analytical process, including 1) modelling macroinvertebrate community structure, represented as a set of principle coordinate axes, as a function of a lagged hydrologic index and other environmental variables using distance-based redundancy analysis 2) visualizing the patterns of delayed effects of flows on the PCO axes, 3) modelling the abundances of groups of taxa along individual PCO axes, and 4) combining the two sets of models in a counterfactual analysis to predict the community structure under flood and no-flood scenarios to describe the multi-decadal trajectory of the community following a flood. Our findings show an increase in abundance of most taxa of filtering-gathering collectors, scrapers, and shredders in the long term that implicates an influx of organic matter of all sizes, from particulate organic matter to coarse and large woody debris, that serves directly or indirectly as a food resource and/or habitat. Our approach enabled the isolation of a flood impact from the confounding effects of other flow events and environmental variables, overcoming a substantial challenge in ecohydrological studies.

J	Tonn, G; Guikema, S				Tonn, Gina; Guikema, Seth			Risk Factors for 100-Year Flood Events in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						100&#8208; year flood; flood frequency; random forest	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RETURN PERIODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; STATIONARITY; DELINEATION; BASINS; HAZARD	Anecdotal information indicates that streams in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States experience more extreme flood events than might be expected. This leads to the question of whether this is an unfounded perception or if these extreme events are actually occurring more than should be expected. If the latter is true, is this due solely to randomness, or alternately to characteristics that make certain watersheds more prone to repeated events that may be defined as 100-year or greater floods? These questions are investigated through analysis of flood events based on standard flood frequency analysis. 100-year streamflow rates for stream gages were estimated using Bulletin 17B flood frequency analysis methods, and the probability of the annual peak flow record for each gage was calculated. These probabilities were compared to a set of synthetic probabilities to evaluate their distribution. This comparison indicates that for the Mid-Atlantic region as a whole, the Bulletin 17B method does not systematically over or underestimate flood frequency. A Random Forest model of probability of actual flood record (PAFR) versus watershed and stream gage characteristics was developed and used to understand if certain characteristics are associated with PAFR. This analysis indicated that unexpected numbers of large flood events in a stream gage period of record can be attributed primarily to randomness, but there is some correlation with watershed and gage characteristics including weighted skew, drainage area, and mean annual peak discharge. The results indicate that watersheds with high values of these characteristics may warrant advanced flood frequency methods.

J	Deria, A; Ghannad, P; Lee, YC				Deria, Anisha; Ghannad, Pedram; Lee, Yong-Cheol			Evaluating implications of flood vulnerability factors with respect to income levels for building long-term disaster resilience of low-income communities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood disaster; Disaster vulnerability; Resilience; Low-income communities	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; URBAN COMMUNITIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; HAZARD; KATRINA; PLACE	Communities residing in hazard-prone zones are more frequently affected by natural disasters and generally tend to bear higher losses than other communities. General factors such as sensitivity and adaptive capacity to a natural event determine the vulnerability of the communities. Several studies in this research area have claimed that both economic and socio-demographic factors are significant indicators of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. However, the possibility of a correlation between these two has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we aimed to establish a method to identify the correlation of various vulnerability factors to the economic factor in a particular geographical location based on census data and historical flood hazard information. All factors of vulnerability do not affect all communities equally, and therefore it is necessary to devise a method that can be used to identify those factors of vulnerability that are specific to a community. This study was conducted for the low-income community as income has already been established as a significant indicator of adaptive capacity, responsible for reducing the resiliency of a community while responding to a natural disaster. Through the method proposed in the study, not only the factors specific to an area that renders the lower-income communities more vulnerable can be identified, but also the vulnerability scores of the communities can be analyzed to identify the most dominant factors. Thus, this method is expected to help in providing a direction to planning for risk management and development towards building long-term disaster resilience.

J	Zevenbergen, C; Gersonius, B; Radhakrishan, M				Zevenbergen, Chris; Gersonius, Berry; Radhakrishan, Mohan			Flood resilience Introduction	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						climate change; adaptation; flood resilience; adaptive planning	SYSTEM ROBUSTNESS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE	Three different conceptual frameworks of resilience, including engineering, ecological and social-ecological have been presented and framed within the context of flood risk management. Engineering resilience has demonstrated its value in the design and operation of technological systems in general and in flood resilient technologies in particular. Although limited to the technical domain, it has broadened the objectives of flood resilient technologies and provided guidance in improving their effectiveness. Socio-ecological resilience is conceived as a broader system characteristic that involves the interaction between human and natural systems. It acknowledges that these systems change over time and that these interactions are of complex nature and associated with uncertainties. Building (socio-ecological) resilience in flood risk management strategies calls for an adaptive approach with short-term measures and a set of monitoring criteria for keeping track of developments that might require adaptation in the long-term (adaptation pathways) and thus built-in adaptive capacity as opposed to building engineering resilience which involves a static approach with a fixed time horizon a set of robust measures designed for specific future conditions or scenarios. The two case studies, from a developing and a developed country, indicate that the concepts of ecological and socio-ecological resilience provide guidance for building more resilient flood risk management systems resulting in an approach that embraces flood protection, prevention and preparedness. The case studies also reveal that the translation of resilience concepts into practice remains a challenge. One plausible explanation for this is our inability to arrive at a quantification of socio-ecological resilience taking into account the various attributes of the concept. This article is part of the theme issue 'Urban flood resilience'.

J	Tonnessen, M				Tonnessen, Morten			Current Human Ecology in the Amazon and beyond: a Multi-Scale Ecosemiotic Approach	BIOSEMIOTICS			English	Article						Ecosemiotics; The Amazon; Human ecology; Umwelt theory; Seasonal floodplain forest; Monkeys; Locality; Scale	SCALE	Umwelt theory is an expression of von Uexkull's subjective biology and as such usually applied in analysis of individual animals, yet it is fundamentally relational and therefore also suitable for analysis of more complex wholes. Since the birth of the modern environmental movement in the 1960s, there has been growing scientific and political acknowledgement of there being a global environmental crisis, which today manifests itself as a climate change and biodiversity crisis. This calls for a multi-scale ecosemiotic approach to analysis of human ecology at various levels and scales. In this article I explore to what extent ecosemiotic methodology, drawing on Umwelt theory and its consistently subjective perspective, can be applied in analysis of human ecology at different geographical and ecological scales ranging from the global to the local. The article incorporates a case study of human-animal relations in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in the Central Amazon. This is a seasonal floodplain forest area surrounded by rivers. I investigate aspects of the living conditions and ecology of the reserve, with a main focus on indigenous communities and the circumstances of two primate species, namely the red howler monkey (Alouatta seniculus) and the black-headed squirrel monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii). I outline matrixes of levels of study in ecosemiotics, and scales in human ecology, and apply two scales to the Mamiraua case. These take an individual animal's and an individual human being's subjective experience as their respectively starting points. This allows for multi-scale studies of human ecology from complementary angles.

The increase in the frequency and duration of heavy rainfall due to climate change has negatively affected plant growth and development, which eventually causes the death of plants if it persists for days. Most crops, especially rice, being a semi-aquatic plant, are greatly affected by flooding, leading to yield losses each year. Genetic variability in the plant response to flooding includes the quiescence scheme, which allows underwater endurance of a prolonged period, escape strategy through stem elongation, and alterations in plant architecture and metabolism. Investigating the mechanism for flooding survival in wild species and modern rice has yielded significant insight into developmental, physiological, and molecular strategies for submergence and waterlogging survival. Significant progress in the breeding of submergence tolerant rice varieties has been made during the last decade following the successful identification and mapping of a quantitative trait locus for submergence tolerance, designated as SUBMERGENCE 1 (SUB1) from the FR13A landrace. Using marker-assisted backcrossing, the SUB1 QTL (quantitative trait locus) has been incorporated into many elite varieties within a short time and with high precision as compared with conventional breeding methods. Despite the advancement in submergence tolerance, for future studies, there is a need for practical approaches exploring genome-wide association studies (GWA) and QTL in combination with specific tolerance traits, such as drought, salinity, disease and insect resistance.

We surveyed the spatial and human-influenced characteristics of the riparian zones, river channels, and land use along seven Slovenian rivers. We further monitored the presence and abundance of IAS with different natural properties and different human impacts to define the characteristics of non-infected and heavily infected reaches. Special attention was given to different life forms of IAS. The presence and abundance of IAS positively correlated with distance from river source, current velocity, and water depth, and negatively correlated with altitude, naturalness of the land use, width and completeness of the riparian zone, height and structure of its vegetation, and condition of the riverbed and banks. Annuals prevailed among IAS at 48%, with 37% herbaceous perennials and 15% woody species. The vine Echinocystis lobata was the most abundant IAS, which was found in 179 out of the 414 river reaches analysed, followed by the annual Impatiens glandulifera and the herbaceous perennial Solidago gigantea. E. lobata was spread over the native riparian vegetation and was affected by the natural gradients of the rivers in terms of altitude and distance from the river's source. Reaches without IAS significantly differed from reaches colonised with IAS in the width of riparian zone, vegetation height and structure, land-use next to the river, and distance from the source. As IAS in riparian zones affect riparian and aquatic communities, there is the need for management practices to maintain and establish complex riparian zones that are resistant to IAS colonisation.

The Effect of Co-occurring Heat and Water Stress on Reproductive Traits and Yield of Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>)	HORTICULTURE JOURNAL			English	Article						climate change; plant growth; plant reproduction	CARBOHYDRATE CONCENTRATION; DROUGHT STRESS; TEMPERATURE; GENOTYPES	Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) productivity is negatively impacted by extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and drought. This study evaluated the individual and additive effects of heat and water stress on reproductive traits and yield in the commercial tomato variety `Roma-VF'. Five weeks after sowing, five stress treatments were introduced consisting of combinations of heat and/or moderate and severe water stress. Heat-stressed plants were subjected to day/night temperatures of 35/23 degrees C, and the control of 28/20 degrees C. Moisture stress was imposed by natural depletion of soil water to 70% and 40% of field capacity (moderate and severe stress, respectively). After eight weeks of treatments, plants were placed under control conditions for a five-week recovery phase. Pollen morphology, number of flowers, fruits, and aerial biomass were recorded. Flowers from plants subjected to heat stress combined with either moderate or severe moisture stress did not produce any pollen during the treatment period. Further, by the end of the recovery period, 2738% fewer fruits matured on plants subjected to either heat or moisture stress, while fruit production among plants subjected to both stresses simultaneously declined 90% relative to the control (P < 0.001). We conclude that the `Roma-VF' tomato will be able to recover adequately from heatwaves provided plants are well irrigated. However, should heat and moisture stress co-occur, fruit yield is likely to be decimated and recovery is unlikely. This study is also the first report on additively combined effects of heat and water stress on the `Roma-VF' tomato.

The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of precipitation variability in the tropics and causes severe flooding and drought in many socioeconomically vulnerable regions. It remains unclear how tropical rainfall extremes and ENSO are changing in response to anthropogenic forcing, demanding that we investigate the relationships between precipitation, ENSO, and external forcing in the past. Lake sediment records have provided benchmark records of extreme flood events from the eastern tropical Pacific, where paleofloods have been interpreted to reflect El Nino events during the last millennium. However, the connections between flooding and ENSO variability in this region are uncertain, and the eastern Pacific can only capture precipitation events driven by El Nino, not La Nina. Thus, it is unclear how the ENSO system and tropical rainfall extremes have changed in the recent past. Here, we reconstruct flood events during the past millennium using a lake sediment record from East Java, Indonesia, which can provide insight into flooding driven by La Nina. We detect flood frequency variations in the western tropical Pacific that are highly coherent with records from the eastern part of the basin over the past millennium. Our findings demonstrate that heavy rainfall and flooding occurs more frequently on both sides of the tropical Pacific during periods of warmer Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures, implying that ENSO-driven rainfall extremes could intensify in the near future.

There are numerous hydrodynamic models for urban flooding simulation and management. However, it is difficult for most of these models to simplify the surface runoff process and still provide high simulation accuracy. In this study, an improved simplified urban storm inundation model (SUSIM) that integrates urban terrain, precipitation, surface runoff and inundation models was proposed to quickly and accurately simulate the different inundation conditions by modifying the urban terrain and catchments. Haining City, China, was selected as a case study in which SUSIM was tested and validated. The results were as follows: (1) Detailed locations and depths of inundation were quickly calculated with high correlation coefficient (>= 75%) compared to three actual rainfall events. (2) Four scenarios under different rainfall intensities (5-, 10-, 20- and 50-year return period, respectively) were designed. The maximum inundation depths significantly increased from 403 mm to 1522 mm and the maximum inundation area increased from 2904 m(2) to 7330 m(2). According to the simulation results, Haining Avenue, the West Mountain Park and the old urban area in the northeast part of the city would encounter the most extensive and severe inundation. The result reveals that the SUSIM could find inundation locations and calculate inundation depth and area quickly. It provides better insights and tools for urban inundation simulation and planning strategies.

From 12,000 to 10,500 cal yr BP a grass swamp existed until it was flooded by rising lake levels, indicated by the onset of marl deposition at the site. The onset of higher lake levels coincided with a transition from conifer-rich forest to mixed deciduous-evergreen forest, and a reduction in local biomass burning. Lake levels remained high until 6400 cal yr BP, thereafter fluctuating with possible dry phases at 4050, 2400 and 1100 cal yr BP. Increased burning is apparent from 2200 cal yr BP inferred to represent the onset of human forest clearance to its very reduced state today. The Inle Lake record compares with Holocene sequences in China, Thailand and India and marine cores south of Myanmar, which similarly show a regional pattern of drier conditions in the early Greenlandian stage, followed by maximum lake levels in the early Northgrippian stage. Fluctuating lake levels are evident in the later Northgrippian and Meghalayan stages after 6000 cal yr BP. This pattern coincides with precessional reduction in summer insolation in the region, which weakens the Asian Monsoon. The present-day bare catchments of Inle Lake probably mostly resulted from forest destruction over the last 2000 years although hints of human presence can be inferred throughout the older record.

Here, we propose a comprehensive drought risk assessment scheme combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. At the Mun River Basin, 90% of rice cultivation is rain-fed and regularly encounters droughts resulting in the lowest yields in the country. The water deficit calculated with respect to rice water requirement is used to assess drought hazard and is estimated at monthly time steps. We use drought severity and frequency for hazard estimation and population and rice field characteristics for exposure. Vulnerability is represented by physical and socioeconomic factors and coping and adaptive capacity. Between 1984 and 2016, monthly precipitation during the rice-growing season was insufficient to meet rice water needs at all growth stages (July-November). The hazard is more severe in October and November, which can lead to significantly reduced yields. People and rice fields in the center part of the basin are more exposed to drought than in other parts. Extensive areas are under high and moderate vulnerability due to low coping capacity. The higher drought risks appear in the last 2 months of the growing season and decrease from north to south, while the risk map of total precipitation demonstrates that most of the areas have low and very low risk. This emphasizes the importance of monthly time series analysis to calculate agricultural drought hazard and risk. Consequently, we recommend using the hazard and risk maps for October and November instead of the total precipitation to develop solutions to improve rice yield.

In doing so, we scrutinize how notions of urban resilience, climate adaptation, and ecosystem-based infrastructure are influencing contemporary planning practice. Our account from New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta traces several large-scale hydrological engineering projects with origins in the early 20th century, which aimed to restructure the landscape for more effective maritime transportation, flood protection, and urban drainage. The account then turns to a discussion of a massive and ongoing planning project, which aims to restore the historical dynamics of the Mississippi River Delta, diverting the river into nearby coastal wetlands to provide storm protection for vulnerable communities, most especially New Orleans. Our analysis shows how the development of water infrastructure systems in the region produced cleavages in the region's body politic and eco-hydrology, generating disputes that threaten to slow or obstruct the plan's implementation. The study shows how the forms and discourses of political contention in the present are deeply informed by past decisions regarding the placement, operation, and maintenance of water infrastructures in the region. The conflicts that emerge from these cleavages comprise the primary obstacle facing ecosystem-based strategies aimed at securing New Orleans and other major settlements in the region from storm surges. This raises fundamental challenges for planning practice, which are explored here through a discussion of situational dissensus, conflicting rationalities, and pathways for democratic institutional innovation.

Hurricane flood risk assessment for the Yucatan and Campeche State coastal area	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood modeling; Flood hazard; Flood vulnerability; Flood risk; MEOW; Yucatan Peninsula	STORM-SURGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; TROPICAL CYCLONES; NATURAL HAZARDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BOTTOM STRESS; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; RESILIENCE; HISTORY	In this study, the first ever Sea, Lake, Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) grid was built for the Yucatan Peninsula. The SLOSH model was used to simulate storm surges in the coastal area of the states of Yucatan and Campeche (Mexico). Based on climatology, more than 39,900 hypothetical hurricanes covering all possible directions of motion were synthesized. The storm intensity (category), forward speed, radius of maximum winds and the tide anomaly were varied for each hypothetical track. According to these scenarios, the potential storm surge and associated inundation threat were computed. Subsequently, the Maximum Envelope of Water (MEOW) and the Maximum of the MEOWs (MOMs) were calculated to assess the flood hazard induced by tropical cyclones under varying conditions. In addition, for each MOM, the socioeconomic vulnerability aspects were taken into account in order to assess the hurricane flood risk for the states of Yucatan and Campeche. Results show that the most vulnerable areas are the surroundings of Terminos lagoon, Campeche City and its neighboring areas in the state of Campeche. For Yucatan, the towns located in the Northwest (Celestun, Hunucma and Progreso) and the eastern part of the state presented the highest risk values. The methodology used in this study can be applied to other coastal zones of Mexico as well as places with similar attributes. Furthermore, the MEOW and MOM are very useful as a decision-making tool for prevention, preparedness, evacuation plans, mitigation of the flood hazard and its associated risk, and also for insurance companies.

A sustainable solution for flood and rain hazard using remote sensing & GIS: New Cairo	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES			English	Article						Flood analysis; Satellite imagery; DEM; GIS; Spatial analyst; Sustainability	MANAGEMENT; RISK; REGION	Climate changes have exposed many countries to the risks of heavy rains and floods that may lead to the loss of lives and damage to properties. The trend in prioritizing the establishment of stormwater drainage systems in urban areas in Egypt came after the provision and completion of drinking water. This necessitated the implementation of permanent solutions to absorb the unprecedented amounts of rainwater and torrential rain, which were not taken into account when designing the existing sewage networks. Furthermore, there is a lack of water resources and the existing water resources are less than the demand. Therefore, this research study aimed to take advantage of the stormwater that falls on residential neighborhoods by making underground reservoirs or retention ponds to protect these areas from the damage caused by the rains and reusing it in irrigating local green area inside these regions, to achieve sustainable water resources solutions for these areas. Satellite imagery, DEM & ArcGIS are used. A hydrological calculation for 24 different storms, with 4 different return periods for New Cairo City. However, it is the basin of interest that includes public green spaces for rain harvesting and storage for irrigation. For avoiding the risks of heavy rains in a city that hasn't stormwater networks, and get a sustainable solution by using the water from rainfall for irrigation through using sub-areas of some public green spaces such as retention ponds or ground reservoirs, using the runoff volume shall save approximately 6 days of irrigation per storm.

Specifically, this assessment provides a risk assessment that buildings may face after construction. To achieve the flood risk assessment on buildings, we developed an integrated flood model and collected data on building shape and number of floors, land use, and construction costs for different building types in Shanghai. The extreme compound flood scenarios (1/200-, 1/500-, 1/1000-, and 1/5000-year floods) and building metadata were aggregated using a risk analysis chain. According to the damage for different flood scenarios, the average annual loss (AAL) can be calculated and is referred to as building flood risk. The AAL of residential, commercial, office, and industrial buildings is USD 12.3, 2.5, 3.7, and 3.4 million, respectively. Among the 15 (non-island) districts in Shanghai, Pudong has the highest AAL. The risk analysis chain developed in this study can be reproduced for other megacities. The results provide a clear picture for future building flood risks which links directly to disaster risk management, which implies the extent of flood risk in building types, sub-districts, and districts related to the Shanghai Master Plan. This assessment takes into consideration future climate change scenarios, information for scenario-based decision making, and a cost-benefit analysis for extreme flood risk management in Shanghai. We also discussed different potential adaptation options for flood risk management.

However, a lack of tools for synthetic hazard assessment of the Arctic coast has hindered effective response measures. We developed a holistic framework, the Arctic Coastal Hazard Index (ACHI), to assess the vulnerability of Arctic coasts to permafrost thawing, coastal erosion, and coastal flooding. We quantified the coastal permafrost thaw potential (PTP) through regional assessment of thaw subsidence using ground settlement index. The calculations of the ground settlement index involve utilizing projections of permafrost conditions, including future regional mean annual ground temperature, active layer thickness, and talik thickness. The predicted thaw subsidence was validated through a comparison with observed long-term subsidence data. The ACHI incorporates the PTP into seven physical and ecological variables for coastal hazard assessment: shoreline type, habitat, relief, wind exposure, wave exposure, surge potential, and sea-level rise. The coastal hazard assessment was conducted for each 1 km2 coastline of North Slope Borough, Alaska in the 2060s under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 forcing scenarios. The areas that are prone to coastal hazards were identified by mapping the distribution pattern of the ACHI. The calculated coastal hazards potential was subjected to validation by comparing it with the observed and historical long-term coastal erosion mean rates. This framework for Arctic coastal assessment may assist policy and decision-making for adaptation, mitigation strategies, and civil infrastructure planning.

Flood forecasting by means of dynamical downscaling of global NWPs coupling with a hydrologic model at Nong Son-Thanh My River basins	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						Global forecasting system (GFS); global spectral model (GSM); numerical weather prediction (NWP); watershed environmental hydrology model (WEHY); weather research and forecasting (WRF)	FUTURE CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-COVER; WEHY MODEL; VU GIA; PARAMETERIZATION; SCALE; VIETNAM; PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; SYSTEM	Almost every year, Vietnam suffers floods resulting in the loss of many lives and considerable costs for damaged and lost properties. This study proposes a forecasting system that couples the dynamical downscaling technique with hydrologic models to forecast real-time flood events with a lead time ranging from 1 to 3 days. This approach is demonstrated by applying a regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) and physically based hydrologic model to the Thanh My and Nong Son watersheds. System inputs are provided by two global NWPs, the global forecasting system (GFS) and the global spectral model (GSM). A watershed environmental hydrology model (WEHY-WRF) was selected as the hydrologic-atmospheric components for the proposed system. WEHY-WRF was successfully implemented and validated before testing the real-time forecasting system over the Nong Son-Thanh My watersheds. Overall, the comparison between the model simulations and corresponding observations shows the rainfall and flood forecast by WEHY-WRF-GFS match quite well with observation data and perform better than WEHY-WRF-GSM. However, all forecasting results are generally encouraging considering the correlation coefficients for most events are acceptable. The forecast methodology has demonstrated it as a comprehensive reliable technology which may be universally applied for flood prediction through the coupling of dynamical downscaling technique and hydrologic models.

In 2015, Typhoon Soudelor caused a short-delayed heavy rainfall event in Nanshih River, which caused damage to a section of the Lansheng Bridge discharge station. The section was relocated upstream to rebuild the discharge station in 2019. However, the new discharge station cannot measure high flow due to the bridge structure. The flow observation range of Lansheng Bridge is therefore limited to normal flow, making it impossible to accurately estimate the flow during high-water stages. The purpose of this study is to use the past flow data of Nanshih River to estimate the flow rate under different return periods using frequency analysis. We used a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to map the river's topography, and used the 3D hydraulic calculations of the FLOW-3D model to estimate the water stage and discharge of the Lansheng Bridge. We then verified the accuracy of the model with the measured flow and water stage, and finally used the water stage and discharge data obtained from numerical simulation to construct the stage-discharge rating curve of the Lansheng Bridge. In addition to preventing flood disasters, this study approach can provide reliable data for use in water conservation. It may also be utilized to overcome the problem of measuring and estimating high flow during typhoon floods.

The Shetran model has used for rainfall- runoff simulations, with rainfall input obtained from measured rain gauges (hourly and daily) and TRMM (3 h and daily). Separate model calibrations and validations were carried out. The Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of the models using rain gauge data for the three catchments for the calibration period were 0.75, 0.70 and 0.85 and using the TRMM rainfall data were 0.44, 0.44 and 0.75. The NSE values were 0.71, 0.62 and 0.89 for the validation period using rain gauge data and 0.26, 0.61 and 0.58 for the TRMM data. The Critical Success Index for predicting flooding events was improved using rain gauge data compared to using TRMM data. The results demonstrate that rain gauge data are systematically superior to TRMM rainfall data when used for simulating discharges and predicting flooding events. These findings suggest that rain gauge data are preferred for flood early warning systems in tropical rainfall regimes and that if TRMM or similar satellite rainfall data are used, the evaluated flood risks should be treated with extreme caution.

Among the different psychological processes forging individuals' risk-estimation, the present work focuses on the near-miss effect, the human tendency to underes-timate the risks when a previous negative outcome is avoided by chance. Study 1 (N = 241) in-vestigates the near-miss effect among residents of both flood-prone and safe areas, showing that participants exposed to near-miss scenarios perceive a lower level of risk and damages regardless of their past experience with the hazard, and thus are less prone to adopt protective measures. Based on the data collected in Study 1, Study 2 develops a series of agent-based models to simu-late the effect of experiencing near-miss events on a neighborhood in a flood-prone area, where inhabitants have to decide whether to purchase insurance against flood-related damage. The agent-based models integrating the psychological parameters reveals that the underestimation of the likelihood of flooding due to the near-miss effect is likely to increase the negative economic consequences of disasters suffered by the population. The work shows, at a population level, how psychological factors and human responses to risk might tailor the economic consequences of flood-related events. Implications for risk management and communication are discussed.

The high -Andean Lake Sibinacocha has been regulated since 1988 to increase energy production of the Machupicchu hydropower plant. In this study, river streamflow changes are evaluated by analyzing precipitation and discharge trends using indicators of hydrologic alteration and ecoflow for natural (1965-1987) and altered (1988-2016) flow regimes.New hydrological insights for the region: For the altered flow regime, an ecodeficit of about 20% (compared to natural river flow) and an ecosurplus > 30% were found during the wet season (December-February) and dry season (June-August), respectively. These changes have reduced the risk of water shortage (dry season) and flood (wet season) and contribute to increasing water use including hydropower production, irrigation and drinking water. However, river alteration might lead to considerable impacts on riverine ecosystems.Despite major limitations related to data scarcity and complex environmental processes in the basin, our results highlight the usefulness of combined methods of hydrological alteration and ecoflow to effectively evaluate water regime changes in regulated basins. An integrated scientific approach is necessary to address uncertainties and develop meaningful future water availability scenarios that guide hydropower projects with improved water and energy security considering minimal impacts on human and natural systems.

However, current research provides little insight into how green roofs are used and promoted globally. Therefore, it is essential to look at the global spatial distribution of green roofs and the related policies by using green buildings which have been successfully promoted as a benchmark. This study collected data from multiple sources, such as a dataset of spatial distribution of green roofs from eight countries, and 124 green roof incentive policy texts from 88 cities. Spatial analysis was conducted using ArcGIS Pro, and different types of incentive policies were explored using word frequency analysis. The results show that (1) the unbalanced distribution of green roofs in cities is prominent, with significant regional differences and clustering characteristics along water systems; (2) in the vast majority of countries, the types of incentive policies for green roofs lack diversity; (3) green roofs lack a well-developed rating system compared to how green buildings are promoted. Combining green buildings with green roofs and exploring the gaps between them, this study will help further explore the application of green roofs worldwide and guide governments or non-governmental organizations to develop and implement more efficient policies and provide recommendations to promote the popularity of green roofs worldwide.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Climate refugees; Climate -driven migration; Resettlement; Policy acceptance; Intergroup threat theory	MIGRATION; IMMIGRATION; SUPPORT; THREAT	Climate change will drive migration both within and across nations' borders, requiring some temporary and permanent resettlement. Despite the relative novelty of - and growing need for - climate-driven migration, it is unknown whether or how support for climate refugees' plight differs to other refugees. We examine attitudes of people living in the United States (N = 1765) towards refugee policy that experimentally differs in three respects: the type of refugees (international climate refugees, internal climate refugees, or refugees of war), the length of their stay (permanent or temporary), and their numbers (capped or increasing annually). While specific dis-cussion about climate refugee policy cites fears of 'opening the floodgates', we found no evidence that people were reluctant to support climate refugees when their numbers were going to increase each year compared to when they would remain capped. Instead, ratings did not depend on refugee numbers or refugee permanence. None of these factors interacted, indicating that resistance to migration is contingent only on the group: Proposals to support international climate refugees were supported less than proposals to support internal climate refugees or refugees of war. Responses to a question asking which countries participants expected international climate refugees to relocate from suggests a wide variety of expected origins, and these geographic origins may shape ratings of support and perceived threat to the economy and culture if refugees resettle in the United States. Overall, our findings highlight the greater support and sympathy afforded to groups already living in the United States.

Healthy soil is needed to grow crops, provides food, and sustains populations. It supports diverse ecosystems and critical ecological services such as pollination. It stores water and prevents floods. It captures carbon and slows global climate change. Soil pollution is a great and growing threat to human health. Soil may be polluted by heavy metals, organic chemicals such as pesticides, biological pathogens, and micro/nanoplastic particles. Pollution reduces soil's ability to yield food. It results in food crop contamination and disease. Soil pollutants wash into rivers causing water pollution. Deforestation causes soil erosion, liberates sequestered pollutants, and generates airborne dust. Pollution of air, water, and soil is responsible for at least 9 million deaths each year. More than 60% of pollution-related disease and death is due to cardiovascular disease. Recognizing the importance of pollution to human health, the European Commission and the EU Action Plan for 2050: A Healthy Planet for All, have determined that air, water, and soil pollution must be reduced to levels that cause no harm to human or ecosystem health. We are thus required to create a toxic-free environment, respect the concept of a safe operating space for humanity, and sustain the health of our planet for future generations.

The study used a national-scale flood hazard dataset (pluvial, fluvial, and coastal) to estimate a 1-in-100-year flood exposure of all residential properties across 5721 census tracts. Residential flood exposure data were spatially integrated with a census-based multidimensional social vulnerability index (SoVI) that included demographic, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic indicators influencing vulnerability. Using Bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (BiLISA) cluster maps, the study identified geographic concentration of flood risk hotspots where high vulnerability coincided with high flood exposure. The results revealed considerable spatial variations in tract-level social vulnerability and flood exposure. Flood risk hotspots belonged to 410 census tracts, 21 census metropolitan areas, and eight provinces comprising about 1.7 million of the total population and 51% of half-a-million residential properties in Canada. Results identify populations and the geographic regions near the core and dense urban areas predominantly occupying those hotspots. Recognizing priority locations is critically important for government interventions and risk mitigation initiatives considering socio-physical aspects of vulnerability to flooding. Findings reinforce a better understanding of geographic flood-disadvantaged neighborhoods across Canada, where interventions are required to target preparedness, response, and recovery resources that foster socially just flood management strategies.

A multitude of approaches for modelling disaster evacuation have been proposed for over decades and most of them focus on minimizing the travelling times or costs after a disaster strikes. However, evacuating all vulnerable people to safer places with sufficient vehicles before a disaster strikes is a better option. Owing to this operation's importance at such a crucial time, we have developed a short-notice flood evacuation model by utilising public transportation to evacuate an uncertain number of people, particularly in areas with a high population. The proposed model aims to find the minimum number of vehicles required and its sequence trips to save all evacuees before the water reaches the predicted areas. A closing time window at each evacuation point and evacuees-dependant service times are taken into account to tackle the flood propagation. Due to the limitation of available vehicles at the early stage of the disaster, the model considers splitting the demands and reusing the vehicles, i.e. multi-trips, to cover all the necessary routes within a time horizon. We apply the new model to some synthetic and real-world instances. In addition, we study the trade-off between the minimization of the number of vehicles and total travelling times. The results show that the proposed model has effectively saved more resources when split deliveries and multi-trips are imposed.

This explicit representation is expected to reduce climate projection uncertainty related to deep convection parameterizations found in most climate models. A recent surge in CPRCM decadal simulations over larger domains, sometimes covering continents, has led to important insights into CPRCM advantages and limitations. Furthermore, new observational gridded datasets with fine spatial and temporal (similar to 1 km; similar to 1 h) resolutions have leveraged additional knowledge through evaluations of the added value of CPRCMs. With an improved coordination in the frame of ongoing international initiatives, the production of ensembles of CPRCM simulations is expected to provide more robust climate projections and a better identification of their associated uncertainties. This review paper presents an overview of the methodology to produce CPRCM simulations and the latest research on the related added value in current and future climates. Impact studies that are already taking advantage of these new CPRCM simulations are highlighted. This review paper ends by proposing next steps that could be accomplished to continue exploiting the full potential of CPRCMs. This article is categorized under: Climate Models and Modeling > Earth System Models	[Lucas-Picher, Philippe; Brisson, Erwan; Lemonsu, Aude; Caillaud, Cecile] Univ Toulouse Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol CNRM, Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & Climat GMGEC, Toulouse, France; [Argueso, Daniel] Univ Balear Isl, Dept Phys, Meteorol Grp, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Tramblay, Yves] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Natl Rech Scient CNRS, Inst Rech Dev IRD, Hydro Sci Montpellier HSM, Montpellier, France; [Berg, Peter] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, Norrkoping, Sweden; [Kotlarski, Sven] Zurich Airport, Federal Off Meteorol & Climatol Meteo Swiss, Zurich, Switzerland	Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute	Lucas-Picher, P (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse Meteo France, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Ctr Natl Rech Meteorol CNRM, Grp Meteorol Grande Echelle & Climat GMGEC, Toulouse, France.	philippe.lucas-picher@meteo.fr	Berg, Peter/J-3533-2014; Tramblay, Yves/AAA-4405-2022; Argueso, Daniel/G-1970-2012	Tramblay, Yves/0000-0003-0481-5330; Argueso, Daniel/0000-0002-4792-162X; Caillaud, Cecile/0000-0003-2317-4129; LEMONSU, AUDE/0000-0001-8894-0088; Brisson, Erwan/0000-0003-2558-2556	Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-18-MPGA-0005]; EPICC project [PID2019-105253RJ-677I00]; European Union's Horizon 2020 EUCP project [GA 776613]; GlobalHydroPressure (EU Water JPI through the Swedish Research Council Formas) [2018-02379]; Spanish Ministry of Universities [BG20/00078]; Formas [2018-02379] Funding Source: Formas; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-18-MPGA-0005] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR); Vinnova [2018-02379] Funding Source: Vinnova	Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); EPICC project; European Union's Horizon 2020 EUCP project; GlobalHydroPressure (EU Water JPI through the Swedish Research Council Formas)(Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research Council); Spanish Ministry of Universities(Spanish Government); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Vinnova(Vinnova)	Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/ Award Number: ANR-18-MPGA-0005; EPICC project, Grant/Award Number: PID2019-105253RJ-677I00 MCI/AEI/ FEDERUE; European Union's Horizon 2020 EUCP project, Grant/Award Number: GA 776613; GlobalHydroPressure (EU Water JPI through the Swedish Research Council Formas), Grant/Award Number: 2018-02379; Spanish Ministry of Universities, Grant/Award Number: Beatriz Galindo Fellowship (BG20/00078)		596	86	90	14	80	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1757-7780	1757-7799		WIRES CLIM CHANGE	Wiley Interdiscip.

Hence, identification of primary drivers of animal population decline is a priority for conservation. Analyzing long time-series data is a powerful way to assess drivers of declines, but the data are often missing, hampering effective conservation policymaking. In this study, based on twenty-four years (from 1996 to 2019) of annual maximal count data, we investigated the effects of climate and landscape changes on the increasing population trend of the Greater White-Fronted Goose (Anser albifrons) at a Ramsar site in the Middle and Lower Yangtze Floodplain, China. Our results showed that the availability of a suitable habitat and landscape attributes are the key driving forces affecting the population trend, while the effects of climate factors are weak. Specifically, increasing the area of suitable habitat and alleviating habitat fragmentation through a fishing ban policy may have provided a more suitable habitat to the geese, contributing to the increasing population trend. However, we also observed that the grazing prohibition policy implemented in 2017 at Shengjin Lake may have potentially negatively affected geese abundance, as grazing by larger herbivores may favor smaller geese species by modifying the vegetation community and structure. Based on our results, we suggest several practical countermeasures to improve the habitat suitability for herbivorous goose species wintering in this region.

Changes to spotted turtle (<i>Clemmys guttata</i>) habitat selection in response to a salt marsh restoration	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Spotted turtle; Clemmys guttata; Salt marsh; Restoration; Tidal restriction; Compositional analysis	EMYDOIDEA-BLANDINGII; CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; SALINITY	Development of coastal New England has led to the replacement of up to 37% of salt marshes with degraded freshwater wetlands, primarily through tidal restrictions. Removing these restrictions to restore salt marsh ecology would improve water quality, increase flood and storm protection, nutrient filtration, erosion control, and carbon sequestration. However, such restorations replace functional freshwater wetlands and could potentially impact freshwater species. Freshwater-dependent wildlife species such as the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), may be especially vulnerable to rapid changes in habitat resulting from tidal reintroduction due to their high site fidelity and limited ability to disperse quickly. Conservation of genetically and physically isolated spotted turtle populations as well as the restoration of salt marshes to mitigate climate change impacts are both high priorities on Nantucket Island. These two priorities conflicted in a project to restore tidal hydrology to an impounded freshwater marsh known to host a robust spotted turtle population. We evaluated changes to spotted turtle home range size and location and habitat use in response to salt marsh restoration over eight years. Home range size did not change but the location of home ranges shifted into bordering wetlands landward of the tidal salt water influence. Spotted turtles selected remaining freshwater marshes and shrub swamps while avoiding developed land and areas of establishing salt marsh within areas that had previously been high quality habitat. This study suggests prioritizing conservation of wetlands adjacent to planned salt marsh restoration to provide habitat for freshwater species to migrate.

J	Zhu, HG; Liu, F				Zhu, Huagui; Liu, Fan			A Group-Decision-Making Framework for Evaluating Urban Flood Resilience: A Case Study in Yangtze River	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban flood resilience; multi-criteria decision making; group consensus; Yangtze River		Floods are among the most common and destructive natural disasters confronted by cities and are further aggravated by rapid climate change and increasing urbanization, posing a great challenge to flood risk management. To cope with uncertainty, there is a need to move towards approaches to managing flood risk by taking resilience into consideration. While the evaluation of urban flood resilience has gained much attention in recent decades, studies on quantitative measurement using multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches are rare. In addition, the results determined by different MCDM methods may exhibit considerable variability. It is an intractable task to gather a group consensus from these methods. In this regard, in this paper, we propose a group-decision-making framework for measuring urban resilience to flooding, combining three stages, which are (i) normalizing the data, (ii) weighting the criteria and (iii) aggregating the results. Four objective MCDM methods-i.e., the variation coefficient method, Shannon weighting method, CRITIC and ideal point method-are proposed and treated as reliable methods. A stochastic multi criteria acceptability analysis is adopted to integrate those results into a composite resilience index. The proposed methodology is applied to the resilience evaluation problem of 41 cities in the Yangtze River basin, and the results are compared with those obtained with the four MCDM methods. It is demonstrated that our method considers all possible preferences among the results provided by various MCDM methods and is thus more robust and acceptable.

Ammonium(NH4+) is the predominant form of nitrogen in flooded soils, but the role played by NH4+ in the plant response to salt stress has not been fully clarified. We investigated the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Nicotiana benthamiana plants fed with NH4+. All species were hypersensitive to NaCl stress and accumulated more Cl- and less Na+ than those fed with NO3-. Further investigation of A. thaliana indicated that salt hypersensitivity induced by the presence of NH4+ was abolished by removing the Cl- but was not affected by the removal of Na+, suggesting that excess accumulation of Cl- rather than Na+ is involved in NH4+-conferred salt hypersensitivity. The expression of nitrate transporter NRT1.1 protein was also up-regulated by NH4+ treatment, which increased root Cl- uptake due to the Cl- uptake activity of NRT1.1 and the absence of uptake competition from NO3-. Knockout of NRT1.1 in plants decreased their root Cl- uptake and retracted the NH4+-conferred salt hypersensitivity. Our findings revealed that NH4+-aggravated salt stress in plants is associated with Cl- over-accumulation through the up-regulation of NRT1.1-mediated Cl- uptake.

A disaster governance paradigm is a comprehensive set of prevailing and institutionalized ideas that shape disaster plans and policies that eventually are implemented on-the-ground. Nepal has prepared various disaster plans and policies at the national, provincial and local level, but there are major gaps in disaster risk preparedness, with annual floods and landslides continuing to be responsible for the loss of lives and heavy infrastructure damages. In this article, we show how disaster governance paradigms have evolved between 1982 and 2019, using policy document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key policy actors. The study found that four major disaster governance paradigms exist in Nepal - (1) response and recovery; (2) disaster risk reduction and management; (3) integrated climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction; and (4) federalized disaster risk reduction. The results of this study show that multiple state and non-state actors such as key government ministries, NGOs, INGOs and other civil society actors are competing over resources and there is an ongoing administrative struggle for promoting different disaster governance paradigms. There has been a push from various civil society actors to prioritize disaster risk reduction in Nepal. Finally, we conclude that it is too early to assert that the decentralization process will be able to reduce disaster risk for vulnerable communities, especially with the federalization of Nepal's disaster governance.

They affect livelihoods, infrastructure and production systems, hence impacting on Sustainable Development (SD). Early Warning Systems (EWS) for floods that properly address all four EWS components, while also being community and impact-based, do not yet exist in WA. Existing systems address only the main rivers, are conceived in a top-down manner and are hazard-centered. This study on the Sirba river in Niger aims to demonstrate that an operational community and impact-based EWS for floods can be set up by leveraging the existing tools, local stakeholders and knowledge. The main finding of the study is that bridging the gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches is possible by directly connecting the available technical capabilities with the local level through a participatory approach. This allows the beneficiaries to define the rules that will develop the whole system, strengthening their ability to understand the information and take action. Moreover, the integration of hydrological forecasts and observations with the community monitoring and preparedness system provides a lead time suitable for operational decision-making at national and local levels. The study points out the need for the commitment of governments to the transboundary sharing of flood information for EWS and SD.

Therefore, based on the level of the maximum or minimum temperature warming scenarios, a variety of meteorological datasets were selected to assess the asymmetric effect of increased daily extreme temperature on the streamflow from a multi-scale perspective by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Model simulations indicate that the streamflow experiences more significant changes in response to the maximum temperature than in response to the minimum temperature, and the relationships of streamflow with both the maximum and minimum temperatures show an upwards parabolic response function, but the response function varies with the type of warming. Additionally, the seasonal and monthly duration curves results show that the increases in both the maximum and minimum temperatures demonstrate a similar response that leads the proportion of the flood period streamflow to be increased (Tmin: 0.16-0.53%/degrees C; Tmax: 0.11-0.51%/degrees C). When the minimum temperature increases, the higher the original temperature in the region, the greater the proportion of the flood period streamflow increases. However, when the maximum temperature increases, the opposite effect occurs.

Using the top-down allocation mode, we consider the influence of the social, economic, and ecological environments, flood drainage demand and efficiency, and other factors on the allocation of flood drainage rights. A bi-level multi-objective programming model from the perspective of fairness and efficiency is established for the allocation. The Sunan Canal is taken as a typical case study. The model is solved by the multi-objective optimal allocation method and the master-slave hierarchical interactive iteration algorithm. After three iterations of the initial solution, the allocation of flood drainage rights in six flood control regions finally reach an effective state. The results of the model were compared with results based on historical allocation principles, showing that the bi-level multi-objective programming model, based on the principles of fairness and efficiency, is more in line with the current social and economic development of the canal. In view of the institutional background of water resources management in China and the flood drainage pressure faced by various regions, the allocation of flood drainage rights should be comprehensively considered in combination with various factors, and the market mechanism should be utilized to optimize the allocation.

However, improving the accuracy of seasonal forecasting remains a challenge. In this study, a statistical model and four dynamical global circulation models (GCMs) are applied to conduct seasonal rainfall forecasts for the Yangtze River basin. The statistical forecasts are achieved by establishing a linear regression relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. The dynamical forecasts are achieved by downscaling the rainfall predicted by the four GCMs at the monthly and seasonal scales. Historical data of monthly SST and GCM hindcasts from 1982 to 2010 are used to make the forecast. The results show that the SST-based statistical model generally outperforms the GCM simulations, with higher forecasting accuracy that extends to longer lead times of up to 12 months. The SST statistical model achieves a correlation coefficient up to 0.75 and the lowest mean relative error of 6%. In contrast, the GCMs exhibit a sharply decreasing forecast accuracy with lead times longer than 1 month. Accordingly, the SST statistical model can provide reliable guidance for the seasonal rainfall forecasts in the Yangtze River basin, while the results of GCM simulations could serve as a reference for shorter lead times. Extensive scope exists for further improving the rainfall forecasting accuracy of GCM simulations.

Water mites are among the aquatic animal groups with highest share of crenobiotic (=spring-dwelling) species and, therefore, are possibly the best indicators of the ecological status of spring habitats. We studied water mites and environmental factors correlated with their distribution pattern along a eucrenon-hypocrenon gradient. The sampling was conducted in 14 karstic springs located in the Mediterranean part of Montenegro. We collected 17 water mite species of which four species were crenobiotic. We did not find significant differences between the water mite assemblages from the source and springbrook. Similarly, there were no significant differences in number of species and abundance between the studied spring sections, neither for crenobiotic taxa nor for non-crenobiotic taxa. We found that the number of non-crenobiotic taxa was predicted mainly by water depth, whereas the abundance of crenobionts was most strongly associated with temperature. No significant predictors for the number of crenobiotic species in spring habitats were found. Our results revealed also that distance from the nearby water body was the main driver of the crenobiotic species abundance in eucrenon suggesting the large effects of the local flooding events on crenobiotic species. Water mites may help in assessing the response of crenobiotic assemblages in those spring habitats which likely to be flooded in future as the results of ongoing climatic changes.

J	Phonphoton, N; Pharino, C				Phonphoton, Nuchcha; Pharino, Chanathip			A system dynamics modeling to evaluate flooding impacts on municipal solid waste management services	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptation; Bangkok; Flooding; Municipal solid waste management; Planning; System dynamics	RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENERATION; SIMULATION; TRANSPORTATION; CONSTRUCTION; OPTIMIZATION; ADAPTATION; COLLECTION; REDUCTION	The municipal solid waste management service system has been one of the most important service provisions in the city. Complex linkages within the system are impacted by waste quantities and qualities. Due to the complex characteristic of stock and flow in a waste management system, it is difficult to design a sustainable management system that can handle varying conditions, particularly in case of a disaster. Interferences from the natural disaster i.e. flooding could potentially affect the entire MSWM system. Flooding is a major disaster in many regions of the world and poses a challenge as an external disturbance to any part of the waste management system. This research has applied the concept of system dynamics (SD) to understand patterns and evaluate flood impacts on the waste management systems of 22 districts that transport waste to the Nongkhaem transfer station in Bangkok, Thailand. The SD model of waste management illustrates waste generation trends and collection and transfer patterns to predict potential flood-affected areas. The research analyzed different flooding hazard scenarios and evaluated potential impacts within flood-prone areas. The results proved that flooding has various degree of impacts on the accumulated waste amounts of services areas within and outside the flooded areas. The findings can be a guideline to help prepare an appropriate mitigation plan for waste management under flood conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using Methyl Bromide for Interspecies Cell-Cell Signaling and As a Reporter in a Model Soil Consortium	ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY			English	Article						biosensor; community; consortium; gene expression; methyl halide; microbiology; reporter; signaling; soil; syntheticbiology	MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; GENE-EXPRESSION; PATHWAY; BIOREMEDIATION; BIODIVERSITY; TRANSFERASE; BACTERIA; OMICS; WATER	Soil microbial communities with reduced complexity are emerging as model systems for studying consortia-scale phenotypes. To establish synthetic biology tools for studying these communities in hard-to-image environmental materials, we evaluated whether a single member of a model soil consortium (MSC) can be programmed to report on gene expression without requiring matrix disruption. For these studies, we targeted a five-membered MSC that includes Dyadobacter fermentans, Ensifer adhaerens, Rhodococcus sp003130705, Streptomyces sp001905665, and Variovorax beijingensis. By coupling the expression of a methyl halide transferase to a constitutive promoter, we show that V. beijingensis can be programmed to synthesize methyl halides that accumulate in the soil headspace at levels that are >= 24-fold higher than all other MSC members across a range of environmentally relevant hydration conditions. We find that methyl halide production can report on an MSC promoter that is activated by changes in water potential, and we demonstrate that a synthetic gas signal can be read out directly using gas chromatography and indirectly using a soil-derived Methylorubrum that is programmed to produce a visual output in response to methyl halides. These tools will be useful for future studies that investigate how MSC responds to dynamic hydration conditions, such as drought and flood events induced by climate change, which can alter soil water potential and induce the release of stored carbon.

Welfare Analysis of the Vltava River Reservoir System	WATER			English	Article						recreation; water reservoir system; non-market valuation; economic assessment; travel cost method (TCM)	TRAVEL COST; STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; CONTINGENT BEHAVIOR; FLOOD RISK; DEMAND; BENEFITS; QUALITY; MODELS; METAANALYSIS; LIMITATIONS	Contrary to the other functions of multi-purpose reservoirs, recreational use is not associated with a tangible social value, which hinders the search for new balances among optimal uses of water that will likely be needed under climate change. The objective of this study is to analyze visitation behavior and its patterns at a large-scale reservoir system on the Vltava River to quantify the total social benefits associated with recreation in monetary terms and to suggest how the magnitude of estimated recreation welfare relates to hydro-energy benefits, which are in usual practice taken much more into account than recreation in the strategic management of water dams. The elicited average consumer surplus per person and trip is EUR 55.7, which yields a total yearly recreation value of EUR 34 billion (ranging between 22 and 57). When compared to, e.g., the social value of hydro-energy generation, the actual yearly recreation welfare represents 1/3 of this nowadays more prioritized use. The results of the study bring new information for water management bodies that has been missing up to now, and they bring new arguments for reaching socially optimal water use in the strategic and operational management of the cascade of dams. From this perspective, the actual strategic relative prioritization of these two reservoir functions at the pilot site may be viewed as rational.

The quantification of the extent of flooding on selected major Afrotropical lakes to guide management implications	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						flooding; rising water levels; wetland; conservation; great lakes	AFRICAN CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; EAST-AFRICA; FISHERIES; FLOODPLAIN; FUTURE; LIVELIHOODS; VICTORIA; TRENDS	The extent of flooding in vulnerable inland and lacustrine systems can demonstrate the coverage and the magnitude of such phenomenon for policy enhancement. This study examined the extent of flooding due to rising water levels in selected Afrotropical lakes to guide interventions that would sustain the livelihoods of communities affected. The years that were most prone to flooding (2010 and 2020) were used as a baseline in the extraction of changes in spatial extent and area of lacustrine shoreline, and rainfall and satellite altimetry data, using geospatial and remote sensing technologies. The extent of flooding was strongly but insignificantly related (R (2) = 0.63; p = 0.07) to the sizes of the studied lakes and the amount of rainfall. Lakes with the smallest surface areas such as Baringo and Naivasha showed the greatest increase in flooding of 52.63% and 42.62%, respectively. Larger lakes such as Lakes Victoria (1.05%), Turkana (3.77%), and Tanganyika (0.07%) had the lowest increases in areal extent. Furthermore, the topography of the lakes studied further determined the residence time and the extent of flooding, such that lakes such as Edward (-0.09%) and Rukwa (-3.25%) receded during the period when other lakes were flooding. The information and data presented here provides the most up-to-date quantification of flooding to support adaptation strategies for inland lake systems and guide policy implementation.

To overcome this challenge, it is recommended that future automobiles have zero carbon exhaust emissions. Even though battery electric vehicles reduce carbon emissions relative to combustion engines, a carbon footprint still remains in the overall ecosystem unless the battery is powered by renewable energy sources. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is an alternate source for automotive mobility which, similar to battery electric vehicles, has zero carbon emissions from its exhaust pipe. Moreover, the typical system level efficiency of a PEMFC is higher than an equivalent internal combustion powertrain. This review article covers the background history, working principles, challenges and applications of PEMFCs for automotive transportation and power generation in industries. Since the performance of a PEMFC is greatly influenced by the design of the anode and cathode flow channels, an in-depth review has been carried out on different types of flow channel designs. This review reveals the importance of flow channel design with respect to uniform gas (reactant) distribution, membrane proton conductivity, water flooding and thermal management. An exhaustive study has been carried out on different types of flow channels, such as parallel, serpentine, interdigitated and bio-inspired, with respect to their performance and applications.

Here we proposed a probabilistic framework to serve the purpose. Specifically, the framework allows to 1) identify successive occurrence of hydrological droughts and fluvials, 2) estimate the probability of transition from a prior hydrological drought to a succeeding fluvial, and 3) make predictions of fluvials given a preceding dry spell. We applied this framework to predict the following fluvial severity based on the characteristics of hydrological drought at two runoff stations as an illustration. They are located in the Doingjiang Basin of Southern China (Station I) and the Eel River of United States (Station II), respectively. Our results show that the proposed framework can capture the observed fluvials based on the prior drought information at both stations, attesting to its skillful predictability. The transition probability estimate indicates that appreciable changes in the joint distribution of hydrological droughts and fluvials over time at Station I where the increased drought severity tends to enhance the occurrence likelihood of the fluvial happening in close succession, while Station II is subject to the opposite effect. Collectively, this study is expected to broaden the understanding of unusual shifts between droughts and floods, while providing useful information to help policy makers and infrastructure operators develop integrated approach to drought and flood manage-ment in the future.

Present cultivation of this crop covers different humid tropic regions of the world across the continents. The utilization of this fruit in various means to serve the interests of industrial and nutraceutical sector are being explored in the recent past; cultivation of rambutan also trends to develop livelihood quality of growers due to its demand in export and the fresh market as an exotic fruit attributed by its peculiar vibrant red hairy outgrowth of the peel. Fruits are deseeded during processing and the peels and seeds remain as a wasted by-product of the canning industry. Various studies have reported that differ-ent parts of rambutan fruit such as peel, seed and root contain bioactive compounds which hold potentiality for curing inflammation, bacterial diseases, diabetes and cancer. Stakeholders may consider rambutan as an orchard crop since its increased tree biomass will help mitigate climate change and reduce the risk of severe climatic disasters like strong winds, erosion, and flooding. Trees enhance soil fertility and consequently farm productivity. The present review paper has been undertaken for providing an overview of the chemical con-stituents, potential industrial utilization and valuable nutraceutical properties of rambutan along with its role in livelihood development and climate resilience.(c) 2022 SAAB.

Despite sea level and TC activity being influenced by common thermodynamic and dynamic climate variables, their future changes are generally considered independently. Here, we investigate correlations between SLR and TC change derived from simulations of 26 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models. We first explore correlations between SLR and TC activity by inference from two large-scale factors known to modulate TC activity: potential intensity (PI) and vertical wind shear. Under the high emissions SSP5-8.5, SLR is strongly correlated with PI change (positively) and vertical wind shear change (negatively) over much of the western North Atlantic and North West Pacific, with global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) modulating the co-variability. To explore the impact of the joint changes on flood hazard, we conduct climatological-hydrodynamic modeling at five sites along the US East and Gulf Coasts. Positive correlations between SLR and TC change alter flood hazard projections, particularly at Wilmington, Charleston and New Orleans. For example, if positive correlations between SLR and TC changes are ignored in estimating flood hazard at Wilmington, the average projected change to the historical 100 years storm tide event is under-estimated by 12%. Our results suggest that flood hazard assessments that neglect the joint influence of these factors and that do not reflect the full distribution of GSAT change may not accurately represent future flood hazard.

Remote sensing can be an effective technique to investigate changes in runoff on data-scarce regions. This study used Calibrated Passive Microwave Daily EASEGrid 2.0 Brightness Temperature Earth System Data Record (CETB) and M/C signal method to simulate runoff in Lhasa River Basin. This satellite-derived runoff was compared with gauge observations and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model simulations. The results show that (1) the well-correlated satellite-derived M/C signals are able to detect the runoff process in the selected river channels. For most gauges, the runoff generated by M/C signals fit well with observation, giving a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.9, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient greater than 0.8, and relative error less than 15%; (2) When compared to the SWAT model, the M/C signal method has advantages in flood season runoff simulation. These two simulation methods are nearly equal for the entire runoff process; (3) For runoff simulation influenced by the underlying surface and the shape of the river channel, the M/C signal method is better suited in areas with a low fraction vegetation cover and channels with a typical inverted trapezoid shape. Overall, we conclude that M/C signal method simulation is a valuable source of surface water information and could be used for runoff monitoring in data-scarce areas.

They are also among the most degraded ecosystems on Earth. Freshwater flow regimes drive ecological processes contributing to their biodiversity and economic value, but have been modified extensively in many systems by upstream water use. Knowledge of freshwater flow requirements for estuaries (environmental flows or E-flows) lags behind that of rivers and their floodplains. Generalising estuarine E-flows is further complicated by responses that appear to be specific to each system. Here we critically review the E-flow requirements of estuaries to 1) identify the key ecosystem processes (hydrodynamics, salinity regulation, sediment dynamics, nutrient cycling and trophic transfer, and connectivity) modulated by freshwater flow regimes, 2) identify key drivers (rainfall, runoff, temperature, sea level rise and direct anthropogenic) that generate changes to the magnitude, quality and timing of flows, and 3) propose mitigation strategies (e.g., modification of dam operations and habitat restoration) to buffer against the risks of altered freshwater flows and build resilience to direct and indirect anthropogenic disturbances. These strategies support re-establishment of the natural characteristics of freshwater flow regimes which are foundational to healthy estuarine ecosystems.

Urban areas, human health and technosols for the green deal	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH			English	Article						Green infrastructure; Anthropogenic soils; Wastes; Ecosystem services; Soil sealing	SUSTAINABLE CITIES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAVY-METALS; SOIL; INFRASTRUCTURE; CARBON; CHALLENGES; SEDIMENTS; CITY	Authors aim to carry out a bibliographic review as an initial approach to state of the art related to the quality of urban soils, as well as its possible link with human health. This concern arises from the need to highlight the consequences that soil could face, derived from the growth and aging of the population, as well as its predicted preference for urban settlement. Urban development may pose a challenge to the health of urban soils, due to degradative processes that it entails, such as land take, sealing, contamination or compaction. A healthy soil is the one which maintains the capacity to support ecosystem services, so it can provide numerous benefits to human health and well-being (carbon sequestration, protection against flooding, retention and immobilization of pollutants and a growth media for vegetation and food production). This article addresses threats facing urban soils, the strategies put forward by the European Union to deal with them, as well as the issues that require further attention. Greening cities could be a consensual solution, so authors analyze whether soils of cities are ready for that challenge and what resources need to maintain soil ecosystem functions. This review proposes to use made by waste Technosols for a sustainable green city. Although the use of Technosols as a type of soil is very recent, the interest of the scientific community in this field continues to grow.

A flood forecast system can minimize the impacts by predicting the flood hazard before it occurs. Artificial neural networks (ANN) could efficiently process large amounts of data and find relations that enable faster flood predictions. The aim of this study is to perform multistep forecasts for 1-5 h after the flooding event has been triggered by a forecast threshold value. In this work, an ANN developed for the real-time forecast of flood inundation with a high spatial resolution (4 m x 4 m) is extended to allow for multiple forecasts. After trained with 120 synthetic flood events, the ANN was first tested with 60 synthetic events for verifying the forecast performance for 3 h, 6 h, 9 h and 12 h lead time. The model produces good results, as shown by more than 81% of all grids having an RMSE below 0.3 m. The ANN is then applied to the three historical flood events to test the multistep inundation forecast. For the historical flood events, the results show that the ANN outputs have a good forecast accuracy of the water depths for (at least) the 3 h forecast with over 70% accuracy (RMSE within 0.3 m), and a moderate accuracy for the subsequent forecasts with (at least) 60% accuracy.

Understanding the protective coping behaviors of the public in flood disasters is crucial to the implementation of effective flood mitigation measures and flood risk management. In this study, influential factors affecting protective coping behaviors in the face of flood disasters were identified, and the effects of these factors were discussed as well. Shenzhen City in China was selected as the study area, in which a questionnaire survey of 339 respondents was carried out in three flood-prone districts. Correlation analysis was conducted to preselect potential influential factors. Then, two linear regression models were established to identify main influential factors and to explore the interaction effects of these factors. The results indicated that age, monthly income, flood experience, trust in government and insurance willingness were main influential factors of protective coping behaviors. Trust in government had the highest positive correlation coefficient, while monthly income and age were negatively associated with protective coping behaviors. The interaction between insurance willingness and monthly income jointly affected protective coping behaviors of the public. The findings of this study could help authorities better understand the public's intention to cope with flood and design effective risk reduction measures, not only for Shenzhen, but also for many other similar cities that facing with the same situation.

Several works deal with LoRa (Long Range) communications over land and in the presence of obstacles, but little is known about LoRa communication reliability over water, as it may happen in real flooding scenarios. One aspect that is known to influence the communication quality is the height at which nodes are placed. However, its impact in water environments is unknown. This is an important aspect that may influence the location of sensor nodes and the network topology. To fill this gap, we conducted several experiments using a real LoRa deployment to evaluate several features related to data communication. We considered two deployment scenarios corresponding to countryside and estuary environments. The nodes were placed at low heights, communicating, respectively, over the ground and over the water. Measurements for packet loss, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and round-trip time (RTT) were collected during a period of several weeks. Results for both scenarios are presented and compared in this paper. One important conclusion is that the communication distance and reliability are significantly affected by tides when the communication is done over the water and nodes are placed at low heights. Based on the RTT measurements and on the characteristics of the hardware, we also derive a battery lifetime estimation model that may be helpful for the definition of an adequate maintenance plan.

J	Haeffner, M; Hellman, D				Haeffner, Melissa; Hellman, Dana			The social geometry of collaborative flood risk management: a hydrosocial case study of Tillamook County, Oregon	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Social geometry; Hydrosocial; Flood risk; Disaster management; Adaptation	MITIGATION POLICIES; TOP-DOWN; PERSPECTIVES; IMPACTS; ECONOMY; PEOPLE; DAMAGE; RIVER; FEMA	Coastal and riparian flooding are costly and disruptive natural hazards and already a regular part of life in some areas of the USA. Flooding events caused by sea-level rise and climate change are expected to increase in frequency and severity in the future, creating social, ecological, and economic problems at local, city, state, and federal levels. It is clear that normative, infrastructure-oriented, and strictly hydrological solutions to flooding have not appropriately met these challenges, nor have they adequately addressed relevant socio-political factors which shape hydrological processes. Using the case study of Tillamook County, this study draws upon qualitative interview data to identify and explain social factors which have influenced the outcome of a collaborative, socially engaged flood management project. These include previous flood experience; emotions and feelings; interests and concerns; preferred management strategies; barriers to community-scientific engagement; and perceptions of a mediation process. This situation is further explored within the framework of social geometry, which is used to explain changes in social position and relationships through an interactive, collaborative process. In this case, mediation is shown to decrease both relational space and differences in status between the two primary actor groups, leading to mutually agreeable outcomes but not without dispute. Flood managers and researchers may find this case study useful when analyzing qualitative data related to flood risk management, and/or planning flood management strategies, particularly in disaster-prone regions.

Changes in Antecedent Soil Moisture Modulate Flood Seasonality in a Changing Climate	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							EXTREME PRECIPITATION; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; DATA-SETS; RAINFALL; TRENDS; AUSTRALIA; FREQUENCY; SHIFTS; RISK; PROBABILITY	Due to difficulties in identifying a climate change signal in flood magnitude, it has been suggested that shifts in flood timing, that is, the day of annual streamflow maxima, may be detectable. Here, we use high-quality streamflow, largely free of snowmelt, from 221 catchments across Australia to investigate the influence of shifts in soil moisture and rainfall timing on annual streamflow maxima timing. In tropical areas we find that flood timing is strongly linked to the timing of both rainfall and soil moisture annual maxima. However, in southern Australia flood timing is more correlated with soil moisture maxima than rainfall maxima. The link between flood, soil moisture, and rainfall timing is confounded by event severity: For less extreme events flood timing is more likely to correspond to soil moisture timing, whereas rainfall timing becomes increasingly important as flood severity increases. Using circular regression to investigate nonstationarity, we find that flood timing is shifting to earlier in the year in the tropics and later in the year in the southwest of the continent, consistent with changes in mean and extreme rainfall and shifts in soil moisture timing due to tropical expansion. In southeast Australia, there is evidence that the mechanisms controlling flood seasonality are changing with a reversal of trends post Millennium Drought. Overall, changes in soil moisture timing, compared to changes in rainfall timing, are found to have a greater influence on changes in annual maxima streamflow flood timing.

Makran continental margin sedimentation during the Late Holocene	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Makran active margin; Gulf of Oman; sediment distribution; turbidite	ACCRETIONARY PRISM; LATE QUATERNARY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARABIAN SEA; PAKISTAN; GULF; DEFORMATION; TURBIDITES; PALYNOLOGY; VEGETATION	Sedimentation in the Makran active margin is governed by a complex interaction of atmospheric, tectonics, and hydrodynamic setting of the northern flank of the Gulf of Oman. The mixed clastic carbonate sediments in the tectonically and hydrodynamically active environment have complicated the distribution pattern. The region is suffering from basic sedimen-tological data, and specifically, the sedimentation history of the Holocene deposits has been rarely studied in the Iranian coast. To deal with this deficiency, surface and core sediment samples from the Iranian continental shelf and upper slope of the Gulf of Oman have been studied using standard sedinientological techniques. The overall sediment distribution pattern demonstrates that the grain size gradually decreases from the shoreline to the deeper zones. However, some medium- to coarse-grained sand patches can be found in the deeper parts, especially in the middle part of the studied area that can be related to sediment supply of ephemeral rivers discharging into the sea in rainy seasons and (or) high-energy events (i.e., turbidites and tsunamis during the Holocene). Several horizons of the coarse-grained detrital sediments are detectable in the upper slope sediment cores. The coarse-grained materials are received from the hinterland during flash floods and could be accumulated due to mass wasting events. The elevated amount of organic materials in the upper slope indicates a deficit of dissolved oxygen that leads to preservation of organic materials in the bottom sediments.	[Lahijani, H. A.

Can we detect anthropogenic disturbances	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article						West and Central Africa; Rainforest resilience; Natural processes versus human impact; Palaeoecological versus archaeological; evidence; Palaeoenvironments; Natural dispersers; Multidisciplinary techniques; Lakes; swamps; Sediment records; Pioneer species; Oil palm; Tropical forest dynamics; Pollen	HOLOCENE CLIMATIC CHANGES; RESOLUTION POLLEN RECORD; ELAEIS-GUINEENSIS JACQ.; LAKE BAROMBI MBO; EQUATORIAL AFRICA; LATE PLEISTOCENE; CARBON ISOTOPES; ORGANIC-MATTER; FOSSIL DIATOMS; HUMID PERIOD	The vast tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa were impacted by marked climatic deterioration, which mainly developed between 2500 and 2000 cal yr BP. However, the incidence of human intervention in these rainforests appears all the more speculative, although this was the period when the first stages of Bantu migration occurred towards the south. On the scale of the last millennium, which has seen increasing penetration and colonization of these Bantu peoples, one can envisage a priori a more accentuated anthropogenic pressure on the forest landscape. The combined observations of the environmental processes during the last 1000 years, as preserved in sediments from lakes, swamps, flooded forests and even oceanic environments, are presented on the basis of 24 records. The dominant number of sites in the humid forest or wooded savannas recorded only processes of relatively small size and local effects influencing vegetation cover almost simultaneously around 1000 and 500 cal yr BP; nothing is comparable with the devastating effect on a very large scale of the 2600 cal yr BP forest crisis. Conversely, other sites located in more perennial forest or savanna did not reveal any discontinuity. In all the examples of sedimentary archives considered, no out-of-phase or unusual event, possibly linked to human population and its impact, was observed. However, in more recent times, in intensive iron-ore mining/smelting areas, changes in the vegetal cover could be a legacy of charcoal production impacting forest biomass. Nevertheless, despite the clear cultural and socio-political importance of iron, its role in shaping vegetation communities in the Central African forest is generally presumed to be negligible. The oceanic causes of these climatic oscillations are more widely accepted. On a larger scale, the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are climatic anomalies visible in a number of palaeoenvironmental records worldwide and date to similar to 1600-1000 cal yr BP and similar to 700-100 cal yr BP, respectively. These events are less visible or sometimes not present in some palynological records of tropical Africa, whereas reconstructions from lacustrine records in Atlantic equatorial Africa show overall reductions in lake levels and increases in pollen belonging to light-demanding and pioneer vegetation formations in relation to these two oscillations. To reply to what was more important << the potential influence of human activities on regional climate, or the vulnerability of societies to environmental variability >>, it appears clearly to date, that the second paradigm is most likely. However, today, the ongoing combined efffects of climate change and human impact, including the decimation of the diversity of seed dispersers necessary to regenerate the rainforests of West and Central Africa, may have irreparable and unforeseen consequences.

Understanding the mechanisms of TSS variations in response to environmental drivers is of broad interest for ecology and geomorphology. The Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China is a fragile coastal region that has been affected by human activities and climate change. Here, we investigated TSS along the YRD shoreline over two decades with time-series satellite data (2002-2020). We observed that TSS concentration decreased significantly in nearshore waters (5-m isobath) surrounding the YRD, especially in the LaiZhou Bay. During the same time period, wave height (WH) along the deltaic shoreline and sediment load from the Yellow River have decreased, while sea surface height (SSH) has displayed a positive trend. Our results indicate that WH and SSH play a major role in sediment resuspension and dispersion, while the YSD mildly affected TSS variability along the coast. Monthly bed shear stress triggered by waves was then computed using WH, wave period (WP), and SSH. Bed shear stress and TSS displayed a positive correlation. We concluded that seasonal oscillations in SSH in conjunction with wind waves are responsible for TSS variability in the shallow waters in front of the YRD.

To address this issue, a frequently used preliminary tool is the flood susceptibility mapping of a region using a range of widely available data. Therefore, the present study introduces an index-based approach able to qualitatively assess flood-prone areas, named Physical Susceptibility to Floods Index (PhySFI), based on a multi-criteria decision-making method and developed in a GIS environment. The methodology presupposes a critical discussion of variables commonly used in other flood indexes, intending to simplify the proposed representation, and emphasizes the role of the user/modeler. PhySFI is composed of just four indicators, based on physical parameters of the assessed environment. This index was developed and first applied in the city of Rio de Janeiro, as part of the Rio de Janeiro Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The validation process was based on a comparative analysis with flood extent and height simulated by the hydrodynamic modeling of four watersheds within the study area, with different urbanization processes for each one. The results indicate that the index is a powerful preliminary tool to assess flood-prone areas in coastal cities.

The combination of hydrological model and optimization algorithm can automatically find the optimal solution under multiple objectives. Given the multi-functional characteristics of GI, choosing the optimization objectives of GI are critical for multiple stakeholders. This study proposes a GI optimization method considering spatial functional zoning. Based on the basic conditions, the study area is divided into the flood risk control zone (FRCZ) and the total runoff control zone (TRCZ). The integrated model coupling hydrological model and optimization algorithm is applied to obtain the Pareto fronts and corresponding non-dominated solutions. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to support the decision-making process. The optimal solution obtained for the FRCZ achieves a flood risk reduction rate of 60.49% with an average life cycle cost per year of 0.20 x 108 Chinese Yuan (CNY); The optimal solution obtained for the TRCZ achieves a total runoff reduction rate of 22.83% with an average life cycle cost per year of 0.17 x 108 CNY. This study provides a reference for stakeholders in GI planning and design.

The efforts to alleviate the effects of river flow alterations have paved the way for the emergence and expansion of the concept of e-flows. The role of e-flows in ecosystem protection and water resources management is not yet fully understood and practiced. This review summarizes the historical evolution of the concept of e-flows and recaps its assessment methods; analyzes the impacts of river flow alterations; indicates the challenges e-flows have been facing and identifies the gaps in the focus of e-flows research. A total of 303 articles published since 2010 were collected and systematically assessed. Most of the publications are focused on describing the effects and management of river flow alterations. According to the findings of this meta-analysis, less attention is given to basin scale, social and policy aspects of e-flows. Furthermore, little considerations are given to the part played by groundwater in e-flows along with the roles of e-flows in maintaining the health of floodplains and e-flows of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams.

While multilevel social-ecological network analysis has been applied to assess fit in various contexts, it has not yet been applied to understand transboundary flood planning. We investigate the social-ecological fit of collaborative flood planning efforts in the St. John River Basin, located in New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada and Maine in the United States, focusing on two social-ecological fit challenges: shared management of ecological resources and management of interconnected resources. Our results displayed organizations have a tendency to collaborate with others located in the same sub-sub-basin and not with those working in different sub-sub-basins, indicating limited social-ecological fit of the collaboration network to flooding at the basin scale. Qualitative analysis identified collaboration provided increased knowledge and technical resources to engage in flood planning, but it was hindered by a lack of financial resources, time constraints, and a lack of shared commitment. Collaborative relationships among organizations working in different sub-sub-basins are essential for cohesive flood planning at the basin level, and in this case, there is potential for an increase in collaboration among ecological neighbors to govern for ecological connectivity.

TEMPORAL CHANGES OF VASCULAR PLANT DIVERSITY IN RESPONSE TO TREE DIEBACK IN A MEDITERRANEAN LOWLAND FOREST	ANNALI DI BOTANICA			Chinese	Article						ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; EU HABITATS; FLORA ANALYSIS; LIFE PROGRAMME; NATURA2000	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDICATOR VALUES; OAK DECLINE; BIODIVERSITY; GROWTH; FLORA; CONSERVATION; DISTURBANCE; ECOLOGY; TAXA	Lowland forests underwent a century long history of deforestation and degradation that left only few remnants of this forest type, especially in the Mediterranean region. These remnants have high conservation value but are threatened by tree diebacks related to different causes. Here we focused on the area of Palo Laziale (oak floodplain forest) and on the effects of the tree dieback following the summer drought of 2003. In the framework of an ecological restoration project (LIFE PRIMED LIFE17 NAT/GR/000511), we collected data on plant communities' species composition both in 2019/2020 and compared these data to those collected in 1990, also accounting for life forms, chorotypes and Ellenberg Indicator Values. This analysis was conducted to assess whether there was any change in the species composition following the forest dieback. The total flora of the site increased from 462 to 490 species. Moreover, there has been a turnover of species with the loss of some grassland and halophytic species and the entrance of allochthonous/ruderal and freshwater habitat species. Despite this, the plant diversity remained unchanged in bioindication terms, demonstrating a certain resilience of the ecosystem plant species, confirming the floristic re-survey approach to identify declining processes and support ecosystem-based restoration actions elsewhere.

Based on the latest generation of CMIP6 climate models and high-resolution grid observation data, the quantile mapping method and Taylor diagrams were used to correct and evaluate the simulation values. Six extreme precipitation indices for the near (2021-2040), middle (2051-2070), and far (2081-2100) periods of the 21st century were analyzed under shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The results show that most of the extreme precipitation indices will increase over the Minjiang River Basin in the future, and both extreme precipitation and persistent drought will increase at the same time, which is more likely to cause extreme drought and flood disasters. For seasonal variation, the total amount and intensity of extreme precipitation will increase fastest in autumn, while the frequency of extreme precipitation will increase most in summer. Multimodel median changes show a decrease in the return period of RX1day (the maximum 1-day precipitation). By the end of the 21st century, under SSP5-8.5, the extreme events expected once every 100 years under the current climate are expected to occur approximately every 18.6 years.

Our study is focused on the reconstruction of the settlement's structure and character of the environment from which the site drew resources. These research questions were addressed by the interpretation of plant macroremains, charcoals, and the results of the spatial model. We have focused on the maximum size of the settlement that the surrounding countryside was able to withstand. Our results clearly demonstrated significant deforestation and intensive land use in the vicinity of the Late Bronze Age study site. As the weed taxa showed, a wide range of crops was grown in rather dry or less often in damp fields. Based on our archaeobotanical results, we were able to reconstruct several types of grasslands: dry pastures and fallow fields on plateaus and slopes, wet pastures or meadows in the floodplain. Acidophilous oak forests, alluvial forests, and shrubs were reconstructed as the most common forest habitats in the vicinity of the study site. Based on the archaeological knowledge of the region, we assume relatively low population density during the Late Bronze Age, and thus only a small part of the more or less forested landscape was significantly affected by human activities.

What constitutes a fair distribution, however, is a normative question. In this study, we explore the use of different moral principles drawn from theories of distributive justice to evaluate fairness. We use adaptation planning in Vietnam Mekong Delta as a case study. We evaluate the preference ranking of six alternative policies for seven moral principles across an ensemble of scenarios. Under the baseline scenario, each principle yields distinctive preference rankings, though most principles identify the same policy as the most preferred one. Across the ensemble of scenarios, the commonly used utilitarian principle yields the most stable ranking, while rankings from other principles are more sensitive to uncertainty. The sufficientarian and the envy-free principles yield the most distinctive ranking of policies, with a median ranking correlation of only 0.07 across all scenarios. Finally, we identify scenarios under which using these two principles results in reversed policy preference rankings. Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple moral principles in evaluating the fairness of adaptation policies, as this would reduce the possibility of maladaptation.

To cope effectively with climate change, it is important to use consistent and scientific water information of water resources. In this study, we use a hydrological analysis of the Saint Blaise Vallon area to indicate how the damage from natural disasters that may come in the future may be minimized. In addition, a hydrological analysis and a numerical simulation model were implemented to estimate runoff and runoff coefficients derived from a heavy rainfall event that caused serious damage to river flooding. A runoff sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the soil parameters. In particular, a method using the hydrological model and the hydrological sensitivity analysis were applied to the target watershed, and the results of the peak outlet discharge were analyzed in time series so that they could be used for flood prediction and disaster management. In addition, the flood discharge and runoff coefficients during the flooding of the target watershed were presented through the study.

Here, this process is examined at Plum Island Sound and Essex Inlets, Massachusetts, USA. One major finding from this study is that sand is transferred along the coast-especially at tidal inlets-by parcels, in discrete steps, and over decadal-scale periods. The southerly orientation of the main-ebb channel at Plum Island Sound, coupled with the landward migration of bars from the ebb delta to the central portion of the downdrift Castle Neck barrier island, have formed a beach protuberance. During the constructional phase, sand is sequestered at the protuberance and the spit-end of the barrier becomes sediment starved, leading to shoreline retreat and a broadening of the spit platform at the mouth to Essex Bay (downdrift side of Castle Neck). Storm-induced sand transport from erosion of the spit and across the spit platform is washed into Essex Bay, filling channels and enlarging flood deltas. This study illustrates the pathways and processes of sand transfer along the shoreline of a barrier-island/tidal-inlet system and provides an important example of the processes that future hydrodynamic and sediment-transport modeling should strive to replicate.

One of the conventional ways to model or forecast such events is to utilize hydrological models driven by meteorological and hydrological station data. However, this suffers from complicated parameter specification and large uncertainties, particularly in regions with very few gauged stations. Based on the daily downscaled Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) solutions, this study employed three different machine learning models and two hydrological models for flood modeling at the daily timescale by taking the Xijiang River Basin in China as a case study. The results show that: (1) the uncertainty of daily GRACE solutions alone governs the difference between GRACE data and hydrological simulations; (2) there is a strong correlation between the high-frequency components of runoff anomalies and terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), and runoff plays a dominant role in TWSA variation during floods; (3) the developed machine learning models can model runoff during floods effectively and outperform the hydrological models. The proposed comprehensive method based on remote sensing satellites provides a potential new way for flood modeling, particularly for poorly gauged regions.

Yet, it remains unclear how fire-flood sequences influence downstream coastal littoral systems. It is timely to examine terrestrial-coastal connections because climate change is increasing the frequency, size, and intensity of wildfires, altering precipitation rates, and accelerating sea-level rise; and these factors can be understood as contrasting accretionary and erosive agents for coastal systems. Here we provide new satellite-derived shoreline measurements of Big Sur, California and show how river sediment discharge significantly influenced shoreline positions during the past several decades. A 2016 wildfire followed by record precipitation increased sediment discharge in the Big Sur River and resulted in almost half of the total river sediment load of the past 50 years (similar to 2.2 of similar to 4.8 Mt). Roughly 30% of this river sediment was inferred to be littoral-grade sand and was incorporated into the littoral cell, causing the widest beaches in the 37-year satellite record and spreading downcoast over timescales of years. Hence, the impact of fire-flood events on coastal sediment budgets may be substantial, and these impacts may increase with time considering projected intensification of wildfires and extreme rain events under global warming.

Lessons to Learn after the Heavy Rain and Pluvial Floods in Germany 2021	WATER			English	Article						flash flood; cascading impacts; compounding event; multi-risk; disaster risk management; Germany	RISK; CHALLENGES	Floods are a known natural hazard in Germany, but the amount of precipitation and ensuing high death toll and damages after the events especially from 14 to 15 July 2021 came as a surprise. Almost immediately questions about failure in the early warning chains and the effectiveness of the German response emerged, also internationally. This article presents lessons to learn and argues against a blame culture. The findings are based on comparisons with findings from previous research projects carried out in the Rhein-Erft Kreis and the city of Cologne, as well as on discussions with operational relief forces after the 2021 events. The main disaster aspects of the 2021 flood are related to issuing and understanding warnings, a lack of information and data exchange, unfolding upon a situation of an ongoing pandemic and aggravated further by critical infrastructure failure. Increasing frequencies of flash floods and other extremes due to climate change are just one side of the transformation and challenge, Germany and neighbouring countries are facing. The vulnerability paradox also heavily contributes to it; German society became increasingly vulnerable to failure due to an increased dependency on its infrastructure and emergency system, and the ensuing expectations of the public for a perfect system.

To systematically consider nonstationarity in regional frequency analysis (RFA), the features accounting for temporal variability of data series were developed and a nonstationary index flood model considering the trend and jump mutations was proposed in this study. The features extracted by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) were regarded as attributes to identify homogeneous regions. The fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and the combination of the self-organizing feature map and Ward's agglomerative hierarchical clustering (SOM+Ward) were compared. Then the complete nonstationary RFA was applied to the annual maximum daily precipitation (AMDP) of Jiangxi province, China. The results indicate that the regionalization with the attributes reflecting temporal variability of the data series is more detailed. Moreover, the performance of SOM+Ward is better than FCM. The comparison results of precipitation quantiles, which were estimated by stationary and the proposed nonstationary index model, indicate that ignoring nonstationarity in RFA affects the choice of the best-fit distribution and the determination of index flood. In addition, the complete framework of nonstationary RFA developed in this study can provide more proper information when stations with trend and jump mutations exist in the region.

This paper reviews the causes and consequences of coastal flooding in European Mediterranean countries, common and advanced solutions implemented to mitigate flood risk, and the importance of stakeholder involvement in developing these solutions. Climate change, intensive urbanization, tourism, deforestation, wildfires, and erosion are the main causes of coastal flooding, leading to social and economic losses, degradation of ecosystems, and water and soil contamination due to saltwater intrusion. Various measures for mitigating urban coastal flooding have been implemented, including coastal barriers, infrastructural drainage systems, wetlands, and mobile dams. Development and implementation of such solutions should be performed in close collaboration with stakeholders, but their current engagement at the coordination and/or decision-making level does not allow full integration of local knowledge in flood mitigation projects. Various processes are used to engage stakeholders in coastal flood mitigation, but participatory approaches are required to integrate their perspectives into performance analysis of potential solutions. Such approaches would allow a balance to be reached between nature conservation, market forces, stakeholder needs, and decision-makers' priorities, resulting in development of innovative and sustainable mitigation solutions to enhance urban resilience to coastal flooding.

One option cities have to become more climate-proof is to increase infiltration of stormwater into soil through permeable pavement and thus reduce discharge of stormwater into sewer systems. To analyze the market receptivity for permeable pavements in the Netherlands, this article focuses on the perception of end-users towards key transition factors in the infrastructure transformation processes. Market receptivity was studied on two levels: (1) on the system level, by analyzing 20 key factors in the Dutch urban water sector that enable wider application of permeable pavements; and (2) on the technology level, by analyzing 12 key factors that explain why decision makers select permeable pavements or not. Results show that trust between cooperating partners was perceived as the system level key factor that needs to be improved most to facilitate the wider uptake of permeable pavements. Additionally, the association of end-users with permeable pavement, particularly their willingness to apply these technologies and their understanding of what kinds of benefits these technologies could bring, was regarded the most important receptivity attribute. On the technology level, the reliability of permeable pavement was regarded as the most important end-user consideration for selecting this technology.

Rainwater harvesting systems and green roofs are recognized as being among the most effective blue-green mitigation measures. However, performances of these systems have currently been investigated only at laboratory or very-small local scales. In this work, we assess the potential benefit of the extensive installation of these solutions on all the rooftops of 9 cities, with different climatological and geographical characteristics. Both surface discharge reduction and delay between rainfall and runoff peak generation have been investigated. Green roofs ensure a larger average lag time between rainfall and runoff peaks than rainwater harvesting systems, without significant differences between intensive and extensive structures. On the other hand, the cost-efficiency analysis, considering the entire urban area, shows a higher retention capacity with a lower financial investment for rainwater harvesting rather than for green roofs in most cases. For extreme rainfall events, large-scale installation of rainwater harvesting systems coupled with intensive green roofs over the entire city have shown to be the most efficient solution, with a total discharge reduction that can vary from 5% to 15%, depending on the city characteristics and local climate.

Using high-resolution satellite images, we undertook qualitative and quantitative analysis of lake type, characteristics and distribution, and placed our findings within the context of existing Peru-wide lake inventories. We also mapped and analyzed past GLOFs, revealing a total of 10 GLOFs and 4 ambiguous events, most of which have not been reported before. We found that past GLOFs usually occurred as a result of moraine dam breach during the proglacial stage of lake evolution. Further, we used our lake inventory to evaluate GLOF susceptibility of all lakes larger than 20,000 m(2). Of 46 evaluated lakes, only two lakes (Lake Tsacra and Lake W014) are currently susceptible to generating a GLOF, which would most likely be through dam overtopping resulting from a flood originating in smaller lakes located upstream. The future perspectives of lake evolution and implications for GLOF hazard management are discussed in light of the post-Little Ice Age glacier ice loss as well as in the context of extensive related research undertaken in the nearby Cordillera Blanca.

J	Diodato, N; Bellocchi, G				Diodato, Nazzareno; Bellocchi, Gianni			Reconstruction of Seasonal Net Erosion in a Mediterranean Landscape (Alento River Basin, Southern Italy) over the Past Five Decades	WATER			English	Article						erosive rainfall; parsimonious modeling; river basin; soil erosion	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-EROSION; FLUVIAL SEDIMENT; LAND-USE; IMPACTS; RATES; YIELD	In the low Mediterranean basin, late spring and autumn rainfall events have the potential to increase discharge and transport substantial amounts of sediment soil (that is, the net soil erosion from a watershed). For the Alento River Basin (ARB), located in the low Tyrrhenian coast of Italy, we estimated changes of net erosion as dependent on the seasonality of antecedent soil moisture and its control on rainfall-runoff and erosivity. Based on rainfall and runoff erosivity sub-models, we developed a simplified model to evaluate basin-wide sediment yields on a monthly basis by upscaling point rainfall input. For the period 1951-2018, the reconstruction of a time series of monthly net erosion data indicated a decreasing trend of the sediment yield after 1991. Revegetation and land abandonment that occurred in the last decades can explain such a decrease of net erosion, which occurred even when rainfall erosivity increased. This response, obtained at the basic scale, does not exclude that rapidly developing mesoscale convective systems, typically responsible for the heaviest and most destructive rainfall events in the ARB, can affect small catchments, which are the most vulnerable systems to storm-driven flash floods and soil erosion hazards during soil tilling in spring and at beginning of autumn.

In this study, differences in plant growth, Cd uptake and accumulation, and extractable Cd in the rhizosphere between flooded and non-flooded (well-drained) Salix genotypes were investigated using a pot experiment in the rainshelt. All Salix genotypes grew well under well-drained conditions. In contrast, the flooded Salix genotypes developed hypertrophied lenticels, adventitious roots and aerenchyma, and decreased aboveground biomass production compared with the corresponding non-flooded genotypes, varying with genotypes and Cd levels in the medium. The non-flooded Salix genotypes had high Cd accumulation in aerial tissues with high leaf Cd bioconcentration factors (BCF) and translocation factors (TFs) relative to genotypes, displaying good Cd phytoextraction potentials. The flooded Salix genotypes dramatically decreased Cd accumulation in aerial tissues with low Cd BCFs and TFs, and large amounts of Cd accumulated in roots compared to the non-flooded genotypes, showing Cd phytostabilization traits. The extractable Cd in rhizosphere changed with genotypes and treatments, and comparatively, EDTA-extractable Cd could reflect well Cd phytoavailability to the willows in the soil. It was concluded that flooding tended to shift from phytoextraction to phytostabilization for Cd by willows during whole growing season.

To understand the flood hazard and its variation in the future, the current and future flood hazards in the 21st century in China are discussed. Floods and their trends are assessed using the accumulation precipitation during heavy rainfall process (AP_HRP), which are calculated based on historical meteorological observations and the outputs of a global climate model (GCM) under three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The flood-causing HRPs counted by the flood-causing critical precipitation (the 60% fractile of AP_HRP) capture more than 70% of historical flood events. The projection results indicate that the flood hazards could increase under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and increase slightly under RCP2.6 during the 21st century (2011-2099). The spatial characteristics of flood hazards and their increasing trends under the three RCPs are similar in most areas of China. More floods could occur in southern China, including Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi and Fujian provinces, which could become more serious in southeastern China and the northern Yunnan province. Construction of water conservancy projects, reservoir dredging, improvement of drainage and irrigation equipment and enhancement of flood control and storage capacity can mitigate the impacts of floods and waterlogging on agriculture.

Although the hydrological benefits of LIDs have been extensively documented, the climate impact on LID performance remains unclear with increasing variations in spatial and temporal climate patterns. This systematic review contributes to providing a structured summary of research on how LID systems are sensitive to climate variability by empirical and hypothetical research approaches. The selected 46 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2003 and 2017 were analyzed by key variables, including climatic factors, LID types, and hydrologic measures used to quantify LID performance. A conceptual framework formulated in this study synthesizes the relationship between climate and LID effectiveness. The results of weighted meta-analysis reveal a greater sensitivity of runoff volume to changing storm frequency than peak discharge rates, while the capacity of LID systems to reduce both volume and peak discharge rates diminishes with increasing storm intensity. Future explorations of the sensitivity of LIDs to climate fluctuations will help strategize LID installation for targeted storm patterns and flood mitigation goals. To enhance existing methods and make a balance between empirical and hypothetical knowledge, this study suggests future directions of research and encourages development of effective stormwater management policy.

The aggravating non-stationarity under the changing environment rocked this foundation. The hedging theory is one of the options for adaptive operation based on hydrological forecasts, which can provide a practical tool for optimal reservoir operation under a changing environment. However, the connections between hedging theory and rule curves are not clear. This paper establishes the linkage of rule curves and hedging theory by analyzing three fundamental problems surrounding the design of conventional rule curves, namely the law and design of water supply rule curves, the determination of flood control storage, and the division of refill and drawdown circle. The general interpretation of the conventional water supply rule curves with hedging theory is conducted. Both the theoretical analyses and the Danjiangkou Reservoir case study reveal that, based on the historical records, the rule curves can be interpreted as a specific expression of hedging theory. This intrinsic linkage allows us to propose a more general and scientific method of updating rule curves in the context of non-stationarity. On this basis, the rule-curve-based climate adaptation strategies are figured out using hedging theory. This research is helpful for practical adaptive operation of reservoirs in the changing environment.

Grey infrastructure has long been used for coastal flood protection but can lead to unintended negative impacts. Natural infrastructure often provides similar services as well as added benefits that support short- and long-term biological, cultural, social, and economic goals. While natural infrastructure is becoming more widespread in practice, it often represents a relatively small fraction within portfolios of coastal risk-reducing strategies compared to more traditional grey infrastructure. This study provides a comprehensive review of how natural infrastructure is being used along the United States Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbeancoastsrelated to four habitats - tidal marshes, beaches and barrier islands, mangroves, and biogenic reefs. We compare information on the benefits, opportunities and challenges of implementing natural, grey and hybrid infrastructure in the coastal zone. In addition, we present a suite of actions to increase information and reduce uncertainty so that coastal mangers and planners are aware of the full suite of options for restoration, conservation and planning that maximize ecosystem services over short- and long-term planning horizons.

J	Kiratli, H; Seymen, M; Kiymaci, G				Kiratli, Havvanur; Seymen, Musa; Kiymaci, Gulbanu			Determination of tolerance to flooding stress in melon cultivars by agronomic and physio-biochemical responses	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION			English	Article						Antioxidant enzyme; Color pigments; Cucumis melo; Growth parameter; Photosynthetic activity		Global climate change enhances the effect of abiotic stress factors, which cause limited plant growth, yield losses, and reduced quality. Today, flooding has become an important stress factor restricting plant growth. Recently, researchers have worked out strategies that increase tolerance to flooding stress (Flo). This study aimed to examine the effects of Flo applied to melon cultivars on their agronomic and physio-biochemical properties. Commercially grown cultivars of melon, which is an important vegetable species with economic importance worldwide, included Kirkagac type Sari F1 (C1), Damla F1 (C2), Yucel F1 (C3), 1071 (candidate) (C4), Surmeli F1 (C5), Westeros F1 (C6), Kirkagac 637 (C7), Kirkagac 589 (C8), Super Soykan (C9), Kirkagac local (C10), and Kyrgyzstan local (C11) which were the first treatment in this study. Another treatment was full irrigation (FI) and Flo. After 10 days of the application of flooding stress to plants during seedling growth, they were harvested, and some related measurements of their parameters were made. As a result of Flo application, all melon cultivars were adversely affected, as observed by decreases in values of plant fresh weight, plant dry weight, number of leaves, plant height, root fresh weight, root dry weight, and leaf area by approximately 30, 21, 24, 21, 28, 38 and 39%, respectively. Moreover, Flo negatively affected photosynthesis and pigment content, causing an increase of 47% in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and 50% in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. On the other hand, significant increases were observed in proline and protein contents and antioxidant enzyme activities under stress. Based on the evaluated data, Kirkagac 637, Kirkagac 589, and Kyrgyzstan local cultivars that were the least affected by stress were identified as tolerant cultivars, while the most affected cultivars, Sari F1 and Yucel F1, were found to be the sensitive cultivars.

J	Mitchell, M; Hendricks, J; Schatt, D				Mitchell, Molly; Hendricks, Jessica; Schatt, Daniel			Road network analyses elucidate hidden road flooding impacts under accelerating sea level rise	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						road flooding; sea level rise; network analysis; community impacts; climate change	US EAST-COAST	Introduction: As sea level rises and coastal communities simultaneously grow, road flooding has the potential to significantly disrupt travel along road networks and make houses, businesses, and critical facilities difficult to reach. The impacts of tidal and storm surge flooding on roadways present challenging social and economic considerations for all coastal jurisdictions. Maintenance, public and private accessibility, evacuation routes, emergency services are just a few of the common themes local governments are beginning to address for low-lying roadways currently known to flood. Continuation of these services allows a community to thrive, to maintain or increase its tax base, and to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizenry.Methods: A traditional approach to analyzing road flood overlays flooding areas on roadways and focuses only on impacts within the actual zone of inundation. However, road flooding can also cut-off access to non-flooded roads and properties, closing the transportation corridor into or out of their downstream dwelling/service areas and other areas that may be impacted. In this study, we examined changing road inaccessibility under accelerating sea level rise for urban and rural localities.Results: Inaccessibility of roads and properties increased nearly twice as much as would be suggested by the length of flooded roads. Overall vulnerability of a locality was primarily dependent on its elevation; however, the redundancy of the road network appears to affect the rate at which properties became inaccessible. Areas with complex and redundant road networks-maintained access to coastal properties longer, suggesting increased resilience in the near term.Discussion: Road inaccessibility will impact property values and emergency response times but understanding the connection between flooding areas and inaccessible properties allows prioritization of road upgrades, improving overall coastal resilience.

In the floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD), the development of high-dike polders for intensive rice production has degraded ecosystems and changed socio-economic patterns. Sustainable development pathways must be considered during policy formulations to keep pace with such transformations. In this study, the interwoven socio-economic development and rice-based agricultural production processes were assessed based on mixed data sources, including 550 interviews with farmers in two major delta floodplain provinces - An Giang and Dong Thap. It highlights the pros and cons of the triple-rice farming systems under high-dike protections compared to low-dike farming systems. Results showed that the environmental degradation due to the overuse of agrochemicals (e.g., fertilizer and pesticides) costs approximately US $565 per hectare per crop season, resulting in the lower marginal benefits for the triple-rice production compared to the double-rice production pattern. This includes higher costs borne by local farmers/communities, given the adverse effects of agrochemicals on their health. The study urgently calls for local governments to consider relevant drivers of environmental degradation in agricultural production, especially in rice cultivation. Future policy needs to consider whether the intensification in agriculture, such as triple-rice production, would be an appropriate development pathway for the rural economy. Our study conveys to central and local governments and associated stakeholders that the agriculture-driven development policies would not be a sustainable development pathway under new environmental complexities in the delta.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The Role of Vicariance and Paleoclimatic Shifts in the Diversification of <i>Uranoscodon superciliosus</i> (Squamata, Tropiduridae) of the Amazonian Floodplains	EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Phylogeography; Species Delimitation; Genetic Diversity; Population dynamics; Miocene	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-GENETICS; LIZARDS SQUAMATA; LIFE-HISTORY; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; MITOCHONDRIAL; SPECIATION; DISPERSAL; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Wetlands are present in different parts of the globe, holding a significant portion of the local biodiversity, and have been under the constant influence of climatic changes worldwide on different time scales. Investigations with a phylogeographic approach have revealed the role of Quaternary climatic shifts on a global scale, favoring constant changes in the amplitude of floodplains and affecting the evolutionary history of multi-taxa. This pattern was observed in the Amazonian biota, but due to the complex geological history, some of these models alone are insufficient, especially in widespread species that live in specific regions of the biome. Herein, we investigated the species delimitation and biogeographic history of the semi-aquatic lizard Uranoscodon superciliosus (U. superciliosus), widely distributed in Amazonian floodplains, a habitat that was for a long time considered a corridor to gene flow. Our results support a high genetic diversity with five well-supported lineages within U. superciliosus: North of the Amazon River, East Xingu, Solimoes, Purus, and Tapajos-Madeira, with the basal split within this group in the Miocene and others in the Plio-Pleistocene. These results corroborated a mixture of distinct processes that shaped the diversity of U. superciliosus with rivers as vicariant barriers and the already known role of paleoclimatic shifts during the Quaternary promoting diversification. Among tetrapods, our work is one of the first to describe the genetic structure in a widespread taxon along river-edge environments, thus supporting both patterns of diversification with the compartmentalized lineages along different Amazonian rivers (floodplains) and also the more common pattern found in upland forest species, with main rivers acting as vicariant barriers and playing a role in allopatric speciation.

Geochemistry of organic matter by multi-proxy analyses and temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis in clearwater Amazonian lake sediments	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lipid biomarkers; Amazon basin; Sedimentary organic matter; Organic matter preservation; Global warming; Tropical environments	FATTY-ACID; LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS; FLOODPLAIN LAKES; N-ALKANES; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; SEASONAL CONTRASTS; METHANE OXIDATION; WATER LAKES; HIGH-RATES; CARBON	Despite the relevance of bottom sediments from clearwater floodplain lakes in organic matter preservation and degradation, there is a scarcity of data regarding the composition of molecular biomarkers and responses of benthic methanogenesis in Amazonian lakes in global warming scenarios. Here, surface sediments from a small clearwater floodplain lake (Jacund ' a Lake) in the Brazilian Amazon (Tapaj ' os River) were assessed in a combined approach between molecular biomarker composition and the sensitivity of methanogenesis under two experi-mental temperatures: 25 degrees C as control vs. + 4 degrees C as an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global warming scenario for 2081-2100. Lipid biomarker composition (n-alkanes, sterols) in a 12-cm sediment core revealed a strong predominance of terrestrial-derived organic matter over aquatic contributions, indicating more refractory preserved organic matter, while aquatic organic matter represents substrates to biological degrada-tion. Moreover, alkanoic acids and microbial triterpenoids indicated an intense microbial contribution and elevated organic matter processing. Compound specific isotopic analysis confirmed the presence of methano-trophic microorganisms (diploptene delta 13C = -53.5 parts per thousand) and an uptake of depleted 13C in aquatic organic matter. Diagenetic transformation of biomarkers also indicated a highly anoxic depositional environment throughout the core. Methanogenesis in the upper 15-cm sediment layer under 25 degrees C (39.3 mg C-CH4 m- 2 d-1) was similar to higher rates reported in Amazonian lakes and increased about 60% in the treatment when the temperature increased by 4 degrees C. Despite the predominant terrestrial sources and subsequent refractory composition of organic matter, our findings integrating biomarkers and metabolic processes support that biomass stocks in clearwater lake sediments of the Amazon basin may be sensitive to global warming.

The environmental processes that define the LRI support the natural capital and ecosystem services that are linked directly to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, existing approaches to scale up or down SDG targets and link them to natural capital are insufficient for the two-way human-environment interactions that exist in the LRI. Therefore, this study proposes a place-based approach to interpret the SDG framework to support sustainable land/water management, by (i) identifying key priorities for sustainable development through a normative content analysis of the SDG targets, and (ii) illustrating these priorities and associated challenges within the LRI, based on a literature review and case-studies on human-environment interactions. The content analysis identifies three overarching sustainable development priorities: (i) ensuring improved access to resources and services provided by the LRI, (ii) strengthening the resilience of the LRI to deal with social and natural shocks, and (iii) increasing resource efficiency. The review of the current state of LRIs across the world confirms that these are indeed priority areas for sustainable development. Yet, the challenges of attaining the sustainable development priorities in the LRI are also illustrated with three examples of development-related processes. Urbanisation, dam construction, and aggregate mining occur within specific zones of the LRI (land, land-river, river, respectively), but their impacts can compromise sustainable development across the entire LRI and beyond. The existence of these unintended impacts highlights the need to consider the geomorphic, hydrological, and ecological processes within the LRI and how they interact with human activity. Identifying the place-based priorities and challenges for sustainable development will help achieve the SDGs without compromising the functions and services of the LRI.

In recent years, flood damage has increased due to human intervention and land use and climate changes. The purpose of this study is to predict flood susceptibility in Tafresh watershed in Markazi Province, Iran based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Extremely Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models and evaluate the performance of hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method and XGB model. For this purpose, 14 independent variables affecting flood susceptibility were prepared, also, 227 flood locations were identified as independent variables based on available information and field survey. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters were used. Evaluating the efficiency of the models based on the AUCs of testing dataset showed the higher efficiency of the GA-XGB hybrid model in modeling flood susceptibility in the Tafresh watershed is compared to KNN and XGB models, and the AUC in KNN, XGB, and GA-XGB models are 0.82, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively. So using the genetic algorithm as an optimizer for determining the best parameters in the XGB model increases efficiency in this model. The results of determining the relative importance of independent variables in flood susceptibility modeling showed that the independent variables considered in each model have different effects. Distance from road and distance from river in all three models had significant importance in modeling flood hazard in the Tafresh watershed. The optimization method in this study can be used as a powerful method in other spatial modeling studies. The results of this study also support management programs to reduce flood risks in the study area. (C)& nbsp;2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	McGee, K				McGee, Kelly			A Place Worth Protecting: Rethinking Cost-Benefit Analysis Under FEMA's Flood-Mitigation Programs	UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW			English	Article								As climate change threatens coastal areas with more frequent and intense flooding, the federal government has adopted a greater focus on mitigating the effects of natural disasters. While neighborhoods differ in terms of physical risk exposure, they also differ in social vulnerability-the characteristics that influence a community's ability to safely weather a storm, withstand disruptions to employment and housing, navigate the rebuilding process, and eventually return to normal. Funding for federal flood-mitigation projects administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is currently distributed according to a simple metric-the benefits of a project must outweigh its costs. FEMA's approach to cost-benefit analysis (CBA), however, primarily measures physical risk to property while neglecting the long-term, intangible social costs incurred by vulnerable communities. This approach has resulted in higher-property-value communities receiving a disproportionate share of mitigation infrastructure, while lower-income communities are either left without protection or relocated. The distribution of mitigation funding therefore plays a role in exacerbating place-based inequality. This Comment proposes ways in which FEMA could better account for the distributional effects of its projects and promote efficient policies that take into account the full range of social and economic costs associated with natural disasters. It begins by detailing how FEMA neglects to consider distributional outcomes in its mitigation programs, consistent with the single-minded focus on economic efficiency prevalent in federal regulatory decision-making. Next, it surveys empirical research documenting the ways in which FEMA's use of CBA exacerbates wealth inequality and social vulnerability to flooding. The Comment then considers various legal avenues for redressing the disparate impacts resulting from FEMA's policies, concluding that none are likely to be successful. Instead, it offers five policy adjustments that FEMA could implement in its cost-benefit methodology to ensure that resources for flood mitigation are more equitably distributed, emphasizing ways in which these better accord with the agency's own focus on economic efficiency.

Flooding in the Peace-Athabasca Delta: climatic and hydrologic change and variation over the past 120 years	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Discharge; Drought; Ice jams; Ice-run floods; River regulation	RIVER; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; IMPACTS; COVER	Over the past 120 years, major temporal variations in river flows, lake levels, flood occurrence, wildlife abundance, and vegetation communities, coupled with spatial heterogeneity, have provided fertile ground for narratives of change within the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD). In this paper, I show that simple cause-effect explanations and reliance on short-term datasets have misled through over-generalization and have failed to account for the ecosystem's natural range of variation. Spring break-up discharge correctly predicts 71 to 90% of the binary outcomes (floods, no floods), but break-up discharge is weakly-related to flood magnitude. River regulation has not reduced Peace River spring flood frequency or magnitude. Contrary to popular belief, spring break-up discharge to the PAD from the Peace River's point of regulation at Hudson Hope has increased, not decreased, since regulation. Conversely, suppression of early May to late August discharge is the most noteworthy effect of Peace River regulation, but its ecological impacts remain poorly documented. Flows of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers are strongly correlated and exhibit similar daily, annual, and decadal patterns. An 8-year highstand of Lake Athabasca occurred just prior to river regulation. Lake Athabasca levels prior to the 1960s and after reservoir-filling did not differ significantly but were 60-80 cm lower than during the 1960-1967 highstand. Climatic changes have been complex. The clearest trends are winter warming and a PDSI regime shift from wet and variable to drier and less variable conditions since 1980. Spring flooding is preceded by greater winter precipitation upstream of the PAD and colder winters at the PAD. Spring ice-run floods without ice jams can recharge portions of the PAD including perched basins. I describe two water management approaches that would recharge large areas. Ecosystem complexity and cognitive biases hamper greater understanding of the dynamics of this globally significant ecosystem.

However, spatially explicit and dynamic assessments of flood exposure in China are still very limited, which hinders the development of risk-based flood management considering dynamic changes. Therefore, this study explored the spatial-temporal variations of flood exposure in China from 1992 to 2020 through flood susceptibility mapping and using satellite-based nighttime light data. It can be revealed that a significantly high level and rapid increase of flood exposure could be observed in China, especially around some major metropolitan areas in the eastern region. The expansion of flood exposure was mainly distributed in North China and some coastal areas during 1992-2000; while mainly occurring in South China during 2000-2013, especially in middle Yangtze River basin where flood susceptibility is highest. The changes of flood exposure in China were mainly driven by the increase in the number of lit pixels during the early period, and were dominated by the increase in the intensity of lit pixels in the later period. This process continued to the latest period of 2014-2020. This implies that upgrading of existing flood management facilities and efforts for more effective measures are urgently needed in flood-prone urban areas with increasing exposure intensity. In addition, this study demonstrated the advantage of nighttime light data for disaster assessment and monitoring. With the development of more nighttime light products of higher resolution and higher detection ability and the integration with ground-based observation, it is promising to achieve more precise monitoring and analysis of flood exposure at a large scale, and support fine-grained management of flood risk.

The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a "representative storm" scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.

Soil organic carbon in irrigated agricultural systems: A meta-analysis	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; aridity; climate; irrigation; soil depth; soil organic carbon; soil texture	WASTE-WATER IRRIGATION; LAND-USE CHANGE; BULK-DENSITY; CLIMATIC CONDITIONS; CLAY CONTENT; STOCKS; TEMPERATE; MANAGEMENT; STORAGE; EMISSIONS	Over the last 200 years, conversion of non-cultivated land for agriculture has substantially reduced global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in upper soil layers. Nevertheless, practices such as no- or reduced tillage, application of organic soil amendments, and maintenance of continuous cover can increase SOC in agricultural fields. While these management practices have been well studied, the effects on SOC of cropping systems that incorporate irrigation are poorly understood. Given the large, and expanding, agricultural landbase under irrigation across the globe, this is a critical knowledge gap for climate change mitigation. We undertook a systematic literature review and subsequent meta-analysis of data from studies that examined changes in SOC on irrigated agricultural sites through time. We investigated changes in SOC by climate (aridity), soil texture, and irrigation method with the following objectives: (i) to examine the impact of irrigated agriculture on SOC storage; and (ii) to identify the conditions under which irrigated agriculture is most likely to enhance SOC. Overall, irrigated agriculture increased SOC stocks by 5.9%, with little effect of study length (2-47 years). However, changes in SOC varied by climate and soil depth, with the greatest increase in SOC observed on irrigated semi-arid sites at the 0-10 cm depth (14.8%). Additionally, SOC increased in irrigated fine- and medium-textured soils but not coarse-textured soils. Furthermore, while there was no overall change to SOC in flood/furrow irrigated sites, SOC tended to increase in sprinkler irrigated sites, and decrease in drip irrigated sites, especially at depths below 10 cm. This work sheds light on the nuances of SOC change across irrigated agricultural systems, highlights the importance of studying SOC storage in deeper soils, and will help guide future research on the impacts of irrigated agriculture on SOC.

This article evaluates forecasts relating to extreme weather events - extreme rainfall, tropical cyclones, river flooding and storm surge - in Myanmar and the Philippines to assess the feasibility of using such forecasts to develop early warning systems and responses. To make best use of limited extant data, a variety of methods (reliability diagrams, hit rates, false alarm ratios, correlations) are employed. We review the skill of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) tropical cyclone forecasts and find that whilst errors in cyclone position are relatively small, forecasting intensity is more difficult. When a tropical cyclone has formed, the probabilities provided in the ECMWF track forecast are highly reliable and only slightly over-confident. A tropical cyclone activity product is relatively reliable for forecasts less than a week ahead for North Indian Ocean cyclones affecting Myanmar, but becomes very overconfident beyond this. Looking at flood forecasting models, a comparison of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS, produced by the ECMWF and the European Commission as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Services) with the Global Flood Forecasting Information System (GLOFFIS, produced by Deltares) demonstrates that both GloFAS and GLOFFIS have difficulty simulating 1 in 2 year return period flows or higher, although GloFAS performance is better than GLOFFIS. GloFAS reforecasts show significantly overconfident probabilities over Myanmar where discharge observations are available, whilst the lack of a GLOFFIS reforecast prevents evaluation of this forecast system directly. Evaluation of the ten-day operational storm surge forecast (the Global Storm Surge Information System, GLOSSIS) produced by Deltares was attempted but lack of any data prevented assessment. These findings present valuable insights into how well forecasts perform, which is crucial information for establishing effective humanitarian action mechanisms.

Productive wetlands restored for carbon sequestration quickly become net CO<sub>2</sub> sinks with site-level factors driving uptake variability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FRESH-WATER WETLAND; LAND-USE CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; METHANE PRODUCTION; TYPHA-LATIFOLIA; DIOXIDE FLUXES; RESTORATION; VEGETATION; SOIL; AZOLLA	Inundated wetlands can potentially sequester substantial amounts of soil carbon (C) over the long-term because of slow decomposition and high primary productivity, particularly in climates with long growing seasons. Restoring such wetlands may provide one of several effective negative emission technologies to remove atmospheric CO2 and mitigate climate change. However, there remains considerable uncertainty whether these heterogeneous ecotones are consistent net C sinks and to what degree restoration and management methods affect C sequestration. Since wetland C dynamics are largely driven by climate, it is difficult to draw comparisons across regions. With many restored wetlands having different functional outcomes, we need to better understand the importance of site-specific conditions and how they change over time. We report on 21 site-years of C fluxes using eddy covariance measurements from five restored fresh to brackish wetlands in a Mediterranean climate. The wetlands ranged from 3 to 23 years after restoration and showed that several factors related to restoration methods and site conditions altered the magnitude of C sequestration by affecting vegetation cover and structure. Vegetation established within two years of re-flooding but followed different trajectories depending on design aspects, such as bathymetry-determined water levels, planting methods, and soil nutrients. A minimum of 55% vegetation cover was needed to become a net C sink, which most wetlands achieved once vegetation was established. Established wetlands had a high C sequestration efficiency (i.e. the ratio of net to gross ecosystem productivity) comparable to upland ecosystems but varied between years undergoing boom-bust growth cycles and C uptake strength was susceptible to disturbance events. We highlight the large C sequestration potential of productive inundated marshes, aided by restoration design and management targeted to maximise vegetation extent and minimise disturbance. These findings have important implications for wetland restoration, policy, and management practitioners.

J	Shen, MX; Chui, TFM				Shen, Mingxi; Chui, Ting Fong May			Characterizing the responses of local floods to changing climate in three different hydroclimatic regions across the United States	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Climate change; Flood; Extreme precipitation; Urbanization; Sub-daily scale	PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; FUTURE CHANGES; SOIL-MOISTURE; TRENDS; TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; ATTRIBUTION; FREQUENCY; REGRESSION; INCREASES	How floods respond to changing climate is of great concern in research community and society, but there is no consistent conclusion about whether floods are as sensitive to changes in temperature as precipitation extremes. In this study, the responses and connections of local floods to temperature and precipitation extremes over three hydroclimatically different regions across the United States were explored. The regions include Northeast Coast (humid coast), Central Plains (dry inland), Southeast Plains (humid subtropic), varying in atmospheric moisture availability. Investigation was made at both hourly and daily timescales, and the influences of watershed imperviousness on flood responses were highlighted by using small watersheds (< 600 km(2)) and categorizing watersheds based on watershed imperviousness. Correlation and co-occurrence probability analysis shows that the connections between floods and precipitation extremes over the studied watersheds are relatively high, with the majority showing a value of 0.6 and 0.5 for the two criteria, respectively. Scaling analysis finds that hourly precipitation extremes generally scale with daily temperature according to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship, but daily precipitation extremes reflect smaller scaling rates and even decrease with rising temperature at higher temperatures. Despite floods in the studied watersheds are highly related with precipitation extremes, the scaling of flood-temperature is always lower than that of extreme precipitation-temperature. Increasing connections between floods and precipitation extremes, resulted from higher watershed imperviousness or in summer months, tend to increase the scaling of flood-temperature, even to a close CC relationship. However, the scaling of flood-temperature still cannot surpass that of extreme precipitation-temperature. It is generally concluded that flood would change with rising temperature at a rate smaller than what is expected from the scaling of precipitation extremes to temperature, and precipitation scaling analysis should better use finer-timescale (e.g., hourly) precipitation records.

This study evaluated for the first time the performance of the statistical downscaling model (SDSM-DC) at 2m spatial resolution in simulating rainfall in Ghana for the base period 1981-2010. It further analysed the projected changes in seasonal rainfall pattern across different agro-ecological zones for the twenty-first century under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios over Ghana. Ensemble mean of simulated rainfall data (2011-2099) generated by 43 GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used as base factors for local future climate scenarios generation. Performance analysis of SDSM-DC shows a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, percent bias and RMSE observations standard deviation ratio of 0.88, -19 and 0.34, respectively. Generally, seasonal rainfall amount is expected to increase between 10 and 40% in all the agro-ecological zones in Ghana by the end of the twenty-first century. Off-season rainfall in December-February shows more than 100% increase in the Guinea Savannah zone. Rainfall projected under RCP 4.5 was on average 2% higher than RCP 8.5 in all the seasons throughout the century. Based on these results, it is appropriate to suggest a high incidence of flooding across Ghana in the twenty-first century. This could have dire consequences on agriculture which contribute to a large proportion of Ghana's GDP. Therefore, for sustainable food production and security in the twenty-first century, Ghana needs climate adaptation policies and programmes that encourage the design and implementation of early warning systems of meteorological hazards and the introduction of new crop varieties that are flood tolerant.

J	Arifeen, A; Eriksen, S				Arifeen, Awais; Eriksen, Siri			The politics of disaster vulnerability: Flooding, post-disaster interventions and water governance in Baltistan, Pakistan	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE			English	Article						Authority; co-production; disaster; Pakistan; vulnerability	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; STATE-FORMATION; POWER; AUTHORITY; INFRASTRUCTURE; POLICIES; CONTEXT; RULE	This paper uses governance of water infrastructure in two settlements of Baltistan as an entry point to examine the co-production of power and vulnerability. Access to water and irrigated land is a critical factor in determining how the effects of disasters, such as flooding, are socially distributed within a community. At the same time, the governance of water is intimately linked to the longer-term politics of disaster vulnerability. We examine three different forms of disputes over water infrastructure where struggles over authority and social ordering materialise: (i) between and within settlements over access to a water resource; (ii) within settlements over post-disaster water infrastructure development and (iii) between a settlement and the district government over land, water rights and flood protection. The findings illustrate that the governance of water infrastructure involves continuous negotiations, contestations and disputes over access rights. Access to water resources as an expression of rights plays a key role in the recognition of authority relations. In particular, influential individuals seek to legitimise their leadership role in a settlement by representing the rights and interests of groups in the negotiation of these disputes. However, environmental variability and change, including disasters and post-disaster development interventions, alter perceptions of what constitute legitimate rights, and provide spaces for popular contestation of authority relations through silent non-compliance with decisions. The close interlinkages between material and non-material effects of a disaster are a key feature of the co-production of power and vulnerability. By adding authority relations to studies of village-level practices around disasters, we enrich our understanding of the co-production of power and vulnerability and how these dynamics unfold over time. It is only by investigating this co-production that a deeper understanding can be developed of the mechanisms through which vulnerability is either exacerbated or reduced for particular groups.

Thermal Ecology of Spotted Turtles (<i>Clemmys guttata</i>) in Two Southern Populations	COPEIA			English	Article							OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES; COST-BENEFIT MODEL; BASKING BEHAVIOR; NORTHERN POPULATION; THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; SEASONAL ACTIVITY; PAINTED TURTLE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT USE	The ecology of many ectotherms depends heavily on their ability to navigate the surrounding thermal environment in a manner that maintains body temperature (T-b) within or near some optimal temperature range at least some of the time. From April-December 2016, we measured shell temperatures (T-s) and water temperatures (T-w) in two Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata) populations in southeastern Georgia using iButton temperature loggers. We attached radio transmitters and iButtons to the carapace of adult Spotted Turtles (n = 18 and 11 in each population, respectively) in early spring. Temperature loggers recorded a Ts measurement every 90 minutes (accuracy = 0.5 degrees C), and we restricted our analyses to temperatures recorded between sunrise and sunset. Monthly mean T-s ranged from 12.3 +/- 3.4 to 27.1 +/- 2.7 degrees C (SD), and seasonal variation accounted for a majority of the observed variation in temperatures. We found a strong positive correlation between weekly mean T-s and weekly mean T-w at one site that remained flooded throughout the study (P<0.0001, R-2 = 0.99). T-w could not be measured at the other site because it dried completely early in the study. Spotted Turtles did occasionally (<5% of total temperature observations) bask to raise T-s above that of the surrounding T-w. Gravid females achieved significantly higher daily maximum temperatures (26.2 degrees C) than males (24.5 degrees C) during the four weeks surrounding egg development (P = 0.043). In general, Spotted Turtles at the southern end of their range appear to spend a majority of their time conforming to environmental temperatures that often fall within the preferred range for the species.

Application of machine learning techniques for regional bias correction of snow water equivalent estimates in Ontario, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; MODEL; ASSIMILATION; MICROWAVE; PRODUCTS; COVER; DEPTH; SCALE	Snow is a critical contributor to Ontario's water-energy budget, with impacts on water resource management and flood forecasting. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the amount of water stored in a snowpack and is important in deriving estimates of snowmelt. However, only a limited number of sparsely distributed snow survey sites (n = 383) exist throughout Ontario. The SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) is a daily, 1 km gridded SWE product that provides uniform spatial coverage across this region; however, we show here that SWE estimates from SNODAS display a strong positive mean bias of 50 % (16 mm SWE) when compared to in situ observations from 2011 to 2018. This study evaluates multiple statistical techniques of varying complexity, including simple subtraction, linear regression and machine learning methods to bias-correct SNODAS SWE estimates using absolute mean bias and RMSE as evaluation criteria. Results show that the random forest (RF) algorithm is most effective at reducing bias in SNODAS SWE, with an absolute mean bias of 0.2 mm and RMSE of 3.64 mm when compared with in situ observations. Other methods, such as mean bias subtraction and linear regression, are somewhat effective at bias reduction; however, only the RF method captures the nonlinearity in the bias and its interannual variability. Applying the RF model to the full spatio-temporal domain shows that the SWE bias is largest before 2015, during the spring melt period, north of 44.5 degrees N and east (downwind) of the Great Lakes. As an independent validation, we also compare estimated snowmelt volumes with observed hydrographs and demonstrate that uncorrected SNODAS SWE is associated with unrealistically large volumes at the time of the spring freshet, while bias-corrected SWE values are highly consistent with observed discharge volumes.

The gradual depletion of urban green spaces, largely due to increasing population pressure and urban expansion, has resulted in the land use land cover change (LULC) and has altered the micro-climate of the urban ecosystem. In this context, the present study has analysed and assessed the changing scale and spatial layout of the urban green spaces using the landsat thematic mapper (TM) and OLI/TIRS remote sensing image data from 1988 and 2018 in Mumbai city. Multiple correlation matrix analysis of LST and NDVI, with 200 sample sites of Mumbai, has been carried out to demonstrate how the LST of green space has been changed to other LULC over the period of three decades. The assessment using various indices like LST, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface emissivity (LSE) and leaf area index (LAI) indicated that there has been drastic transformation of urban green spaces; it has reduced from 46.42% in 1988 to 26.67% in 2018. The areas of LST higher than 30.50 degrees C have dramatically increased from 5232 ha in 1988 to 14,339 ha in 2018. The expanding urbanization has engulfed half of the dense vegetation having > 0.3 NDVI index; it has reduced from 17,406 ha in 1988 to 9910 ha in 2018. Since declining green spaces is a negative indicator to the environment, the policy makers, planners and legislation should emphasize and adopt measures to restore green areas of the Mumbai metropolitan region.

Based on the disaster census data of rainstorm-induced flood (including landslide and mud-rock flow) and drought disasters in 637 counties (districts) in East China, the distribution and change of flood and drought disasters were analyzed. The results indicate that the number of records of flood disaster increased at a rate of 77.4 times per decade from 1984 to 2010, while that of drought disaster had no significant trend in East China as a whole. Population affected by floods and droughts increased at rates of 8.7 million and 3.8 million persons per decade, respectively, and the direct economic losses increased at rates of 12.6 billion and 1.9 billion Chinese Yuan per decade respectively, whereas the affected area and the total failure area of crops caused by floods and droughts showed no clear trends. Spatially, the number of records of floods in the southern parts of East China was higher than that in the northern parts, and Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Fujian had more records of affected population, deaths, affected crops, total crop failures and direct economic losses, as well as more affected population and deaths. The affected crop area and total crop failure area by floods were also larger in Anhui, Jiangxi and Jiangsu. Drought disaster had higher number of records of affected population, affected crops, total crop failures and direct economic losses in Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Shandong, and also affected more people and larger area of crops, leading to larger area of total crop failures and higher direct economic losses in Anhui, Jiangxi and Shandong. The results can provide reference for disaster risk regionalization and environmental risk assessment in East China.

The pre-dam topography was reconstructed based on archival aerial imagery and old maps. The benefits and drawbacks of these methods were tested and explained with emphasis on the fact that not all processed archival data are suitable for pre-dam topography modeling. Bathymetric surveying of a reservoir bottom is presently routine, but in this study, we used a wide combination of bathymetric mapping methods (sonar, ground penetration radar, and sub-bottom profiler) and topographic survey tools (LiDAR and photogrammetry), bringing great benefits for bottom dynamic analysis and data cross-validation. The data that we gathered made it possible to evaluate the formation of the inflow deltas in the reservoirs studied and assess the sediment reworking during recent seasonal drawdowns. A typical inflow delta was formed in the deeper of the two studied reservoirs, while the summer 2019 drawdown caused the formation and incision of a temporary drawdown channel and erosive downstream transport of approximately 1/10 of the delta body thickness in approximately 1/10 of the delta transverse size. No inflow delta was formed in the shallower of the studied reservoirs, but unexpectedly extensive sediment reworking was observed in the inflow part of the reservoir. Both the studied reservoirs and the pre-dam river floodplain have accumulated historical contamination by risk elements such as As, Hg, Pb; thus, the enhanced erosion of existing sediment bodies expected in the future, owing to more frequent droughts and global climate change, will endanger the ecological quality of the water and solids outflowing from the reservoirs.

Distributing flood shelters for disaster risk reduction Exploring the practices in Bangladesh from a political economy perspective	DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bangladesh; Department of Disaster Management (DDM); Disaster risk reduction (DRR); Political economy; Public fund distribution	NATURAL DISASTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DETERMINANTS; ADAPTATION; ALLOCATION; GOVERNANCE; RECOVERY; POVERTY; ECOLOGY	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to inspect disaster risk reduction (DRR) challenges from a political economy (PE) perspective and to explore how PE determinants facilitate or hinder effective DRR in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative case study, using semi-structured in-depth interviews, official documents and literature review has been conducted to explore the current process and practices of DRR in Bangladesh. The specific focus is on the distribution of public spending on flood shelters implemented by the Department of Disaster Management. Findings - The study revealed a number of findings, including that the interest and incentives of influencing decision makers matter; formal and informal institutions have influence; and the values and ideas of dominating stakeholders' impact on decisions regarding public spending of DRR in Bangladesh. These PE factors often hinder efficiency by leading to overlapping efforts and inefficient use of scarce resources. DRR planners and practitioners need to take steps to mitigate potential risks from PE processes in the allocations of DRR funding by implementing improved distribution arrangements. Originality/value - Despite many successes in dealing with disasters, Bangladesh faces several challenges, including better governance of funds. DRR challenges can be considered as a problem of PE, which concerns the distribution of resources, and includes how powerful decision makers affect economic choices. Prior research examining the challenges in DRR-related funding distribution from a PE perspective is limited. Therefore, this study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on the situation in Bangladesh from this perspective. The authors elaborate how PE determinants can function as both barrier and opportunities on the ground in DRR-related fund distribution and in the selection of project locations and beneficiaries.

In this paper, we aim at optimizing water-sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs (Longyangxia and Liujiaxia) as the regulatory bodies using one multi-objective model (sediment transport and hydropower generation) and two single-objective models (sediment transport only, and hydropower generation only). We propose an innovative approach (FSS-MOPSO) that hybrids the Feasible Search Space (FSS) with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi-objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs. We analyze the transformation rules of water-sediment regulation among five objectives (hydropower generation, sediment transport, water supply, flood control and ice control) under various optimization schemes. The results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent. An extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2.31 billion kWh (17.6% increase) would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport (73.5% decrease) while only makes little effects on the other three objectives. The results demonstrate that the optimal water-sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future (2030) but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods. The research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water-sediment regulation for efficient cascade reservoirs operation in the Upper Yellow River.

By producing and analyzing the maps of the regions, an integrated approach to geomatics and hydraulic modelling is employed. The following maps are used: Flood-prone urbanity from 1988-2019, a flood risk map of Wadi Nu'man based on a risk matrix map, and a map of the proposed protection measures and alternatives in the study area. In order to achieve these goals, changes in the land use in the Wadi Nu'man basin were monitored by analyzing successive satellite images, taken by the US satellite, Landsat, in 1988, 1998, 2013, and 2019. Using a supervised classification, with the maximum likelihood method of ERDAS IMAGINE 2016, GIS was used in the production and analysis of soil maps, and geological and hydrological groups of drainage basins, as well as the hydrological model (HEC-HMS), were applied in calculating the hydrograph curve of the Wadi Nu'man basin. The flood water volumes and flow rates were estimated based on the SCS unit hydrograph, and the rain depth was analyzed and estimated for different periods. The hydraulic modeling program (HEC-RAS) was employed, when developing a two-dimensional model to calculate the speed, depth, and spread of the flood, in order to apply the risk matrix method. The recommendations based on this study give priority to the implementation of a flood prevention plan and the protection of infrastructure by maintaining the existing flood drainage facilities and establishing new drainage facilities to protect lives, property, and infrastructure.

However, there is relatively sparse evidence of historical changes, as well as the explicit effects of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities on the primary productivity of marine coastal ecosystems. In this study, surface and core sediments from the Zhejiang-Fujian coastal mud area, East China Sea coast, were analyzed using the bulk and molecular biomarkers. The results showed that ecosystem changes were characterized by increased phytoplankton productivity and a fluctuant transition from blooms mostly dominated by diatoms to red tide events dominated by dinoflagellates. Variations from the early 1850s to the early 2010s can be divided into a nature-dominated period (the early 1850s-1960s) and a human-impacted period (1960s-the early 2010s). Particularly, natural forcing such as heavy floods (e.g. 1998, 1954, and 1931) in the whole of the Yangtze River catchment, variations in the intensity of East Asia Monsoon, and strengthened or weakened Kuroshio intrusion/positive or negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase in the coastal mud area have substantially affected the phytoplankton productivity and community structure during the nature-dominated period. In contrast, changes in nutrient supply and compositions were more apparent during the human-impacted period, which could have been because of increased fertilizer usage, discharges of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage, and large-scale human projects (e.g. Danjiangkou Reservoir and Three Gorges Dam) in the Yangtze River drainage area, leading to significant phytoplankton productivity and community structure variations in the coastal mud area system of East China Sea.

Participative Policy Design to Manage Droughts and Floods in an Arid Region under Changing Climate Scenarios: The Case of Baja California Sur, Mexico	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						communities' involvement; climate change; floods and drought management; risks; resilience; Mexico		Floods can be defined as one of the most frequent and destructive disasters, that cause significant damage to people, while droughts present significant challenges, primarily to the most vulnerable communities. In consequence, not only public policies but the increased participation of communities and other sectors are crucial to manage the risk in the face of both phenomena and contribute to the construction of resilient communities. At the request of the National Water Commission of Mexico (CONAGUA) for the Regional Water Plan (PHR), we designed and applied a methodology based on a web-based consultation in conjunction with digital survey tools to understand the opinion of communities, key participants, and researchers about these phenomena. The workshops were organized in the five municipalities of Baja California Sur. Then, we performed an interdisciplinary analysis that combined hydrological considerations with the most critical social, economic, environmental, and legal components, applying the PESTEL (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) analysis. The results indicate that there is a clear and widespread awareness that floods and droughts increase the risk to the livelihoods of the population; however, there are deficiencies in different areas, which complicates risk management. Timely distribution of information and the inclusion of communities in mitigation and adaptation proposals would allow the achievement of greater success with efforts to minimize vulnerabilities and increase the resilience of the population in the face of climate extremes. This must be a collaborative work of the entire society: governmental, social, and private stakeholders.

Evaluation of Reservoir Inflows Using Semi-Distributed Hydrological Modeling Techniques: Application to the Esil and Moildy Rivers' Catchments in Kazakhstan	WATER			English	Article						hydrological modeling; HBV-light; spring flood runoff; Esil River; Moildy River		This study explores the potential application of the HBV model for simulating water inflow into the Astana reservoir in Kazakhstan. The Astana reservoir, with an area of 60.9 km2 and a capacity of 411 million m3, serves as a vital hydrotechnical structure for the regulation of long-term water resources. Positioned on the Esil River, this reservoir plays a crucial role in providing drinking water to Astana, the capital city of the Republic of Kazakhstan. This study presents a concise overview of the HBV model and includes hydrometeorological data as well as information from a digital elevation model constructed from altitude maps of the catchment areas of the Esil and Moildy rivers. To simulate the runoff from both rivers, the GAP optimization algorithm was employed. Model parameters were calibrated for the period spanning 1975 to 2020. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe criterion, which confirms a strong correlation between the simulated runoff dynamics and observed data. This study's outcomes reveal the efficiency of the selected optimal parameters, particularly for the 2020-2022 timeframe, during which the HBV model's parameters were validated. Overall, the quality metrics achieved during both the calibration and validation periods are satisfactory, affirming the model's suitability for short-term runoff forecasts, especially during flood events. Furthermore, the model proves valuable for assessing potential shifts in river runoff patterns under the influence of climate change.

Numerical simulation of the deadliest flood event of Portugal: Unravelling the causes of the disaster	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						November 1967 flash flood; Portugal; Quintas village (Lisbon area); Hydrological-hydraulic simulations; Iber plus numerical model; Elucidation of conditioning factors	FLASH-FLOOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; RISK; FRANCE; EUROPE	The flood event of November 25 and 26,1967 corresponds to the deadliest storm affecting Portugal in recent centuries being responsible for >500 fatalities. The main trigger was the heavy rain that fell in just a few hours, provoking a rapid increase in river flows, although other concurrent circumstances had to occur to reach the dramatic water levels estimated in some affected places. However, even today, several important uncertainties related to water levels achieved and timing of floods remain. Here we aim to clarify some of the pending issues by applying suitable high performance numerical tools to elucidate the main conditioning factors that played a key role in the intensification of this dramatic flood. In particular, the analysis has been focused on Quintas village, the location most affected, where >100 fatalities were recorded, close to 2/3 of its total population at the time. The main conclusion provided by the numerical simulations was that a plugging of water flow downstream of Quintas village, favoured by a poor terrain maintenance coupled with the bottleneck created by topographic features, caused the critical over-elevation of water levels. Simulations also corroborate the rapid increase in water levels in Quintas village, with an estimated rise of >2 m in just two hours, as well as the occurrence of the flood during the night, preventing many people to be aware of the extreme danger they were facing and safeguarding themselves.

Toward Collaborative Adaptation: Assessing Impacts of Coastal Flooding at the Watershed Scale	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal; Flooding; Sea level rise; Watershed; Adaptation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POTENTIAL IMPACT; HAMPTON ROADS; VULNERABILITY; HURRICANES; MANAGEMENT; VIRGINIA; SPACES	The U.S. Mid-Atlantic coastal region is experiencing higher rates of SLR than the global average, especially in Hampton Roads, Virginia, where this acceleration is primarily driven by land subsidence. The adaptation plans for coastal flooding are generally developed at the municipal level, ignoring the broader spatial implications of flooding outside the individual administrative boundaries. Flood impact assessments at the watershed scale would provide a more holistic perspective on what is needed to synchronize the adaptation efforts between the neighboring administrative units. This paper evaluates flooding impacts from sea level rise (SLR) and storm surge among watersheds in Hampton Roads to identify those most at risk of coastal flooding over different time horizons. It also explores the implications of flooding on the municipalities, the land uses, and land covers throughout this region within the case study watershed. The 2% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) storm surge flood hazard data and NOAA's intermediate SLR projections were used to develop flooding scenarios for 2030, 2060, and 2090 and delineate land areas at risk of combined flooding. Findings show that five out of 98 watersheds will substantially increase in inundation, with two intersecting multiple municipalities. They also indicate significant inundation of military, commercial, and industrial land uses and wetland land covers. Flooding will also impact residential land use in urban areas along the Elizabeth River and Hampton city, supporting the need for collaborative adaptation planning on hydrologically influenced spatial scales.

Floods are a problem that worry city administrators who seek to make cities more resilient and safer. This increase in flood events is due to different causes: poor planning, population increase, aging of networks, etc. However, the two main causes for the increase in urban flooding are the increment in frequency of extreme rainfall, generated mainly by climate change, and the increase in urbanized areas in cities, which reduce green areas, decreasing the percentage of water that seeps naturally into the soil. As a contribution to solve these problems, the work presented shows a method to rehabilitate drainage networks that contemplates implementing different actions in the network: renovation of pipes, construction of storm tanks and installation of hydraulic controls. This work focuses on evaluating the flood risk in economic terms. To achieve this, the expected annual damage from floods and the annual investments in infrastructure to control floods are estimated. These two terms are used to form an objective function to be minimized. To evaluate this objective function, an optimization model is presented that incorporates a genetic algorithm to find the best solutions to the problem; the hydraulic analysis of the network is performed with the SWMM model. This work also presents a strategy to reduce computation times by reducing the search space focused mainly on large networks. This is intended to show a complete and robust methodology that can be used by managers and administrators of drainage networks in cities.

The ongoing degradation of wetlands in the Great Lakes basin has been caused by a number of factors, including climate change, urbanization, and agriculture. Mapping and monitoring wetlands across such large spatial and temporal scales have proved challenging; however, recent advancements in the accessibility and processing efficiency of remotely sensed imagery have facilitated these applications. In this study, the historical Landsat archive was first employed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify wetlands (i.e., Bog, Fen, Swamp, Marsh) and non-wetlands (i.e., Open Water, Barren, Forest, Grassland/Shrubland, Cropland) throughout the entire Great Lakes basin over the past four decades. To this end, an object-based supervised Random Forest (RF) model was developed. All of the produced wetland maps had overall accuracies exceeding 84%, indicating the high capability of the developed classification model for wetland mapping. Changes in wetlands were subsequently assessed for 17 time intervals. It was observed that approximately 16% of the study area has changed since 1984, with the highest increase occurring in the Cropland class and the highest decrease occurring in the Forest and Marsh classes. Forest mostly transitioned to Fen, but was also observed to transition to Cropland, Marsh, and Swamp. A considerable amount of the Marsh class was also converted into Cropland.

Following describing the record-setting rainfall and massive landslides that closed the major highway connecting the North Shore communities with the rest of the island, the challenges of "building back better" are investigated. While there was an urgency to finish the roadway repairs as quickly as possible, there was also a need to reduce future risks from flooding and landslides. Strong leadership, coordination, communications, and resource sharing helped improve pre-existing traffic, congestion, parking, and accessibility concerns for residents and tourists. There are important lessons learned concerning the need for timely, accurate data and information. Mitigation and adaptation projects that go beyond simply replacing and repairing assets before the storm are also analyzed. Opportunities to utilize greener, nature-based, and context-sensitive design, engineering, and planning solutions to mitigate and adapt highways to climate-induced extreme events remain challenging even in a community known for scenic beauty, pristine natural areas, and rich cultural heritage. While the community-led efforts to implement improvements to the State park at the end of the road were exemplary, there are still ongoing challenges of increased climate threats and inflexible, limited systems for funding-not just in disaster recovery but also investments in community resilience.

What is a stand? Assessing the variability of composition and structure in floodplain forest ecosystems across spatial scales in the Upper Mississippi River	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Floodplain forest; Microtopography; Upper Mississippi River; Acer sacchariunum; Quercus bicolor	HARDWOOD FORESTS; STOCKING CONTROL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; DISTURBANCE; REGENERATION; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; SILVICULTURE; OBJECTIVES	The forest stand typically represents relatively homogenous forest conditions; the forest stand is generally the unit at which forest attributes are assessed, summarized, and subsequently managed. However, some ecosystems, such as the floodplain forests of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR), can exhibit high variability at fine spatial scales that can confound prescription development, implementation, and ultimate success of stand-level management actions. Here we assess how forest composition and structure vary within and across stand management units on the UMR and test at what spatial scale environmental variables relate to forest characteristics. We found that plot-level measures of composition, structure, and diversity were not well represented by site-level averages of these values. When basal area of all overstory species was combined, this variable was more closely related to "site" than to any of the environmental variables, but when analyzed by species, within-plot topographic variation ("microtopography") was a significant positive predictor for both importance values of an individual species (swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor Willd.)) as well as importance value of a specific group of species (oaks (Quercus spp.), bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis (Wangenh.) K. Koch), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.), and American basswood (Tilia americana L.)). This work highlights the challenges of using average stand conditions to summarize complex or heterogeneous systems and the need for flexibility and relaxed assumptions in defining management units in these forests.

The Role of Groundwater Withdrawals on River Regulation: Example From the Columbia River Basin	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Columbia River; reservoir operation; VIC; groundwater; irrigation; water management	WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; LAND-SURFACE FLUXES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TERM CLIMATE; VIC-2L MODEL; HYDROLOGY; IRRIGATION; STREAMFLOW; DEPLETION; IMPACTS	The Columbia River Basin (CRB) is heavily regulated by more than 250 dams on its river system while depending significantly on groundwater withdrawals in certain sub-basins. Neglecting groundwater withdrawals in hydrologic models of the basin could result in inaccurate predictions of its water budget and thus mislead water management decisions in the basin. This study aims to understand the impacts of groundwater pumping on the spatiotemporal patterns of modeling regulated streamflow in the CRB using a modified version of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model integrated with a water management component that accounts for groundwater withdrawals, irrigation demands, and reservoir operation (VIC-GIRR). The VIC-GIRR simulations showed that considering additional groundwater withdrawals would alleviate the stress of irrigation water deficit in the Snake River Basin with an average reduction of 10 km(3)/year. Such a reduction in water deficit resulted in slight streamflow increase over the CRB with maximum increase up to 40% during dry period in certain locations. We also note that the implementation of groundwater withdrawal does not, however, improve the overall model performance in long-term averaged streamflow and storage predictions. Our results highlight the efforts needed to examine additional important processes in representing the interactions between water withdrawals and reservoir operations. Such efforts will aid in better simulation of multi-reservoir system and improve effectiveness for agricultural productivity, power generation, flood control, and navigation purposes.

Study Focus: Although MNRB hydrology and the red flood phenomena have been addressed in the past literature, water quality parameters and suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics remain poorly known. SPM impacts dam silting, exacerbating flooding, and microbial water quality. This study couples in-situ SPM measurements to radiometric measurements by in-situ and satellite sensors to analyse the temporal and spatial evolution of SPM in the MNRB and assess the contribution of the local flood (red flood) to SPM in Niamey. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: SPM is composed of very fine kaolinites with a major mode around 200-300 nanometers which results in high reflectance in the visible and infrared bands. Radiometric measurements by both radiometer and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors are well correlated to in-situ SPM, allowing efficient spatio-temporal monitoring of SPM concentration. SPM increases very rapidly at the beginning of the rainy season, reaching a peak, characterized by very high SPM values, about one month before the red flood. Satellite data highlight the significant contribution of the right bank tributaries to SPM in the MNRB during this period. SPM then decreases and remains low despite the second runoff increase (black flood) arriving in Niamey after the end of the rainy season from the upper basin.

An abolitionist climate justice praxis necessitates seeing beyond physical inundation to sea-level rise as the sole issue. We argue that sea-level rise is environmental racism, if not always in its racialized outcomes of disproportionate harms, then always in its racialized production of differential value. More than mitigating flood risk when developing Black land futures strategies, to mitigate coastal land loss in the face of rising seas necessitates dismantling "racial regimes of ownership" that are imbued in property relations. Recognizing such, we argue that land futures strategies in the face of rising seas must account for multiple capitalist modes of accumulation but specifically the primitive accumulation process connected to heirs' property. Here, we argue that racial coastal formations are still underway in how sea-level rise and gentrification are leading to a double dispossession of land and displacing Gullah/Geechee people on Sapelo Island. Although such displacement precipitates loss through harm and violence, in this article we share strategies from abolition ecology praxis to "blockade" these double dispossession processes and, to a degree, even the narrative of loss. To situate the double dispossession narrative within a broader praxis that imagines alternative futures, we till the soil, trace the archives, and tread the marsh and drainage ditches with each other, and in solidarity with other residents, to work toward achieving agricultural revival, property retention, and flood risk mitigation.

Grazing Increases Soil Warming in Headwater Wetlands: Importance to Land Managers and Water Users	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						climate change; grazing management; water conservation; riparian water storage; soil organic matter; soil profile temperatures; sub-surface ice; soil thaw	GLACIER MASS-LOSS; ORGANIC-CARBON; NITROGEN STORAGE; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; MOUNTAINS; MEADOWS; IMPACT; MATTER; CREEK	The earth's mountains continue to lose water. Glaciers are melting and mountain snow/rain balance tilts increasingly liquescent. Water is running off sooner-sometimes overfilling reservoirs, causing flooding, and setting the stage for late-season shortages. One adaptive strategy is to recover and enhance water-storage capacities of headwater riparian systems. Grazing, a common use of headwater lands, affects both soils and vegetation. To better understand how grazing might affect water storage and other ecosystem services of high elevation riparian wetlands, we measured soil-profile temperatures, soil organic matter (SOM), and phytomass at six sites in the upper Sweetwater River sub-basin of Wyoming, USA, where fence lines allowed us to contrast grazing management. We found grazed wetlands consistently had warmer soils than fenced wetlands. We found added evidence that SOM is important in both soil temperature control and water-storage potential of wetlands. We review evidence that warmer soil temperatures and drying cause loss of SOM with the implied concomitant C losses through erosion and emissions. We recommend land managers of temperate-climate headwater systems consider the need to end growing seasons with full stands of riparian vegetation to reduce soil warming and to build organic matter-particularly on lands where municipalities and other downstream water users are seeking long-term increases in water yields and less flooding.

Moreover, the rapid development of specialized technologies in satellite instruments provides the opportunity to obtain a wide spectrum of various measurements. The purpose of this research is to use publicly available remote sensing product data computed from geostationary, polar and near-polar satellites and radar to improve space-time modeling and prediction of precipitation on Crete island in Greece. The proposed space-time kriging method carries out the fusion of remote sensing data with data from ground stations that monitor precipitation during the hydrological period 2009/10-2017/18. Precipitation observations are useful for water resources, flood and drought management studies. However, monitoring stations are usually sparse in regions with complex terrain, are clustered in valleys, and often have missing data. Satellite precipitation data are an attractive alternative to observations. The fusion of the datasets in terms of the space-time residual kriging method exploits the auxiliary satellite information and aids in the accurate and reliable estimation of precipitation rates at ungauged locations.

Despite international attempts to mobilize governments and relevant stakeholders to address disaster risk more holistically, disaster risk reduction and human development remain detached from each other in many countries and communities. This paper explores government practitioners' views on an integration of disaster risk reduction and human development in the context of floods and droughts in Canada and Australia. The paper draws from a comparative case study analysis involving two Delphi studies and semi-structured interviews with Canadian and Australian practitioners at local, provincial/state, and federal levels. The findings from this study show a dominant view among participants that disaster risk reduction requires a broader engagement with human development systems that is adaptable to local contexts. This includes considerations - such as poverty, health and well-being, climate action, social equity and equality, and human agency - as well as mainstreaming disaster risk information in human development processes and activities. The research identifies mechanisms perceived as being critical to developing integrated approaches, including in effective legislation, policy frameworks, evidence-based decision-making, and cross-sector collaboration. While an integrated approach to disaster risk reduction and human development challenges the political and programmatic complexities for flood and drought risk reduction, approaches to disaster risk governance that reflect the capacities and needs of individuals and vulnerable populations must be developed.

AMG Azevedo & HC Lima were kept in conditions of field capacity (FC), flooding (FL), total submersion (TS), post-flooding (PF), and post-submersion (PS) so survival strategies could be evaluated. Analyzes were performed after 30 and 60 days of hydric treatment (DTH). Soil flooding resulted in the production of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots in FL plants, whereas flooding resulted in the death of 18% of TS plants after 50 DTH. In addition, water saturation affected the formation of rhizobia nodules in the roots, resulting in a decrease of nodulated plants during the water saturation period. The TS plants were negatively influenced by submersion after 60 DHT. There was a decrease in the height, number of leaves, root-collar diameter and the dry mass of roots, shoot and leafs. The plant chlorophyll rate also was reduced. The ratio between the root dry mass and the total dry mass also decreased during the two periods. Low rates were recorded for dry mass of roots, shoots and total and root-collar diameter in PS plants. Results showed that the roots of FL, TS, PF, and PS plants had more soluble carbohydrates after 60 DTH. After 60 DTH, higher sucrose rates were observed in roots of FL, PF, and PS plants. Although flooding had a negative effect on the plants, the evaluations show that L.cultratus is tolerant to stress caused by flooding and total submersion in periods up to 60 DTH.

To manage disaster risk, government commissioned inquiries have called for greater investment in mitigation. This article critically examines the call for a shift in funding priority towards pre-disaster mitigation measures, in the context of growing concerns around the ability of households to access and afford insurance. It examines mitigation measures in the context of three prominent Australian disasters: the Black Saturday bushfires (Victoria, 2009), the Queensland floods (2010-2011), and Cyclone Yasi (Queensland, 2011). We argue that as a mode of disaster security, mitigation operates as a complex assemblage of logics and practices of protection, preparedness, and resilience, which problematizes simplistic protection/resilience binaries. On the one hand, mitigation serves as a mode of protection, which underscores the dominant maladaptive rationality of insurance. It promises a collective solution to uninsurability that is limited by government fiscal constraints and growing employment of risk-reflective insurance pricing. On the other hand, there is evidence of an emergent rationality of household insurance as a path to resilience and preparednessfor example, in the development of insurance systems that price household retrofitting technologies and in the development of policyholder education campaigns. This resilience rationality holds the promise of securing individuals previously excluded from insurance. However, for householders lacking the necessary physical, cognitive, and financial capacities to make themselves and their properties resilient, the transition to a pre-disaster mitigation mode of security will likely do little to alleviate disadvantage and marginalization.

Paraglacial processes are the governing mechanism of landscape evolution in deglaciating valleys and are now studied to understand the deglacial and postglacial landscape dynamics. We here present and describe detailed glacial geomorphology of Lashar and Chopta valleys as the area is strongly modified by the erosional and depositional imprints of late Pleistocene glaciations (MIS 2). Using geomorphological and stratigraphical methods, field surveys, SRTM DEM, Landsat ETM+and Google Earth Pro data, we have mapped glacial and glaciofluvial landforms and established moraine stratigraphy in the study area. Based on the morphostratigraphical mapping of the moraines supported by limited optical chronology, four events of glaciations have been identified in the in the Lashar, Chopta and Kalip valleys and date back to last glacial maximum and advocate for a widespread ice cover with large outlet tributary glaciers. The disposition of the lateral and terminal moraines has been used to estimate the area of paleoglacial extent and their corresponding ice volume during different stages. The presence of proglacial lakes, sensitive indicators of climate change, suggests that the glaciers in the region are melting and radically responding to global warming and are potentially vulnerable for generating glacial lake outburst floods.

The lake lies in a closed basin and its limnology, ecology, and fisheries are driven by seasonal cycles of flooding from the Omo River, which provides more than 90% of the lake's inflow. Lake Turkana is a unique ecosystem and is home to at least 79 fish species (12 endemic), the world's largest remaining population of Nile crocodile, and hundreds of resident and migratory bird species. The lake has considerable fisheries resources that contribute to food security, employment, and the general wellbeing of local communities. Lake Turkana is also the least studied of the Great Lakes of Africa, due to its remoteness, the absence of necessary scientific infrastructure, and the scarcity of trained personnel in the field of aquatic sciences and fisheries in the region. Here, we present a review based on the available literature and on expert discussions and surveys to synthesize current knowledge, research gaps, and opportunities for increasing our knowledge on this unique ecosystem. Our literature review showed that there is a marked lack of interdisciplinary and applied research on Lake Turkana, and that much of the work published on the system (63.3%) focuses on previous geological periods rather than the current state of the ecosystem. We highlight four critical steps that need to be taken to improve research into this system: local capacity building, consistent monitoring and data sharing, sustainable financing, and strengthened collaborative networks.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Accurate flood forecasting can offer governments early warnings about impending flood disasters, giving them a chance to evacuate and save lives. Deep learning is used in flood forecasting to improve the timeliness and accuracy of flood water level predictions. While various deep learning models similar to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have achieved notable results, they have complex structures with low computational efficiency, and often lack generalizability and stability. This study applies a spatiotemporal Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (STA-GRU) model for flood prediction to increase the models' computing efficiency. Another salient feature of our methodology is the incorporation of lag time during data preprocessing before the training of the model. Notably, for 12-h forecasting, the STA-GRU model's R-squared (R2) value increased from 0.8125 to 0.9215. Concurrently, the model manifested reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. For a more extended 24-h forecasting, the R2 value of the STA-GRU model improved from 0.6181 to 0.7283, accompanied by diminishing RMSE and MAE values. Seven typical deep learning models-the LSTM, the Convolutional Neural Networks LSTM (CNNLSTM), the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), the spatiotemporal Attention Long Short-Term Memory (STA-LSTM), the GRU, the Convolutional Neural Networks GRU (CNNGRU), and the STA-GRU-are compared for water level prediction. Comparative analysis delineated that the use of the STA-GRU model and the application of the lag time pre-processing method significantly improved the reliability and accuracy of flood forecasting.

Biophysical and biochemical features' feedback associated with a flood episode in a tropical river basin model	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Biophysical and biochemical features; Flood management; Regeneration process; Tropical river basin; Vegetation indices	GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; CONDITION INDEX VCI; KALU-GANGA RIVER; VEGETATION RESPONSES; RIPARIAN FOREST; RISK ANALYSIS; LAND-USE; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS	Global climate change scenarios such as frequent and extreme floods disturb the river basins by destructing the vegetation resulting in rehabilitation procedures being more costly. Thus, understanding the recovery and regeneration of vegetation followed by extreme flood events is critical for a successful rehabilitation process. Spatial and temporal variation of biochemical and biophysical features derived from remote sensing technology in vegetation can be incorporated to understand the recovery and regeneration of vegetation. The present study explores the flood impact on vegetation caused by major river basins in Sri Lanka (a model tropical river basin) by comparing pre-flood and post-flood cases. The study utilized enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), and gross primary productivity (GPP) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) platform. A remarkable decline in EVI, LAI, FPAR, GPP, and vegetation condition index was observed in the post-flood case. Notably, coupled GPP-EVI and GPP-LAI portrayed dependency of features and showed a significant impact triggered by the flood episode by narrowing the feature in post-flood events. EVI depicted the highest regeneration (0.333) while GPP presented the lowest regeneration (0.093) after the flood event. Further, it was revealed that 1.18 years have been on the regeneration. The regeneration of GPP and LAI remained low comparatively justifying the magnitude and impact of the flood event. The study revealed successful implications of vegetation indices on flood basin management of small to large tropical river basins.	[Bellanthudawa, B. K.

Because of their morphological characteristics, rivers can cause major flooding events. Indeed, they can be subjected to variations in discharge in response to heavy rainfall and riverbank failures. Among the emerging methodologies that address the monitoring of river flooding, those that include the combination of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and photogrammetric techniques (i.e., Structure from Motion-SfM) ensure the high-frequency acquisition of high-resolution spatial data over wide areas and so the generation of orthomosaics, useful for automatic feature extraction. Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS) is an automatic feature extraction open-source tool. It was developed to primarily fulfill supervised classification purposes of biological microscope images, but its usefulness has been demonstrated in several image pipelines. At the same time, there is a significant lack of published studies on the applicability of TWS with the identification of a universal and efficient combination of machine learning classifiers and segmentation approach, in particular with respect to classifying UAV images of riverine environments. In this perspective, we present a study comparing the accuracy of nine combinations, classifier plus image segmentation filter, using TWS, also with respect to human photo-interpretation, in order to identify an effective supervised approach for automatic river features extraction from UAV multi-temporal orthomosaics. The results, which are very close to human interpretation, indicate that the proposed approach could prove to be a valuable tool to support and improve the hydro-geomorphological and flooding hazard assessments in riverine environments.

Insects from the southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot: a barometer of diversity and threat status of nine host-dependent families across three orders	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION			English	Review						Threat status; Coextinction; Insecta; Threatening processes; IUCN Red List; Threatened species lists	LICE HEMIPTERA TRIOZIDAE; FLORISTIC REGION; CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT; HETEROPTERA TINGIDAE; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; TRAPDOOR SPIDERS; GENUS; PLANT; TERRESTRIAL; DECLINES	The mass loss of insects is gaining momentum in the twenty-first century, compared with the previous 100 years. The loss is coinciding with accelerating threats, including megafires, flooding, temperature extremes, urbanisation, and habitat loss. In global diversity hotspots, where endemism is high, and native vegetation highly impacted, many insect species would likely be both endemic and threatened. However, insect diversity, endemicity and threat status are largely unknown in these regions. Here we assess the biodiversity and status of host-dependent insects in the southwest Australian (SWWA) hotspot. We selected nine insect families across three orders; Tingidae, Achilidae, Derbidae, Dictyopharidae, Triozidae (Hemiptera), Micropterigidae, Heliozidae (Lepidoptera), Boopidae, and Philopteridae (Psocodea). These families had 632+ species, of which 255 (similar to 40%) were described. One species was formally listed as threatened, but a further 245 species potentially require conservation management. Threatening processes include coextinction (through loss or reduction in host populations), climate change, altered fire regimes, habitat loss, and fragmentation of host populations. Taxonomic and resourcing bias has inhibited attempts to describe the diversity and biogeography of the region, precluding comprehensive conservation assessments for the majority of insect families. Implications for insect conservation Given the scale and intensity of threats faced by a hyperdiverse insect fauna in the southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot, a systematic approach to manage habitats at a landscape scale is most likely to succeed in conserving species in the short-term. Longer term solutions require addressing these knowledge gaps, thus increasing our understanding of the diversity and conservation needs of insect families in southwest Australia.	[Young, D.

However, such practice may not yield systems that are robust with respect to a broad array of rainfall conditions. To tackle this problem, we contribute a novel computational framework characterized by two distinguishing features. First, we use multiple rainfall events throughout the design process; and, second, we rely on faster emulators (instead of process-based models) to manage the inevitable increase in the computational requirements. In particular, our framework moves through five steps accounting for the generation of stochastic rainfall events, the selection of decision variables (via sensitivity analysis), emulator identification, emulation-based optimization, and ex-post robustness analysis. To test our framework, we implement it on a 33-km2 basin in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and benchmark it against a more traditional approach based on design storms. Results show that there are untapped opportunities for improving drainage performance without altering investment costs. For example, we found that a budget of $30 million can yield an overflow reduction of about 85% or 50% depending on whether we rely on stochastic rainfall events or design storms. Importantly, such improvements do not affect the computational requirements, owing to the use of emulators. The framework is applicable to other basins and could be readily extended to other sources of uncertainty, such as land use change, or climate change scenarios, which are expected to pose additional strains on urban drainage systems.

Flood Risk Assessment and Mapping in the Hadejia River Basin, Nigeria, Using Hydro-Geomorphic Approach and Multi-Criterion Decision-Making Method	WATER			English	Article						flood risk; flood hazard; socio-economic vulnerability; multi-criterion analysis; Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)	ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; NGURU WETLANDS; WEST-BENGAL; PROCESS AHP; GIS; DISTRICT; REGIONS; DAMAGE; AREAS	Flood risk management is crucial for climate change resilience. The Hadejia River basin is known for severe and frequent floods, which have destroyed houses and farmlands and claimed many lives. This study developed a GIS-based flood risk and vulnerability mapping assessment using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to outline scenarios that reduce risk and vulnerability associated with floods in the Hadejia River basin. The risk mapping of the basin integrated seven hydro-geomorphological indicators influencing extreme events (elevation, mean annual rainfall, slope, distance from rivers, soil type, and drainage density) and six socio-economic vulnerability indicators (population density, female population density, literacy rate, land use, employment rate, and road network) using a multi-criterion analysis. The average annual rainfall data of 36 years (1982-2018) were used for flood plain mapping in this study. Combining the flood hazard and socio-economic vulnerability indices of the basin revealed high-to-very high flood risk in the downstream and central upstream portions of the basin, which cover about 43.4% of the basin area. The local areas of Auyo, Guri, Hadejia, Ringim, Kafin Hausa, and Jahun were identified as zones at a very high flood risk. The study also revealed that flood hazard and vulnerability indicators have different influences on flood risk. The validated results resonate with the records of previous flood distribution studies of the basin. This research study is significantly important for developing strategic measures and policy revision through which the government and relief agencies may reduce the negative impact of floods in the Hadejia River basin.

This study addresses the contribution of groundwater flux in a large floodplain system (Poyang Lake, China), with focus on quantifying the groundwater-lake interactions at multiple time scales in high rainfall (2010) and low rainfall (2011) years using a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Simulated results revealed that the unconfined aquifer received approximately 8 % of the annual rainfall as groundwater recharge. Fluctuations in shallow groundwater and lake water level reflected hydraulic synchronization and hysteresis. Additionally, the diurnal variability in the groundwater-lake exchange fluxes was subject to dynamic and bidirectional patterns, and a time lag between the water exchange and rainfall was also found. For 2010 and 2011, the monthly net flux of lake infiltration into groundwater was 1.5-10.0 mm and 0.1-6.0 mm and groundwater exfiltration into lake was 1.3-9.5 mm and 0.4-2.2 mm, respectively, demonstrating a significant variation of the exchange magnitude and direction. In particular, we found that groundwater exfiltration contributed up to 55 % of lake storage change in February of 2011. The outcomes from this study indicate that groundwater can be a major component of the Poyang Lake's water balance, which suggests an important role of groundwater in regulating the lake water storage and perhaps other flood pulse systems.

Compound floods from multiple sources are prone to superimposed effects, greatly aggravating flooding. In addition, the influence of anthropogenic activities such as man-made flood control projects in coastal regions also need to be explored. Using the Ling River Basin on the east coast of China as a case study, this study investigated the impacts of natural and human drivers on the spatiotemporal distribution of extreme floods based on a 1D-2D coupled hydrodynamic model. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated based on historical flood events, and the validated model was further used to reproduce the devastating flood caused by Typhoon Lekima in 2019. The results show that the model has great capability and accuracy in simulating both the flood occurrence process and its inundation extent under natural and anthropogenic influences. The results also indicate that the high amount of discharge from the upper reaches of the Ling River was the main driver that caused the catastrophic consequences, and 83% of the inundation is caused by this factor. Comparatively, the failure of flood protection measures, which was a human driver, aggravated the influence of floods in local regions. Assessing the individual and superimposed effects of natural and human drivers on flooding may help enhance the resilience of flooded coastal areas.

They are also heavily modified by humans and today nearly all habitats in many large rivers have been drastically altered. These modifications often include disconnecting lentic habitats either permanently or intermittently from the main channel. The Merwin Preserve at Spunky Bottoms (Merwin) began as a connected backwater that was leveed and drained for agriculture in the 1920s and restored in 1999, with restoration allowing it to become a disconnected backwater habitat. This status changed in 2013 when record flooding on the adjacent Illinois River overtopped and breached the levee creating an unmanaged and intermittent connection allowing the river access at moderately high river stages. During the past 20 years, the fish community at Merwin has undergone several changes that follow three drought events pre-breach, the exchange of fishes from the mainstem following the breach in 2013, and subsequent low water conditions of much of the area as river levels drop. Long term data and more intensive sampling efforts during the drought of 2012 showed relative abundance of sport fishes declined during, or immediately following, pre-breach drought events and post-breach low water conditions while relative abundance of non-sport and non-native fishes remained stable. The unique story of Merwin can provide a case study for other large river restoration projects on the effects of drought, climate change, and impacts of an unmanaged connection of a previously disconnected habitat to an adjacent large river.

Kashmir valley in the NW Himalaya is subject to a multitude of hazards and has been an area of many disasters ranging from landslides to catastrophic earthquakes, with heavy loss of life and property. However, information on most of these events is poorly reported or exaggerated and in some cases not recorded at all. The availability of an organized and reliable database of past hazards and disasters is essential for understanding risk and mitigating future disasters in the valley. The present study addresses the lack of data availability by developing a hazard and disaster catalogue for Kashmir valley based on an investigation of secondary data sources. The database comprises 1858 events including 1693 earthquakes, 39 floods, 69 landslides, and 57 snow avalanches for the period of 1900-2020. Information on triggers and impacts, and insights into spatial and temporal trends are also included. There is a general increase in the incidence of the extreme events over this period of the study, except for floods, which show little change in frequency. The results further reveal that the valley has experienced numerous small to major earthquakes that appear to be randomly distributed in space. In contrast, floods recur at regular intervals and are restricted to floodplains, and landslides and snow avalanches have occurred only on slopes adjacent to the valley. The historical disaster database is an aid in regional planning and policy development to facilitate the disaster risk reduction process.	[Ali, Noureen; Alam, Akhtar; Bhat, M.

Initiating the appropriate strategies of disaster risk reduction is necessary to understand risk perception. This study attempted to examine the flood risk public perception in flash flood-prone areas of Punjab, Pakistan. A simple random sampling technique was used for collecting the data of 560 household respondents, and a logistic regression model was employed to make out the factors of flood risk perception. In classification of low and high perceived risk of relevant indicators, flood risk perception index was constructed. Risk perception is significantly influenced by socioeconomic factors which have a direct impact on disaster preparedness and potential adaptive capacities. After that, potential correlation of risk perception with the demographic status of respondents was investigated in this study. Empirical estimates indicated as respondents' schooling, ownership of house, size of household, employment status and past flood experience significantly influence flood risk perception. Risk perception determinants also diverse among both communities portray spatial differences. Inadequate protection measures from public authorities and institutions, limited preparedness regarding actions of private mitigation, reduced intensity of reliance in institutions and authorities are major reasons for high risk and lower mitigation in these flash flood-prone areas. The outcomes of this research can facilitate to understand flood risk perception and its factors for conniving appropriate management plan of flood risk and communication strategies. Furthermore, this research can help consider multidimensional flood risks and its spatial vibrancy from the perspective of social science.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Floods; Vulnerability; Economic status; Livelihood; Poverty, Hazara and Malakand, Pakistan	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; RISK; VULNERABILITY; DIVERSIFICATION; PROVINCE; IMPACTS	The agriculture sector remains under attack by the consistent flooding events in Pakistan as flooding water is sweeping away crops and livelihood opportunities, thus dragging the already vulnerable communities into poverty. This research has studied the adverse impacts of consistent floods (2010 to 2018) on the rural mountainous agriculture, agrarian occupation, economic system, and rise in poverty in ten districts of Hazara and Malakand divisions, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. In total, 1000 self-administered questionnaires were deployed at the household level through judgment sampling studying the flood-affected households. Primary data for the impacts of floods on the livelihood, economic status, and poverty and correlation among them was estimated through three parallel logistic regression equations based on indexes for three separate models for the study variable to describe the flood-induced vulnerability at HH level. The results of the interrelationship of the selected variables declared Malakand division more prone to loss of livelihood, degradation of low-economic status, and increased in poverty due to flooding than Hazara division. It is concluded that floods have curtailed the agricultural livelihood on damaging crop production that has degraded locals' economic system by reducing household's income and savings, ending up in borrowing of money and leading to debt due to non-repayment. Households' vulnerability has increased due to increased poverty as being more exposed to natural disasters. It calls for government intervention to safeguard poor mountainous communities of Pakistan through financial help, seeds, livestock, and technical help in times of disaster.

This has a significant impact on productivity and human life. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the characteristics of extreme precipitation and its spatiotemporal variation. In this study, we investigate the dominant variation patterns of extreme precipitation (EP), which is characterized by indices, and also analyze its potential causes in the Shandong province of China during 1961-2015 using the daily precipitation data from 123 metrological stations. The results show that there has been a dry trend in the Shandong Province in the past 55 years, that is, with the decrease in precipitation, most of the extreme precipitation index has basically showed a downward trend to varying degrees. In particular, the increase in the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) and the decrease in the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) can better explain the drought in this region. After the 1980s, the extreme precipitation index basically showed an upward trend to varying degrees, indicating that extreme precipitation events have shown an increasing trend in recent years. The spatial distribution of each extreme precipitation index generally increased from north to south. The mutation of each extreme precipitation index occurred in the 1970s and 1990s, and there was a main period of 0.9-2.2 years. In terms of influencing factors, the NINO3 area can be used as the critical sea area for the response of extreme precipitation to SSTAs in the Shandong Province. The research results are helpful to understand the temporal and spatial variations of extreme precipitation and have very important reference value for the prediction of and response to climate change and extreme events in the future.

A system dynamics model (SDM), explored for the urban region of Orlando, Florida, acts as a multiagent model for portraying material and energy flows across the food, energy, water, and waste (FEWW) sectors to account for urban sustainability transitions. The interlinkages between the FEWW sectors in the SDM are formulated with multiple layers of dependencies and interconnections of the available resources and their external climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic drivers through four case studies (scenarios). The vital components in the integrated FEWW infrastructure system include urban agriculture associated with the East End Market Urban Farm; energy from the fuel-diverse Curtis H. Stanton Energy Center; reclaimed wastewater treated by the Eastern Water Reclamation Facility, the Water Conserv II Water Reclamation Facility, and stormwater reuse; and solid waste management and biogas generation from the Orange County Landfill. The four scenarios evaluated climate change impacts, policy instruments, and land use teleconnection for waste management in the FEWW nexus, demonstrating regional synergies among these components. The use of multicriteria decision-making coupled with cost-benefit-risk tradeoff analysis supported the selection of case 4 as the most appropriate option as it provided greater renewable energy production and stormwater reuse. The SDM graphic user interface aids in the visualization of the dynamics of the FEWW nexus framework, demonstrating the specific role of renewable energy harvesting for sustainably transitioning Orlando into a circular economy.

J	Devlin, AT; Pan, JY; Lin, H				Devlin, Adam T.; Pan, Jiayi; Lin, Hui			Extended Water Level Trends at Long-Record Tide Gauges Via Moving Window Averaging and Implications for Future Coastal Flooding	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						sea level rise; total water level; tidal evolution; western boundary currents; coastal flooding; climate change	MEAN SEA-LEVEL; PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; NORTH-SEA; SECULAR CHANGES; VARIABILITY; RISE; ACCELERATION; OCEAN; CYCLE	Quantifying the nature and patterns of sea level rise (SLR) is a critical challenge for the sustainability and resilience of coastal zones. Studies of SLR typically consider time-averaged mean sea level (MSL) trends, however, coastal flooding is more sensitive to extended water level (EWL), which includes time-variable components such as tides and seasonal variability. Here, we describe a new way to determine long-term trends of peak extended water levels (PEWL) considering combined monthly averaged MSL and tidal range and their changes in linear rates and variability, which are compared to trends in mean extended water levels (MEWL) over moving 20-year time windows at long-period tide gauges over two epochs: century-scale, and half-century-scale. Results show that a majority of locations exhibit different PEWL trends than MEWL trends in both epochs, and this difference has intensified in the past 50 years. There are strong regional coherencies observed: positive PEWL trends along western boundaries of basins (US Atlantic Coast, Japan, and Australia), and negative PEWL trends in most of Europe and the US Pacific Coast. Strong correlations to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are also observed at many locations. Significant contributions from changes in tidal range and/or variability highlights the importance of considering multiple components of the water level spectrum beyond MSL. Our results are further analyzed in the context of IPCC projections to demonstrate that increased rates of PEWL may have additional implications for future flood levels at locations which have large projected increases in SLR.

Nevertheless, much of India's population still suffers from hunger and poverty. Floods obstruct agricultural production; destroy infrastructure; and disrupt livelihoods, normal services, health care, etc. In this way, floods ultimately affect households' food security. We examined household food security in flood-prone rural areas of India in a more extensive way than in previous studies by constructing an index that incorporates various factors of the food security dimensions. Factors determining the level of flood-prone households' food security were also analyzed. By polychoric principal component analysis, an aggregate food security index was constructed. The food security score was regressed on different explanatory variables to evaluate their effect on the overall food security situation in the study area. Our results showed that three-fourths of the respondent households faced food security issues to varying degrees. Family type, physical assets and employment scheme showed positive impacts on the level of food security of the respondents. In contrast, households with female household heads and those suffering losses of property due to floods were adversely affected in terms of negative impacts on overall food security. The results suggest the need for the adoption of integrated strategies to effectively address food security issues amidst the increased severity of flood events. The study findings are useful for policy makers in India and countries with similar backgrounds to tackle the food insecurity brought about by flood hazards.

However, DER focuses more on the overall shape changes of recovery path, two features that commonly appear in the dynamic change process of recovery curve are also worth evaluating separately: the "secondary shock" caused by adverse factors during the recovery process and sustainable improvement of economic output at the end of recovery. Therefore, we adopt a dynamic input-output model that integrates capital damage and affected people and apply it to an extreme flood in 2016, Wuhan City, China, building the relationship between 7 recovery actions (rescue funds) and changes of two features, analyzing the impact of resilience on the dynamic recovery path features through 6 characteristic variables constructed in this paper. Results show that (1) economic resilience increases from no to actual action, the dropping rate caused by "secondary shock" decreases 30.4%, and Wuhan's economic output has achieved an improvement in sustainability of 0.088% compared to the pre-disaster level, which contributes permanently to reducing vulnerability to future disasters. (2) only 21.81% (compared to the actual scenario) of the rescue funds is needed to support 30% reduction action plus 0.02% sustainable improvement. But to support the 50% recovery action, 78.92% of the rescue funds is needed. This paper aims to provide a new perspective for the refined dynamic assessment of resilience and to prove the role of resilience in promoting short-term post-disaster recovery and long-term sustainable development.

J	Ferreira, RN				Ferreira, Rosana Nieto			Cut-Off Lows and Extreme Precipitation in Eastern Spain: Current and Future Climate	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						cut-off lows; extreme precipitation; climate change	INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; PATTERNS; CYCLONES; SYSTEMS; EVENTS	This study presents a seasonal synoptic climatology of cut-off lows (COLs) that produced extreme precipitation in the Valencia region of Spain during 1998-2018 and uses simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to study how extreme COL precipitation may change in a future warmer climate. COLs were shown to be the main producer of extreme precipitation in the Valencia region, especially during the transition seasons. The strongest raining COL events occurred during September-November. Six-day composites of thermodynamic and dynamic fields and precipitation show that COLs that produce extreme precipitation in this region remain stationary over Spain for 2-3 days and tend to produce precipitation over the Valencia region for at least two consecutive days. In the low levels these COLs are characterized by low pressure over the Mediterranean sea and winds with an easterly, onshore component thus fueling precipitation. Comparison of current and future climate ensembles of WRF simulations of 14 September-November extreme precipitation producing COL events suggest that in a warmer climate extreme COL precipitation may increase by as much as 88% in northeastern Spain and 61% in the adjoining Mediterranean Sea. These projected increases in extreme COL precipitation in the northeast of Spain present additional challenges to a region where COL flooding already has significant socio-economic impacts. Additionally, about half of the future climate COL event simulations showed increases in precipitation in the Valencian region of eastern Spain. These results provide important nuance to projections of a decreasing trend of total precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula as the climate warms.

Frequency analysis of the number of rivers with the annual maximum flow over the flow capacity in the same year (defined as simultaneous flooding here) indicated that simultaneous flood risk will increase in the future climate under 4-degree rise scenarios in Japan, whose increment is larger than the variation of sea surface temperature projections. As the result, the return period of simultaneous flooding in eight river basins (the same number as in a severe storm in western Japan, 2018, causing the second worst economic damage since 1962) is estimated at 400 years in the historical experiment, 25 years in the 4-degree rise experiment. The association rule and graph theory analyses for the big data of annual maximum flows in the future climate scenarios indicated that simultaneous flood occurrence is dominated by spatial distance at a national scale as well as by the spatial relation between mountainous ridges and typhoon courses at a regional scale. Large ensemble climate simulation data combined with the informatics technology is a powerful approach to simultaneous flood risk analysis.

One such example is Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), to which the ecologically important black box tree Eucalyptus largiflorens (Myrtaceae) is unique. Little is known about its mineral nutrition and response to flooding. A field study conducted at Hattah Kulkyne National Park on the MDB examined nutrient and Al distribution in mature and young foliage of trees whose status varied with respect to the presence of surface floodwaters. Black box is also of interest due to emerging evidence of its capacity to accumulate high foliar salt concentrations. Here, cryo scanning electron microscopy alone (SEM), combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy were applied to evaluate leaf anatomy and elemental patterns at the cellular and whole-leaf levels. Variation in whole-leaf elemental levels across flooded and dry trees aligned with known nutritional fluctuations in this drought-tolerant species reliant on occasional infrequent flooding. The microprobe data provide evidence of drought tolerance by demonstrating that extended conditions of lack of water to trees do not elicit leaf anatomical changes nor changes to leaf cellular storage of these elements. Foliar Na concentrations of similar to 2000-6000 mg kg(-1) DW were found co-localised with Cl in mesophyll and dermal cells of young and mature leaves, suggesting vacuolar salt disposal as a detoxification strategy.

An unusual combination of winds created a storm surge reaching up to 3.5 m above mean sea level, which is more than a meter higher than all other observations over the past 200 years. On the Danish, German, and Swedish coasts, about 300 people lost their lives. The consequences of the storm in Denmark and Germany were more severe than in Sweden, with significantly larger destruction and higher numbers of casualties. In Denmark and Germany, the 1872 storm has been more extensively documented and remembered and still influences local and regional risk awareness. A comparative study indicates that the collective memory of the 1872 storm is related to the background knowledge about floods, the damage extent, and the response to the storm. Flood marks and dikes help to remember the events. In general, coastal flood defence is to the largest degree implemented in the affected areas in Germany, followed by Denmark, and is almost absent in Sweden, corresponding to the extent of the collective memory of the 1872 storm. Within the affected countries, there is local variability of flood risk awareness associated with the collective memory of the storm. Also, the economic dependency on flood-prone areas and conflicting interests with the tourism industry have influence on flood protection decisions. The processes of climate change adaptation and implementation of the EU Floods Directive are slowly removing these differences in flood risk management approaches.

Hourly precipitation data from eight high quality precipitation gauges from 1958 to 2014 in Victoria (Australia) were used. Variations in the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events as well as their proportion of total precipitation were examined. On average, we found an 89% increase in hourly precipitation events exceeding 18 mm/h in the latter half of the study period as compared to the earlier half. The most extreme precipitation events increased in intensity by more than more moderate extremes, with larger increases during the warm season. The proportion of precipitation that could be attributed to extreme precipitation events during the warm season has increased in recent decades while annual precipitation totals have been declining. Extreme value modeling was performed to estimate how the 2, 10 and 100 year precipitation events have changed. A statistically significant increase could only be claimed for two sites for the 2 year return period precipitation event. However, the mean estimates of the 100 year return period precipitation events at five of the eight stations from 1987 to 2014 exceeded the 90% confidence intervals of the 100 year return period precipitation events from 1958 to 1985, while little change was observed at the other three sites. Our findings have implications for improved planning and resilience around intense rainfall and associated hazards such as flash flooding in Australia.

The Asynergies of Structural Disaster Risk Reduction Measures: Comparing Floods and Earthquakes	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						asynergies; building back better; DRR Measures; multi-hazard risk assessment; sustainable development	MULTI-HAZARD RISK; NATURAL HAZARDS; GLOBAL EXPOSURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BUILDING BACK; VULNERABILITY; URBAN; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK	Traditionally, building-level disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures are aimed at a single natural hazard. However, in many countries the society faces the threat of multiple hazards. Building-level DRR measures that aim to decrease earthquake vulnerability can have opposing or conflicting effects on flood vulnerability, and vice versa. In a case study of Afghanistan, we calculate the risk of floods and earthquakes, in terms of average annual losses (AAL), in the current situation. Next, we develop two DRR scenarios, where building-level measures to reduce flood and earthquake risk are implemented. We use this to identify districts for which DRR measures of one hazard increase the risk of another hazard. We then also calculate the optimal situation between the two scenarios by, for each district, selecting the DRR scenario for which the AAL as a ratio of the total exposure is lowest. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of the total risk to each scenario. The optimal measure differs spatially throughout Afghanistan, but in most districts it is more beneficial to take flood DRR measures. However, in the districts where it is more beneficial to take earthquake measures, the reduction in risk is considerable (up to 40%, while flood DRR measures lead to a reduction in risk by 16% in individual districts). The introduction of asynergies between DRR measures in risk analyses allows policy-makers to spatially differentiate building codes and other building-level DRR measures to address the most prevalent risk while not compromising the risk resulting from other hazards.

SIMULATING HYDROLOGIC EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE ON A SMALL SUB-ALPINE WATERSHED IN NEW MEXICO, US	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Landscape change; PRMS; Runoff change; Wildfire	POSTFIRE RUNOFF; QUALITY MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIRE; EROSION; CATCHMENT; FOREST; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; REPELLENCY	Streamflow records available before and after wildfire in a small, mixed conifer, sub-alpine monsoonal dominated watershed in New Mexico provided a unique opportunity to calibrate a watershed model (PRMS) for pre- and postfire conditions. The calibrated model was then used to simulate the hydrologic effects offire. Simulated postfire surface runoff averaged 14.7 times greater than prefire for the 29-year simulation period. The relationship between precipitation and streamfiow changed dramatically after wildfire, largely from a decreased influence of antecedent soil moisture (ASM) and increased influence of canopy factors (less interception) and soil factors (greater hydrophobicity, less infiltration) in controlling surface runoff. For higher ASM, simulated pre- and postfire streamflow was similarly variable. However, for moderate and lower ASM, soil water storage was too low to contribute baseflow for either prefire or postfire conditions, and thus postfire streamflow maintained a linear, surface runoff-dominated response to precipitation, whereas prefire sfreamflow showed little response. Postfire streamflow efficiency increased with ASM from a mean of 0.02 at the lowest ASM to 0.30 at the highest ASM, whereas prefire conditions showed no sensitivity to ASM at low to moderate ASH Postfire streamflow increased (2.1 times greater median flow than prefire), particularly from increased surface runoff (14.7 times greater), which occurred across all ASM conditions. As a result, streamfiow shifted from baseflow-dominated to surface runoff-dominated after wildfire. This result indicates that substantial increases in runoff efficiency (20% or more of precipitation volume) can occur across a range of ASM postfire, which may have severe consequences for flooding. This result also indicates that monitoring of soil moisture would enhance raingauge networks for early flood warning.	[Moeser, C.

Rethinking Reef Island Stability in Relation to Anthropogenic Sea Level Rise	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						sea level rise; Holocene; coastal vulnerability; atoll; Republic of the Marshall Islands; reef island	SHORELINE CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEDIMENT PRODUCTION; MAJURO ATOLL; PACIFIC; DRIVEN; HIGHSTAND; FACIES; FLATS	Unprecedented rates of anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) and attendant wave-driven flooding and salinization threaten the stability (and habitability) of atoll islands. Thus, there is doubt regarding the continued existence of sovereign atoll nations and unique, place-based indigenous atoll cultures. Evidence that some atoll islands may have originally formed in the latter stages of post-glacial sea level rise (SLR) has been interpreted to mean they will persist under accelerating ASLR. These forecasts are at odds with interpretations that atoll islands will succumb to rising seas. To shed light on conflicting models of island stability, we develop a multitemporal island vulnerability assessment (MIVA) to anticipate island instability and apply it in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) where there is a history of previous research. Using evidence from geological and historical records of island response to changing late Holocene sea level and modern tide, wave, and groundwater observations, we identify thresholds where islands pass from stable to unstable phases due to projected local, relative ASLR. Under the most likely scenario (intermediate-high) where ASLR reaches 1.91 m by 2100, island stability deteriorates by midcentury as historical rates of SLR at RMI increase threefold, and temporary flood events deteriorate potable groundwater and agroforests. In the second half of the century, as ASLR exceeds geological sea level thresholds, permanent island instability will be inevitable with no action. We conclude that these islands are already trending into declining stability due to ASLR as documented by published observations of extreme tides, wave inundation, salinization, and sediment mobilization.

Assessment of water-related disaster risk is essential for risk mitigation and management for sustainable development. To investigate these issues, this study examined hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and resilience to disaster in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) of China, where water-related disasters have had an adverse impact on economic development and water resource security. We developed a multiple index system for the concerned YREB 131 cities, applied a risk assessment model to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of the water-related disaster risk and identified the hotspots of risks in the YREB from 2000 to 2015 based on multisource observation data. The results showed that the average hazard, exposure, and vulnerability increased by 3.62%, 1.28%, and 2.07%, respectively, in the YREB during 2000-2015, revealing that water-related disaster risk presented an upward trend. The high-risk areas were mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the YREB. The water-related disaster risk for the Chengdu-Chongqing City Cluster and urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta increased and had spatial agglomeration characteristics. In addition, cities' resilience can contribute to 14%-25% decreases in water-related disaster risk in the YREB. Thus, policy makers should focus more attention on water-related disaster risk reduction and improve cities' resilience, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the YREB.

Understanding the role of natural hazards in internal labour mobility in Australia	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES			English	Article						Internal migration; Labour mobility; Natural disasters; Online survey; Stated preference	RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY; LIFE-COURSE; CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; EXTREME HEAT; MIGRATION; WORST; PREFERENCE; INTENTIONS; COMMUNITY; DECISION	Australia is among the countries most exposed to natural hazards, particularly wildfire, cyclones, floods and heat waves. Natural disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity as climate changes. For some people, the increase in risk from these disasters is a reason to move away from certain places or avoid others. Contemporary migration literature has largely ignored environmental factors for mobility, concentrating instead on economic and amenity or lifestyle factors. In this study we fill this gap by exploring the extent to which people in Australia consider natural hazards in their location choices and mobility decisions. Results from a survey using best-worst scaling showed that non-environmental factors prevail, with safety from crime the factor people consider most important when moving somewhere for a new job, followed by living costs and provision of adequate health care. Environmental factors were secondary in people's migration decisions but more important than attractive scenery and educational opportunities. The reasons people in Australia are not particularly dissuaded from moving to places where the prospects of good employment opportunities are high even though they risk the effects of natural disasters, might be a belief in their ability to cope with the disasters should they occur (self-efficacy). Among the environmental factors, high wildfire risk was most important in people's migration decisions, even though the survey was conducted before the devastating wildfires in 2019/20 which were unprecedented in their extent and severity. Wildfires might since have become more important in people's migration decisions, leading to long-term demographic change if people start avoiding high fire risk regions.

Evaluation mainly focuses on rainfall characteristics relevant to hydrological or agricultural applications: spatial distribution pattern, effect of aggregation over time, the capture of small-scale variability and seasonality, detection of dry spells and wet spells, and timing and volume of heavy rainfall events. Verification statistics were modified and metrics were reported for extreme weather performance, such as flood and drought monitoring. The analysis was performed for different rainfall categories, over regions dominated by different weather systems or with different topographical structures. The latest versions of seven commonly available, high-resolution rainfall estimates have been evaluated by the method against daily data from 16 rain gauge stations over Tanzania, during 1998-2006. They were TRMM 3B42, CHIRPS, TAMSAT, CMORPH_RAW, CMORPH_BLD, WFDEI_CRU, and CPCU. All products, except for CMORPH_BLD and CPCU, were poorly correlated to gauge data at daily time scale with correlation coefficients < 0.5. Five-day aggregation was the minimum time scale that can be used for the products to reach an accuracy better than monthly-mean of gauge data. Their performance varied across different climatic or topographical regions and different rainfall seasons. Timing of precipitation was inaccurately estimated by all products, particularly for heavy rains, with less than 40% hits. The results of the evaluation procedure allow discrimination between available products and better selection of the product to be used for a specific application, such as crop insurance or flood early warning, under particular climatic conditions.

To reduce related environmental and safety risks, rainfall and groundwater level research was carried out in Kyoto Prefecture with two rain gardens (RG1 and RG2) to investigate flood mitigation functions using a tank model. During the 134 days of monitoring from July 14, 2017, to November 25, 2017, RG1 had seven overflow events with an average runoff control ratio of 63.94%, and RG2 had one event with a ratio of 95.97%. The RG1 tank model (two stages) showed that initial storage for the first and second depths was 6.912 x 10(-11) and 0 mm, respectively. The heights of the discharge holes were 20.857 and 0.784 mm for the first stage and 0.659 mm for the second stage, and the discharge hole coefficients were 0.529 and 0.002 for the first stage and 0.004 for the second stage. The results showed that RG1 had penetration hole coefficients of 0.138 (first stage) and 0.254 (second stage), with a water balance error of 0.017 (< 0.02) and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.922, indicating better reliability and quality than RG2 with the one-stage tank model. Peak flow simulation for mitigation showed that RG1 had a high overflow control ratio (mitigation time 2 h for instant rainfall of 100 mm/h), and can therefore be considered appropriate for other urban areas of Japan.

The reason is twofold: On the one hand, climate change has increase rainfall frequency and intensity, while on the other, reckless urban expansion has increased exposure to such hazards over time. Italy is a country that is very vulnerable to flood and landslide hazard; the city of Genoa, which, in recent decades, has been frequently hit by severe floods, has risen to symbolize Italian geo-hydrological risk. Recent studies on Genoa's geo-hydrological hazard have focused on the analysis of hydro-geomorphological features of the Bisagno stream basin, yet their main focus was on hazard control. Very little research has been done to enhance the understanding of the source of risk in such catchments. This paper presents a study on the increased urban exposure and vulnerability to geo-hydrological hazard along the Bisagno stream catchment area over the last 200 years. Morphometric analyses were coupled with historical documents showing the evolution of the urban layout in this area. The results show that the "Bisagno Master Plan", a territorial planning strategy aimed at reducing geo-hydrological hazard and risk, has not produced the expected benefits. In spite of the plan, critical changes in land use and the hydrographic network, along with uncontrolled anthropization of the Genoa metropolitan area, has continued over the last two decades.

Sedimentation and glaciations during the Pleistocene: Palaeoclimate reconstruction in the Peshawar Basin, Pakistan	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						clay mineralogy; geochemistry; glaciation; Pakistan; Peshawar Basin; Pleistocene-Holocene	ASIAN MONSOON; INTERMONTANE-BASIN; ORGANIC-MATTER; CHEMICAL INDEX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NW HIMALAYA; SALT RANGE; HOLOCENE; EVOLUTION; AGGRADATION	The Pleistocene represents the youngest period of repeated widespread glaciation and interglacial intervals of both hemispheres. The Pleistocene-Holocene siliciclastics of the Peshawar Basin preserve a significant terrestrial record of palaeoclimatic fluctuations during this glacial time interval in northwest Pakistan at latitudes of 33-35 degrees N. The sedimentological evidences indicate that the lower part of the stratal package consists of floodplain clay cycles overlain by lacustrine-glaciofluvial rhythmites, that are followed by loess deposits and finally recent floodplain clays. The geochemical proxies demonstrate an overall cold-arid climate with very low intensity of chemical weathering, whereas the clay mineralogy and related indices suggest intensifying physical erosion. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) reflects comparatively slightly higher (but still very low) intensity of chemical weathering for the lowermost part of the succession and uppermost loess deposits. The illite-rich clay mineralogy of these two lithofacies associations also indicates the prevailing cold-arid palaeoclimate. The low CIA and smectite-rich clay mineralogy of the rhythmites, on the other hand, reflect deposition in poorly drained lakes. Multiple evidences for break-out floods and the presence of ice-rafted debris (IRD) within the rhythmites provide conclusive evidences for ice damming in the Peshawar Basin and drainage blockage due to the uplift of the Attock-Cherat Range. The floodplain clays indicate deposition in an interglacial semiarid-semihumid palaeoclimate preceding the Shanoz stage glaciation. The rhythmites correlate with the Shanoz, Yunz, and Borit Jheel glacial stages. The loess deposits indicate aeolian deposition in a cold, periglacial environment spanning over the late glacial maximum (LGM) interval.

Salinity and sodicity drastically reduce agricultural crop yields, damage farm equipment, jeopardize food security, and render soils unusable for agriculture. However, many farmers in developing semi-arid regions cannot afford expensive amendments to reclaim saline-sodic soils. Furthermore, existing research does not cover soil types (e.g., Luvisols and Lixisols) that are found in many semi-arid regions of South America. Therefore, we used percolation columns to evaluate the effect of inexpensive chemical and organic amendments (gypsum and cow manure) on the reclamation of saline-sodic soils in the northeast of Brazil. Soil samples from two layers (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm in depth) were collected and placed in percolation columns. Then, we applied gypsum into the columns, with and without cow manure. The experiment followed a complete randomized design with three replications. The chemical amendment treatments included a control and four combinations of gypsum and cow manure. Percolation columns were subjected to a constant flood layer of 55 mm. We evaluated the effectiveness of sodic soil reclamation treatments via changes in soil hydraulic conductivity, chemical composition (cations and anions), electrical conductivity of the saturated soil-paste extract, pH, and the exchangeable sodium percentage. These results suggest that the combined use of gypsum and cow manure is better to reduce soil sodicity, improve soil chemical properties, and increase water infiltration than gypsum alone. Cow manure at 40 ton ha(-1) was better than at 80 ton ha(-1) to reduce the sodium adsorption ratio.

This study investigates households' vulnerability to public health risks in disaster-prone areas of Pakistan. It uses a dataset of 600 households, based on structured questionnaire with household heads from two severely flood-affected districts (Nowshera and Charsadda) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Household vulnerability to flooding and related health problems are assessed through a logistic regression model. The results reveal that respondents' socio-economic and demographic attributes, such as age, gender, education, income, the materials out of which their house is constructed, past experience of floods and social networks are the key factors influencing their flood vulnerability. Households' health vulnerability is affected by their access to information and health facilities, their sanitary arrangements, distance from the main health facility and previous damage to water supply and health facilities from the flood in 2010. The findings suggest the need to overcome households' flood and health vulnerability through capacity building, training and sustainable mitigation efforts. At the governmental level, a comprehensive and realistic stakeholder analysis is needed to ensure the active involvement of all stakeholders, to generate their commitment and support and to identify what actions are most needed. Any actions to minimize household health risks will require an integrated, multi-sector, approach which would increase efficiency through pooling resources and skills.

When typhoons have approached, bridge foundations have been broken due to the insufficient bearing capacity of the bridge column. The bridge bottoming method involves rebuilding the lower structure while keeping the bridge surface open, and transferring the load of the bridge temporarily to the temporary support frame to remove the bridge base or damaged part with insufficient strength. This is followed by replacing the removed bridge base with a new bridge foundation that meets the requirements of flood and earthquake resistance. Meanwhile, monitoring plans should be coordinated during construction using the bottoming method to ensure the safety of the bridge. In the case of this study, the No. 3 line Wuxi Bridge had a maximum bridge age of 40 years, where the maximum exposed length of the foundation was up to 7.5 m, resulting in insufficient flood and earthquake resistance. Consequently, a reconstruction plan was carried out on this bridge. This study took the reconstruction of Wuxi Bridge as the object and established a finite element model using the SAP 2000 computer software based on the secondary reconstruction design of the Wuxi Bridge. The domestic bridge design specification was used as the basis for the static and dynamic analyses of the Wuxi Bridge model. As a result of the analysis, the management value of the monitoring instrument during construction was determined. The calculated management values were compared with the monitoring data during the construction period to determine the rationality of the management values and to explore changes in the behavior of the old bridges and temporary support bridges.

The Western-Euro-centric notions of science and scientific knowledge and technologies usually open opportunities to control natural processes with infrastructures to maximize economic benefits. Emphasis on short-term economic growth through the option of controlling or altering natural processes may hinder community resilience, referred as ability to resist, adapt with and recover from negative and devastating impacts of any natural process. Through employing oral history methodology in a case from Bangladesh, this article investigate the consequences of incorporating Western-Euro-centric scientific knowledge and traditional practices based on indigenous knowledge for managing water resources and resulted impacts on community flood resilience. In this case, to protect the lands from seasonal inundation, structural interventions were implemented and it resulted an environmental disaster, where cultivable lands and settlements got suffered from prolonged drainage congestion and water-logging problem. The problem was resulted due to some donor funded interventions on the river system since sixties with construction of polders/enclosures, utilizing Western-Euro-centric knowledge, which de-linked the floodplain wetlands from rivers. Whereas, indigenous approach of managing the tidal waves with temporary structures was scientifically proved its suitability to make those areas free from drainage congestion and water-logging problem. The article ends with a conclusion that, to get a resilient community, we need to combine the benefits of indigenous knowledge and modern technological solutions.

The growing need for resilience measurements motivates this research, measurements that reflect the complex, dynamic features of welfare among populations living in shock-prone contexts. It presents insights from three measurement approaches to explore the dynamic, intra-annual effects of shocks on household well-being, mediated by household characteristics; one based on shock persistence, one based on the stochastic distribution of well-being, and one driven by machine learning algorithms and based on predictive power. The insights gained from the comparison of measurement approaches offer a fuller understanding of the factors driving resilience than any single approach on its own. The paper harnesses a novel data-set from the 'Measuring Indicators for Resilience Analysis' project, which, each month, tracks shocks and food security indicators for one year in a highly food insecure population in Malawi. Across approaches, our study consistently finds that shocks and food insecurity are very persistent, and that households living in the flood plains are more resilient. When focusing on specific shocks such as illness, the gender of the household head matters as-well. A broader search for predictors of food insecurity using LASSO and. Random Forest algorithms uncovers other characteristics that affect resilience, such as the distance to drinking-water. The paper demonstrates how multiple complementary approaches can identify different but overlapping factors related to resilience, painting a fuller, richer picture. It also demonstrates the empirical benefits derived from using high-frequency data sets in the study of resilience. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The city had an extensive natural drainage system which has now lost its original form. This study investigated the blockages and their causes during the last two decades in one of the city's riverbeds-Malir. Moreover, the extent of floods identifying the vulnerability of the watershed's urban area after major rainfall events was modeled. The geospatial techniques and satellite images of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were used to analyze the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) of the Malir Basin. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model and topographic sheets of 1975 were utilized to delineate the natural drainage network and streambeds of the basin using geographical information system (GIS) tools. Historical rainfall data from 1985 to 2014 were acquired from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) to simulate runoff using the US Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS and HEC-GeoHMS). The flood modeling was done using the River Analysis System (HEC-RAS and GeoRAS). Rainfall-runoff simulations and flood extent and depth of five major rainfall events-1992, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2013-were modeled in this study. GIS overlay analysis combined the LULC, riverbed, and drainage line layers to identify the blocked area and to quantify the specific LULCs that were causing blockages in the riverbed. Several maps, which are prepared in this study, show the parts of the river with altered drainage patterns in 2013 from what existed back in 1975.

The analyses focus on the dominant mechanisms that modulate terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations and droughts. We find that (1) the model simulates the basin-averaged TWS variations remarkably well; however, disagreements are observed in spatial patterns of temporal trends, especially for the post-2008 period. (2) The 2010s is the driest period since 1980, characterized by a major shift in the decadal mean compared to the 2000s caused by increased drought frequency. (3) Long-term trends in TWS suggest that the Amazon overall is getting wetter (1.13 mm yr(-1)), but its southern and southeastern subbasins are undergoing significant negative TWS changes, caused primarily by intensified LULC changes. (4) Increasing divergence between dry-season total water deficit and TWS release suggests a strengthening dry season, especially in the southern and southeastern sub-basins. (5) The subsurface storage regulates the propagation of meteorological droughts into hydrological droughts by strongly modulating TWS release with respect to its storage preceding the drought condition. Our simulations provide crucial insight into the importance of sub-surface storage in alleviating surface water deficit across Amazon and open pathways for improving prediction and mitigation of extreme droughts under changing climate and increasing hydrologic alterations due to human activities (e.g., LULC change).

In Argentina, the geographic region known as the Pampa is at the heart of agricultural production. In this context, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the presence of long-term trends and abrupt changes in reference evapotranspiration (ETo PM) and associated climate variables in 30 weather stations of the Pampa over the 1984-2014 period. The presence of temporal trends was evaluated using Mann-Kendall's statistical test, whereas abrupt changes were detected through Pettitt test. Significant upward trends were observed in 80 and 43% of maximum temperature (Tmax) and ETo PM time series, whereas relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (WS), in contrast, presented decreasing trends in 57 and 47% of the locations. Abrupt changes were frequently observed in the years 2000-2003 for Tmax, RH, and ETo PM time series, a period that coincides with the occurrence of flooding events in the region. Weather stations of the Pampa region could be divided into two broad categories based on their trends in ETo PM and influencing climate variables: (A) stations exhibiting a rising trend in ETo PM and a concomitant decreasing trend in RH and (B) stations presenting invariant ETo PM and a decreasing trend in WS. The spatial distribution of the two categories of stations did not exhibit any specific geographic pattern. The information provided herein on modern trends in climate and evaporative demand is essential to the development of climate models and future scenarios necessary to evaluate food security prospects both regionally and globally.

In this study, an enhanced inundation method (EIM) for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale is proposed. EIM can be easily coupled with urban hydrological models and the coupled framework can consider both source flooding and non-source flooding in floodwater generation. In EIM, the floodwater spreading order in the positive process is based on the topological relationship between depression outlets; the floodwater from lower depression elements is considered as a feedback process. These improvements make this proposed method suitable for inundation estimation in large urban catchments. Dahongmen (DHM) catchment in Beijing, China was selected as the case study area to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Historical inundation records during one heavy storm were applied to test the performance of the method. EIM is compared with USISM (urban storm-inundation simulation method) on the flood hazard map in the DHM catchment, which reveals the effectiveness of the improvements. The results show that all inundation locations are successfully identified by EIM and are distributed in flooding areas (water depth greater than 0.15 m) in the catchment. The average relative error of simulated inundation depths is 15%, which indicates that EIM can successfully simulate flooding scopes and depths in the study area. The results revealed that EIM can be a valuable tool for mapping urban flood hazards at the large catchment scale based on GIS techniques.

Within the Mesopotamia, Corrientes Province is particularly attractive due toits current vegetation and geomorphological characteristics where the Eastern-Northwestern migration of the Parana River has played an important role. This migration in turn, allowed the sedimentation of the main geological units in the Pliocene-Pleistocene interval. The outcrops of the Ituzaingo (Pliocene) and Toropi/Yupoi (late Pleistocene) formations are widely distributed in Corrientes, and include numerous fossil remains of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (mainly mammals). Despite the paleontological and stratigraphic studies carried out, the data are still insufficient to reconstruct how the environments varied and how the migration of the Parana River could have affected the vegetation during the last part of the Cenozoic. In this contribution, the first detailed study of the phytolith assemblages is accomplished, characterizing the Ituzaingo and Toropi/Yupoi formations in order to infer the palaeoclimatic and vegetation changes during the late Cenozoic in this area of the Mesopotamian region. Four sampling localities (BV1, BV2, E1, and E2) were selected in two sites (Bella Vista and Empedrado). The recovered associations were useful for environmental reconstructions. Both formations are fluvial deposits related at different times to the current Parana River. The phytolith assemblages of the Ituzaingo Fm. evidence the different ways in which the biosilica elements were affected by pre and post-depositional processes. The Toropi/Yupoi Fm. shows well-preserved assemblages that suggest heterogeneous vegetation communities, with wetlands and grasslands to savannas and forests on the floodplain environments under seasonal subtropical climates.

Growth performance of <i>Labeo bata</i> (Hamilton, 1822) in freshwater and its acclimatization in brackish water with betaine as feed additive	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Labeo bata; Betaine; Feed; Growth; Salinity; Toxicity; Resistance	CYPRINUS-CARPIO; LARVAL GROWTH; STRIPED BASS; COMMON CARP; SEA-WATER; FISH-MEAL; ADAPTATION; SALINITY; SURVIVAL; ATTRACTANT	Climate change is one of the major causes of coastal flood and tropical cyclone which results in salinity changes in large scale coastal area. Salinity affects survival and growth of many aquatic organisms and causes stress of freshwater fish affecting fisheries in various parts of the world. However, incorporation of 'Betaine'in the supplementary feed may be way out for freshwater fish species grown in saline environment In this study, the experiments were conducted with Labeo bata, a freshwater fish species with two feeds, T0 (non-betaine feed) and T1 (betaine added feed) in three phases: (i) growth study for 50 days in freshwater, (ii) toxicity test on salinity for 96 h, with loss of body weight and muscle tissue water, and (iii) salinity resistance test for 12 days in gradually increasing salinities @ 1.0 ppt day(-1). Results showed that growth rate (%) was significantly (P(<)0.05) higher in betaine fed fish (16.79 +/- 0.84-27.91 +/- 3.33) as compared to non-betaine fed fish (13.58 +/- 1.25-15.36 +/- 0.29) throughout the experimental period. Betaine fed fish showed no mortality even at 12 ppt after 96 h exposure whereas all non-betaine fed fish showed 100% mortality within 24 h at 12 ppt. Over all, non-betaine fed fish lost 10.3% higher amount of water in muscle tissue as compared to that in betaine fed fish while grown in saline condition. The beneficial effect of betaine as feed additive described in this study may encourage farmers to culture L. bata up to 12 ppt.	[Ghosh, T. K.; Chauhan, Y.

The Bias-Detecting Ensemble: A New and Efficient Technique for Dynamically Incorporating Observations Into Physics-Based, Multilayer Snow Models	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							HYDROLOGICAL DATA ASSIMILATION; LAND-SURFACE MODEL; WATER EQUIVALENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; KALMAN FILTER; PRECIPITATION; FORECASTS; EVENTS; ENERGY; FLOOD	The reliance on distributed energy- and mass-balance snow models as runoff forecasting tools has been increasing. Compared to traditional, conceptual forecasting approaches, these physics-based tools are robust to conditions that deviate from historic norms and offer improved performance in potentially dangerous rain-on-snow events. The physics-based simulations, however, depend on a large suite of accurate forcing data. Current numerical weather prediction products are capable of supplying the full range of required data, but systematic biases are often present. Data assimilation presents a means of compensating for such errors as well as potential snow model errors, yet currently available data assimilation techniques have limited usefulness in these snow models. This study introduced an alternative technique that similarly uses observations to update and improve simulations. As such, it is the first method to incorporate point snow observations in a fully distributed, physics-based, multilayer snow model while conserving mass and maintaining physically consistent layer states that are in accord with observations. At the core of this technique is an ensemble of predetermined perturbations to the model forcings termed the bias-detecting ensemble. Ensemble members were evaluated using observed snow depths to ascertain potential biases at nearly 300 sites across Switzerland. The bias assessments were distributed to 38 independent sites and incorporated into the model. Tests were conducted over three winter seasons using two numerical weather prediction-based products with varying quality. Averaged across the 38 sites and 3 seasons, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency score for bias-detecting ensemble-corrected snow depth was 0.98 compared to 0.81 without the bias-detecting ensemble method.

J	Leahy, CP; Gay, C				Leahy, Carla Pascoe; Gay, Catherine			Care and crisis: disaster experiences of Australian parents since 1974	HISTORY OF THE FAMILY			English	Article						Australian history; oral history; disaster; parent; mother; father	AFTERMATH; CHILDREN; YOUTH; HOUSE	The historical influence of environmental factors on families has received relatively little scholarly attention. In this article we explore the impact of the 'natural' or 'more-than-human' world on Australian families through one of the most powerful examples of environmental influence: disasters. We take three case studies as our focus: Cyclone Tracy (1974), the 2011 Queensland Floods and the 2019-20 Black Summer Fires. Our primary source materials are oral history interviews with Australian parents, some of which are archived interviews in cultural collections and some of which are contemporary interviews newly-created for this research. Through these case studies spanning half a century, we analyse change and continuity in the ways in which disasters have been experienced and remembered by Australian parents. While parents consistently shoulder an additional burden during disaster by caring for children, the ways they do so are distinctly gendered and have remained so across time. But as disasters increase in frequency, ferocity and severity in an era of climate change, the way parents understand, respond and prepare for environmental crises is shifting. Australian parents increasingly see their childrearing duties as encompassing consideration of extreme weather in locating or renovating a family home, practicing evacuation drills, and anticipating potential disasters in planning family holidays. Awareness of climate risks is even influencing reproductive decisions about family size or whether to become a parent. We hypothesise that shifts in individual parent's disaster experiences may be collectively changing Australian cultural ideals of 'good' parenthood in the twenty-first century. Research conducted at the intersection of the history of the family and environmental history is becoming urgently significant in the present-day, as we seek to make sense of rapid environmental change and its personal and cultural impacts on our human lives.

J	Wang, MM; Li, M; Sweetapple, C				Wang, Mingming; Li, Min; Sweetapple, Chris			A new framework for distributed storage tanks placement based on a resilience characteristic metric and reduced modelling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Urban flooding; Resilience; Placement; Distributed storage tanks; Urban drainage system	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; OPTIMAL LOCATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN AREAS	In recent years, urban flooding has been a frequent occurrence, and seriously threatens the safety of lives and properties. Rational placement of distributed storage tanks is one of the effective ways to solve urban flooding, addressing stormwater management and rainwater reuse. However, existing optimization methods (such as genetic algorithm (GA) and other evolutionary algorithms) for determining the placement of storage tanks typically have a high computational burden; as such, they can be very time-consuming, and are not conducive to energy saving, carbon reduction and work efficiency improvements. In this study, a new approach and framework based on a resilience characteristic metric (RCM) and reduced modelling requirements are proposed. In this framework, the resilience characteristic metric, which is based on the linear superposition principle of system resilience metadata, is introduced, and a small number of simulations based on a coupling of MATLAB with SWMM are used to obtain the final placement scheme of storage tanks. The framework is demonstrated and verified with two cases in Beijing and Chizhou, China, and compared with a GA. The GA requires 2000 simulations for two cases (considering the placement of 2 and 6 tanks respectively), while the proposed method needs 44 simulations for the Beijing case and 89 simulations for the Chizhou case. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective, and cannot only obtain a relative better placement scheme, but also considerably reduce computational time and energy consumption. It significantly improves the efficiency of determining the placement scheme of storage tanks. This method provides a new approach for the determining better storage tank placement schemes, and is useful for informing device placement in sustainable drainage systems.

NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							DUAL-POLARIZATION RADAR; PARTIAL BEAM BLOCKAGE; FLASH-FLOOD; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; POLARIMETRIC-RADAR; RAINFALL MEASUREMENT; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEATHER RADAR; ATTENUATION	The disastrous July 2021 flooding event made us question the ability of current hydrometeorological tools in providing timely and reliable flood forecasts for unprecedented events. This is an urgent concern since extreme events are increasing due to global warming, and existing methods are usually limited to more frequently observed events with the usual flood generation processes. For the July 2021 event, we simulated the hourlystreamflows of seven catchments located in western Germany by combiningseven partly polarimetric, radar-based quantitative precipitation estimates(QPEs) with two hydrological models: a conceptual lumped model (GR4H) and aphysically based, 3D distributed model (ParFlowCLM). GR4H parameters werecalibrated with an emphasis on high flows using historical dischargeobservations, whereas ParFlowCLM parameters were estimated based onlandscape and soil properties. The key results are as follows. (1) With nocorrection of the vertical profiles of radar variables, radar-based QPEproducts underestimated the total precipitation depth relative to raingauges due to intense collision-coalescence processes near the surface, i.e., below the height levels monitored by the radars. (2) Correcting the vertical profiles of radar variables led to substantial improvements. (3) The probability of exceeding the highest measured peak flow before July 2021 was highly impacted by the QPE product, and this impact depended on the catchment for both models. (4) The estimation of model parameters had alarger impact than the choice of QPE product, but simulated peak flows ofParFlowCLM agreed with those of GR4H for five of the seven catchments. Thisstudy highlights the need for the correction of vertical profiles ofreflectivity and other polarimetric variables near the surface to improveradar-based QPEs for extreme flooding events. It also underlines the largeuncertainty in peak flow estimates due to model parameter estimation.

J	Li, XL; Zhang, J; Gao, JY				Li, Xilai; Zhang, Jing; Gao, Jay			A Topographic Perspective on the Propensity for Degradation of Plateau Swampy Meadows in Maduo County, West China	LAND			English	Article						swampy meadow type; degradation propensity; severity assessment; topographic influence; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	QINGHAI-TIBET PLATEAU; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; ALPINE WETLANDS; VEGETATION	The swampy meadows atop the vast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in West China fall into alpine, pediment, valley, floodplain, terrace, lacustrine, and riverine types according to their hydro-geomorphic properties. They have suffered degradation to various levels of severity due to climate change and external disturbance. In this paper, we studied the propensity of these types of swampy meadows to degrade from the topographic perspective. Evaluated against four degradation indicators of vegetation, hydrology, soil erosion, and pika (Ochotona curzoniae) damage, degradation severity at 106 swampy meadows representing all types of wetlands was graded to one of four levels, from which the field-based propensity to degrade (PtD) index value was derived. Judged against this index, terrace and alpine swampy meadows are the most prone to degradation while valley, lacustrine, and riverine swampy meadows are the least. The index value of a given swampy meadow type bears a close relationship (R-2 = 0.916) with its rate of change during 1990-2013, which confirms the validity of the proposed index in predicting the propensity of swampy meadows to change. The observed differential PtD of different types of swampy meadows is attributed primarily to elevation (R-2 = 0.746; p = 0.027) and, secondarily, to surface morphology (R-2 = 0.696; p = 0.039). Thus, the elevation at which a swampy meadow is situated is a more important factor to its PtD than its surface morphology. In particular, swampy meadows located at a higher elevation with a convex surface are much more prone to degradation than those at a lower elevation of a concave slope. Such findings can guide the proper management of different types of swampy meadows to achieve sustainable animal husbandry.

Seasonal and Spatial Variations of Dissolved Organic Matter Biodegradation along the Aquatic Continuum in the Southern Taiga Bog Complex, Western Siberia	WATER			English	Article						organic carbon; biodegradation; incubation; forest; river; mire; stream; soil water; peatland	MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON; WATERS; BIOAVAILABILITY; DEGRADATION; PEATLAND; SUNLIGHT; ABSORBENCY; CATCHMENT	The inland aquatic ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, owing to the metabolism of terrestrially derived organic matter as it moves through fluvial networks along the water continuum. During this transport, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is microbial processed and released into the atmosphere, but the degree and intensity of this processing vary greatly both spatially and temporally. The Western Siberian Lowlands is of particular interest for a quantitative assessment of DOM biodegradation potential because the global areal-scale effects of DOM biodegradation in abundant surface organic-rich waters might be the highest in this region. To this end, we collected water samples along a typical aquatic continuum of the Bakchar Bog (the north-eastern part of the Great Vasyugan Mire) and, following standardized protocol, conducted an experimental study aimed at characterizing the seasonal and spatial variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biodegradability. The biodegradable DOC fraction (BDOC) over the exposure incubation period ranged from 2% to 25%. The natural aquatic continuum "mire-forest-stream-river" demonstrated the systematic evolution of biodegradable DOC among the sites and across the seasons. The highest biodegradation rates were measured during spring flood in May and decreased along the continuum. The maximum possible CO2 production from DOM yielded the maximum possible flux in the range of 0.1 and 0.2 g C-CO2 m(-2) day(-1) d, which is an order of magnitude lower than the actual net CO2 emissions from the inland waters of the WSL. This study suggests that although the biodegradation of the humic waters of the WSL can sizably modify the concentration and nature of the DOM along the aquatic continuum, it plays only a subordinary role in overall C emissions from the lakes and rivers of the region.

J	Li, XX; Qin, XC; Yang, J; Zhang, YZ				Li, Xiangxiang; Qin, Xiaochen; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Yizhi			Evaluation of ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA55 and MERRA2 reanalysis precipitation datasets over the Poyang Lake Basin in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						evaluation; Poyang Lake Basin; precipitation; reanalysis datasets	GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; INTERPOLATION; RIVER	Increasing variability of precipitation induced by climate change raises uncertainties for ecosystem services and agricultural production in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), China. Reanalysis precipitation datasets (RPDs) are attractive alternatives for monitoring the hydro-climate cycles. However, their applicability in China has mainly been evaluated at the national scale, while less attention has been paid to the PLB or southeastern China. Here, we apply various metrics to evaluate the magnitude and spatial similarity of annual, monthly, different intensities and the spatial structure of precipitation from four reanalysis-the fifth global atmospheric analysis dataset of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (ERA5), Interim ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis project (JRA55) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), against the rain-gauges over the PLB during 1980-2018. The results showed that the detection capacity of ERA5 and MERRA2 shifted around 2002, whereas that of ERA-Interim and JRA55 did not substantially change. Before 2002, ERA-Interim had the lowest biases for the magnitude of annual, monthly and different intensities of precipitation (except for heavy rain), while ERA5 and MERRA2 had strengths in capturing spatial correlation. Notably, ERA5 and MERRA2 had region-wide wet and dry biases, respectively, before 2002, which can be attributed mainly to the estimation of flood season precipitation (from April to June) and heavy rain. In contrast, the fractional contribution of light-moderate rain was underestimated and overestimated by ERA5 and MERRA2, respectively. However, after 2002, because of the improved reproducibility of flood season precipitation and heavy rain magnitude, the systematic biases of ERA5 and MERRA2 significantly decreased, especially for ERA5, which outperformed other RPDs on all aspects of precipitation. The conclusions of this paper suggest that the variation of applicability over time should be seriously tested before the utilization of RPDs in hydro-climate analyses.

When the imperative of urban economic and spatial growth is taken as a given, the mechanisms that perpetuate it remain unexplored and unquestioned. Lack of attention to such mechanisms, and specifically the politics of urban land use, can lead to ineffective planning and maladaptation. In this review, we explore the intersection of scholarship on urban climate adaptation governance and the political economy of urban development to identify the specific contemporary mechanisms that perpetuate uneven patterns of urban vulnerability and undermine adaptation planning. We are guided by three questions: What are the mechanisms that urban managers employ to assign rights and responsibilities to land, and thus allocate spatial exposure to risk? How is land implicated in cities' efforts to finance themselves and their activities, and what are the implications for adaptation? What mechanisms enable urban actors to protect themselves from risk and respond to uncertainty? We emphasize the need to place urban climate governance within the broader political dynamics of urban development for more effective, equitable and ultimately sustainable vulnerability interventions. We find that instruments of urban development are often supporting the prioritization of economic rewards over equitable and just distribution of risk and rights to adaptation benefits. We conclude by highlighting the "uncomfortable knowledge" that if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved, the mechanisms of urban development and associated actors that shape, steer and utilize these instruments for a variety of means and goals, must be made visible and addressed.

Predicting and analyzing these landscape pattern changes are important in the early stages of urban planning. In practice, the threshold for obtaining comprehensive and detailed hydrological and meteorological data is high, which makes it difficult for landscape and urban planners to quickly evaluate urban floods. To compensate for these trends, we took Nanjing, China, as the study site and discussed the leading flood vulnerability landscape patterns based on quantitative assessments. We introduced catastrophe theory to integrate three indicators and seven subfactors for flood vulnerability assessment: exposure, including precipitation; sensitivity, including elevation, slope, soil and drainage density; and adaptability, including land use and forest coverage. Then, we calculated the landscape pattern metrics (shape index, fractal dimension index, related circumscribing circle, contiguity index and landscape division index) at the class level. Finally, we divided the city into four subregions, established regression models for the subregions and the whole city, and deduced the leading flood vulnerability landscape patterns in each region and the whole city. We found that the leading landscape patterns varied among different regions. According to the research results, the landscape pattern indexes identified in this paper can be interpreted intuitively, which can provide a reference for modifying the planning layout of regional green infrastructure, optimizing the vulnerability of urban floods, and providing a basis for further improving Nanjing urban planning and alleviating the urban flood vulnerability. The methods proposed herein also will benefit land use and green infrastructure management in other regions lacking meteorological and hydrological data.

Such influences may drive non-linear shifts in surface re-sponses that require long-term monitoring approaches for their study. Here, we used a piece-wise regression model to characterize long-term Ecosystem Change Types (ECT) in the surface water and vegetation dynamics of the Inner Niger Delta wetlands in Mali between 2000 and 2019. We also examined the added benefits of using a dense Landsat time series for such segmented trend analysis in comparison with MODIS products that are regularly used for ecosystem trends assessment. Our approach has found statistically significant (p < 0.05) long-term changes in wetland ecosystems, as calculated from Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image series on both the MODIS and the Landsat scales. The class-specific accuracies of the detected ECTs were evaluated through the validation of temporal trajectories based on the TimeSync logic at selected probability sample locations. Results showed higher user's, producer's, and overall accuracies (OA) when using a dense Landsat time series (OA = 0.89 +/- 0.01), outperforming the MOD09A1 time series (OA = 0.37 +/- 0.03). Our study provides a robust framework for long-term wetland monitoring that demonstrates the benefits of applying dense Landsat time-series imagery for accurate quanti-fications of linear and non-linear ecosystem responses in vast highly dynamic floodplain systems. Delivering such an improved assessment, in a spatial resolution that better resolves the characteristics of wetlands ecosystems, has the potential to support the information needs of global conservation and restoration efforts.

Using results from a calibrated, tracer-aided ecohydrological model (EcH(2)O-iso) we analyzed the dynamics of storage-flux-age-response time (RT) interactions at scales that resolve the internal heterogeneity of these non-stationary relationships. EcH(2)O-iso has previously shown an adequate representation of ecohydrological flux partitioning and storage dynamics (celerity), and water ages (velocity) over 11-year at Demnitzer Millcreek catchment (DMC, 66 km(2)), a drought-sensitive, lowland catchment in Germany. The 11-year period had marked hydroclimatic contrasts facilitating the evaluation of flux-storage-age-RT dynamics under different wetness anomalies. Our results show that the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture and ecohydrological partitioning dynamics reflect both land use (especially forest cover) and distinct soil units (i.e., brown earth vs. podzolic soils). Spatial differences in RTs of storage were driven by rapid soil evaporation and transpiration responses to rainfall, which revealed a divergence of transpiration ages from RTs. RTs of groundwater and streamflow were fast (days), but mediation by soil water storage dynamics caused marked separation from water ages (years-decades) of deeper flow paths. Analysis of RTs and ages revealed a degradation of process representation with coarsening model spatial resolution. This study uses novel analysis of the spatio-temporal interactions of flux-storage-age-RT from a model to understand the sensitivity and resilience of catchment functionality to hydroclimatic perturbations.

Predicting flood damage probability across the conterminous United States	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						flood damage; hazards; machine learning; random forest; CONUS; geospatial	RANDOM-FOREST; SUSCEPTIBILITY; CLASSIFICATION; MODELS; SCALE; RISK	Floods are the leading cause of natural disaster damages in the United States, with billions of dollars incurred every year in the form of government payouts, property damages, and agricultural losses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency oversees the delineation of floodplains to mitigate damages, but disparities exist between locations designated as high risk and where flood damages occur due to land use and climate changes and incomplete floodplain mapping. We harnessed publicly available geospatial datasets and random forest algorithms to analyze the spatial distribution and underlying drivers of flood damage probability (FDP) caused by excessive rainfall and overflowing water bodies across the conterminous United States. From this, we produced the first spatially complete map of FDP for the nation, along with spatially explicit standard errors for four selected cities. We trained models using the locations of historical reported flood damage events (n = 71 434) and a suite of geospatial predictors (e.g. flood severity, climate, socio-economic exposure, topographic variables, soil properties, and hydrologic characteristics). We developed independent models for each hydrologic unit code level 2 watershed and generated a FDP for each 100 m pixel. Our model classified damage or no damage with an average area under the curve accuracy of 0.75; however, model performance varied by environmental conditions, with certain land cover classes (e.g. forest) resulting in higher error rates than others (e.g. wetlands). Our results identified FDP hotspots across multiple spatial and regional scales, with high probabilities common in both inland and coastal regions. The highest flood damage probabilities tended to be in areas of low elevation, in close proximity to streams, with extreme precipitation, and with high urban road density. Given rapid environmental changes, our study demonstrates an efficient approach for updating FDP estimates across the nation.

In many water-scarce parts of the world, where centralized wastewater treatment is not accessible or practical, decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATSs) have the potential to supply the water needed for irrigating UGSs. Here, we first review UGS systems supported by DEWATSs and the water quality guidelines and challenges associated with implementing DEWATSs for urban greening in different countries, including Mexico. We also critically examine the linkages between the lack of UGSs in Tijuana, Mexico, extensive soil erosion, and failing sanitation infrastructure that has led to the infamously poor water quality in the Tijuana River. Tijuana's Ecoparque Wastewater Treatment Facility, a low-energy, aerobic DEWATS, which collects, treats, and discharges residential sewage for localized landscape irrigation, demonstrates how DEWATSs can meet the water demands for urban greening in rapidly urbanizing cities. The aerobic decentralized treatment using a gravity-fed trickling biofilter resulted in a >85% removal of chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon. Prior to treatment facility upgrades, there was a ~2 log reduction in total coliform and Escherichia coli and a <20% decrease in ammonia from the influent to final effluent. After the addition of a maturation pond in 2020, the effluent met Mexico standards for irrigation reuse, with a ~4 log reduction in fecal coliforms from the influent to final effluent. Case study results demonstrated the potential for decentralized wastewater treatment to meet effluent standards for landscape irrigation, provide water for urban greening, and prevent pollution in the Tijuana River and other urban waterways.

J	Alhassan, AB; Aljahdali, MO				Alhassan, Abdullahi Bala; Aljahdali, Mohammed Othman			Nutrient and physicochemical properties as potential causes of stress in mangroves of the central Red Sea	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AVICENNIA-MARINA; BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS; ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GREY MANGROVE; SALT STRESS; NITROGEN; GROWTH; CARBON; PLANT	Mangrove ecosystems are some of the most productive and important sinks for sediment globally. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in possible causes of stress in mangroves, such as nutrient limitation, high salinity, solar radiation and temperature. We measured different factors casing stress and determined how they influenced oxidative stress and growth biomarkers in six study sites dominated by mangroves; Al Lith, South Jeddah, Dahban, Thuwal, Rabigh and Mastorah. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were recorded in water salinities and temperatures, nitrogen and phosphorus content in sediments, and antioxidant enzyme activities in different study sites. The highest salinity (40.75 parts per thousand) and temperature (29.32 degrees C) were recorded in the Rabigh mangrove stand, which corresponds to the lowest dissolved oxygen (5.21 mg/L). Total organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus in sediment across the study areas were in the order Rabigh>Thuwal>Dahban> Al Lith>South Jeddah>Mastorah. Total nitrogen in mangrove leaves at Rabigh was the highest and about 1.3 times higher than the total nitrogen in South Jeddah mangrove ecosystem, very different from the ratio of total nitrogen in the sediments at Rabigh and South Jeddah mangrove ecosystems. The average values of delta C-13 (-17.60 parts per thousand) and delta N-15 (2.84 parts per thousand) in the six mangrove ecosystems, and the highest delta C-13 (-13.62 parts per thousand) and delta N-15 (4.39 parts per thousand) at Rabigh in the sediments suggest that nutrient input differed among study sites. Higher nutrient levels at Rabigh mangrove ecosystem were attributed to restricted circulation, camel grazing and land runoff with agricultural waste during seasonal flooding events. However, N limitation and possibly salinity contributed to stress in Al Lith, South Jeddah, Dahban, Thuwal, Rabigh, and Mastorah mangrove ecosystems. Salinity (r = 0.9012) contribute more to stress at Rabigh.

Thus, precipitation monitoring and the evaluation of its variability have become fundamentally important actions through the analysis of long-term data records. In particular, satellite-based precipitation products are often used because they counterbalance the sparsity of the rain gauge networks which often characterize these areas. The aim of this work is to compare and contrast the capabilities of three daily satellite-based products in EA and SA from 1983 to 2017. The selected products are two daily rainfall datasets based on high-resolution thermal infrared observations, TAMSAT version 3 and CHIRPS, and a relatively new global product, MSWEP version 2.2, which merges satellite-based, rain gauge and re-analysis precipitation data. The datasets have been directly intercompared, avoiding the traditional rain gauge validation. This is done by means of pairwise comparison statistics at 0.25 & DEG; spatial resolution and daily time scale to assess rain-detection and quantitative estimate capabilities. Monthly climatology and spatial distribution of seasonality are analyzed as well. The time evolution of the statistical indexes has been evaluated in order to analyze the stability of the rain detection and estimation performances. Considerable agreement among the precipitation products emerged from the analysis, in spite of the differences occurring in specific situations over complex terrain, such as mountainous and coastal regions and deserts. Moreover, the temporal evolution of the statistical indices has demonstrated that the agreement between the products improved over time, with more stable capabilities in identifying precipitating days and estimating daily precipitation starting in the second half of the 1990s.

Flood losses in the developing countries throughout the Belt and Road region are more than twice the global average. However, to date, the extent of the vulnerability of the Belt and Road region remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study sought to address this knowledge gap. In this study, we presented a vulnerability assessment model based on triangular fuzzy number-based analytic hierarchy process (TFN-AHP) and support vector machine (SVM) model. Firstly, a geospatial database including 11 flood conditioning factors was built. Secondly, the exposure and disaster reduction capability were calculated based on TFN-AHP and SVM, respectively. Finally, the spatial distribution of vulnerability throughout the Belt and Road region was generated. According to the results, the exposure and disaster reduction capability in most areas are extremely low, accounting for 86.45% and 80.53%, respectively. Meanwhile, the vulnerability of 47,105,300 km(2) areas is low or extremely low, accounting for 93% of the Belt and Road region. The high-vulnerable areas (accounting for 3.54%) are primarily concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of China, northern India, most areas of Bangladesh, the Indus Valley in Pakistan, the Nile River Basin in Egypt, and the central region of Indonesia. Obviously, these regions with high vulnerability are characterized by frequent economic activities and dense populations. As suggested of these results, this study provides scientific and technological evidence for the prevention and mitigation of flood disasters in the countries along the Belt and Road region.

Top ten areas, called ELIGES (Spanish acronym for Areas with Geosites for Environmental Education in the city of Segovia, Spain), have been selected from the 94 geosites previously identified for this city. The assessment method was developed specifically with the idea of using geoheritage for environmental education and geotourism at the local level. The assessment criteria used were (1) Value for environmental education (Ved); (2) Scientific value (Vsc); (3) Tourism value (Vtr); (4) Safety and accessibility (Vsa); (5) Conservation and site sustainability (Vcs) and (6) Value of the geosite's environmental information for geotourism (Vti). These criteria have been assessed for the 94 geosites in the city of Segovia, each of which in turn includes four subcriteria to minimise subjectivity in the decision-making process. Environmental challenges transmitted by the ELIGES are global change and climate change (sea level, temperature changes and extreme storms), geohazards (mainly floods, landslides and rockfalls), groundwater contamination, extinction of species, impacts caused by the exploitation of raw materials, degradation of rocks by pollution in monuments, the harmful and damaging effects of naturally occurring radon on human health and recommendations for collecting and trading movable geological heritage. Understanding the city's geological past and present through environmental education and geotourism using ELIGES makes all stakeholders more resilient when tackling important issues in our society such as global change and its effects on the urban ecosystem and people.

Quantifying the degree and duration of flood impact to urban systems under extreme rainstorms is essential for long-term flood risk management and short-term emergency response. This study aims to develop a novel stress testing framework for evaluating urban system flooding upon extreme rainstorms in Hong Kong. The stress testing framework is based on a pipe-surface coupled hydraulic model for detailed flood simulation in urban settings and a dynamic flood impact evaluation method for assessing interruptions to urban transportation and building systems. The proposed stress testing method is applied to assess the flood impacts in Kowloon, the most densely populated area in Hong Kong. Detailed urban settings such as engineering drainage facilities and buildings are incorporated into the flood simulation model, and the model is validated both qualitatively and quantitatively by field observations. Flood hazard scenarios are investigated under design rainstorms of different return periods (20, 100, and 1000 years), and the impacts on transportation and building systems are evaluated with the new process-based impact evaluation method. The results of the case study indicate that underground mass transit railway (MTR) stations and residential buildings will be more affected than highways and other types of buildings in Kowloon: up to 56% of MTR stations and 43% of residential buildings may be affected under the 1000-year rainstorm, with inundation durations of 8 and 7 h for the MTR stations and residential buildings, respectively. To ensure public transportation services and reduce potential exposure of residents during extreme rainstorms, mitigation measures should be taken to reduce the affected percentage and duration of MTR stations and residential buildings. The proposed methods contribute to enhanced societal flood preparedness, warning, and response.

The traditional disaster alleviation strategies have gradually expanded to non-engineering disaster reduction strategies. As urban public property, public facility is more available than private land, making it the preferred strategy of site selection for urban land flood diversion. However, due to the limited government finance, how to select public facilities as the multi-use detention basin to maximize the disaster reduction and external benefits is an issue that needs to be considered before planning and decision-making. This study builds an operable decision model of site selection of urban public facilities as multi-use detention basin from the perspective of environmental efficiency. The decision model analyzes the expected costs and benefits of the multi-use detention basin based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) and cross-efficiency analysis, so as to establish the optimal combination of alternative schemes of site selection. It further compares with the traditional detention basin considering only disaster reduction efficiency to summarize how to improve the strategy of selecting multi-use detention basin site within the watershed in the future. This paper uses the watershed of Dajiaxi as a case study, and finds that (I) there is a certain trade-off relationship between the optimized schemes established from the perspective of environmental efficiency and disaster reduction efficiency evaluation. The scheme with the highest disaster reduction efficiency does not necessarily increase the external benefit significantly; (II) for the inefficient schemes, the difference between the site selection schemes and the ideal efficiency value can be measured through slack variable analysis.

Seasonal migration to seek refuge from floodwaters represents a central adaptation strategy, but may entail risky navigation of anthropogenic spaces in heterogeneous landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the opportunities and constraints large-bodied mammalian herbivores face during an adaptive response of obligatory flood-driven refuge migration, across a human-dominated environment. Our study system, centred around a productive protected area--Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Northeast India-on the floodplains of the Brahmaputra River, is home to an abundance of large herbivores that undertake seasonal migrations in response to floods. We contrast species distribution data during a major flood event with those from the dry season to illustrate season-specific movement and space use decisions of large herbivores ranging in body mass from the 3000-kg Asian elephant Elephas maximus to the 20-kg muntjac Muntiacus muntjak. In the dry season, most large herbivores--a majority of which are endangered and threatened by anthropogenic pressures--avoided areas with a strong human footprint, while preferring spaces with high land-use diversity. During the floods, such species were pushed out of inundated habitats within the protected area, and they chose tomove through woodlands and areas under bamboo cover on private lands, as they migrated to forested refugia on higher ground. Our results showhowseasonal environmental constraints shaped by floods determine the internal motivation of animals to risk traversing a human-dominated space to seek refuge, which contextually defines how animals view and navigate the landscape. Such insights underscore the importance of dynamic and adaptive planning, and participatory conservation efforts, to facilitate connectivity in the changing environment and climate of the present Anthropocene.

This work focuses on future changes in mean and extreme climate of the YRB for the near-term (2021-2040), mid-term (2041-2060), and far-term (2081-2100) future, and assesses these with respect to the reference period (1986-2005) using the latest REgional MOdel (REMO) simulations, driven by three global climate models (GCMs) and assuming historical and future [Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5] forcing scenarios, over the CORDEX East Asia domain at 0.22 degrees horizontal resolution. The results show that REMO reproduces the historical mean climate state and selected extreme climate indices reasonably well, although some cold and wet biases exist. Increases in mean temperature are strongest for the far-term in winter, with an average increase of 5.6 degrees C under RCP 8.5. As expected, the future temperatures of the warmest day (TXx) and coldest night (TNn) increase and the number of frost days (FD) declines considerably. Changes to mean temperature and FD depend on elevation, which could be explained by the snow-albedo feedback. A substantial increase in precipitation (34%) occurs in winter under RCP 8.5 for the far-term. Interannual variability in precipitation is projected to increase, indicating a future climate with more extreme events compared to that of today. Future daily precipitation intensity and maximum 5-day precipitation would increase and the number of consecutive dry days would decline under RCP 8.5. The results highlight that pronounced warming at high altitudes and more intense rainfall could cause increased future flood risk in the YRB, if a high GHG emission pathway is realized.

In the present study, 20 herbaceous species that naturally occur in habitats with infrequent and periodic inundation were mix-planted in hydrology-induced and disturbed revetments along the mainstream of the Yangtze River in the typical mountain city of Chongqing, China. The experimental meadow communities exhibited persistence under the constraints imposed by the prevailing hydrological conditions and disturbances, such as the extremely high soil wetness variability between periodical inundation on seedlings, the drought during the summer, and the transition between runoff washout and quick drainage. All planted species survived under the changing hydrological conditions, while the semi-natural meadow maintained good growth and visual landscape quality. Meadow mixes were significantly superior in species richness, abundance and structural diversity over the existing homogeneous community dominated by invasive liana Humulus scandens. Community data suggest that species richness has increased by more than 60% in the meadow mix over the existing vegetation. The meadow communities resisted invasion by indigenous weeds and colonising species that spread through wind-dispersal and hydrochorous transport from the upstream catchment. We therefore recommend prioritising taxonomically diverse meadows for river revetments wherever possible. This study provides a valid framework that can be used to inform future vegetation restoration schemes in river revetments affected by complex hydrological variation and disturbances. The methodology is applicable to a broad range of vegetative revetment structures.

J	Ramiaramanana, FN; Teller, J				Ramiaramanana, Fenosoa Nantenaina; Teller, Jacques			Urbanization and Floods in Sub-Saharan Africa: Spatiotemporal Study and Analysis of Vulnerability Factors-Case of Antananarivo Agglomeration (Madagascar)	WATER			English	Article						demographic change; urbanization; flooding; drainage system; vulnerability; Sub-Saharan Africa; Antananarivo	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CURRENT TRENDS; RISK; IMPACT; MIGRATION; CITIES; REDUCTION; POOR; LAND	Flooding is currently one of the major threats to cities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The demographic change caused by the high rate of natural increase, combined with the migration toward cities, leads to a strong demand for housing and promotes urbanization. Given the insufficiency or absence of adequate planning, many constructions are installed in flood-prone zones, often without adequate infrastructure, especially drainage systems. This makes them very vulnerable. Our research consists of carrying out a spatiotemporal analysis of the agglomeration of Antananarivo (Madagascar). It shows that urbanization leads to increased exposure of populations and constructions to floods. There is a pressure on land in flood-prone zones due to the exponential growth of the population at the agglomeration level. Some 32% of the population of the Antananarivo agglomeration lived in flood-prone zones in 2018. An analysis of the evolution of built spaces from 1953 to 2017 highlights that urban expansion was intense over those years (6.1% yearly increase of built areas). This expansion triggered the construction of built areas in flood-prone zones, which evolved from 399 ha in 1953 to 3675 ha in 2017. In 2017, 23% of the buildings in the agglomeration, i.e., almost one out of every four buildings, were in flood-prone zones. A share of the urban expansion in flood-prone zones is related to informal developments that gather highly vulnerable groups with very little in terms of economic resources. Better integration of flood risk management in spatial planning policies thus appears to be an essential step to guide decisions so as to coordinate the development of urban areas and drainage networks in a sustainable way, considering the vulnerability of the population living in the most exposed areas.

Four nonstationary design methods, namely expected waiting time (EWT), expected number of exceedances (ENE), equivalent reliability (ER), and average design life level (ADLL) have already been proposed in recent years. Among them, the EWT method needs to estimate design flood magnitudes by solving numerically. In addition, EWT requires estimating design quantiles for infinite lifespan, or extrapolation time (t(extra)), to guarantee the convergence of the EWT solution under certain conditions. However, few studies have systematically evaluated pros and cons of the EWT method as to how to determine the t(extra) and what kinds of misunderstandings on the applicability of the EWT method exist. In this study, we aim to provide the first investigation of various factors that influence the value of t(extra) in the EWT method, and provide comprehensive comparison of the four methods from the perspectives of t(extra), design values and associated uncertainties. The annual maximum flood series (AMFS) of 25 hydrological stations, with increasing and decreasing trends, in Pearl River and Weihe River were chosen for illustrations. The results indicate that: (1) the t(extra) of EWT is considerably affected by the trend of AMFS and the choice of extreme distributions. In other words, the t(extra) of stations with increasing trends was significantly smaller than that of stations with decreasing trends, and the t(extra) was also larger for distributions with heavier tail; (2) EWT produced larger design values than ENE for increasing trends, and both EWT and ENE yielded larger design values than ER and ADLL for higher return periods, while complete opposite results were obtained for decreasing trends.

However, despite the frequency and intensity with which such messages are being broadcasted throughout the world's media, there is little actual evidence of any relocation actually taking place, even though there are a number of past examples of relative sea level rise due to earthquake induced subsidence or groundwater extraction. Thus, in order to better understand the consequences of future sea level rise the authors analysed four instances of land subsidence that have taken place in the 20th and early 21st centuries (namely, adaptation strategies around Tokyo and Jakarta, and the experience of islands on the Danajon bank in the Philippines, and Kepulauan Seribu close to Jakarta). In all cases the inhabitants of densely populated coastal areas remain in place, despite the challenge of living with higher water levels. Adaptation was done through a five-phase process, starting with the construction of rather weak seawalls, which is then followed by the placement of pumps to drain water. Eventually, as the economic and technical capacities of coastal settlements improved, better seawalls were built, which then led to the reclamation of new areas, the elevation of entire districts or the construction of super levees. Thus, while it is clear that sea level rise will pose an additional financial strain on urbanised coastal areas, the authors found no evidence that any major coastal settlements will surrender a significant portion of its land area to the sea, given the range of adaptation options available. Rather, the opposite is true, and evidence indicates that new lines of defence will be built further into the water, effectively meaning that humans will encroach on the sea.

In addition to the efforts to reduce the hazards, a holistic strategy that also addresses the vulnerability and exposure of residents and their assets is essential to mitigate the impacts of such hazards. Evaluating the socioeconomic vulnerability of SIDS can serve the purpose of identification of the root drivers of risk. In this paper, we present a methodology to assess and map socioeconomic vulnerability at a neighbourhood scale using an index-based approach and principal component analysis (PCA). The index-based vulnerability assessment approach has a modular and hierarchical structure with three components: susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of adaptation, which are further composed of factors and variables. To compute the index, we use census data in combination with data coming from a survey we performed in the aftermath of Irma. PCA is used to screen the variables, to identify the most important variables that drive vulnerability and to cluster neighbourhoods based on the common factors. The methods are applied to the case study of Sint Maarten in the context of the disaster caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. Applying the combined analysis of index-based approach with PCA allows us to identify the critical neighbourhoods on the island and to identify the main variables or drivers of vulnerability. Results show that the lack of coping capacities is the most influential component of vulnerability in Sint Maarten. From this component, the "immediate action" and the "economic coverage" are the most critical factors. Such analysis also enables decision-makers to focus their (often limited) resources more efficiently and have a more significant impact concerning disaster risk reduction.

Flash floods are costly natural hazards, primarily due to their rapid onset. Therefore, predicting property damage of flash floods is imperative for proactive disaster management. Here, we present a systematic framework that considers a variety of features explaining different components of risk (i.e. hazard, vulnerability, and exposure), and examine multiple machine learning methods to predict flash flood damage. A large database of flash flood events consisting of more than 14 000 events are assessed for training and testing the methodology, while a multitude of data sources are utilized to acquire reliable information related to each event. A variable selection approach was employed to alleviate the complexity of the dataset and facilitate the model development process. The random forest (RF) method was then used to map the identified input covariates to a target variable (i.e. property damage). The RF model was implemented in two modes: first, as a binary classifier to estimate if a region of interest was damaged in any particular flood event, and then as a regression model to predict the amount of property damage associated with each event. The results indicate that the proposed approach is successful not only for classifying damaging events (with an accuracy of 81%), but also for predicting flash flood damage with a good agreement with the observed property damage. This study is among the few efforts for predicting flash flood damage across a large domain using mesoscale input variables, and the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

To fill such a gap, data assimilation was carried out in this study to construct a long-term gridded daily (0.50 degrees x 0.50 degrees) rainfall time series (1951-2014) over Southeast Asia. In rainfall data assimilation, the available and globally accepted high resolution gridded datasets viz. Southeast Asia observed (SA-OBS) (1981-2014), APHRODITE (1951-2007), TRMM (1998-2018), PRINCETON (1951-2008) along with limited rain gauges-based rainfalls were utilized. In this study, eight gap filling methods were employed and tested at 20 selected rainfall grids to fill the long gaps presented in the SA-OBS gridded dataset. The strength of each method and associated uncertainties were evaluated in the computed rainfalls utilizing multiple functions at missing grids. The accuracy of each method, in case of extreme rainfalls, was tested by quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots at different quantile intervals. The distance power method based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and the multiple linear regression method performed satisfactorily and produced minimum uncertainties in filling rainfall gaps. To test the accuracy and compatibility of gap-filled SA-OBS gridded dataset with other sources of datasets, the seasonality analysis and rainfall indices comparison were carried out. Results showed that the gap-filled SA-OBS dataset was better comparable to other sources of rainfalls. For the construction of the long-term rainfall time series (1951-2014), quantile mapping was adopted for bias correction and the quality of the final merged dataset was evaluated.

A new very high-resolution climatological dataset in Portugal: Application to hydrological modeling in a mountainous watershed	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Ecohydrology, Soil and Climate Change (EcoHCC)	SEP, 2017	Figueira da Foz, PORTUGAL			Distributed hydrologic model; Statistical downscaling; High-resolution climatic data; Corgo river; Portugal	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; RAINFALL; EUROPE; CIRCULATION; PROJECTIONS; MECHANISMS; IMPACT; RIVER	The study of precipitation and temperature variability in Portugal, including their extremes, is often restricted by the lack of high-resolution gridded datasets at daily timescales and available for sufficiently long time periods. They are of quite importance specially when considering hydrology modeling at a local scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop new high-resolution gridded datasets (similar to 1 km) of daily precipitation (1950-2015) over Portugal. Daily precipitation is downscaled by ordinary kriging from a coarser gridded dataset (similar to 20 km). Daily temperatures were retrieved from a previous work and extracted for the target watershed in this study, Corgo River (northern Portugal). The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of the new high-resolution data in improving the performance of a distributed hydrologic model, Hydrological Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) in simulating flowrates at one target watershed in northern Portugal (Corgo River watershed), thus providing a practical basis for subsequent hydrological analysis. The performances of the HSPF model, driven by either a single weather station or the new gridded datasets are compared. The results clearly hint at an improved model performance when using our dataset (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency at daily timescale: 0.34 for the single-station run and 0.64 for the multi-point run). A good performance was also found in reproducing specific flash flood events. Although the advantage of using these novel climatic datasets for hydrologic modeling in Portugal is demonstrated herein, they can be applied to other areas of research, such as ecology, agriculture and forestry, contributing to more accurate decision support systems to assist decision-makers and stakeholders.

Building drought resilience through early warning in southern Africa	WATER SA			English	Article						drought; SADC; early warning system; water scarcity; resilience; disaster risk reduction	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT	Southern Africa is highly vulnerable to drought because of its dependence on climate-sensitive sectors of agriculture, hydro-energy and fisheries. Recurring droughts continue to impact rural livelihoods and degrade the environment. Drought severity in southern Africa is exacerbated by poor levels of preparedness and low adaptive capacity. Whilst weather extremes and hazards are inevitable, the preparedness to manage such hazards determines their impact and whether they become disasters. Southern Africa is often caught unprepared by drought as existing early warning systems lack the drought forecasting component, which often results in reactionary interventions as opposed to well-planned and proactive response mechanisms. This study assesses the spatio-temporal changes of rainfall and aridity in southern Africa through an analysis of long-term precipitation and evaporation trends from 1960 to 2007. Stakeholder consultation was conducted in Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe during the peak of the 2015/16 drought, focusing on overall drought impacts, current water resource availability, existing early warning systems, adaptation mechanisms and institutional capacity to mitigate and manage droughts as part of overall disaster risk reduction strategies. Average rainfall has decreased by 26% in the region between 1960 and 2007, and aridity has increased by 11% between 1980 and 2007. The absence of drought forecasting and lack of institutional capacity to mitigate drought impede regional drought risk reduction initiatives. Existing multi-hazard early warning systems in the region focus on flooding and drought monitoring and assessment. Drought forecasting is often not given due consideration, yet it is a key component of early warning and resilience building. We propose a regional drought early warning framework, emphasising the importance of both monitoring and forecasting as being integral to a drought early warning system and building resilience to drought.

The main objective of this work is the classification of flood generation mechanisms in 28 catchments of the upper Vistula basin. A significant innovation in this study lies in the utilization of decision trees for flood classification. The methodology has so far been applied in the Alpine region. The analysis reveals that peak daily precipitation in the catchments mainly occurs in summer, particularly from June to August. Maximal daily snowmelt typically happens at the end of winter (March to April) and occasionally in November. Winter peaks are observed in March to April and, in some areas, in November to December, while summer peaks occur in May and, in specific catchments, in October. Higher peak flows for annual floods are noted in March to April and June to August. Most annual floods in the Upper Vistula basin are classified as Rainon-Snow Floods (RoSFs) or Lowland River Floods (LRFs). LRFs contribute from 19% to almost 72%, while RoSFs range from 18% to 75%. In Season 1 (summer), most seasonal floods are identified as LRFs (51%-100%), with very few as RoSFs (0%-46.9%). In Season 2 (winter), the opposite pattern is observed, with most RoSFs (48.4%- 97.9%) and fewer LRFs (0%-20.6%). While there are changes in flood patterns, they are not statistically significant. Conducted studies and obtained results can be useful for the preparation of flood prevention documentation and for flood management in general.

J	Liu, WP; Li, Y; Chen, SP				Liu, Wenping; Li, Yan; Chen, Shuaipeng			Navigating the ecosystem flood regulation service flows from subbasin to catchment in the Han River Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						ecosystem regulation service; spatial flow; spatial accumulation; basin; catchment	SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND; DYNAMICS; WETLANDS; CHINA	With the increasing cross-regional impact of climate change increasing in recent years, the Han River Basin, as a vital water resource supply and densely populated area in China, faces severe cross-regional flood threats and challenges. The systematic consideration of flood regulation throughout the entire upstream and downstream of the basin has become imminent. Our research aims to gain a deeper understanding of the ecosystem flood regulation service flows from upstream to downstream within subbasins and catchments scales of the Han River Basin. The results showed that the overflow path from upstream to downstream of the flood was basically consistent with the trend of the stream and the main tributaries of the Han River. It emerged that subbasins c, e, g, h and k were the key areas for the overall regulation of the upstream and downstream floods at subbasin scale. A total of 11 catchments overflow into their adjacent downstream catchments across the subbasins, a fact which is critical for catchment scale flood regulation. What's more, there is evident interaction not only between adjacent subbasin and catchment units but also substantial exchange of service flows between non-adjacent units. Notably, catchment c's flood regulation service flow was primarily contributed by its non-adjacent units. These findings not only contribute to filling the current knowledge gap in cross-watershed flood overflow and flood regulation service flows, but also provide support for the integrated response of upstream and downstream flood disaster risk management at the whole basin scale.

Field measurements for a catchment area in Kielce, Poland, were used to apply the model and demonstrate its usefulness. This model extends the capability of recently developed statistical and machine learning hydrodynamic models developed from multiple runs of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The extensions enable the inclusion of (1) the characteristics of the catchment and its stormwater network, calibrated model parameters expressing catchment retention, and the capacity of the sewer system; (2) extended sensitivity analysis; and (3) risk analysis. Sensitivity coefficients of calibrated model parameters include correction coefficients for percentage area, flow path, depth of storage, and impervious area; Manning roughness coefficients for impervious areas; and Manning roughness coefficients for sewer channels. Sensitivity coefficients were determined with respect to rainfall intensity and characteristics of the catchment and stormwater network. Extended sensitivity analysis enabled an evaluation of the variability in the specific flood volume and sensitivity coefficients within a catchment, in order to identify the most vulnerable areas threatened by flooding. Thus, the model can be used to identify areas particularly susceptible to stormwater network failure and the sections of the network where corrective action should be taken to reduce the probability of system failure. The simulator developed to determine the specific flood volume represents an alternative approach to the SWMM that, unlike current approaches, can be calibrated with limited topological data availability; therefore, the aforementioned simulator incurs a lower cost due to the lower number and lower specificity of data required.

The aim of this examination is to ecological disturbances and potential aquaculture land identification by applying satellite Landsat datasets and other certain datasets. Saltwater intrusion because of flood inundation and anthropogenic actions were triggering factors for deforestation, salinity increase, and shoreline change; therefore, diagraming the environmental problems was also significant. Flood-inundated lands are calculated through Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Index-based mapping was applied for environmental degradation throughout the study periods. Around 12 certain criteria are applied for the examination of potential fishery site selection. In this process, the area is characterized by different suitable sites for aquaculture land development. The model output designates the place and magnitude for the expansion of this region in different suitability measures viz., very high suitable 0.16% (1.91 km2), high suitable 20.98% (244.59 km2), moderate suitable 54.94% (640.43 km2), low suitable 12.43% (144.83 km2), very low suitable 0.12% (1.35 km2), and not suitable 11.37% (132.53 km2).Remote sensing (RS) and GIS applications are applied for the aquaculture land identification based on selected criteria. These outcomes help to generate employment, creative application of the region, and informally fluctuated and economically retrograde people of this location. The analysis helps organizers to design plans to connect maximum fish biomass and to originate community assistance from inland open waters in the area.

The main purpose is to systematically reveal the response process to urban stormwater under different urban development degree (DD) and lowimpact development (LID) implementation. A novel distributed hydrological and hydrodynamic coupled model (DHHCM), consisting of a sub-catchment-based hydrological method for plot areas and a grid-based hydrodynamic method for road areas was developed in this study. The Fengxi New Town, China was applied as the research object, a total of 11 combined events of DDs (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) and LID deployment were simulated under five rainfall return periods (P = 2a, 5a, 30a,50a and 100a) to explore their impact on the flood process. The results indicated that the DD and the LID implementation have no obvious impact on road flood when P & LE; 5a. However, the road flood increases significantly with the increase of DD when P & GE; 30a. The peak discharge of the drainage system significantly increases with the increase in DD under different return periods, and the average peak discharge increases the most obviously (2.62 m3/s) under P = 30a. The implementation of LID measures has significantly improved the mitigation effect of surface inundation, drainage system discharge and runoff control, and its effect has increased with the DD increase. It is with great significance to accurately control the flood disaster evolution process in urban development activities, and provide data and technical support for quantifying the risks and losses in policy making.

However, the presence of societal demands that impact both livelihoods and urban planning in response to climatic hazards undermines the potential positive outcomes. This research, conducted in a coastal urban area of Ghana's Greater Accra Region, utilized the Community-based Risk Screening Tool - Adaptation and Livelihoods (CRiSTAL) developed by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) to analyze the experiences of climatic hazards and overall livelihoods of the population. The study employed Ghana's Census Sampling Frame for implementation, and Participatory Learning Approaches, to collect data which it identified floods, heavy storms, and heat stress as the most significant hazards. These hazards greatly influenced the population's physical, social, and financial livelihood assets, resulting in losses and damages caused by heavy rains, storms, and subsequent floods. Extreme heat also had a notable impact on human and financial resources. The local population prioritized human mobility and livelihood diversification as important adaptation strategies. The findings have important policy implications, highlighting the need to address barriers and disruptions in resilience-building and sustainability efforts, emphasizing the significance of prioritizing policy investment and considering climate change uncertainties in planning towards minimizing "urban climate policy inhibition" (Urban-CPI). The study also revealed valuable lessons, such as CRiSTAL's ability to bridge the gap between climatic risk and livelihood issues, bringing them closer to communities and enhancing preparedness to adapt to climatic risks and impacts on livelihoods.

SQ can be an ambiguous concept, which can function as boundary object that unites stakeholders from various backgrounds. Yet, the ambiguity of SQ can also be misused to justify particular interests, result in unmet expectations and lead to miscommunication. To contribute to the understanding, communication and implementation of SQ in flood risk management projects, this study systematically reviewed the use of SQ in the literature. The first part of this review resulted in the identification of 19 aspects categorized into four dimensions of SQ: experiential, use, ecological, and long-term quality. Based on these dimensions, we found in the second part of this review that SQ is understood either as (1) experiential quality only, (2) the combination of experiential, use, and ecological quality, and (3) the combination of all four dimensions. The review illustrates that the understanding of SQ is related to several context characteristics, including the country of author affiliation and the prominent school of thought with regards to objectivity and subjectivity. For example, only authors affiliated with Dutch institutions take into account all four dimensions of SQ. To bridge between these different understandings of SQ, this study provides a framework with a set of terms that can be used for the development of a shared language for SQ, ultimately fostering the implementation of this concept in flood risk management projects.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Planning Water	[Bakx, Michiel; Stremke, Sven; Lenzholzer, Sanda] Wageningen Univ, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands	Wageningen University & Research	Bakx, M (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Landscape Architecture Chair Grp, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.	michiel.bakx@wur.nl		Bakx, Michiel/0000-0003-4058-4840	Wageningen University; University of Groningen; OKRA Landschapsarchitecten BV; Stichting Deltares; STOWA; TAUW; twelve Dutch water boards	Wageningen University; University of Groningen; OKRA Landschapsarchitecten BV(Oce-Technologies BV); Stichting Deltares; STOWA; TAUW; twelve Dutch water boards	Wageningen University and University of Groningen and co-funded by OKRA Landschapsarchitecten BV, Stichting Deltares, STOWA, TAUW and twelve Dutch water boards.		79	1	1	4	6	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2049-1948			WIRES WATER	Wiley Interdiscip.

Although there is a significant cost associated with the creation, operation and maintenance of drainage systems, the representation of these systems in flood models is overly simplified. This simplification is due to data protection regulations, and the complexities associated with drainage network modelling. A new framework developed by Water UK in collaboration with the Environmental Agency and sewerage undertakers for UK Drainage Water Management Plans provides data on the capacity and performance of the drainage system. The output from this framework provides a new method of incorporating a more explicit representation of spatially varied drainage capacity in flood models.This study presents the first application of the UK's capacity assessment framework (CAF) for drainage representation in flood models. We develop a method of using the CAF outputs to represent spatially varied drainage losses across a catchment and assess its impact on flood risk. Three catchments in Leeds are used to quantify the difference generated in flooding when using a national average removal rate (NARR, e.g., 12 mm/hr) and our CAF-derived rainfall removal rates. Although there is variance across catchments, the results show the CAF removal rates increase flood depths, velocities, and flood hazards when compared to the national average due to a more realistic representation of the real system drainage capacity. With the pressures of climate change and continued urban development, a better representation of real drainage systems capacities will become more important and will make local solutions more resilient and relevant to the realities on the ground.

Characterizing the temporal and spatial variation of enteric pathogens prevalent in wastewater is critical to develop approaches to mitigate their distribution in the environment. In this study, we aim to characterize pathogen variability and test the applicability of the human-associated wastewater indicator crAssphage as an indicator of enteric viral and bacterial pathogens. We conducted weekly samplings for 14 months from four wastewater treatment plants in North Carolina, USA. Untreated wastewater samples were processed using hollow fiber ultrafiltration, followed by secondary concentration methods. Adenovirus, norovirus, enterovirus, Salmonella, Shiga toxin 2 (stx2), Campylobacter, and crAssphage were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and reverse transcriptase (rt)-qPCR. Our results revealed significant correlations between crAssphage and human adenovirus, enterovirus, norovirus, Salmonella, and Campylobacter (p<0.01). Pathogens and crAssphage concentrations in untreated wastewater showed distinct seasonal patterns, with peak concentrations of crAssphage and viral pathogens in fall and winter, while bacterial pathogens showed peaked concentrations in either winter (Campylobacter), fall (Salmonella), or summer (stx2). This study enhances the understanding of crAssphage as an alternative molecular indicator for both bacterial and viral pathogens. The findings of this study can also inform microbial modeling efforts for the prediction of the impact of wastewater pathogens on surface waters due to increased flooding events and wastewater overflows associated with climate change.

Insights into the complementarity of natural disaster insurance purchases and risk reduction behavior	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						adaptation; flood risk; insurance; risk perception; risk reduction measures	FLOOD DAMAGE MITIGATION; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERCEPTION; COMMUNICATION; ADAPTATION	While flooding is the costliest natural disaster risk, public-sector investments provide incomplete protection. Moreover, individuals are in general reluctant to voluntarily invest in measures which limit damage costs from natural disasters. The moral hazard hypothesis argues that insured individuals take fewer other preparedness measures based on their assumption that their losses will be covered anyway. Conversely, the advantageous selection hypothesis argues that individuals view insurance and other risk reduction measures as complements. This study offers a comprehensive assessment of factors related to the separate uptake of natural disaster insurance and the flood-proofing of homes as well as why people may take both of these measures together. We use data from a survey conducted in Paris, France, in 2018, after several flood events, for a representative sample of 2976 residents facing different levels of flood risk. We perform both main effects regressions and interaction analyses to reveal that home adaptation to flooding is positively associated with comprehensive insurance coverage, which includes financial protection against natural disasters. Furthermore, actual and perceived risks, as well as awareness of official information on flood risk, are found to explain some of the relationship between home adaptation and comprehensive insurance purchase. We suggest several recommendations to policymakers based on these insights which aim to address insurance coverage gaps and the failure to take disaster risk reduction measures. In particular, groups in socially vulnerable situations may benefit from subsidized insurance, low interest loans, and decision aids to implement costly adaptation measures.

Based on ground-based rainfall data from 116 gauges, the performance of Global Rainfall Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products (IMERG-Early run (IMERG-E), IMERG-Late run (IMERG-L), and IMERG-Final run (IMERG-F)) were evaluated from the seven-day rainfall change process, the hourly rainfall change process on July 20th and the six traditional indexes. Results indicate that the overall performance of IMERG-F is the best, relative bias (RB) is-0.03 and correlation coefficient (CC) is 0.51. IMERG-L (RB,-0.09; CC, 0.49) is very close to IMERG-F More outstandingly, in the three days of 19th, 20th and 21st, RB of IMERG-L per day is-0.01, 0.02, and -0.13, respectively. IMERG-L shows a greater ability to capture extreme short-duration heavy rainfall in the peak period compared to the other two products. Since weak rainfall overestimation coefficient (WROC) is >0.5, it can be concluded that RB of excessively overestimated gauges are >100% mainly determined by the overestimation during weak rainfall; Because of overestimation coefficient (OC) and weak rainfall coefficient (WRC), there is an obvious error trend that gauges with weak rainfall (<= 1 mm/h) are easily overestimated and gauges with non-weak rainfall (> 1 mm/h) are easily underestimated; IMERG-F has higher entire accuracy and reduces the error trend because of the large number of PMW estimates.

These factors, along with human pressures, lead to an increase in coastal erosion. In response, hard engineering measures were realized as breakwaters and groins, to oppose erosion processes along the sandy beaches of the Italian coastline. These types of defense systems showed negative impacts on landscapes, ecosystems, and expected results. Additionally, the use of coastal revetments, submerged sandbars, soil bioengineering, and beach nourishment projects were used to defend seaboard areas from the risk of a growing shore withdrawal. Among these soft solutions, beach nourishment is becoming an environmentally friendly method to control shoreline erosion, increasing the width of sandy beaches to guarantee a better tourist use of coastal regions and to add a greater buffer between the shoreline and existing infrastructure. In recent times, nourishment projects have been combined with other protective measures, such as submerged sandbars and underwater detached breakwaters, limiting the loss of sediments from sandy beaches and allowing better protection from stormy events. These mixed solutions ensure effective coastal protection by maintaining the width of sandy beaches for tourist use, guaranteeing the environmental safeguard of the coastal ecosystems. In order to achieve the best result with these types of projects, a close collaboration between coastal engineers, geologists, biologists, and policymakers toward integrated coastal zone management is necessary. The study described in this paper has taken the form of a literature review regarding both the negative environmental impacts and the benefits associated with the use of old and new coastal defense systems.

Recent updates of the state-of-the-art Land Surface Models (LSMs) include the impacts of irrigation on surface hydrology. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is one of the global hotspots of irrigation water applications. However, the direct application of these models to Indian basins has certain limitations. The commonly employed flood irrigation technique is often indiscriminate and unmanaged, unlike the state-of-the-art models' estimation of crop water use based on soil moisture (SM) conditions. The primary crop in the IGP is paddy, cultivated in inundated fields with quite distinct water and energy partitioning mechanisms represented in very few models. Here, we developed an improved irrigation module to simulate the Indian agricultural practices for the widely used Variable Infiltration Capacity model. We incorporated the crop-specific water use for flood irrigation, calculated based on previously reported field studies. The water and energy balance processes are modified by incorporating the ponded paddy fields with proper parameterization. We achieved moderate improvement in the simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and SM of the IGP, particularly in the non-monsoon seasons with the updated model. We found that ET and SM are more sensitive to the irrigation techniques than the interval of irrigation application. Runoff strongly responded to irrigation technique as well as the interval of application. We emphasize accurate representation of irrigation practices in the LSMs, specifically when applied to the human-natural hydrological system.

It is of great significance to accurately detect the non-stationary changes of precipitation. Focusing on the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River basin which is considered as the key ecological barrier in northern China, the best probabilistic model with time-varying moments was established to fit the wet-season precipitation series from 1988 to 2017 for 38 meteorological stations. Considering four three-parameter distributions, time was used as covariate to describe the linear or nonlinear change of each parameter, and model optimization was performed by Akaike Information Criterion. Combined with conventional methods including the Trend-Free Pre-Whitening Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimator, the non-stationary behaviors of wet-season precipitation variability were quantitatively captured. Results showed that the generalized gamma distribution performed best in fitting the wet-season precipitation series in the study area, characterized with high skewness and heavy tails. The non-stationary characteristics of the wet-season precipitation were obvious in most areas during the past 30 years, especially in the central region. The non-stationarities of wet-season precipitation manifested in a downward trend in the mean value, an increase in dispersion degree and significant changes in distribution shape with time, consequently adding the uncertainty to wet-season precipitation process and raising the risk of extreme conditions. The findings of this study provide scientific references to water resources management, drought resistance, and disaster reduction.

High-density residential areas and high proportions of impervious surfaces make residential areas prone to severe flooding. Low-impact development practices are broadly applied to solve these problems, and as a main component of low-impact development practices, green spaces have also drawn attention because of their capacity to control rainwater. However, the effects of green space spatial characteristics on hydrological processes have been overlooked. In this study, to determine how to optimize the layout of the green space system to improve the capacity of stormwater management, data from Tianjin were analyzed using a FRAGSTATs model and a SWMM model to identify how the layout of green spaces affects the process of rainwater generation and concentration in terms of three typical residential area layouts. The results show that (1) when it is possible to increase the amount of green space, maintaining a high patch density is the best way to achieve runoff treatment; (2) when newly built green space is limited, increasing connectivity between existing green spaces is the best way to control rainwater, especially in enclosed and axial modes; (3) when comparing the efficiency of the three modes, the axial mode presents the best performance in terms of promotion rate. These results will provide those developing urban residential areas with more economical, practical, and suitable layout strategies for green space systems in terms of planning, design, and optimization aimed at stormwater management.

In Fiji, coastal resources are a primary source of food, medicine, income and other necessities for livelihood security. Human-induced climate change places growing pressure on the quality of coastal resources due to the increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters like coastal erosion and flooding. Anthropogenic activities like coastal mining of earth minerals further threatens livelihood security with cumulative pressure on the coastal environment and its resources. This paper discusses the compounding impacts of mining in the flood-prone community of Vanua Votua in Ba (Fiji). They currently witness the degradation of their coastal environment and its resources (iqoliqoli). The people of Vanua Votua have a cultural and spiritual attachment to their coastal ecosystem as indigenous custodians. However, they are limited in their ability to conserve and protect their iqoliqoli due to an unfair legal duality of national coastal governance structures and processes between the state and indigenous custodians. We found that a central issue of coastal mining, governance, and the people's livelihood vulnerabilities, is Fiji's Mining Act [Cap 146] and associated environmental legislations and policies that consolidate much of the coastal governance authority with the state.

An Exploratory Study	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						haor; environmental stress; sedimentation; floodplain; vulnerable populations; Bangladesh	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; RIVER; ADAPTATION; LIVELIHOOD; EVENTS; BASIN; RISK; LAKE; POPULATIONS	The haor landscape is a wetland ecosystem in northeast Bangladesh, comprising shallow depressions that undergo large changes in water inundation between the monsoon and dry seasons. Sediment is supplied to the haor from rivers originating in the adjacent Shillong Plateau, and can adversely affect these largely arable agricultural lands. The critical adverse effects of changing hydrology and enhanced sedimentation due to anthropogenic change include the reduction of natural water storage capacity, changes in the timing and magnitude of floods, and increasing loss and damage to crops, which consequently affect the livelihoods of wetland dwellers. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to investigate how sedimentation has affected the livelihoods of the residents and the pressures they experience. Cross-sectional surveys and interviews were conducted with 180 respondents in Lubar and Pochashul Haors (LPH), Sunamganj District, and allied with an analysis of satellite images that reveals the nature of landscape change over the past 56 years. Our findings confirm that sedimentation has been promoted through both natural processes of alluvial fan progradation and anthropogenic forcings. Enhanced sedimentation threatens the agriculture of the region and affects the livelihood of local inhabitants, leading to other societal issues related to income, education, employment, health, displacement, and sexual harassment. The mixed methods employed herein are essential tools to reveal these effects. In order to reduce the vulnerability of the local population, a transboundary dialog between India and Bangladesh is needed to realize measures to protect wetland resources and achieve progress towards environmental sustainability.

However, little is known about how public Extension and Advisory Services (EAS) facilitate learning to help adapt to particular climate stressors. This article investigates the role of public EAS in facilitating learning to enhance innovation in a flash flood-affected farming context. Design/methodology/approach: The research adopted flash flood-affected rice farming in Bangladesh as a case and collected data with actors involved in various extension approaches using interviews and focus group discussions. Findings: Public EAS should involve a range of relevant actors, including the private sector and scientists, and jointly evaluate with farmers and provide feedback on the effectiveness of various crop cultivation strategies for flash flood adaptation. Public EAS needs to deliver the necessary instrumental support and resources to achieve learning outcomes and enable farmers to make desirable changes to farm activities. Practical implications: Policy makers need to develop policies for the capacity development of public EAS staff and provide adequate resources so that public EAS can facilitate learning approaches to support discussions on local concerns and the use of local knowledge, experiences, and resources for flash flood adaptation. Theoretical implications: Facilitation of learning to support adoption of technological innovations is not sufficient in the context of flash flood adaptation. Facilitation should support discussions on effective utilisation of natural and common resources for the flash flooding context. Originality/value: The study investigated the ways public EAS can facilitate learning to overcome barriers to innovation and support learning outcomes in a flash flooding context.

Distribution of extreme rainfall events and their environmental controls in the West African Sahel and Soudan	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						West African Sahel; Extreme rainfall; Mesoscale convective system (MCS); African easterly wave; Intertropical front; Intertropical discontinuity; Dryline; Vertical wind shear; Flooding	MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; WARM-SEASON RAINFALL; DIURNAL CYCLE; EASTERLY WAVES; INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY; SQUALL LINES; PART I; ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS; TROPICAL AFRICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE	West African Sahel and Soudan extreme rainfall events are impactful when strong mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) produce large amounts of rainfall in short periods. NASA IMERG rainfall estimates and the ERA5 reanalysis are examined to understand where the top 100 highest 12Z-12Z 24-h rainfall totals and MCS storm genesis occur, and to assess the relative importance of environmental conditions in their generation including the influence of atmospheric moisture and vertical wind shear. Most of the top 100 events are located south of 14 degrees N over the Soudan. Events cluster over three regions, namely, Mali, Burkina Faso, and northern Nigeria. The associated MCSs are typically not locally generated, forming instead at distances greater than 100 km upstream. Composites reveal that a significant increase in atmospheric moisture content occurs prior to development, but there is no evidence of significant changes in the 600-925 hPa vertical wind shear. This indicates that changes in vertical wind shear are less influential in extreme storm development than atmospheric moisture preconditioning. The top 10 events are further evaluated. A change in these storms' direction and speed near the maximum rainfall location is common, suggesting the MCSs are reorganizing around peak rainfall intensity time. Three atmospheric conditions are associated with these events. They are (1) moisture preconditioning of the atmosphere, (2) interaction of the storm in the wake of a region of anticyclonic flow, and (3) interaction of the storm in the wake of a region of anticyclonic flow and the Sahel/tropical dryline boundary.

J	Huang, PC				Huang, Pin-Chun			An effective alternative for predicting coastal floodplain inundation by considering rainfall, storm surge, and downstream topographic characteristics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Floodplain inundation; Coastal flooding; Storm surge; Topographic wetness index; Geomorphological characteristics; Recurrent neural network model	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOW; WATER	The extent of coastal flooding is influenced by many factors such as the topography of the low-lying land, tidal level, rainfall pattern, inflow discharge collected from the upstream drainage area, etc. This study establishes a new methodology of effectively predicting the flooding process in coastal areas, and which is achieved by combining the recurrent neural network (RNN) model with the detailed analysis of different hydrological and geomorphological factors. The novelty of this study is to apply the topographic wetness index (TWI) of each grid to classify all inputs into multiple classes for separative training to improve the overall accuracy of flooding simulations. A numerical inundation model based on hydrodynamic equations was applied to investigate the behavior of coastal flooding in the temporal and spatial domain under a variety of model settings with different hydrologic conditions and it was utilized to generate the target inundation depths for the training of the RNN model. The relevance between the downstream topography, tidal level, rainfall intensity, and the spatial distribution of flooding in coastal areas is explored via the use of machine learning (ML) techniques. The focus of this study is to evaluate the proposed alternative method that allows for improving the efficiency and stability of forecasting coastal floods caused by rains and storm surges due to the approaching tropical cyclones. The method developed in this study is promising to replace the numerical inundation model to reinforce the model's stability and computational efficiency.

This Review explores the relationships between vegetation and the stability and dynamics of meandering rivers and will serve anthropogenic stressors on Earth's rivers. The Palaeozoic evolution of land plants revolutionized river geomorphology. However, the relationships between biotic forcing and channel dynamics are still debated and, as such, the impacts of anthropogenic stressors such as climate change, reduced biodiversity and aridification on modern meandering rivers and their biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. In this Review, we propose a unifying framework based on field and modelling data that describes the stability and dynamics of meandering rivers in both the presence and the absence of land plants. Based on evidence from the pre-vegetation rock record and from modern systems, we emphasize that meandering streams can indeed arise in the absence of land plants. However, plant evolution provided widespread settings suitable for stable meandering systems through retention of floodplain mud, sediment baffling and mechanical strengthening of channel banks. Altogether, these processes slowed the characteristic rates of meander growth and floodplain-soil reworking by up to an order of magnitude. Continued anthropogenic removal of riparian and watershed vegetation due to increased urbanization, deforestation, aridification and pollution could revert streams to pre-vegetation functioning, thereby increasing their channel and sediment mobility. Future research can use this framework to constrain the pace of ancient landscape processes on Earth and Mars, in addition to modern terrestrial rivers impacted by humans.

Tree-rings are a good hydroclimatic proxy used to reconstruct drought and streamflow in regions that respond to common global forcings. We used a multi-species dataset of 32 tree-ring width chronologies from Chile and Uruguay as a climate proxy to infer annual streamflow (Q) variability in the Negro River basin, a grassland-dominated watershed of lowland Southeastern South America. A positive linear correlation between tree-ring chronologies from Central Chile and annual Negro River instrumental streamflow from 1957 to 2012 indicated a cross-continental teleconnection between hydroclimate variability in Central Chile and Northeastern Uruguay. This relationship was mediated in part by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whereby the El Nino 3.4 Index was positively correlated with regional rainfall, annual tree growth, and Q anomalies. Despite the proximity of Uruguayan tree-ring chronologies to Negro River hydrometric stations, the Chilean tree-ring chronologies best predicted annual streamflow. Thus, using tree-ring data from four long-term moisture-sensitive chronologies of the species Cryptocarya alba in Central Chile (32-34 degrees S), we present the first streamflow reconstruction (1890-2009) in the lower La Plata Basin. The reconstruction supports regional evidence for increasing frequency of extreme flood years over the past century in Uruguay. We demonstrate how climate teleconnections that mediate local hydroclimate variability permit the cross-continental reconstruction of streamflow, filling a major geographical gap in historical proxies for flooding and drought in grassland biomes of the southern hemisphere.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variations in eleven extreme precipitation indices are determined using the Sen's method, Mann test and heuristic segmentation method. The relations between extreme precipitation and the Asia summer monsoon are analyzed by cross wavelet transform methods. The major findings of this research are as follows: (1) the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation changes over time in the Qinling-Dabashan Mountains: higher precipitation intensity occur in the middle and southeastern regions, while other regions exhibit adverse variation patterns. (2) Temporally, the regional trends of only the annual total wet day precipitation are dominant in the Qinling-Dabashan Mountains and its subregions. However, the regional trends of extreme precipitation are not statistically significant. In addition, the extreme precipitation in the Qinling-Dabashan Mountains and its subregions was sensitive to environmental changes from 1961 to 2018, including intensive human activity, the Asian summer monsoon and steep terrain. Sensitivity to environmental change implies flash floods and other natural disasters from 1961 to 2018.

However, few studies have focused on the impacts of regulation on the water required (WR) for hydrological drought recovery, nor on the response relationship between WR and drought characteristics (i.e., duration and severity). Therefore, we proposed a comparative approach that integrates reconstructing unregulated streamflow and a drought identification method using variable threshold levels (VTLs) to evaluate the impacts. Long-term (>40 years) observational datasets for streamflow at a hydrometric station and inflow and outflow at multiple large reservoirs in the Dongjiang River Basin were used. Using VTLs that accounted for seasonal differences in hydrological processes, our method performed well in identifying historical hydrological droughts and their characteristics in the study area. The WR mainly depended on drought severity rather than drought duration and there was a clear nonlinear response relationship (i.e., power function) between WR and drought severity. The performance indices (i.e., R-2 = 0.92, NSE = 0.97, PBIAS = 13.57%) indicated that the optimal nonlinear function model could accurately simulate the WR of hydrological drought events. Large reservoirs reduce the frequency of hydrological droughts, shorten drought duration, and reduce drought severity by storing water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season. The presence of reservoirs shifted the relationship between WR and drought severity from linear to nonlinear. These findings showed that the proposed methodology can help us to optimize the management of water resources for drought prevention and disaster reduction under changing environments.

Yet, evidence on its determinants in low-income countries remains scarce. We examined the social determinants of depressive symptoms for Tanzanian adolescents. Methods We used cross-sectional data for 2458 adolescents (aged 14-19), to describe associations with depressive symptoms within and across five domains-demographic, economic, neighbourhood, environmental and social-cultural-using linear mixed models. We estimated depressive symptoms using the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, which ranges from 0 to 30 and increases with additional symptoms. Results Factors associated with depressive symptoms in the fully adjusted models included experiencing five or more household economic shocks (beta=2.40; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.32), experiencing droughts/floods (beta=0.76; 95% CI 0.36 to 1.17), being in a relationship (beta=1.82; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.33), and having moderate (beta=1.26; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.71) or low (beta=2.27; 95% CI 1.81 to 2.74) social support. Exclusive schooling was protective compared with being engaged in both school and paid work (beta=1.07; 95% CI 0.05 to 2.61) and not engaged in either (beta=0.73; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22). Household size and relationship status were more important factors for girls, while employment status, and extreme precipitation were more important for boys. Conclusion Mental health is associated with determinants from multiple domains. Results suggest that environmental shocks related to climate change contribute to poor mental health in adolescents, highlighting an important area for intervention and research.

Application of ANN and HEC-RAS model for flood inundation mapping in lower Baro Akobo River Basin, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						ANNs; Flood inundation; HEC-RAS; Machine-learning; NDWI; TWI	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; VULNERABILITY; REGION; RISK	Study region: Lower Barn River, Ethiopia. Study focus: This paper presents the novelty of ANN and HEC-RAS model for flood inundation mapping in lower Baro Akobo Basin River, Ethiopia. ANN and HEC-RAS model is applied and successfully improves the accuracy of prediction and flood inundation in the region. This study uses 14 meteorological stations on a daily basis for 1999-2005 and 2006-2008 periods, and Topographical Wetness Index (TWI) to the train and test the model respectively. The runoff time series obtained in ANN model is linked to HEC-RAS and the flood depths were generated. The flood inundation generated in HEC-RAS model result was calibrated and validated in Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI). New hydrological insights for the region: As the inundation map generated from the runoff values of ANN model reveals, the lower Bam river forms huge inundation depth up to 250 cm. The performance the ANN model was evaluated using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE = 0.86), PBIAS = 8.2 % and R-2 = 0.91 and NSE = 0.88, PBIAS = 8.5 % and R-2 = 0.93 during the training and testing periods respectively. The generated inundation areas in HEC-RAS and the water bodies delineated in NDWI were covered with 94.6 % and 96 % as overlapping areas during the calibration and validation periods respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that the integration of the ANN approach with the HEC-RAS model has improved the prediction accuracy in traditional flood forecasting methods.

An Extreme-Preserving Long-Term Gridded Daily Precipitation Dataset for the Conterminous United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Extreme events; Precipitation; Runoff; Hydrology; Data processing; Surface observations	HYDROLOGICALLY BASED DATASET; LAND-SURFACE FLUXES; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; CLIMATE; MODEL; SNOW; TIME; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RESOLUTION	Extreme daily precipitation contributes to flooding that can cause significant economic damages, and so is important to properly capture in gridded meteorological datasets. This work examines precipitation extremes, the mean precipitation on wet days, and fraction of wet days in two widely used gridded datasets over the conterminous United States. Compared to the underlying station observations, the gridded data show a 27% reduction in annual 1-day maximum precipitation, 25% increase in wet day fraction, 1.5-2.5 day increase in mean wet spell length, 30% low bias in 20-yr return values of daily precipitation, and 25% decrease in mean precipitation on wet days. It is shown these changes arise primarily from the time adjustment applied to put the precipitation gauge observations into a uniform time frame, with the gridding process playing a lesser role. A new daily precipitation dataset is developed that omits the time adjustment (as well as extending the gridded data by 7 years) and is shown to perform significantly better in reproducing extreme precipitation metrics. When the new dataset is used to force a land surface model, annually averaged 1-day maximum runoff increases 38% compared to the original data, annual mean runoff increases 17%, evapotranspiration drops 2.3%, and fewer wet days leads to a 3.3% increase in estimated solar insolation. These changes are large enough to affect portrayals of flood risk and water balance components important for ecological and climate change applications across the CONUS.

This study aims to examine ongoing risks caused by hydrometeorological hazards, with a focus on micro-level household response to increasing vulnerabilities, in addition to macro-level community related vulnerabilities. Data collection was undertaken through semi-structured interviews in three hydro-meteorological hazard-prone communities, dominated by members of the Indi-Fijian community, that is, the Indian diaspora, in the Western part of Fiji. The findings were analysed using descriptive, interpretive and inferential analysis. The findings reveal that climatic, physical, cultural and socio-economic factors render households more vulnerable at a micro-level. The research also revealed that members of the Indian community normally have lower levels of societal cohesion, have an inherent individualistic approach to disasters and lack access to communal assets such as land, rendering them more vulnerable at a community level. As a coping mechanism, households were found to have a higher likelihood of adhering to social adaptive strategies such as making behavioural, informational, and educational changes for risk reduction. According to this study, participants show a high degree of risk perception with a sound understanding of storm surge, flood peaks and extents as well as prolonged dry spells. The study recommends avenues for combining scientific knowledge together with citizen science for better hazard risk analysis as future research. To ensure appropriate risk mitigation, governments should implement effective warning systems and undertake capacity building prior to disasters to initiate adequate response to forecast warnings.

Favourable inland wetland conditions increase apparent survival of migratory shorebirds in Australia	EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY			English	Article						Shorebirds; temporary wetlands; apparent survival; Australian birds	RAPID POPULATION DECLINE; TEMPORARY EMIGRATION; FITNESS CONSEQUENCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT LOSS; WATERBIRDS; IMPACTS; INFORMATION; VARIABILITY; FRAMEWORK	Many migratory shorebird species using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway are declining rapidly. While the loss of staging habitats in East Asia is considered the primary cause, stressors to fitness often occur throughout the geographic range of declining species, and threats in the non-breeding grounds have been comparatively poorly studied. Three species of migratory shorebird, Curlew Sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), Sharp-tailed Sandpiper (C. acuminata) and Red-necked Stint (C. ruficollis), use Australia's dynamic temporary wetland systems opportunistically, yet these large wetland systems have become increasingly degraded, with reduced frequency and extent of flooding. Here, we test whether variables related to wetland availability in Australia's interior can explain annual variation in apparent survival, abundance or immature to adult ratios at three well-monitored coastal shorebird areas in southern Australia (total area > 1315 km(2)). We show that coastal annual bird abundance and ratios of immatures at the coast were higher when inland Australia was relatively hot and dry. Also, a small but significant amount of variation in annual apparent survival can be explained by annual variation in inland conditions, with higher survival rates in years when inland conditions were relatively wet and cool. For the endangered Curlew Sandpiper, the impacts of Australian environmental conditions may be exacerbating the impacts of conditions experienced in other parts of its range on fitness and survival. While the effects we document here are relatively weak, they do suggest that management of inland wetlands for these shorebirds may positively affect survival rates of these sharply declining species.

In this context, promoting water-saving practices, such as alternate wetting and drying technology, is vital to sustain rice production and enhance people's resilience to climatic changes in the Delta. Since this technology is not widely applied in the region, this study hypothesized that a precise water measurement using the Internet of Things technology could facilitate the uptake of the alternate wetting and drying rice cultivation practice. The study applied a rigorous research design to assess the differential benefits of applying the technology with sensors. Participating farmers were divided into three treatment groups that produced rice using either the continuously flooded irrigation technique, manual alternate wetting and drying tubes, or tubes with sensors. The on-farm trials' results showed that the precise water level measurements with the sensors allowed the farmers to maximize the benefits from alternate wetting and drying irrigation. The experimental results indicated an additional 13-20% of water savings over manual alternate wetting and drying. The technology also reduced irrigation energy costs by 25% and moderately enhanced rice yields by 2-11%. This pilot was the first to demonstrate in a large-scale open-field trial that it is feasible and beneficial for smallholder farmers to apply cutting-edge Internet of Things technology to increase water use efficiency in their rice farms. The technology adoption would significantly contribute to sustaining the agriculture-based livelihoods of people in the Delta.

Understanding their hydrogeomorphic dynamics is fundamental in hazard assessment studies, especially in subtropical and tropical regions where debris flows have scarcely been studied when compared to other mass-wasting processes. Thus, this study aims at systematically analyzing the meteorological and geomorphological factors that characterize a landslide-triggered debris flow at the Pedra Branca catchment (Serra do Mar, Brazil), to quantify the debris flow's magnitude, peak discharge and velocity. A magnitude comparison with empirical equations (Italian Alps, Taiwan, Serra do Mar) is also conducted. The meteorological analysis is based on satellite data and rain gauge measurements, while the geomorphological characterization is based on terrestrial and aerial investigations, with high spatial resolution. The results indicate that it was a large-sized stony debris flow, with a total magnitude of 120,195 m(3), a peak discharge of 2146.7 m(3) s(-1) and a peak velocity of 26.5 m s(-1). The debris flow was triggered by a 188-mm rainfall in 3 h (maximum intensity of 128 mm h(-1)), with an estimated return period of 15 to 20 years, which, combined with the intense accumulation of on-channel debris (ca. 37,000 m(3)), indicates that new high-magnitude debris flows in the catchment and the region are likely to occur within the next two decades. The knowledge of the potential frequency and magnitude (F-M) can support the creation of F-M relationships for Serra do Mar, a prerequisite for reliable hazard management and monitoring programs.

On the contribution of remote sensing-based calibration to model hydrological and hydraulic processes in tropical regions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological modeling; Multi-variable calibration; Amazon; Hydrodynamic modeling; Large basins	SATELLITE RADAR ALTIMETRY; SOIL-MOISTURE; DATA ASSIMILATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IN-SITU; WATER; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; UNCERTAINTY; BASIN	The accuracy of hydrological model predictions is limited by uncertainties in model structure and parameterization, and observations used for calibration, validation and model forcing. While calibration is usually performed with discharge estimates, the internal model processes might be misrepresented, and the model might be getting the "right results for the wrong reasons", thus compromising model reliability. An alternative is to calibrate model parameters with remote sensing (RS) observations of the water cycle. Previous studies highlighted the potential of RS-based calibration to improve discharge estimates, focusing less on other variables of the water cycle. In this study, we analyzed in detail the contribution of five RS-based variables (water level (h), flood extent (A), terrestrial water storage (TWS), evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture (W)) to calibrate a coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model for a large Amazon sub-basin with extensive floodplains. Single-variable calibration experiments with all variables were able to improve discharge KGE from around 6.1% to 52.9% when compared to a priori parameter sets. Water cycle representation was improved with multi-variable calibration: KGE for all variables were improved in the evaluation period. By analyzing different calibration setups, a consistent selection of complementary variables for model calibration resulted in a better performance than incorporating all RS variables into the calibration. By looking at multiple RS observations of the water cycle, inconsistencies in model structure and parameterization were found, which would remain unknown if only discharge observations were considered.

However, substantial uncertainties remain in global and regional projections of future flood conditions simulated by global climate models (GCMs) and/or global hydrological models (GHMs). Using physical models coupled with machine learning (ML), for the first time, we project changes in flood magnitudes of 2062 global river basins by constraining physical-based streamflow simulations with observations under 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios identified for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We found that, during the validation period, the GHMs-simulated flood magnitudes would improve with reduced uncertainty over the selected river basins after ML with a Long Short-Term Memory network. Our estimation suggested that flood magnitudes would increase in many Northern Hemisphere mid- and high-latitude rivers (e.g., Lena River, Amur River and Volga River) but decrease in some river basins in southern Finland and Eastern Europe in future periods (i.e., 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming levels). In 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warmer worlds, the decreasing flood magnitudes in most South American rivers are associated with decreased soil moisture and increased evapotranspiration induced by warmer temperatures. Although the geographical pattern of changes in flood magnitudes for the +2 degrees C experiment is close to that of the +1.5 degrees C experiment, a 1.5 degrees C warming target is more likely to reduce flood magnitudes of many river basins worldwide (e.g., in central and eastern Siberia, Alaska/ Northwest Canada and South America).

Therefore, it is important to assess the capability of the beach-dune system to resist, recover, and adapt from storms in the context of coastal development and climate change. This work aims to investigate the role of human impacts on the spatiotemporal evolution of the Coastal Resilience Index (CRI) in the area. The study is conducted on a prograding micro-tidal beach located on the vicinity of coastal structures. Beach and dune morphometrics, characteristic beach parameters, and maximum shoreline recession were determined from the analysis of beach profiles undertaken along a 2-km straight of coastline during the 2015-2020 period. Moreover, the maximum extreme water levels were estimated using in situ data and numerical models. This information is employed to assess the alongshore and temporal variability of the beach resilience. The results suggest that the beach and dune morphology present alongshore and temporal variability due to the human impacts associated to the dune degradation and the presence of coastal structures. The analysis shows that coastal resilience has been increasing over the past years but presents significant alongshore variations. High CRI values were found at beach transects presenting low anthropogenic impact, whereas low resilience was observed at transects with a degraded dune or located in the vicinity of coastal structures regardless of presenting high progradation rates. The observed beach response during the passage of recent tropical storms is consistent with the CRI values.

Water shortages were caused by climate change, such as altered weather patterns, including droughts or floods, increased pollution, and increased human demand and overuse of water. Without the proper source of water, people encounter a lot of problems in health, hunger, education, and poverty. In this work, an electrochemical system was applied to cut the heavy metals in semiconductor processing wastewater and also was able to generate a notable volume of recovered water. Consequently, a batch system to treat each 10 L of heavily affected Cadmium ions effluent and recover 70% of those input solutions as a clean water resource was introduced. The systems are prepared with a pair of Polyaniline coated (PAC) electrodes together work under low voltage input, and yet still maintain a high removal efficiency of Cadmium at the maximum rate of 92% and produce reclaimed water over time with 5.5-6.5 L every 60 min. Parameters such as treatment temperature, initial concentration of Cadmium and other pollutants, electrolysis time, and the current efficiency of the system play a significant role during the process. The results obtained from electrode material analysis confirm the successfully preparing of the Polyaniline coated electrode and also describes its behavior under different working conditions. On the other hand, the efficiency of the treatment process is also carefully evaluated by examining the output effluent properties using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) measurement, turbidity measurement, and total solid suspended (TSS) measurement.

Ensemble Species Distribution Model Identifies Survey Opportunities for At-Risk Bearded Beaksedge (<i>Rhynchospora crinipes</i>) in the Southeastern United States	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						at-risk species; ensemble modeling; habitat suitability; SDM	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION; SELECTION; ACCURACY	Locating additional occurrences of at-risk species can inform assessments of their status and conservation needs (including potential legal protections). The perennial bearded beaksedge (Rhynchospora crinipes) ranges from Mississippi to North Carolina, but known occurrences are limited. Because of the species' apparent rarity, a model to identify areas with suitable habitat conditions for the species will allow conservationists to effectively prioritize and allocate scarce surveying resources. We used known occurrence records, a suite of environmental datasets, and four species distribution modeling techniques (generalized additive, GAM; maximum entropy, MaxEnt; generalized boosted, GBM; and weighted ensemble) to generate maps to inform surveys for R. crinipes. The ensemble approach improved predictive performance (AUC-PR = 0.95) compared to other techniques (individual model AUC-PR ranged from 0.7 to 0.8). We also obtained quantitative insights on the species' habitat relationships, including the likelihood of R. crinipes's presence near Atlantic white cedar (Chamaeryparis thyoides) habitat and floodplains, which is consistent with prior field observations. The ensemble model indicated that 3.6% of the study area could be suitable habitat, but only 0.38% had high suitability. Small stream riparian habitats and Atlantic swamp forests in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia had the highest proportion of suitable areas. Prioritizing surveys in areas with model-indicated high habitat suitability is expected to reveal additional R. crinipes occurrences. We suggest surveying efforts for other at-risk species may benefit from using an ensemble modeling approach to identify and prioritize survey areas and improve ecological knowledge of these species.

These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use/land cover. The results showed 1985-1991 and 2002-2015 periods experience fast change and the land use transformation has been accelerating over the whole period. The major changes were caused by the Built-up and Agricultural activities constituting 21.24 % and 13.19 % respectively in the category level. It is recommended that, authorities should consider several structural transformation measures within Ghana, including inter-sectoral land use harmonization icies (e.g. the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act 2016), land use planning and legal reforms to help address	[Nyamekye, Clement; Agyapong, Emmanuel] Koforidua Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB KF 981, Koforidua 00233, Ghana; [Kwofie, Samuel] Koforidua Tech Univ, Dept Gen Studies, POB KF 981, Koforidua 00233, Ghana; [Ghansah, Benjamin] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geomat Engn, Univ POB PMB, Kumasi 00233, Ghana; [Boamah, Linda Appiah] Koforidua Tech Univ, Dept Environm Management Technol, POB KF 981, Koforidua 00233, Ghana	Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology	Nyamekye, C (corresponding author), Koforidua Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn, POB KF 981, Koforidua 00233, Ghana.	nyamekye.clement@ktu.edu.gh; Sam.kwofie@ktu.edu.gh; pecku2000@yahoo.com; agyapongemmanuel12@gmail.com; aferilin@yahoo.com	Nyamekye, Clement/AAK-1863-2020	Nyamekye, Clement/0000-0002-7719-796X; Agyapong, Emmanuel/0009-0001-3440-093X; Ghansah, Benjamin/0000-0001-6117-1418	Koforidua Technical University	Koforidua Technical University	The authors are grateful for the support provided by Koforidua Technical University.

The multi-billion-dollar Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized in 2000 to restore and protect the Everglades ecosystem. However, the progress in implementing CERP projects has been slow because of their size, complexity, and long-term nature. In 2016, a review of CERP recommended updating it, and in 2018, a mid-course assessment was recommended to incorporate new scientific knowledge. This study began a reassessment of the CERP by evaluating the relative importance of a range of factors, including operations, water storage, removal of barriers to water flow, and seepage control. The purpose was to identify those elements most affecting hydrologic and ecological responses in different regions of the Everglades. The South Florida Water Management Model, a regional hydrologic model, was used as a primary tool to simulate the restoration scenarios over a 36-year period (1965-2000). All scenarios provided substantial improvements to the hydrologic system when compared to the existing conditions. However, restoration benefits of these scenarios were unequally distributed across the Everglades landscape. The scenario that expanded the surface storage in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) to2.5 billion m3reduced flood control discharges to the northern estuaries by 66% relative to the existing conditions, which was 8% higher than CERP. However, the scenario with CERP projects significantly increased flows to Everglades National Park. The findings of this study are relevant to Everglades restoration especially in light of recent and emerging science on storage feasibility and climate change.

Storm Surges and coastal flooding were simulated using Advanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) and Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) numerical models, and spatial features of water depths, wave heights and velocities were imported into the ESRI ArcMap using Arc-StormSurge toolbox. SD and GIS were integrated to develop a Spatial System Dynamics (SSD), and applied as a single modeling framework to simulate feedback-based storm surge impacts in time and space. Total damages (direct + indirect) of storm surge events on the community elements were simulated in the SD model. In the SD model, the direct impacts were imported from GIS model through data dynamic exchange procedure, and indirect damages were considered as an estimation of related direct damage of elements in the first day of storm event, which decreases exponentially in the subsequent days. The developed model was applied to the case of Chabahar city, south-east of Iran. Seven storm scenarios were defined based on historical data and hydrodynamic modeling, and the SSD model was run for them. The best estimation of total damages was obtained after 8 days of SSD model simulation, in comparison with reference data. The assessments showed exponential trends of maximum water level rise (MWLR) in relation to the total damage estimation. The functional form of MWLR and estimated total damages was suggested to be used as a fast prediction tool for rapid assessment of storm damages.

However, long sedimentary sequences with a reliable chronological framework from this setting are scarce. Here, we present an integration of lithostratigraphic, rock magnetic, and magnetostratigraphic results for the sedimentary sequence of a 285.0 m core (GZK01) recovered from the northern Jiangsu coastal plain of the onshore South Yellow Sea, eastern China. Alluvial, fluvial, lacustrine, and marine deposits were identified according to lithofacies analysis, and detrital magnetite and hematite are the main magnetic carriers. The magnetostratigraphic results show that core GZK01 records the Brunhes, Matuyama, Gauss, and Gilbert chrons, and has an extrapolated basal age of similar to 5.1 Ma. This record is the oldest sedimentary sequence yet reported from the continental shelf of the South Yellow Sea. Integrating the geochronological framework with changes in lithofacies, a conceptual model of the environmental evolution of the northern Jiangsu coastal plain is proposed. For a long interval during the Pliocene, the drilling area was a lacustrine environment. From the Late Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene, the disappearance of the paleolake and a transition to a fluvial and marine environment suggests the peneplanation of the northern Jiangsu coastal plain. Cumulative land-sea interactions since 0.8 Ma subsequently shaped the modern geomorphology. The observed process of sedimentary evolution was possibly controlled by regional tectonics and long-term climate changes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the high accuracy prediction of flood susceptible areas plays a key role in flood warnings and risk reduction. The main objective of this study is to propose novel hybridizations of fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), Index of Entropy (IoE), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for predicting the areas susceptible to floods. Buzau river catchment (Romania) was the area on which the present study was focused. In this regard, a database with 205 flooded locations, 205 non-flood locations and 12 flood predictors was established and used to train and validate the flood susceptibility models. The performance of the proposed models was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and statistical metrics. The results show that all the hybrid models have a high prediction performance and outperform the stand-alone models. Among them, the SVM-IoE model (AUC = 0.979) has the highest performance, followed by the FAHP-IoE (AUC = 0.97), IoE (AUC = 0.969), SVM (AUC = 0.966) and FAHP (AUC = 0.947). These results highlight a very high efficiency of all the applied models. The application of the models mentioned above revealed that a percentage between 12.5% (FPIIoE) and 21.2% (FPIFAHP) of the study area is characterized by high and very high exposure to these hydrological hazards.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of floods on Maternal and Newborn Healthcare (MNH) utilization in Bangladesh between the years 2011 and 2014. Methods We used variables from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2014 data and georeferenced data of floods between 2011 and 2014 from the Emergency Events Database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether the flood-affected exposures were significant in predicting differences in MNH utilization. Results The odds for the received antenatal care by skilled providers, institutional deliveries, deliveries by c-section, and postnatal care of the babies were significantly lower (Unadjusted OR = 0.81, 0.88, 0.83, and 0.82 respectively; P < 0.05) in the flood-affected area than the non-affected area. Additionally, the odds of postnatal checkup of women was statistically significant (P < 0.001) and less likely to be received in flood-affected area (OR = 0.76). The odds of all indicators were significantly lower (OR < 1) for the women living in the twice and four times flooded areas compared to the once flooded areas. Conclusions for Practice The study shows that floods can have a negative impact on MNH utilization. In addition, repeated floods have a worse impact on MNH utilization than incidental floods. Extra effort should be put on ensuring access to MNH of women in flood-affected areas.

In hydrological modeling, it is a challenging task to quantify the major hydrological components like runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), and total water storage (TWS) due to improper and limited availability of detailed meteorological datasets. Furthermore, there has been no consensus to answer a-decade-long critical question that a less data-intensive models can be an alternate to robust data-intensive models in data scarce conditions. This study aims at multi-model approach over the single models usage for representing the hydrological behaviour in the Kangsabati River Basin (KRB), India. It is done by applying the standard model selection criteria over various hydrological models. Two hydrological models are selected, a semi- distributed model, Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC-3 L), and a conceptually lumped model, Identification of unit Hydrograph and Component flows from Rainfall, Evapotranspiration and Streamflow (IHACRES). Both models were calibrated against the observed daily discharge at the KRB outlet for the period of 2001-2006 and validated for 2008-2010. The results show that both VIC-3 L and IHACRES produce reasonable runoff estimates at daily and monthly time scale in the KRB. The ET estimates show that VIC-3 L and IHACRES captured the seasonal variations with the percent change of 0.4% and 6.6% respectively. As IHACRES is simpler, parsimonious, fewer parameters, and better performances, it can be useful for hydrological modeling in data-scarce regions.

However, the concept of natural variations and the complex physical mechanisms hidden in the observed data sets must also be taken into consideration. This study aims to examine the matter further with reference to inter-decadal variability in extreme precipitation quantiles appropriate for risk analysis. Temporal changes in extreme precipitation are assessed using a parametric approach incorporating a regional method in region-of-influence form. The index-flood method with the application of generalized extreme value distribution is used to estimate the decadal extreme precipitation. The study also performs a significance test to determine whether the decadal extremes are significant. A case study is performed on the Yangtze River Basin, where annual maximum 1-day precipitation data for 180 stations were analyzed over a 50-year period from 1961 to 2010. Extreme quantiles estimated from the 1990s data emerged as the significant values on several occasions. The immediate drop in the quantile values in the following decade, however, suggested that it is not practical to assign more weight to recent data for the quantile estimation process. The temporal patterns identified are in line with the previous studies conducted in the region and thus make it an alternative way to perform decadal analysis with an advantage that the scheme can be transferred to ungauged conditions.

Management challenges related to long-term ecological impacts, complex stressor interactions, and different assessment approaches in the Danube River Basin	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EU Habitat Directive; EU Water Framework Directive; hydrograph; hydropower production; multiple stressors; navigation; neozoa; river regulation	MULTIPLE HUMAN STRESSORS; RESTORATION OPTIONS; FRESH-WATER; FISH; PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEMS; EXTENSION; MARINE	For centuries, rivers have experienced massive changes of their hydromorphic structures due to human activities. The Danube River, the second largest river in Europe, is a case in point for long-term societal imprint. Resulting human-induced pressures are a key issue for river management, aiming to improve the ecological conditions and guarantee the provision of ecosystem services. As the most international river basin in the world, the management of the Danube is particularly challenging and needs a well-organized cooperation of 19 nations. The recent river basin management plan has identified pollution and hydromorphological alterations as most pressing problems, but it has also acknowledged newly emerging issues. In this article, we present 3 specific examples of highly relevant issues for the future river basin management of the Danube: (a) long-term impacts in the catchment such as changes in flood patterns and potential ecological consequences; (b) complex feedback loops linking the spread of neozoa with intertwined stressor responses due to river engineering for different purposes; and (c) linkages between different assessment approaches based on European legal frameworks to analyse the specific pressures at different spatial scales. These examples highlight the need for a more integrated approach in future Danube River Basin management schemes. Furthermore, large-scale effects such as climate change and interactions of multiple pressures need to be addressed in future management to increase resilience of the river system and to allow a sustainable ecosystem-based management of rivers.

Examining the pluvial to nival river regime spectrum using nonlinear methods: Minimum delay embedding dimension	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Streamflow; Climate change; Pluvial-nival spectrum; Delay embedding space; Nonlinear analysis; False nearest neighbor	GREAT-SALT-LAKE; ON-SNOW EVENTS; FLOW REGIMES; DYNAMICS; CLASSIFICATION; FREQUENCY; HYDROLOGY; FLOODS; SCALE	The nonlinear dynamics of streamflow time series from 667 reference hydrometric stations in North America spanning the pluvial-nival hydrological continuum are explored using minimum embedding dimensions as determined by False Nearest Neighbor (FNN) methods. Simulations using synthetic time series demonstrate that snowmelt dominated time series have lower embedding dimensions than those that are rainfall dominated, and that mixtures of the two processes result in a nearly linear change in the embedding dimension. The majority of the reference hydrometric stations drop below a 1% threshold at a dimension less than 30, showing a high degree of natural complexity in the signals ranging from annual snowmelt to weather-driven pseudo-stochastic systems. A less restrictive threshold, 5% is suggested to be more appropriate for streamflow time series. Time series smoothing impacts the embedding dimension and over-smoothing results in incorrect reductions of embedding dimensions. The relationship of the embedding dimensions to watershed and statistical properties of streamflow record showed the lowest embedding dimensions are restricted to large drainage areas, high elevations, and large mean annual flows and variance, high autocorrelations, and large fractions of the records with only small changes in magnitude. Times series that have a large proportion of consecutive days of equal streamflow typically result in higher embedding dimensions. Mapping of the embedding dimension shows spatial patterns related to the streamflow generating processes and geographical features. The use of embedding dimension resolved different dynamics across the hydrological continuum for rainfall to snowmelt over many climate zones. Changes in the embedding dimension might indicate process changes related to climate variability and change.	[Aksamit, N. O.; Whitfield, P.

Growth/climate responses suggested that mean maximum temperature (T-max) was the limiting factor affecting radial growth of PJ trees in the study region. According to the correlation analysis between the ring-width index and meteorological data, a June-July mean maximum temperature (Tmax6-7) series between 1772 and 2004 was reconstructed by using the standard chronology. For the calibration period (1959-2004), the explained variance of the reconstruction was 41.6%. During the last 233 years, there were 36 warm years and 34 cold years, accounting for 15.5% and 14.7% of the total reconstruction years, respectively. Cold periods occurred in 1899-1913, 1955-1970, and 1975-1989, while warm periods occurred in 1881-1888. The reconstructed temperature series corresponded to the historical disaster records of extreme climatic events (e.g., drought and flood disasters) in this area. Comparisons with other temperature reconstructions from surrounding areas and spatial correlation analysis between the gridded temperature data and reconstruction series indicated that the regional climatic variations were well captured by the reconstruction. In addition, multi-taper method spectral analysis indicated the existence of significant periodicities in the reconstructed series. The significant spatial correlations between the reconstructed temperature series and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), solar activity, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) suggested that the temperature in the CBM area indicated both local-regional climate signals and global-scale climate changes.

On the basis of the reservoir index (RI), a modified reservoir index (MRI) was put forward and used as a covariate to represent the effects of reservoirs on extreme flows. Using the generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), nonstationary flood frequency models were developed with the MRI covariate. The models were applied to fit the annual maximum daily flow (AMDF) from 1956 to 2013 at Boluo, the control gauge station of the Dongjiang River (DJR) basin, which is strongly influenced by reservoirs. In addition, to avoid the potential impacts of climatic variability on extreme flows, a precipitation covariate that characterizes the key climatological properties is taken into account in the nonstationary flood frequency models. The results show that the MRI is superior to the RI to reflect the effects of reservoirs on the extreme flows which is more effective and practical. And it is a significant explanatory variable for the extreme flows in the nonstationary modeling. A significant effect of the reservoirs on the extreme flows is detected with the MRI and this effect is greater than the precipitation effect. In addition, with the increasing demand for water resources and the transformation of reservoir functions, the effects of the reservoirs on extreme flows in the DJR basin will further increase.

A survey of the Late Roman period (3rd-6th century AD): Pollen, NPPs and seeds/fruits for reconstructing environmental and cultural changes after the floods in Northern Italy	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Archaeobotany; Palynomorphs; Palaeoenvironment; Late roman; Mutina; Emilia-romagna	EMILIA-ROMAGNA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BRONZE-AGE; PLAIN; EVOLUTION; REMAINS; SPORES; PALEOECOLOGY; INFORMATION; NETHERLANDS	In this paper, we focus on the most critical but low-studied Late Roman phase (3rd-6th century AD) of Mutina, an important Roman colony situated in Northern Italy. During this period, partly including the Late Antique, the seasonal variability with inconstant precipitation might have been responsible for devastating flood events. In the Po Plain, lying on four regions of Northern Italy (Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto), an impressive set of flood events occurred that resulted in evident, sometimes thick sediment strata, in between the Roman archaeological layers, and after their full deposition. The research is a key example of integrated archaeobotanical analyses based on five archeological sites (on-site records) excavated within the modern city of Modena and studied for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Plant micro- and macro-remains were analysed in the framework of interdisciplinary archaeological studies, aiming at reconstructing the main floristic, vegetational and palaeoecological features of Mutina and its surroundings. Since early phases of the Roman age, there have been wetlands and thinly scattered mixed oakwoods that together with human environments, i.e. cereal fields and gardens, characterised the plant landscape of the area. Interestingly, during the Late Roman period, the woodland cover increased. Overall, the archaeobotany studies highlighted the effects of the floods on the city of Modena and its surroundings showing that subsequent episodes of floods favoured the expansion or spreading of wetlands with the development of hygrophilous woods in the later phases, after the flood of the 6th century AD.

There is a need for a sustainable initiative across the national, regional, and local levels to manage this degenerative process. To date, however, measures for mitigating climate change impacts remain insufficient. There is also the need for a further push in thinking about how coastal archaeology and culturally submerged sites may be remembered or, if on the cards, protected. The Coastal and Intertidal Zone Archaeological Network (CITiZAN), a national project working across coastal sites in England, works with communities to support and empower them in identifying and understanding their immediate environment and the relevance of the heritage therein. In this article, the CITiZAN team presents the range of vulnerable coastal heritage found across England, discusses why there is limited capacity or resources to protect these sites, and highlights the communities that have either reactively or proactively responded to changing climate conditions and, in so doing, provide examples of resourcefulness and resilience. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of communities in understanding intertidal-zone and coastal heritage, and the relevance of water heritage to understanding climate change impacts terrestrially. Miles de importantes sitios arqueologicos y patrimoniales se encuentran en las costas de todos los continentes, amenazados por perdidas y danos por el aumento del nivel del mar y otros impactos en cascada, como inundaciones, deslizamientos de tierra, aumento de la salinizacion, erosion o incluso el cambio de ser patrimonio basado en la tierra a ser patrimonio sumergido o subacuatico. Existe la necesidad de una iniciativa sostenible a nivel nacional, regional y local para gestionar este proceso degenerativo. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha, las medidas para mitigar los impactos del cambio climatico siguen siendo insuficientes. Tambien existe la necesidad de un mayor impulso para pensar en como la arqueologia costera y los sitios culturalmente sumergidos pueden ser recordados o, de ser posible, protegidos. La Red Arqueologica de la Zona Costera e Intermareal (CITiZAN, por sus siglas en ingles), un proyecto nacional que trabaja en sitios costeros en Inglaterra, trabaja con las comunidades para apoyarlas y empoderarlas en la identificacion y comprension de su entorno inmediato y la relevancia del patrimonio ahi. En este articulo, el equipo de CITiZAN presenta la gama de patrimonio costero vulnerable que se encuentra en Inglaterra, analiza por que existen capacidades o recursos limitados para proteger estos sitios y destaca las comunidades que han respondido de manera reactiva o proactiva a las condiciones climaticas cambiantes y, al hacerlo, proporcionan ejemplos de ingenio y resiliencia. El articulo concluye destacando la importancia de las comunidades en la comprension del patrimonio costero y de la zona intermareal, y la relevancia del patrimonio acuatico para comprender los impactos del cambio climatico en la tierra.

Une initiative durable est necessaire aux niveaux nationaux, regionaux et locaux pour faire face a ce processus de degeneration. Toutefois, a ce jour les mesures visant a l'attenuation des impacts lies au climat demeurent insuffisantes. Il existe egalement un besoin d'une reflexion supplementaire accrue sur la maniere dont les sites cotiers archeologiques et culturels submerges peuvent etre commemores ou si cela est ineluctable, etre proteges.

The southern Korean Peninsula witnessed record-breaking rainfall during the summer of 2020, resulting in an extreme flood event that caused extensive damage to the riparian ecosystem along the Seomjin River. This study was aimed at identifying the composite factors of riparian vegetation destruction along the entire river. Based on a spatially explicit multilevel approach, it was found that large-scale geomorphic characteristics (i.e., alternation of plain and valley topographies) appeared to be essential determinants of hydraulic characteristics of the channel (e.g., shear stress and specific energy), which were the leading causes of vegetation destruction. Moreover, at small spatial scales, several trees situated upstream of a vegetation patch protected other plants on the patch from the direct hydraulic impact of the flood, thereby serving as 'shield' trees. These findings indicate that scale-dependent fluvial biogeomorphic processes take place during extreme flood events; hence, identifying the optimal scales of these processes and associated factors could help in further understanding riparian hydrology from a biogeomorphic point of view. This study suggests that hydrologists consider both geomorphological and ecological factors when studying hydrological processes. At large spatial scales, at which valley and plain areas alternate over space (left), hydraulic variables (e.g., shear stress and specific energy) were found to be important indicators of vegetation destruction during an extreme flood, whereas at fine scales (right), preflood distribution of 'shield' trees seemed to protect vegetation patches from the physical disturbance.image	[Lee, Keonhak] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Korean Reg Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Cheolho] Inha Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci & Bioengn, Incheon, South Korea; [Baek, Donghae] Korea Environm Inst, Environm Assessment Grp, Sejong, South Korea; [Park, Gunwoo; Kim, Daehyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Geog, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Shim, Taeyong] Korea Univ, OJEong Resilience Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Won] Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Dept Hydro Sci & Engn Res, Goyang, South Korea; [Cho, Kang-Hyun] Inha Univ, Coll Nat Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Incheon, South Korea	Seoul National University (SNU); Inha University; Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Seoul National University (SNU); Korea University; Korea Institute of Civil Engineering & Building Technology (KICT); Inha University	Kim, D (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Social Sci, Dept Geog, Seoul 08826, South Korea.	biogeokim@snu.ac.kr		Lee, Keonhak/0000-0002-3821-7462; Lee, Cheolho/0000-0003-1849-139X; Shim, Taeyong/0000-0003-4183-4557	Seoul National University; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [2021R1I1A2047661];  [200-20220056]	Seoul National University; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); 	The members of the Fluvial Biogeomorphology Working Group of the Korean Society of Ecology and Infrastructure Engineering inspired and encouraged us to pursue this topic.

To mitigate tsunami disasters, the insurance industry plays a vital role in implementing risk transfer measures by providing financial protection against asset damage. However, the current research on catastrophe insurance policies for coastal infrastructure lacks consideration of climate change effects. It is essential to take into account the non-stationary effects of sea-level rise to develop long-term tsunami disaster mitigation measures and promote socioeconomic resilience in coastal communities. This paper aims to provide an insurance portfolio optimization framework for coastal residential buildings subjected to tsunamis considering non-stationary sea-level rise effects based on a stochastic simulation approach. A spatiotemporal probabilistic sea-level rise hazard assessment is carried out by utilizing available climate models and considering several emission scenarios. Tsunami propagation analyses under various sea-level rise cases are performed to evaluate the time-variant tsunami hazard curves based on Monte Carlo simulation. A life cycle-based stochastic insurance claim model associated with the cumulative loss of building assets is developed based on a non-stationary compound renewal process. Finally, a sample average approximation method is leveraged to estimate the optimum basic insurance premium rate by maximizing the insurer's profit under a cost-constrained insurance purchase decision of homeowners. As a case study, the proposed framework is applied to multiple municipalities situated in the tsunami-prone region of Kochi Prefecture, Japan. Sea-level rise substantially decreases the maximum profits of tsunami insurers and increases the premium rate and ruin probability.

In this study, we focused on the Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), an iconic species in the Lagoa do Peixe National Park (LP) in southern Brazil. Our objective was to investigate the factors that influence the foraging habitat selection of flamingos and assess the impact of artificial lagoon openings on their occupancy. We collected monthly physical and biological data of foraging areas from October 2021 to September 2022. Using generalized linear mixed models, we construct habitat selection models that linked Chilean Flamingo presence to the environmental variables collected. The results revealed that water depth, salinity, distance from the shore, and the abundance of polychaetas and vegetal fragments significantly determine the flamingos' foraging habitat selection in the lagoon. These factors are directly affected by artificial openings and the subsequent summer drought. Furthermore, we observed variations in habitat suitability during the flooded and dry seasons, leading to significant changes in the relationship between environmental variables and flamingo presence. These findings highlight the potential influence of management decisions on the presence of the species in the region. It emphasizes the urgent need for multidisciplinary decision-making groups and the establishment of short, medium, and long-term conservation goals to protect Lagoa do Peixe, safeguard the Chilean Flamingos, and assure the subsistence of local communities.

Among the variables that can influence river streamflow are precipitation and land use, which can intensify the occurrence of extreme events. The objective of this work is to identify trends in the time series of minimum and maximum streamflows, on a monthly and annual scale, in a tropical basin, based on nonparametric techniques. We also aim to analyze the main climatic and anthropic factors that can explain the changes in the rates of streamflow. The Mann-Kendall, modified Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used at different levels of significance, as well as the Theil-Sen slope, to identify the magnitude of the trends found. The results showed that the minimum and maximum streamflows had a decreasing tendency in the dry period of the basin, specifically in October. Changes in the monthly time series occurred mainly in 2012. Precipitation behaved similarly to that observed in streamflows, with significant changes in the dry and rainy seasons, mainly in the north of the basin. Land use and land cover showed little variation in the analyzed period and was not considered a determining factor in streamflow changes. The application of different statistical methods allowed for finding satisfactory results for the behavior of water in the basin, while the analysis of climatic and anthropic factors made it possible to know their possible influences on changes in streamflow trends.

The region has sustained several disasters over the past decades. These events include annual floods in 2004-2019 and extreme droughts (1990-1993); other climate-induced disasters, such as cyclones, also have had devastating impacts, particularly on the Indian Ocean island states and east coast countries. To reduce the risk and impacts of disasters, governments must invest in disaster risk reduction (DRR). However, interventions aimed at reducing social and economic vulnerability and investing in long-term mitigation activities are often few, poorly funded, and insignificant in comparison with money spent on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and post-disaster reconstruction. This study investigated whether DRR is adequately funded within SADC member states in light of the high stakes in human life, infrastructure, and economic losses and the potential savings involved. The study applied a qualitative research design with data collected through semistructured interviews and focus group discussions. Respondents were selected purposefully and through snowball sampling with a total of 67 respondents from Botswana, Eswatini, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe participating in the study. The study findings reveal that DRR is inadequately funded in all the member states consulted in comparison to funding allocated to disaster response. In light of the underfunding experienced by DRR activities, this study provides a platform for lobbying and advocacy for adequate funding for DRR.

The valley is recurrently prone to catastrophic floods with increased Total runoff frequency in recent decades (post-2010 periods). LANDSAT ETM+ satellite image based land use/land cover mapping exhibited the dominance of vegetation cover (46%) primarily in the peripheral hilly regions, in contrast to agricultural land (29%) and built-up (1.6%) in the elongated valley region. The high anomalous rainfall (>500 mm) in most of the catchments during 2014-2018 caused an increased runoff apparently leading to catastrophic floods inundation (as observed in 2014 with accumulated rainfall of 713 mm and cumulative Total Runoff of 55 LCM). A higher contribution towards Total Runoff in northern catchments (>56%) exhibited higher susceptibility to flood inundation as compared to the southern catchments (<42%). The study highlighted a high vulnerability in the large proportion of built-up land (148 km2) within close proximity to Jhelum river and below 1560m elevation range due to the erratic rainfall induced runoff floods. The insignificant proportion of built-up led to less contribution towards the high runoff yet increases the severity of runoff and flood inundation due to high imperviousness. The rapid built-up growth coupled with deterioration of natural wetlands in the urban-rural fringe increased the impact of catastrophic flood manifolds. The study provided a regional and comprehensive runoff assessment that can be utilized to develop adequate flood control measures at the catchment level in the valley.

Rapid and efficient flood forecasting is crucial. However, traditional hydrological simulation methods that rely on site distribution are limited by the limited availability of data and cannot provide fast and accurate flood monitoring information. Therefore, this study took the flood event in Huoqiu County in 2020 as an example and proposes a three-dimensional flood monitoring method based on active and passive satellites, which provides effective information support for disaster prevention and mitigation. The experimental results indicated the following: (1) the flood-inundated area was 704.1 km(2), with the Jiangtang Lake section of the Huaihe River and the southern part of Chengdong Lake being the largest affected areas; (2) water levels in the study area ranged from 15.36 m to 17.11 m, which is 4-6 m higher than the original water level. The highest flood water level areas were the Jiangtang Lake section and the flat area in the south of Chengdong Lake, with Chengdong Lake and the north of Chengxi Lake having the greatest water level increase; (3) the flood water depth was primarily between 4 m and 7 m, with a total flood storage capacity of 2833.47 million m(3), with Jiangtang Lake having the largest flood storage capacity; and (4) the rainstorm and flood disaster caused a direct economic loss of approximately CNY 7.5 billion and affected a population of approximately 91 thousand people. Three-dimensional monitoring of floods comprehensively reflects the inundation status of floods and can provide valuable information for flood prediction and management.

J	Wang, Y; Gao, L; Ming, Y; Zhao, LB				Wang, Yao; Gao, Lei; Ming, Yue; Zhao, Lingbin			Recent Declines in Nutrient Concentrations and Fluxes in the Lower Changjiang River	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Nutrients; Changjiang (Yangtze) River; Discharge; Seasonal variations; Decadal trends	ANTHROPOGENIC PHOSPHORUS INPUTS; DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON; YANGTZE-RIVER; DONGTING LAKE; BOHAI SEA; CHINA; NITROGEN; BASIN; IMPACTS; HUANGHE	To elucidate nutrient variation patterns and trends over various timescales under combined effects of human activities and climate change, nutrient concentrations were monitored monthly in Lower Changjiang (Yangtze) River from November 2016 to August 2020. They were also monitored daily during an extreme flood in July 2020. Over daily and seasonal timescales, the Changjiang River discharges had a dominant influence on nutrient concentrations. By combining existing data over recent decades with those from the current study, we found that turning points for concentration trends for most nutrients emerged in the recent decade (2010-2020), i.e., 2012 for NO3-, PO43-, and NH4+ and 2014 for SiO32-. After these turning point years, NO3-, SiO32-, and PO43- concentrations decreased at annual rates of 2.953, 3.746, and 0.108 mu M/year, respectively. Regarding NO3- and PO43-, their concentrations and fluxes increased from 1960s to 2012, similar to the increasing trends of anthropogenic N and P fertilizer inputs from the drainage basin. After 2012, concentrations and fluxes of NO3- and PO43- showed significant decreasing trends, largely due to the control of N and P fertilizer usage. A comparison among eight rivers in East and South China (including the Changjiang River) indicated that basin latitudes were essential to determining areal nutrient yields, implying that latitude-related factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and areal population density, significantly impacted nutrient fluxes. This study emphasized that the deteriorating Changjiang River aquatic environment (which lasted from 1960s to 2010) has been successfully terminated over the last 10 years in 2010s.

We review the results of experiments that evaluated the effects of the global change factors carbon dioxide, ozone, temperature, drought, flooding, and salinity on plant symbioses with beneficial Epichloe endophytes. The factors affected the performance of both plants and endophytes as well as the frequency of plants symbiotic with the fungus. Elevated carbon dioxide levels and low temperatures differentially influenced the growth of plants and endophytes, which could compromise the symbioses. Furthermore, we summarise the plant stage in which the effects of the factors were quantified (vegetative, reproductive, or progeny). The factors ozone and drought were studied at all plant stages, but flooding and carbon dioxide were studied in just a few of them. While only studied in response to ozone and drought, evidence showed that the effects of these factors on symbiotic plants persisted trans-generationally. We also identified the putative mechanisms that would explain the effects of the factors on plant-endophyte associations. These mechanisms included the increased contents of reactive oxygen species and defence-related phytohormones, reduced photosynthesis, and altered levels of plant primary metabolites. Finally, we describe the counteracting mechanisms by which endophytes would mitigate the detrimental effects of the factors on plants. In presence of the factors, endophytes increased the contents of antioxidants, reduced the levels of defence-related phytohormones, and enhanced the plant uptake of nutrients and photosynthesis levels. Knowledge gaps regarding the effects of global change on plant-endophyte associations were identified and discussed.

The flow of water and the trends of temperature (6.1-27.2 degrees C) and rainfall (300-600 mm) (1967-2018) were investigated using Mann-Kendall and Sen's tests. The hydrologic cycle was investigated using 22 observing wells and was subsequently simulated using the WetSpass (Water and Energy Transfer between Soil, Plants and Atmosphere under quasi Steady State) model in which the input variables including climate, potential evapotranspiration, soil layer, ground water level, topography, slope and land use were integrated in ArcView GIS maps. The land use in the region was illustrated by Landsat, and was processed by ENVI for the production of the final maps for use in the model. The output variables of the model were plant cover, land use, flooding pathways, rain-harvesting, rainfall-runoff, and charging and discharging of groundwater level. The maximum total yearly runoff of 724 mm, cold season of 632 mm and warm season of 250 mm were estimated by the model. The maximum of yearly groundwater charging of 91 mm, discharge (warm season) of 25 mm and yearly rain-harvesting of 145 mm were also estimated by the model. The WetSpass model simulated the hydrologic cycle in the region with a high accuracy. If land use is managed properly in the region, it would be possible to increase the efficiency of water sources.

Under the influence of the reservoirs operation and climate change, the general hydrological regime in the JRB has been altered. Although the change process can be determined through a runoff time-series analysis and hydrological simulation, the individual impacts of the reservoirs have not been quantified. This study aimed to clarify the impact of the reservoirs in the JRB on the runoff, flood, and drought processes using a framework coupling long short-term memory (LSTM) and flood drought assessment techniques. The results are as follows: (1) From 1998 to 2020, reservoirs in the JRB changed the average daily runoff at Pingshan Station by -5.64%, +10.95%, and -10.93% at the annual and seasonal (dry and rainy) scales, respectively. (2) The operation of dams reduces the risk of flood disasters effectively. Compared with the natural river flow, the flood frequency decreased by 7.69%, and the total flow over the threshold was reduced by 37.86%. (3) The operation of dams has changed the duration and severity of drought, reducing extreme drought and increasing moderate and severe drought. In conclusion, the reservoirs in the JRB have positive effects on water resource regulation, and their mitigation of floods and extreme drought provides security for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This study provides a reference for the LSTM modeling of reservoir basins, quantifying the impact of reservoirs on runoff, flood, and drought in the JRB.

An appraisal of carbon capture and sequestration in few selected wetlands of West Bengal	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Wetlands; Carbon; Climate change; West Bengal	ORGANIC-CARBON; RESTORED WETLANDS; VEGETATION; MATTER; AREA; LAKE	Wetlands provide numerous ecological and economic services to mankind. The soils of wetlands are one of the largest sinks of carbon (C) among the terrestrial ecosystems and can play an important role in offsetting the emission of C as a greenhouse gas (GHG) to the atmosphere. India is bestowed with enriched wetland ecosystems that support diverse and unique habitats. The potential of the wetlands in terms of C capture and sequestration has not been quantified. Therefore, in the present paper, an assessment of C capture from different sources and its ultimate deposition in soils leading to sequestration has been done in three different types of wetlands, one created sewage-fed and two natural floodplain oxbow lakes, in the West Bengal state of India. Multiple seasonal sampling of water, macrophytes, and soil was done to assess the primary productivity, dissolved C, and deposition of C in soils of the wetlands in comparison to reference upland sites. All these wetlands are productive ecosystems as indicated by the physicochemical parameters of water and soil. The quantity of C accumulated up to 0.3 m depth in the oxbow lakes was to the tune of 144-166 Mg/ha, which was 3.43-4.78 times higher than that in the corresponding reference upland sites. In the sewage-fed wetland, the C accumulation estimated as 50 Mg/ha was 1.27 times higher than its corresponding upland site. So, the wetland ecosystems, particularly the floodplains, are highly efficient in accumulating C in their soils and thus can somewhat negate the GHG emission.

J	Finley, JB; Robinson, E; DeRose, RJ				Finley, Judson Byrd; Robinson, Erick; DeRose, R. Justin			Arroyo formation impacts on an early dryland agricultural community in Northeastern Utah, USA	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						alluvial geoarchaeology; arroyo problem; dryland agriculture; Fremont	MAIZE AGRICULTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SALT-LAKE; FREMONT; VARIABILITY; SETTLEMENT; PLATEAU; CARBON; CREEK; BASIN	Indigenous Fremont farmers in Cub Creek, a part of northeastern Utah's Dinosaur National Monument, occupied the northern ecological margin of maize cultivation in western North America from A.D. 300 to 1300. Agriculture in Cub Creek was a response to multidecadal precipitation variability, but when precipitation stabilized between A.D. 750 and 1050, agricultural conditions improved and populations expanded to form villages along the floodplains of local dryland streams. Did the very same conditions (i.e., decreased precipitation variability) that allowed the growth of agricultural societies make them simultaneously vulnerable to arroyo formation, a key geomorphic risk to floodplain agriculturalists? Preliminary results from Cub Creek show that rapid sedimentation punctuated by episodic arroyo formation characterized the last 2000 years. We use stratigraphic and chronological evidence formalized in a Bayesian age model to develop a set of working hypotheses that a 2.5 m-deep discontinuous arroyo formed before either A.D. 1020 or A.D. 1275. The earlier age corresponds with occupation of the Cub Creek village, while the later age corresponds with the end of Fremont agriculture in Cub Creek, and demonstrates regional synchronicity with arroyo formation across the Colorado Plateau. A second arroyo formed before A.D. 1490, indicating rapid alluvial cycling in Cub Creek. We conclude that floodplain instability and arroyo formation combined with the return of the dominant multidecadal precipitation variability regime beginning at A.D. 1050 was a key constraint on the growth potential of local populations. These findings have potential implications for the development of early Indigenous dryland agricultural systems throughout the interior of western North America.

J	Colven, E				Colven, Emma			A political ecology of speculative urbanism: The role of financial and environmental speculation in Jakarta's water crisis	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article						Speculation; speculative urbanism; urban flood risk; urban political ecology; water crisis	LAND SUBSIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GREAT-GARUDA; RISK; URBANIZATION; FUTURE; TRANSFORMATION; INDONESIA; ROOTS; SLUMS	Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, is increasingly characterized by luxury real estate developments and high-profile infrastructural projects made possible by economic liberalization and finance capital. Yet these developments have contributed to Jakarta's struggles with chronic flooding, land subsidence, and water shortages. This paper contributes an empirical study of the spatial-temporal dynamics of speculative urbanism and the associated impacts on water resources and flood events in Jakarta. I use an urban political ecology approach to analyze mainland and offshore development. First, I show how financial speculation generates flood risk and the overexploitation of water resources, producing uneven socio-spatial distributions of risk. These transformations in Jakarta's hydroscape in turn threaten to undermine the city's viability as a site for speculative investment. I thus show how speculative urbanism can be threatened or disrupted by nonhuman agencies. Second, I illustrate a second form of speculation, which I refer to as environmental speculation. As Jakarta's water crisis has cast doubt on the future of the city itself as a place of habitation, the state explored an ambitious and potentially lucrative coastal defense project, while private developers have engaged in land reclamation. The turn toward offshore development illustrates how environmental speculation creates new opportunities for capital accumulation. I advance two arguments: first, in order to capture the full costs of speculative urbanism, it is imperative that urban scholars attend to its ecological dimensions. Second, an urban political ecology approach advances our understandings of speculative urbanism by illuminating its contradictions and limits.

To tackle this, the use of a set of historical flood/drought index (FDI) spanning from AD 1470 to 2000 for 120 sites in China has been made to investigate the multiscale temporal variability of annual precipitation by applying wavelet methods. The analyses reveal oscillating components of the FDI time series from the decadal to multi-decadal, and to the quasi-centennial range, as well as in the interannual range. Furthermore, the relationships of the FDI with the dominant mode of oscillations in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, i.e., the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, on a range of time scales have been probed by cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence methods. Statistically significant coherence between FDI and ENSO index time series has been found for regions in eastern China south of the Yangtze River (inclusive) at the decadal to multi-decadal time scale (10- to 50-yr) after 1750, as well as for north China on the 10- to 30-year range in the eighteenth century. The FDI is less coherent with the ENSO index for other regions of China. The results of the present study may add to our understanding of the connections between long-term changes of annual precipitation and large-scale oscillations in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, and provide a scientific basis for developing policies to adapt to future changes in water abundance.

J	Tripathy, P; Malladi, T				Tripathy, Pratyush; Malladi, Teja			Global Flood Mapper: a novel Google Earth Engine application for rapid flood mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood; Disaster; Sentinel-1; SAR; Google Earth Engine; Climate change	DISASTER RESPONSE; RISK; WATER	Timely and accurate information about the extent of floodwater is critical for emergency planning and disaster management efforts. Despite the advances in computational resources and in the field of remote sensing, there is a clear gap that restricts the disaster community from leveraging the technological resources in real time, which impedes on-ground response efforts. To bridge this gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, the paper presents a new web application, the Global Flood Mapper (GFM) that allows the user to generate flood maps quickly and without getting into technical intricacies. To derive the flood extent from Sentinel-1 satellite data, the pre-flood collection is considered as base and anomaly cells in the during-flood image(s) are identified using Z-Score values. Second, it advances an existing flood mapping method to (a) Map the peak of the floods by combining ascending and descending scenes when necessary, and (b) Check for false positives in hilly terrains by adding slope and elevation mask parameters. By comparing our results with Sentinel-2 MSI derived flood maps and field photographs, we show that the GFM can generate flood maps with precision. The GFM can be used to map and download the extent of multiple flood events of an area as vector data (.kml format), which can be a critical input for flood modeling and risk and impact assessments. The GFM shall enable first responders and practitioners across the globe to overcome technical barriers and lack of computational resources to map the extent of inundation during and after floods.

Improved projections on the impact of climate change to critical infrastructure are essential to assist future planning. This paper uses hydro-sedimentary modelling to predict river erosion threats to electricity transmission infrastructure in an urbanised river valley under multiple increasing flow magnitude scenarios. We use a coupled hydrodynamic and landscape evolution model, CAESAR-Lisflood, to simulate river channel changes along a reach of the River Mersey, UK from the present day to 2050. A range of synthetic flow scenarios, based on recent hydrological records, was used in the model ranging from 'no change' up to a flow with 50% higher magnitude. The results revealed: (1) riverbank erosion will pose significant threats to several transmission towers located along the river, requiring intervention to avoid destabilisation by the moving channel; (2) the total area of floodplain erosion and deposition >= 0.5 m deep was positively related to increasing projected flow magnitudes. However, through running a 'low' and 'high' erosion version of the model, the simulations revealed these threats were most sensitive to the calibration of the erosion component of the model, illustrating the challenges and uncertainty in forecasting long-term river channel change; and (3) how long-term simulations can assist in adaptation planning for electricity transmission towers. Further reach- and catchment-scale modelling will be necessary to determine the timings of large floods more accurately, which produce the most significant erosion and deposition events, and to evaluate the efficacy of protections to transmission towers.

Seasonal inundation dynamics and water balance of the Mara Wetland, Tanzania based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						Wetlands; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; Ecosystem Services; Hydrology; Lake Victoria	RIVER-BASIN; INDEX NDWI; REMOTE; FLOODPLAIN; MOISTURE; TRENDS; REGION; COVER; LAKE; SOIL	Anthropogenic hydrologic alternations are a threat to flood dependent wetland ecosystems like The Mara Wetland in Tanzania, which plays an important role in regulating the quality, timing and magnitude of the flow of water into Lake Victoria and provides natural resources and habitat for a variety of species. Baseline information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the seasonal inundation is critical to manage potential threats such as dam construction and local climate change, but is challenging to acquire due to the heterogeneity of the landscape caused by the interspersion of open water and emergent vegetation. In this study, intra- and inter-annual inundation pattern of the Mara Wetland are reproduced for 2017-2019 using remotely sensed data. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm is trained bi-seasonally, using eight Sentinel-2 bands, five water- and vegetation-indices and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) to classify the land cover of the wetland region in a semi-automated way, by processing a total of 73 Sentinel-2 scenes based on wet- and dry-state training images for 2017. The scenes are classified into seven classes; three wetland- and four dryland-classes. The overall classification accuracy achieved (based on an independent validation set) is 98.6%. The inundation extents are used in combination with available hydrological field-data to estimate the water balance. The seasonal expansion and contraction of the wetland follows a consistent bi-modal regime, and the results from the water balance affirm the importance of river-flow during the dry-season and local precipitation for the seasonal fluctuations in water-availability.

New concepts for stormwater man-agement, such as LID (low impact developments) and Bos (best management practices), and the SCP (Sponge City Program) of China become important means to reduce flooding disasters. Specifically, the SCP has gained much attention from scholars and engineers worldwide, and has come into practice across China. How the SCP measures work is a realistic issue, and the rela-tionship between green and grey SCP measures remains to be understood. Therefore, in this study, simulations of the flood response under different sponge measure combinations and rainfall scenarios were carried out, and the synergistic effect of different sponge city measures was determined. The results show that the current LID measures in the study area can effectively control light and high-frequency rainfall but show limited effects with respect to extreme and low-frequency rainfall. The combination of LID measures and drainage system upgrading has a better control effect and should be properly employed to avoid harming the downstream area. Both measures fail when confronting extreme rainfall events, and emergency measures are indispensable. The two measures cooperate better to address rainfall with long recurrence in-tervals and great peak ratios, and show different effects on the alleviation of different flood in-dicators, which indicates SCP planning according to local conditions. A global angle should be adopted, and localized SCP measures are preferred. This pattern is advisable for cities facing flood problems.

Due to climate change and land development, surface runoff has increased. In addition, the functions of flood control engineering facilities have their limits. Surface runoff cannot be fully absorbed by rivers, and frequent floods still occur in some areas. According to the characteristics of water flowing along the terrain to low-lying land, the terrain features can be used to find out the hot areas prone to flooding and the appropriate location of flood storage space for improving flooding. On the basis of the natural terrain environment, the disaster risk framework is used to manage environmental complexity, and to carry out research on flood warning and governance decision-making systems, so that human beings can coexist with the uncertainty of flood risk. In this study, the Zhuoshuixi Basin was used as the sample area, the SCS-CN method was used to analyze the excess runoff, and the risk concept was used to establish a flood evaluation model. In addition, through the changes in land use, the SCS-CN method estimates the difference of potential maximum retention, quantifies the variation of excess rainfall in each watershed division, and uses the digital elevation model to calculate the depression site to analyze the relationship between the difference of potential maximum retention and the depression space of the watershed. The results show that the adaptation strategy for high-risk flooded areas should be strengthened, and areas with large water storage space and a small potential maximum retention difference can be the best location for offsite compensation.

Due to geomorphic alteration of river channels and land-cover change, degradation to floodplain lakes in the Ohio River basin is occurring at a rate that will escalate as climate change causes increased flood intensity and the seasonal redistribution of rainfall. A better understanding of the local drivers that affect oxbow lakes is needed for targeted floodplain restoration efforts designed to slow degradation. We examined the effects of land cover, topography, and hydrologic connectivity on water quality and fish diversity and abundance in nine floodplain lakes with potentially high remnant ecological function in the Wabash-White watershed (Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois). Data collection included water-quality parameters; stable water isotopes; total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a; and fish community diversity and abundance. Results indicate that hay/pasture land cover and decreased topographic relief in the local oxbow watersheds, along with reduced river hydrologic connectivity, were related to an increase in total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a. Greater biodiversity and abundance in fish assemblages were evident in oxbow lakes that were more disconnected from the main channel. The results of this study suggest that hydrologic connectivity of oxbow lakes with the contributing drainage area and the main channel influence nutrients and fish communities. Knowing the influencing factors can help ecosystem managers better protect these valuable floodplain lake ecosystems and prioritize restoration efforts amidst increasing stressors due to climate and land-use changes.

This study investigated the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff and constructed a model for predicting hydrological processes in mining areas with goaf. For this purpose, the control basin of Jingle Hydrology Station in Shanxi Province, which has experienced severe coal mining damage, was taken as the research area. First, based on field investigation, indoor simulation experiments of runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf were designed. Then, according to the experimental results, the runoff mechanism and water balance change in goaf were analyzed, runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf were parameterized and introduced into a hydrological model to simulate floods, and the water balance equation of goaf was introduced into the two-parameter monthly water balance model (MWBM) to simulate annual runoff. Finally, with 1951-2017 as the study period, 1990 was taken as the reference time for the appearance of goaf. By introducing generalized parameters to recalculate 12 flood processes after 1990, the qualification rate of the simulation results increased from 0 to 66.67%. By introducing the goaf water balance equation into MWBM to simulate the runoff process after 1990, the qualification rate of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow increased from 22.22 % to 55.56 %. The introduction of parameters and water balance equation effectively improved the simulation accuracy of the model for predicting floods and annual runoff after large-scale coal mining.

Influence of extraordinary floods on wildlife parasites: the case of gastrointestinal helminths and protozoa of wild canids from the Ibera Ecoregion, Argentina	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Flood; Gastrointestinal parasites; Wild canids; Argentina	DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX; PSEUDALOPEX-GYMNOCERCUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BILE-ACIDS; EL-NINO; TRANSMISSION; SOUTHERN; IDENTIFICATION; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS	Parasites are natural components of ecosystems and play a significant role in the dynamics of wild animal populations. Although the environment of parasites is primarily defined by the host, most life cycles involve stages that must endure external conditions. Rainfall and flooding events are important factors that might influence the transport of parasitic stages, altering soil moisture levels, and resulting in a favorable environment for parasite survival and development. We assessed whether an extraordinary flood event modified the occurrence of gastrointestinal parasites (nematodes and protozoa) in wild canids in two protected areas in northern Argentina. From 2016 to 2018, we collected fecal samples of two fox species, Lycalopex gymnocercus and Cerdocyon thous, and examined the presence of nematodes and protozoa. We assessed changes in the occurrence of these parasites after a flood event, while adjusting for potential confounders (i.e., monthly average temperature, season, host species, site). In a second stage of the analysis, we evaluated whether part of the effect was caused by changes in soil moisture, by adding normalized difference water index as an independent variable. We found that the presence of nematodes in foxes was higher after flooding than before flooding, and this association was not explained by changes in the soil moisture. On the other hand, the flood event was not relevant for protozoa. Stronger and long-lasting flood events are expected due to the effect of global warming on El Nino events, and this may increase and intensify the spread of some parasites affecting wildlife, which could also be of public health concern.

The role of stakeholder attributes, such as the power, legitimacy, and urgency of local governments, in reducing the impact of disasters on built infrastructure remains ambiguous. Stakeholders' organizational attributes, together with socio-economic and built infrastructure conditions, need to be considered to provide a better understanding of how to reduce disaster risk. The main aim of this research was to empirically investigate the mediating role of socio-economic and infrastructure conditions in the direct relationship between stakeholders' attributes and economic damage to road infrastructure from flooding. Survey data collected from local governments in New South Wales, Australia and historical data for over 20 years from archive databases were analyzed using structural equation modeling with the partial least squares estimation approach. The results showed that socio-economic and infrastructure conditions have significant mediating effects on the direct relationship between stakeholders' attributes and flood damage. Engaging stakeholders proactively empowers legitimate stakeholders in urgent conditions, and this is essential to reduce the economic impact of flood disasters and to better manage road infrastructure. Finally, to better manage flood risks, local governments need to improve their capacity of power, legitimacy, and urgency; state and federal governments need to improve the socio-economic conditions of the communities; and the transport infrastructure authorities need to develop long-term solutions for resilient roads and bridges.

This is crucial to accurately assess and predict hydrological processes such as streamflow, drought, and flood. However, simulations of these hydrologic processes from various hydrological models differ in their accuracy. By analyzing different characteristics of hydrological models, selection scores can be used to select the best model for the intended purpose based on their inherit strengths (i.e., some models are better for streamflow prediction). In this study, 13 different criteria were used for the model selection scores including temporal and spatial resolutions, and processes involved. Thereafter, based on different scores, we selected two different hydrological models for streamflow prediction in the Kangsabati River Basin (KRB) in eastern India, namely (1) Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier (GR4J), a conceptual model, and (2) Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), a semi-distributed model. The models were calibrated against the daily observed streamflow at upper KRB (Reservoir) and lower KRB (Mohanpur) from 2000 to 2006 and validated during the period from 2008 to 2010. Despite the differences in model structure and data used, both models simulated streamflow at a daily time scale with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.71-0.82 for the VIC model and 0.63-0.71 for the GR4J. Due to the simpler structure, parsimonious nature, fewer parameters, and reasonable accuracy, the results suggest that a conceptual rainfall-runoff model like GR4J can be used in data-deficient conditions.

All flood hazard and risk assessment suffer from a certain degree of uncertainty due to multiple factors, such as flood frequency analysis, hydrodynamic model calibration, or flood damage (magnitude-damage functions) models. The uncertainty linked to the flood frequency analysis is one of the most important factors (previous and present estimation point to 40%). Flood frequency analysis uncertainty has been approached from different points of view, such as the application of complex statistical models, the regionalization processes of peak flows, or the inclusion of non-systematic data. Here, we present an achievable approach to defining the uncertainty linked to flood frequency analysis by using the Monte Carlo method. Using the city of Zamora as the study site, the uncertainty is delimited by confidence intervals of a peak flow quantile of a 500-year return period. Probabilistic maps are derived from hydrodynamic results, and further analysis include flood hazard maps for human loss of stability and vehicle damage. Although the effect of this uncertainty is conditioned by the shape of the terrain, the results obtained may allow managers to achieve more consistent land-use planning. All those Zamora city results point out the probable underestimation of flood hazard (the higher hazard areas increase around 20%) and risk when the uncertainty analysis is not considered, thus limiting the efficiency of flood risk management tasks.

Daily flow simulation in Thailand Part II: Unraveling effects of reservoir operation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Reservoir effects; Naturalized flow; Scenario analysis; Distributed hydrological model; Wflow_sbm; Chao Phraya basin	PHRAYA RIVER-BASIN; HYDROLOGICAL SIMULATION; HUMAN INTERVENTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LARGE DAMS; LAND-USE; IMPACT; STREAMFLOW; PARAMETERIZATION; HYDROPOWER	Study region: Upper region of the Greater Chao Phraya River (GCPR) basin in Thailand. Study focus: The upper GCPR basin is highly regulated by multipurpose reservoirs, which obviously have altered the natural streamflow. Understanding quantitative effects of such alteration is crucial for effective water resource management. Therefore, this study aims to assess how reservoir operation affects the water balance, daily flow regime and extreme flows in this basin. For this purpose, we reconstructed streamflow in the naturalized (no reservoir) and baseline operation scenarios using the (similar to 1 km resolution) distributed model. To overcome data scarcity, we ran the model with global data and parameterization. A target storage-and-release-based reservoir operation module was applied in the baseline operation scenario. The model results were analyzed in comparison to observations in a wet year, a dry year, and the period 1989-2014. New hydrological insights for the region: The reservoir operation resulted in more evaporation. It inverted the natural flow seasonality and smoothed the daily flow regime with decreasing high flows, increasing mean flows and low flows, greater baseflow contribution, and lower flashiness. It prevented or mitigated many historical extreme flow incidents. The annual flood peaks and minimum flows were markedly mitigated in terms of both magnitudes and frequencies, but their timing became more variable and difficult to predict. Altogether, the results highlighted the importance of effective decision making for real-time operation, which remain challenging in practice.	[Wannasin, C.; Brauer, C. C.; Uijlenhoet, R.; Weerts, A.

This necessitates an objective review of physiological mechanisms and management practices, which could sustain crop productivity under partial or complete submergence. Submergence usually reduces photosynthesis rate that results in quick depletion of the carbohydrate reserve and ultimately the plant dies. Varieties introgressed with SUB1A QTL maintains higher activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and low rate of chlorophyll degradation and thus exhibits better survival under submergence. Prolonged submergence results in a significant reduction in soil redox potential and the heavy influx of flood water promotes runoff, volatilization and deep percolation which leads to loss of sizeable amount of nutrients and ultimately causes nutrient deficiency in soil. Thus, to ensure optimum yield, it is essential to alter the nutrient schedule when plant is subjected to submergence stress. Agronomic management practices like seed priming, higher seed rates, alteration in crop geometry and other improved seeding methods enhance production efficiency by boosting germination, early growth and optimum partitioning of photosynthates to vegetative and reproductive parts. This review critically explores the complex problems faced by rice crop during submergence, physiological mechanisms that helps plant to cope up the submergence stress, as well as available cost-effective management strategies to arrest the yield decline.

This kind of stress may cause severe depression of the plant's growth through inhibition of photosynthesis and oxidative cell damage as well as changes in cell respiration. The present work aimed to study the effect of flooding stress on oxidative and antioxidative parameters in leaves of two maize hybrids (ZP 555 and ZP 606). Leaves of maize plants at the stage of three fully developed leaves were harvested after 6, 24, 72, and 144 h of applied flooding stress. Leaves were used for determination of physiological (the content of photosynthetic pigments and soluble proteins), oxidative stress parameters (the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2) as well as antioxidants (the total polyphenols content, and activity of antioxidative enzymes [catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), and Class III peroxidases (POX, EC, 1.11.1.7)]). Results indicated that flooding stress-induced time-dependent changes of measured parameters and those hybrids differ in response to stress. The noticeable difference between hybrids was detected in the H2O2 and MDA content. An increase in the activity of SOD, POX and polyphenols content, with the most pronounced changes in POX activity and polyphenols concentration, could minimize the cellular damage caused by flooding. The results of the present study suggest that a more robust antioxidative metabolism is essential under flooding stress and could be a protective strategy against oxidative damage induced by flooding in ZP 606 maize plants compared to ZP 555 plants.

Using remote sensing to assess peatland resilience by estimating soil surface moisture and drought recovery	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Blanket bog; SAR; Sentinel-1; Hydrology; Water table dynamics	BLANKET PEAT; EVAPORATION; HYDROLOGY; DYNAMICS	Peatland areas provide a range of ecosystem services, including biodiversity, carbon storage, clean water, and flood mitigation, but many areas of peatland in the UK have been degraded through human land use including drainage. Here, we explore whether remote sensing can be used to monitor peatland resilience to drought. We take resilience to mean the rate at which a system recovers from perturbation; here measured literally as a recovery timescale of a soil surface moisture proxy from drought lowering. Our objectives were (1) to assess the reliability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter as a proxy for water table depth (WTD); (2) to develop a method using SAR to estimate below-ground (hydrological) resilience of peatlands; and (3) to apply the developed method to different sites and consider the links between resilience and land management. Our inferences of WTD from Sentinel-1 SAR data gave results with an average Pearson's correlation of 0.77 when compared to measured WTD values. The 2018 summer drought was used to assess resilience across three different UK peatland areas (Dartmoor, the Peak District, and the Flow Country) by considering the timescale of the soil moisture proxy recovery. Results show clear areas of lower resilience within all three study sites, which often correspond to areas of high drainage and may be particularly vulnerable to increasing drought severity/events under climate change. This method is applicable to monitoring peatland resilience elsewhere over larger scales, and could be used to target restoration work towards the most vulnerable areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Contrasting response of two <i>Lotus corniculatus</i> L. accessions to combined waterlogging-saline stress	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Compartmentalization; flooding; forage; ion transporters; legumes	SALT TOLERANCE; FLOODING TOLERANCE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSES; CONDENSED TANNINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NA+ EXCLUSION; CHLORIDE; GROWTH; EXPRESSION; TRANSPORT	Waterlogging and salinity impair crop growth and productivity worldwide, with their combined effects being larger than the additive effects of the two stresses separately. Here, a common forage tetraploid Lotus corniculatus (cv. San Gabriel) and a diploid L. corniculatus accession, collected from a coastal area with high frequency of waterlogging-saline stress events, were evaluated for tolerance to waterlogging, salinity and these two stresses combined. We hypothesize that, due to its environmental niche, the diploid accession would show better adaptation to combined waterlogging-saline stress compared to the tetraploid L. corniculatus. Plants were evaluated under control conditions, waterlogging, salinity and a combined waterlogging-saline treatment for 33 days. Shoot and root growth were assessed, together with chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange measurements. Results showed that salinity and waterlogging effects were more severe for the tetraploid accession, with a larger effect being observed under the combined stress condition. Concentrations of Na+, Cl- and K+ were measured in apical and basal leaves, and in roots. A larger accumulation of Na+ and Cl- was observed under both saline and combined stress treatments for the tetraploid L. corniculatus, for which ion toxicity effects were evident. The expression of CLC gene, coding for a Cl- transporter, was only increased in diploid L. corniculatus plants in response to the combined stress condition, suggesting that ion compartmentalization mechanisms were induced in this accession. Thus, this recently characterized L. corniculatus could be used for the introduction of new tolerance traits in other Lotus species used as forage.	[Antonelli, C. J.; Calzadilla, P. I.; Campestre, M.

Breaching Barriers: The Fight for Indigenous Participation in Water Governance	WATER			English	Article						tribal recognition; Indigenous rights; environmental justice; clean water act; wetlands; Lumbee; Haliwa-Saponi; Coharie; Meherrin; pipelines	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; RIGHTS; PROTECTION; STANDARDS; SHELLFISH; BASIN	Indigenous peoples worldwide face barriers to participation in water governance, which includes planning and permitting of infrastructure that may affect water in their territories. In the United States, the extent to which Indigenous voices are heard-let alone incorporated into decision-making-depends heavily on whether or not Native nations are recognized by the federal government. In the southeastern United States, non-federally recognized Indigenous peoples continue to occupy their homelands along rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. These peoples, and the Tribal governments that represent them, rarely enter environmental decision-making spaces as sovereign nations and experts in their own right. Nevertheless, plans to construct the Atlantic Coast Pipeline prompted non-federally recognized Tribes to demand treatment as Tribal nations during permitting. Actions by the Tribes, which are recognized by the state of North Carolina, expose barriers to participation in environmental governance faced by Indigenous peoples throughout the United States, and particularly daunting challenges faced by state-recognized Tribes. After reviewing the legal and political landscapes that Native nations in the United States must navigate, we present a case study focused on Atlantic Coast Pipeline planning and permitting. We deliberately center Native voices and perspectives, often overlooked in non-Indigenous narratives, to emphasize Indigenous actions and illuminate participatory barriers. Although the Atlantic Coast Pipeline was cancelled in 2020, the case study reveals four enduring barriers to Tribal participation: adherence to minimum standards, power asymmetries, procedural narrowing, and "color-blind" planning. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for federal and state governments, developers, and Indigenous peoples to breach these barriers.

Physics of building vulnerability to debris flows, floods and earth flows	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Debris flows; Floods; Landslides; Buildings; Vulnerability; Impact analysis	FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSLIDE; DAMAGE; MODEL; SIMULATION; HAZARDS; ZHOUQU; EVENT	Mass flows such as landslides and floods pose great risks to the built environment. In the literature the assessment of the building vulnerability to these different mass flows is evaluated separately and little effort has been made to investigate the interaction mechanisms between mass flows and buildings, leading to a lack of explicit failure mechanisms in many vulnerability models. In this study, the failure modes of a typical reinforced concrete building upon impact by debris flows, debris floods, floods and earth flows are discovered through an explicit finite element platform LS-DYNA. Five impact cases with increasing solid concentration; namely, low-intensity water flow, high-intensity water flow, debris flood, debris flow and earth flow, are considered. The intrinsic physics of building damage by these flow-like mass movements is compared. The frontal walls and side walls are vulnerable to any type of flow. A forward pushover failure mode, which is a global failure of the building frame, is observed in the high-intensity water flow and debris flood cases. Upon impact by an earth flow, progressive local failure of the columns at the ground floor can occur and lead to backward collapse of the building. Upon impact by a debris flow, both the local column failure and the global pushover collapse of building can occur, as debris flows with high solid contents are an intermediate flow sharing characteristics of both floods and earth flows. The in-depth study of the physics of building damage provides a solid basis to develop generic vulnerability models for such flow-like mass movements of varying solid contents.	[Luo, H. Y.; Fan, R.

Flooding is one of the many factors that seems to influence the incidence of snakebite. The catastrophic floods from late 2018 in Kerala (India) were widely broadcast and are an example of how flooding events are related to the increased incidence of snakebite. This relationship has been mentioned regularly in scientific and grey literature, but usually quite scarcely in comparison to other topics linked to snakebite. Additionally, web media, mobile communications, and social media have started playing an important role not only in providing access to information on flooding-related snakebite events, but also in snakebite prevention at a larger scale. In order to better understand to what extent the relationship between snakebite incidence and flooding is reported and quantified and appraise the importance of mobile communications and social media in snakebite prevention and management, we performed multiple searches in generic (Google) and specialized (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar) databases. We retrieved 68 scientific articles and 5 reports ranging from 1892 to 2018 mentioning or analyzing flooding and the increased incidence of snakebite. Additionally, we found 68 web media reports linking flooding and snakebite. This review indicates that the increase of snakebite incidence due to flooding has been repeatedly observed all over the world. This phenomenon could be exacerbated because of climate change, which is expected to increase the overall magnitude and frequency of flooding. However, it could also be mitigated by the role the Internet, mobile communications, and social media could play in snakebite prevention and human and animal rescue strategies during flooding.

A Process-Based Framework to Characterize and Classify Runoff Events: The Event Typology of Germany	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						event classification; event type; rainfall-runoff events; event typology; event characteristics; runoff generation mechanisms	SPACE-TIME VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CATCHMENT CLASSIFICATION; EXPLORING CONTROLS; FLOOD RESPONSE; RAINFALL; GENERATION; PATTERNS; VALIDATION; SEPARATION	This study proposes a new process-based framework to characterize and classify runoff events of various magnitudes occurring in a wide range of catchments. The framework uses dimensionless indicators that characterize space-time dynamics of precipitation events and their spatial interaction with antecedent catchment states, described as snow cover, distribution of frozen soils, and soil moisture content. A rigorous uncertainty analysis showed that the developed indicators are robust and regionally consistent. Relying on covariance- and ratio-based indicators leads to reduced classification uncertainty compared to commonly used (event-based) indicators based on absolute values of metrics such as duration, volume, and intensity of precipitation events. The event typology derived from the proposed framework is able to stratify events that exhibit distinct hydrograph dynamics even if streamflow is not directly used for classification. The derived typology is therefore able to capture first-order controls of event runoff response in a wide variety of catchments. Application of this typology to about 180,000 runoff events observed in 392 German catchments revealed six distinct regions with homogeneous event type frequency that match well regions with similar behavior in terms of runoff response identified in Germany. The detected seasonal pattern of event type occurrence is regionally consistent and agrees well with the seasonality of hydroclimatic conditions. The proposed framework can be a useful tool for comparative analyses of regional differences and similarities of runoff generation processes at catchment scale and their possible spatial and temporal evolution.

In this study, we analyzed the spatial variations of different sediment types and corresponding soils in 15 pedosedimentary profiles across three major geomorphic units in an alpine ridge-valley basin of the Qilian Mountains, northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Particle size distribution was used to trace the sediment types. Inorganic and organic carbon concentrations were included as metrics of soil processes. Aeolian silts from both distant and proximal sources cover floodplains, hillslopes and some positions on alluvial fans, while the distribution of fluvial sediments and periglacial slope deposits are much more limited due to the coverage of loess. The soils vary in response to sediment types and climatic conditions under the influence of their geomorphic settings. The vertical distribution patterns of carbonates in soil profiles show considerable differences among different geomorphic units, reflecting their contrasting water balance and migration pathways. Soil organic carbon accumulates most extensively in aeolian silts with sufficient water supply. A special pedogenic soil horizon - the mattic epipedon is formed primarily in loessial sediments in Kobresia ecosystems. The complex entanglement of fine earths and massive grassroots make the mattic epipedon extremely resilient, which helps to preserve the soils and to shape the landscapes. By integrating geomorphology, sedimentology, ecology and pedology, the outcomes of this study promote the understanding of the evolution of typical landscapes and ecosystems of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and many other periglacial settings.

Interregional ES flows - ecosystem services "imported" from and "exported" to other countries - are rarely analyzed and their importance for global sustainability is little known. Here, we provide a first multi-ES quantification of a nation's use of ES from abroad. We focus on ES flows that benefit the population in Germany but are supplied outside German territory. We employ a conceptual framework recently developed to systematically quantify interregional ES flows. We address four types of interregional ES flows with: (i) biophysical flows of traded goods: cocoa import for consumption; (ii) flows mediated by migratory species: migration of birds providing pest control; (iii) passive biophysical flows: flood control along transboundary watersheds; and (iv) information flows: China's giant panda loan to the Berlin Zoo. We determined that: (i) Ivory Coast and Ghana alone supply around 53% of Germany's cocoa while major negative consequences for biodiversity occurred in Cameroon and Ecuador; (ii) Africa's humid and sub-humid climate zones are important habitats for the majority of migratory bird species that provide natural pest control services in agricultural areas in Germany; (iii) Upstream watersheds outside the country add an additional 64% flood regulation services nationally, while Germany exports 40% of flood regulation services in neighboring, downstream countries; (iv) Information flows transported by the pandas were mainly related to political aspects and - contrary to our expectations - considerably less on biological and natural aspects. We discuss the implications of these results for international resource management policy and governance.

Urban ecological infrastructure: The importance of vegetation cover in the control of floods and landslides in Salvador / Bahia, Brazil	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Ecological infrastructure; Vegetation cover; Landslides; Floods; Salvador-Bahia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; GIS	The city of Salvador has undergone a hasty population growth over the last five decades, from a mere 250,000 inhabitants in 1950 to ca. 2.9 million in 2017. This surge in population has resulted in a series of environmental issues directly connected with the reduction of the vegetation cover. Landslides and floods are among the most striking of such issues because they have put at risk, successively over the years, the lives and assets of hundreds of people, very in particular of those in less privileged circumstances. In view of this vulnerability framework and recognising the role that green areas play in the urban fabric, this work sought to determine the correlation between remnant vegetation cover and recorded occurrences of mass movements and floods. Particular consideration was given to the socioeconomic profile of the population segments most affected by these occurrences, assessed in terms of Municipal Human Development Index (M-HDI). We conclude that municipal government negligence in the control of the occupation and use of the land has been responsible for the emergence of hundreds of areas at risk, those where most mass movement and flood occurrences have taken place, which largely correspond with the neighbourhoods with the lowest rates of human development. In contrast, both the number of occurrences and their impact are smaller or non-existent in the northern part of the municipal territory, where the largest forest remnants are located, as well as in the most affluent neighbourhoods, where the ecological infrastructure has been replaced with costly public works.

The questions of how to value the economic loss that would result if a catastrophe were to occur in Capital Beijing and how long the recovery period would last have long been topics of concern for the government and the public. This study envisions an earthquake similar to the Wenchuan earthquake occurring in Beijing and examines the differences in indirect economic loss and recovery periods between Beijing and the Wenchuan earthquake using the same loss rate. An improved input-output model is used to evaluate the indirect losses. The results show that (1) Beijing experiences greater indirect loss than Sichuan. When both regions suffer a direct loss of USD 100, Beijing suffers USD 12 more in indirect loss than does Sichuan. (2) The reconstruction period of Beijing is shortened by at least 5 months, and indirect loss is reduced by 27.1% if the assistance level increases from 120 to 150% of that provided to Sichuan. (3) High assistance efficiencies can effectively reduce total losses, but increasing the efficiency of strength is more efficient than improving the efficiency of time in Beijing. Five sectors in Beijing are firstly needed to be assisted to recover, which can help other sectors to recover more quickly and efficiently through industrial linkages. Dynamic assessment of indirect loss in this study may help the government better understand the quantitative impact of disasters and allocate assistance resources more efficiently in Beijing.

A simplified hindcast method for the estimation of extreme storm surge events in semi-enclosed basins	APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH			English	Article						Storm surge; Physics-based model; Sea level hindcast; ROMS; Coastal flooding risk; Climate change	SEA-LEVEL; EVOLUTION; MODEL; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; SEDIMENT; SEICHE; GULF	Human presence, coastal erosion, and tourism activities are increasing the attention to coastal flooding risk. To perform risk assessments, long time series of observed or hindcast wave parameters and tide levels are then necessary. In some cases, only a few years of observation are available, so that observed extreme data are not always representative and reliable. A hindcast system aimed to reconstruct long time series of total tide levels may be of great help to perform robust extreme events analysis and then to protect human life, activities as well as to counteract coastal erosion by means of risk assessments. This work aims to propose a simplified method to hindcast storm surge levels time series in semi-enclosed basins with low computational costs. The method is an extension of a previous work of some of the authors and consists of a mixed approach in which the estimation of storm surge obtained by using the theory of linear dynamic system is corrected by using a statistical method. Both steps are characterized by low computational costs. Nevertheless, the results may be considered reliable enough also in view of the simplicity of the approach. The proposed method has been applied to the Manfredonia case study, a small village located in the Southern Adriatic Italian coast and often prone to coastal flooding events. The comparison of extreme events estimated on the basis of hindcast levels time series is satisfactorily similar to those estimated on the basis of observed tide series.

However, the fisheries benefits of FPAs are not well understood, particularly for indiscriminate fisheries typical of tropical systems. Here we report the results of a model that tests the fisheries effects of no-take protected areas in conditions unique to indiscriminate riverine/floodplain systems. The model has a generalized form applicable to a wide range of systems. We report the results of the general model, as well as those from a specialized form parameterized for the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. Both the general and Tonle Sap versions of the model show that FPAs can pay important fisheries benefits, especially where it is difficult to control fishing mortality through gear restrictions or other means. The harvest and profit benefit response curves have similar shapes, with additional FPAs paying high dividends at less than approximately 50% FPA coverage, and then truncating and declining thereafter. In the specific setting of the Tonle Sap of Cambodia, FPAs would pay a large increase in harvest because current FPA coverage is low. It may be counterintuitive to community fisheries managers in Cambodia that the best way to increase harvest is to restrict fishing, but at very high levels of fishing effort, reducing effort or area fished will improve both harvest and profit. In Cambodia, it may make sense to maximize harvest rather than profit because fishers living in poverty need to maximize protein offtake, but the benefits of FPAs remain. Similar considerations may apply in many freshwater and indiscriminate fisheries.

The proposed approach is to simulate runoff hydrograph rather than several indices (e.g., runoff initiation, peak flow, and runoff volume) to avoid the uncertainties under a certain rainfall scenario. A rainfall-runoff model of a residential district in China, constructed based on the stormwater management model (SWMM), is auto-calibrated (validated) based on 12 (25) observed rainfall and runoff events using model-independent parameter estimation (PEST). The priority sites and parameters for LID practices for different objectives are auto-calculated using PEST based on the calibrated model and different expected runoff processes. The expected runoff processes are simulated from the calibrated model with four impervious cover scenarios corresponding to 5-year, 2-h duration design storm. The study illustrates that (i) the proposed approach can auto-optimize runoff manage strategies based on LID practices and land; (ii) the design parameters of LID practices can be auto-calculated and that simulated runoff processes are in near perfect agreement with expected runoff processes; (iii) this approach can auto-optimize any specific parameters of the SWMM and LID practices without changing those determined parameters. Our simple, but quantitative, approach for identifying potential LID sites and design parameters based on land can better inform the hydrologic effectiveness of LID practices for managing runoff.

Uncontrolled expansion and human pressures are hindering planning, adaptation, and conservation efforts. To understand the extent of these issues, this study combined morphometric analysis, soil loss calculation, field monitoring, and remote sensing and GIS tools to assess soil erosion in the Metropolis of Tangier (Morocco) located at the confluence of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean at the Strait of Gibraltar. The study relied on data from 13 rain gauge stations, official reports, and remote sensing acquisitions, as well as field observations. Results showed an average soil erosion rate of 24.2 t/ha/year, equivalent to an annual soil loss of 588,051 t/year. This high rate was largely due to areas with a high erosion risk (99.8%), covering only 8.3% of the territory, which were characterized by recently burned topsoil, fallow land, and steep slopes. These areas included both uncontrolled neighbourhoods and areas for planned urban and industrial expansion, posing a threat to the landscape's sustainability and socio-economic prospects. The morphometric analysis revealed its high vulnerability to erosion and degradation, with the highest soil loss rates observed in the eastern and western regions. The study also found that flash floods caused by hydroclimatic hazards can lead to significant damage to infrastructure and equipment, particularly in western sub-basins and mountainous regions. In conclusion, the use of remote sensing and GIS technologies provided valuable insights into the physical characteristics and vulnerability of the Tangier Metropolis to land degradation and soil erosion. These findings emphasize the need for effective land management practices and conservation measures to mitigate the impacts of land degradation and soil erosion in the face of climate change. This information is crucial for decision-makers and stakeholders to develop strategies to address these pressing issues.

However, sedimentological evidence for the recurrence of these paleolakes during the Quaternary remains inadequate. During this research we conducted extensive geological surveys, and sedimentary and geochronological analyses, of the river terraces and valley sediments upstream of the Yarlung Tsangpo Gorge. Three fluvial-lacustrine terraces formed since the last glacial period were identified from analyses of 17 sedimentary sites, with the following depositional ages, from new to old: 0.6-0.4 ka (T1), 9-5 ka (T2) and & GE;50-20 ka (T3), respectively. The sediments of T1 and T2 are <30 m thick with an overall pattern of reversely-graded sequences, each reflecting a dammed paleolake event (named Paleolake I and Paleolake II). The sediments in T3 are the thickest (>265 m), with the highest preserved terraces in the river valley. More than five depositional cycles of fluvial and lacustrine phases in this terrace reflect many sporadic damming events during the last glacial period (representing Paleolake III). Additionally, the earliest phase of sedimentation of the dammed lakes revealed by analyses of drill cores in the valley fill may have begun in the Mid Pleistocene. The sedimentary sequences of these paleolakes revealed that frequent glacial-damming events have occurred in response to climate change since the Mid Pleistocene, supporting the theory that glacial dams and outburst floods have played an influential role in the geomorphological evolution of the margins of the Tibetan Plateau.

Synergistic effects of precipitation and groundwater extraction on freshwater wetland inundation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hydrology; Depressional wetlands; Geographically isolated wetlands; Drought; Climate change; Cypress swamp	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; HYDROPERIOD; VEGETATION; URBANIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; HYDROLOGY; FLORIDA; SOIL	Wetlands provide essential ecosystem services, including nutrient cycling, flood protection, and biodiversity support, that are sensitive to changes in wetland hydrology. Wetland hydrological inputs come from precipitation, groundwater discharge, and surface run-off. Changes to these inputs via climate variation, groundwater extraction, and land development may alter the timing and magnitude of wetland inundation. Here, we use a long-term (14-year) comparative study of 152 depressional wetlands in west-central Florida to identify sources of variation in wetland inundation during two key time periods, 2005-2009 and 2010-2018. These time periods are separated by the enactment of water conservation policies in 2009, which included regional reductions in groundwater extraction. We investigated the response of wetland inundation to the interactive effects of precipitation, groundwater extraction, surrounding land development, basin geomorphology, and wetland vegetation class. Results show that water levels were lower and hydroperiods were shorter in wetlands of all vegetation classes during the first (2005-2009) time period, which corresponded with low rainfall conditions and high rates of groundwater extraction. Under water conservation policies enacted in the second (2010-2018) time period, median wetland water depths increased 1.35 m and median hydroperiods increased from 46 % to 83 %. Waterlevel variation was additionally less sensitive to groundwater extraction. The increase in inundation differed among vegetation classes with some wetlands not displaying signs of hydrological recovery. After accounting for effects of several explanatory factors, inundation still varied considerably among wetlands, suggesting a diversity of hydrological regimes, and thus ecological function, among individual wetlands across the landscape. Policies seeking to balance human water demand with the preservation of depressional wetlands would benefit by recognizing the heightened sensitivity of wetland inundation to groundwater extraction during periods of low precipitation.

To date, limited field scale AFs models are available to simulate all possible ESS and BD together. We conducted an extensive systematic review of available agroforestry (AF), BD, and soil erosion models for the simulation potential of seven most desirable ESS in AFS. Simple to complex AF models have an inherent limitation of being objective-specific. A few complex and dynamic AF models did not meet the recent interest and demands for the simulation of ESS under AFS. Further, many ESS modules especially soil erosion, GHGs emission, groundwater recharge, onsite water retention, nutrients and pesticide leaching, and BD are often missing in available AF models, while some existing soil erosion models can be used in combination with AF models. Likewise mechanistic and process-based BD diversity models are lacking or found limited simulation potential for ESS under AFS. However, further efforts of model development and improvement (integration and coupling) are needed for the better simulation of complex interactive processes belonging to ESS under AFS. There are different possibilities but a proficient modeling approach for better reliability, flexibility, and durability is to integrate and couple them into a process-based dynamic modular structure. Findings of the study further suggested that crop modeling frameworks (MFW) like SIMPLACE and APSIM could be potential ones for the integration and coupling of different suitable modeling approaches (AF, soil protection, GHGs emission, flood prevention, carbon sequestration, onsite water retention, ground recharge, nutrient leaching, and BD modules) in one platform for dynamic process based ESS estimation on daily basis at the field scale.

The new proxy was applied in the analysis of sedimentary records from two boreholes (identified as JM and SZ) in the Kaifeng area of the lower Yellow River, an area that has received less research attention in terms of flood events and sedimentary records compared to its middle and upper reaches. From this analysis, flood events that occurred in the lower Yellow River since the late Holocene were reconstructed. The results suggest there are 15 and 14 sedimentary rhythms in the cores of JM and SZ, respectively. Based on historical documents, archaeological excavation data from the vicinity of the core sites, and AMS14C dating, we established the chronological framework of sedimentary rhythms in both JM and SZ cores. Using this information, we then reconstructed six Yellow River flood events impacting Kaifeng that occurred after the Warring States period in the years 225 BCE, 1387 CE, 1399 CE, 1461 CE, 1642 CE and 1841 CE. Among the six flood events, except for the flood of 225 BCE which was directly caused by human factors, the rest were caused by natural factors, mainly from prevailing climatic conditions but superimposed by human activities. The research results, therefore, can provide a scientific basis for flood prediction, prevention and risk assessment in the Yellow River Basin under the background of global change, and also provide support for clarifying the relationship between regional climate background and human activities in abnormal flood events.

Use the improved model to verify its applicability to the Hanjiang River Basin, then, choose the ones who has the most familiar trend with the historical data in the future climate model data (CMIP6). Put the selected data in the model to predict the runoff of Hanjiang River from 2021 to 2060. By analyzing the future runoff trend of Ankang, Huangjiagang and Huangzhuang in the Hanjiang River Basin from 2021 to 2060 and the changes of average runoff, seasonal runoff and monthly runoff compared with the historical period (1981-2020), the conclusions drawn are as follows: 1) The improved Wetspa model has good applicability in the Hanjiang River Basin; 2) The future runoff of Ankang section is decreasing, while that of Huangjiagang and Huangzhuang sections is increasing; 3) Compared with the reference period, the average runoff of the three sections in the future shows an increasing trend, which indicates that there will be flood risk in the future; 4) Compared with the reference period, the runoff proportion of the three sections will increase in spring and winter, and decrease in autumn. Attention should be paid to the risk of drought in autumn. In terms of months, the proportion of runoff from April to June increases, decreases from September to November, and increases and decreases in other months are uncertain.

The study characterized the temporal and spatial variations in its flow and sediment load based on the daily datasets of the past 60 years from all main-stem hydrological gauge stations, and proposed a new five-segment river reach division scheme instead of the traditional three- or four-segment division. Furthermore, we distinguished the key factors and their contributions that caused the flow and sediment variations, offering reference for the river management stra-tegies as per the local conditions. A significant decreasing trend in annual flow and sediment load was observed in the river basin, except for certain reaches in Segment 1 (upstream of Tangnaihai). The maximum flood-event duration decreased significantly in Segment 2 (from Tangnaihai to Shizuishan). The flood volume and sediment load during the maximum flood event also showed significant downward trend in Segments 2-5 (downstream of Tangnaihai). Operation of cascade reservoirs, especially in Segment 2, has smoothed the annual flow process in the upstream. Sediment trapping in the reservoirs had little effect on the change in sediment load, but reservoir regulation of flow greatly influenced siltation in the upstream river channel. Water abstraction has also played a significant role in flow variation. Consequently, the ratio of flood sediment load to annual sediment load decreased significantly in the upper reach, but increased significantly in the lower reach. Temporally, the recorded period was divided into three periods using change point detection: pre- 1987, 1987-1999, and post 1999. The ratio of flood volume to annual flow decreased significantly in the first two periods, and generally increased post 1999, with the impact of aforementioned anthropogenic activities.

In the face of this threat, policy-and decision-makers are increasingly calling for new approaches and tools to support risk management and climate adaptation pathways that can capture the full extent of the impacts. In this frame, a GIS-based Bayesian Network (BN) approach is presented for the capturing and modelling of multi-sectoral flooding damages against future 'what-if' scenarios. Building on a risk-based conceptual framework, the BN model was trained and validated by exploiting data collected from the 2014 Secchia River flooding event, as well as other contextual variables. Moreover, a novel approach to defining the structure of the BN was performed, reconfiguring the model according to expert judgment and data-based validation. The model showed a good predictive capacity for damages in the agricultural, industrial and residential sectors, predicting the severity of damages with a classification accuracy of about 60% for each of these assessment endpoints. 'What-if' scenario analysis was performed to understand the potential impacts of future changes in i) land use patterns and ii) increasing flood depths resulting from more severe flood events. The output of the model showed a rising probability of experiencing high monetary damages under both scenarios. In spite of constraints within the case study dataset, the results of the appraisal show good promise, and together with the designed BN model itself represent a valuable support for disaster risk management and reduction actions against extreme river flooding events, enabling better informed decision making.

California experienced its three largest fires early in its fire season. The Pantanal, the largest wetland on the planet, burned over 20% of its surface. More than 18 million hectares of forest and bushland burned during the 2019-2020 fire season in Australia, killing 33 people, destroying nearly 2500 homes, and endangering many endemic species. The direct cost of damages is being counted in dozens of billion dollars, but the indirect costs on water-related ecosystem services and benefits could be equally expensive, with impacts lasting for decades. In Australia, the extreme precipitation ("200 mm day-1 in several location") that interrupted the catastrophic wildfire season triggered a series of watershed effects from headwaters to areas downstream. The increased runoff and erosion from burned areas disrupted water supplies in several locations. These post-fire watershed hazards via source water contamination, flash floods, and mudslides can represent substantial, systemic long-term risks to drinking water production, aquatic life, and socio-economic activity. Scenarios similar to the recent event in Australia are now predicted to unfold in the Western USA. This is a new reality that societies will have to live with as uncharted fire activity, water crises, and widespread human footprint collide all-around of the world. Therefore, we advocate for a more proactive approach to wildfire-watershed risk governance in an effort to advance and protect water security. We also argue that there is no easy solution to reducing this risk and that investments in both green (i.e., natural) and grey (i.e., built) infrastructure will be necessary. Further, we propose strategies to combine modern data analytics with existing tools for use by water and land managers worldwide to leverage several decades worth of data and knowledge on post-fire hydrology.

They are disproportionately exposed to and hit by multiple natural hazards, with flooding being the leading cause of bridge failures in the world. Their performance is constantly challenged by the combined effects of natural hazard stressors, e.g. flash floods, exacerbated by climate change, ageing, increasing traffic volumes and loads. Bridges are vulnerable to scour and other flood-related impacts, such as hydraulic forces and debris accumulation. In order to assess and quantify the resilience of flood-critical bridges and subsequently deploy bridge resilience models aiming at building resilience into transport networks, it is essential to use reliable fragility, capacity restoration and traffic reinstatement metrics and models. It is surprising that, despite the importance of bridges and their high vulnerability to hydraulic actions, there are no available recovery models. The latter can help quantify the pace of post-flood capacity and functionality gain for facilitating well-informed decision making for reliable prioritisation and efficient allocation of resources in transport networks. The main barrier is the nature and complexity of recovery actions, which encompass engineering, operational, owner resources and organisational challenges, among others. This paper, for the first time in the international literature, aims at filling this gap by generating a set of reliable recovery models that include both bridge reinstatement (traffic capacity) and restoration (structural capacity) models based on a detailed questionnaire that elicits knowledge from experts. Recovery models are then presented and validated for spread and deep foundations for a typical reinforced concrete bridge, including restoration task prioritisation and scheduling, inter-task dependencies, idle times, durations and cost ratios for different damage levels, as well as the evolution of traffic capacity after floods.

However, a bias exists between simulated climate model data and observed data. Therefore, various bias correction methods have been developed to reduce this imbalance. The quantile mapping (QM) method is one of the most widely used approaches worldwide. However, the QM method does not account for the relative change in the raw data since bias correction is only performed on observed data. To solve this problem, the detrended quantile mapping (DQM) and quantile delta mapping (QDM) methods were developed to consider the relative changes in the raw data. Generally, the QM method is performed assuming that the statistical characteristics are the same when using cumulative density functions (CDFs) obtained from climate models and observations. However, the general QM (or QDM) method is performed using daily data, and thus the outcome may be slightly different from the quantiles of observed data in the statistical analysis of extreme data. This difference can lead to distortions when estimating relative changes in rainfall quantiles. Herein, the regional quantile delta mapping (RQDM) method for bias correction, which can solve the problems of the QDM method, was proposed. Additionally, evaluations were performed for the RQDM and existing QDM methods using several statistical approaches for a historical period (S0; 1979-2005). The results revealed that the RQDM method was similarly corrected to the observed results than the QDM method and produced more appropriate outcomes based on statistical evaluations. Moreover, the RQDM method showed a well-preserved relative changes in rainfall quantiles of the raw data, unlike the QDM method. Thus, it was found that the proposed RQDM method showed more robust results than the conventional QDM method.

J	Nowogonski, I				Nowogonski, Ireneusz			Runoff Volume Reduction Using Green Infrastructure	LAND			English	Article						climate changes; low impact development; rain barrels; rain gardens; stormwater; surface sealing		Uncontrolled urbanization is a frequent cause behind the local flooding of catchment areas. This also results in a degradation of water quality in receivers, as well as causing a disruption of the natural water cycle in the catchment. Classical solutions, such as retention, do not prove to be sufficient under all conditions. An alternative solution is the application of low impact development (LID), which, in the analysed case, takes the form of rain gardens, infiltration trenches and controlled unsealing of catchment components. The work presents the influence of a few variants of solutions on a selected urbanized catchment located in Gorzow Wielkopolski. The assessment was developed using a simulation model, making use of EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) software. The nalysed design variants are compared with the described existing state before the implementation of modernization works. Previous results showing that LID may be ineffective as the only solution in systems overloaded with runoff generated by rainfall of relatively low intensities were confirmed. In the case of existing systems, LID should be applied in combination with classical retention systems or in a treatment train and every opportunity to implement LID whether on a property or urban site must be taken. Such solutions in the analysed cases will allow for a reduction of the maximum outflow intensity from the analysed subcatchment by 9 to 17% depending on the analysed rainfall. The results are similar to those obtained in other implementations. However, the interpretation of the results is not as simple and obvious for overloaded systems. In addition to flow rate reduction, reduction of surcharge in the sewer network and reduction of the volume of local flooding must be considered. LID solutions should also, whenever possible, be looked into as early as the stage of planning the land development of the infrastructure.

Using the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre historical period (1961-2005) rainfall data as the reference, projection was conducted over 323 grid points of Nigeria for the periods 2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. The performances of the different BC methods in removing biases from the GCMs were assessed using different statistical indices. The computation of the MME of the projected rainfall was conducted by aggregation of 20 GCMs using random forest regression method. The percentage differences in the future rainfall relative to the historical period were estimated for all BC methods. Spatial projection of the percentage changes in rainfall for Linear scaling, which was the best performing BC method, showed increases in rainfall of 5.5-6.9% under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, while the decrease range was -3.2--4.2% respectively during the wet season. The range of annual increases in precipitation was 5.7-7.3% for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, while the decrease range was -1.0--4.3%. This study also revealed monthly rainfall within the country will decrease during the wet season between June and September, which is a significant period where most crops need the water for growth. Findings from this study can be of importance to policy makers in the management of changes in hydrological processes due to climate change and management of related disasters such as floods and droughts.

In addition, the Vietnam coast is highly influenced by the seasonal monsoon regime, which is characterized by large northeast waves from October to March and calm southeast waves from April to September every year. Consequently, the tidal inlet entrance morphologies often suffer from a dynamic seasonal evolution due to distinct differences in the direction of wave-induced longshore sediment transport (LST) between the two monsoon seasons. The migration or closure of tidal inlets causes a lot of problems for socio-economic development in the region since these are the main reasons leading to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding and the obstruction of navigation. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the morphological evolutions of natural tidal inlets on the central coast of Vietnam using long-term remote sensing data sets and by the Delft3D numerical model. Surprisingly, the estimated LST rates from the former method are in an order of magnitude agreement with the results from the latter one for all of the areas in this study. Based on the conservation equation for sand and comprehensive data collection, a new simple empirical formula for predicting the sand spit elongation rate as a function of the sand spit width is developed. Although the breaching of sand spit might happen during an extreme flood event at some tidal inlets, the growth rate of the spit before and after the breaching is almost unchanged. These findings are very useful information for supporting the local coastal authorities to find better management solutions in terms of sustainable development.

We set up a simple camera monitoring system to record the timings and durations of the leafy period and the spring flush of river water at three observation sites (Boydom [B]: 70.64 degrees N, 148.15 degrees E; Kodac [K]:70.56 degrees N, 148.26 degrees E; Verkhny-Khatistakh [VK]:70.25 degrees N,147.47 degrees E) in the Indigirka lowland, in Northeastern Siberia. Time-lapse digital cameras were located at seven points across the three sites. The time intervals were 1-4 or 24 hours. The minimum and maximum monitoring periods were 2 years (July 2016 to August 2018) at B and 5 years (August 2013 to July 2018) at K. One camera documented the timings of river ice melt and open water periods from the riverbank of the Kryvaya River, one of the small tributaries of the Indigirka River. The other six cameras recorded several types of ground cover typical of the area, including larch trees (Larix cajanderi), shrubs (including Salix spp. and Betula nana), forbs, mosses and graminoids in an ecosystem of sparsely forested shrublands, wetlands and riversides. The data consists of 45,617 JPEG-format images. This dataset can be used to detect the onset and offset of the growing season and to capture the ice melt timing and water cover periods in wetlands and riversides.

J	Dowding, JE				Dowding, John E.			Changes in the number and distribution of northern New Zealand dotterels (<i>Charadrius obscurus aquilonius</i>): results of four censuses undertaken between 1989 and 2011	NOTORNIS			English	Article						Charadrius obscurus; northern New Zealand dotterel; shorebird; census; population size; distribution; population trend; management		This paper presents the results of four censuses of the northern New Zealand dotterel population undertaken between 1989 and 2011. During that period, the population increased by roughly 50%, from about 1,320 to about 2,130 birds. Most birds (85%) were in the northern part of the North Island (Northland, Auckland, and Coromandel Peninsula), but the taxon is expanding its range southwards on both the west and east coasts. On the east coast, a few pairs are now breeding close to Cook Strait. Population trends varied between regions, and almost all of the overall increase was a result of increases on the east coast. The highest rates of increase were on the Auckland east coast and on Coromandel Peninsula, probably because the intensity of management has been highest in those regions. In the Auckland urban area, birds now routinely breed inland, mainly on grass or bare earth; elsewhere, the taxon is almost entirely coastal. The proportion of birds on the west coast has fallen over the past 50 years, and about 85% of the taxon is now found on the east coast. If the overall increase in numbers has continued at the same rate since 2011, there would be about 2,600 birds in 2020. The size of the population and its rate of increase justify the recent down-listing of the subspecies to a threat ranking of At Risk (Recovering), but it remains Conservation Dependent. The recovery programme has been highly successful, and most management of the taxon is now undertaken by community groups, regional councils, and volunteers. Continuing threats include predation, flooding of nests, and disturbance during breeding; in future, continuing coastal development and increased recreational activity will probably degrade habitat further, particularly on the east coast, and climate change will have a range of impacts.

Given the extremely limited ground observations on the TP due to the harsh environment and complex terrain, we exploited multiple altimetric missions and Landsat satellite data to create high-temporal-resolution lake water level and storage change time series at weekly to monthly timescales for 52 large lakes (50 lakes larger than 150 km(2) and 2 lakes larger than 100 km(2)) on the TP during 2000-2017. The data sets are available online at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.898411 (Li et al., 2019). With Landsat archives and altimetry data, we developed water levels from lake shoreline positions (i.e., Landsat-derived water levels) that cover the study period and serve as an ideal reference for merging multisource lake water levels with systematic biases being removed. To validate the Landsat-derived water levels, field experiments were carried out in two typical lakes, and theoretical uncertainty analysis was performed based on high-resolution optical images (0.8 m) as well. The RMSE of the Landsat-derived water levels is 0.11 m compared with the in situ measurements, consistent with the magnitude from theoretical analysis (0.1-0.2 m). The accuracy of the Landsat-derived water levels that can be derived in relatively small lakes is comparable with most altimetry data. The resulting merged Landsat-derived and altimetric lake water levels can provide accurate information on multiyear and short-term monitoring of lake water levels and storage changes on the TP, and critical information on lake overflow flood monitoring and prediction as the expansion of some TP lakes becomes a serious threat to surrounding residents and infrastructure.

However, SREs have often been associated with complex and nonlinear errors. One way to enhance the quality of SREs is to use soil moisture information. Few studies have indicated that soil moisture information can be used to improve the quality of SREs. Nowadays, satellite-based soil moisture products are becoming available at desired spatial and temporal resolutions on an NRT basis. Hence, this study proposes an integrated approach to improve NRT SRE accuracy by combining it with NRT soil moisture through a nonlinear support vector machine-based regression (SVR) model. To test this novel approach, Ashti catchment, a sub-basin of Godavari river basin, India, is chosen. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA)-based NRT SRE 3B42RT and Advanced Scatterometer-derived NRT soil moisture are considered in the present study. The performance of the 3B42RT and the corrected product are assessed using different statistical measures such as correlation coefficient (CC), bias, and root mean square error (RMSE), for the monsoon seasons of 2012-2015. A detailed spatial analysis of these measures and their variability across different rainfall intensity classes are also presented. Overall, the results revealed significant improvement in the corrected product compared to 3B42RT (except CC) across the catchment. Particularly, for light and moderate rainfall classes, the corrected product showed the highest improvement (except CC). On the other hand, the corrected product showed limited performance for the heavy rainfall class. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has potential to enhance the quality of NRT SRE through the use of NRT satellite-based soil moisture estimates.

This study evaluated the effects of the flood on riparian forest structure and composition. In 2012, 168 forest sites sampled in 2006-2009 were resampled on five floodplain segments between Montana and Missouri, with 80 sampled again in 2013-2014. Changes in riparian forest area over 2006-2012, by age class and segment, were assessed using aerial imagery and GIS. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine (a) the initial effects of the flood (preflood to 2012) on tree and shrub stem densities, (b) postflood (2012-2014) changes in stem density, and (c) species-level responses for cottonwood (Populus deltoides), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Across the study area, forest area declined 6-38% among age classes, with the greatest declines in the youngest classes. Tree density declined 19-49% across segments from preflood to 2012 but did not change significantly from 2012 to 2014. Shrub density declined 52-89% across segments from preflood to 2012, with 73-78% declines in the two youngest age classes, but increased by 42% from 2012 to 2014. Cottonwood and Russian olive, but not red cedar, showed partial recovery in the shrub/sapling layer, increasing from 2012 to 2014. Although flooding is important for floodplain forest health, the 2011 flood had mixed effects, with significant mortality of native floodplain trees and shrubs and only limited cottonwood recruitment. The initial decline in invasive species (Russian olive and red cedar), however, suggests that flooding may be an effective management tool.

Current long-term daily or sub-daily datasets of P, SM, and SWE are limited by a coarse spatial resolution or the lack of local correction. Although SM and SWE data derived from hydrological simulations at a national scale have fine spatial resolutions and take advantage of local forcing data, hydrological models are not directly calibrated with SM and SWE data. In this study, we produced a daily 0.1 degrees dataset of P, SM, and SWE in 1981-2017 across China, using global background data and local on-site data as forcing input and satellite-based data as reconstruction benchmarks. Global 0.1 degrees and local 0.25 degrees P data in 1981-2017 are merged to reconstruct the historical P of the 0.1 degrees China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA) available in 2008-2017 using a stacking machine learning model. The reconstructed P data are used to drive the HBV hydrological model to simulate SM and SWE data in 1981-2017. The SM simulation is calibrated by Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 4 (SMAP-L4) data. The SWE simulation is calibrated by the national satellite-based snow depth dataset in China (Che and Dai, 2015) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data. Cross-validated by the spatial and temporal splitting of the CMPA data, the median Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of the reconstructed P is 0.68 for all grids at a daily scale. The median KGE of SM in calibration is 0.61 for all grids at a daily scale. For grids in two snow-rich regions, the median KGEs of SWE in calibration are 0.55 and-2.41 in the Songhua and Liaohe basins and the northwest continental basin respectively at a daily scale. Generally, the reconstruction dataset performs better in southern and eastern China than in northern and western China for P and SM and performs better in northeast China than in other regions for SWE. As the first long-term 0.1?daily dataset of P, SM, and SWE that combines information from local observations and satellite-based data benchmarks, this reconstruction product is valuable for future national investigations of hydrological processes.1 Introduction A long-term national terrestrial hydrological dataset with high spatiotemporal resolutions can be used in many hydrological applications such as exploring the controls of rainfall-runoff events (Tarasova et al., 2020; Yang et al.,2020b; Stein et al., 2021), predicting floods and droughts(Van Steenbergen and Willems, 2013; Reager et al., 2014;Abelen et al., 2015), and assessing the impacts of climate change on streamflow and floods (Sharma et al., 2018;Bloschl et al., 2019; Li et al, 2019). As key variables in the hydrological cycle, precipitation (P), soil moisture (SM),and snow water equivalent (SWE) generate riverine run off and determine the wetness states of the basins. Although long-term (at least 30 years) daily P, SM, and SWE can be obtained from many data products in China, these products suffer from a coarse spatial resolution and a lack of local in-formation.

These are here grouped into 15 categories, and the abilities and limitations of each are discussed. No standard or optimum method has emerged, despite more than 80 years of effort in the last two centuries, together with prior work from the 17th C onwards. Indeed, new methods continue to be explored for both point-based and area-wide collections of intensity data. Examples include the use of signal attenuation by rain along the tower-to-tower links of cellular phone networks, monitoring the speed of vehicle windscreen wipers, and exploiting the sound or vision from security and traffic-monitoring cameras. Many of these approaches have the potential to provide vastly more observation sites than conventional meteorological stations equipped with rain gauges. Some of these contemporary approaches seek to harness the potential of crowdsourced or citizen-science data. It is hoped that the present overview of methods will provide a guide for those wishing to collect or analyses rainfall intensity data for application in areas such as soil erosion processes, ecohydrology, agrochemical washoff, or urban flash flooding. Because rainfall intensity is one of the key aspects of the hydrologic cycle likely to respond as climate change and variability proceed, the choice of appropriate data collection methods has additional contemporary importance for the monitoring of regional and global precipitation changes.

Therefore, it is urgent to delineate the areas vulnerable to extreme precipitation and formulate more reasonable measures to reduce the risk of extreme precipitation. In this study, we selected gross domestic product, population, nighttime light, normalized difference vegetation index, runoff depth, and relief degree of land surface data to comprehensively characterize surface vulnerability. We selected the 90, 95, and 99% precipitation quantiles and their occurrence frequencies in the historical and future periods as hazard factors, and calculated the extreme precipitation risks faced by different regions of China based on a risk calculation formula. The results indicate that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and urbanized regions such as the Yangtze River Delta are high-risk areas affected by extreme precipitation. The precipitation simulated by the Beijing Climate Center climate system model version 2 (BCC-CSM2-MR) global climate model selected in this study is relatively smaller than the historical precipitation, but it can basically reflect the actual spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation. Under four future climate scenarios, the joint occurrence probability of extreme precipitation will decrease, while high-risk areas of extreme precipitation will still be located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and densely urbanized areas. This study systematically analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation risk under historical and future scenarios, providing theoretical support for the formulation of more reasonable measures to prevent extreme precipitation risk.

Two quantitative trait loci, Sub1 (conferring submergence tolerance) and AG1 (conferring anaerobic germination), were recently pyramided into a single genetic background, without compromising any desirable agronomic traits, leading to the development of Ciherang-Sub1 + AG1 (CSA). However, little research has been conducted to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stress (submergence) and biotic stress (rice blast), which occur in a damp climate following flooding. The BC2F5 breeding line was phenotypically characterized using the AvrPi9 isolate. The biotic and abiotic stress tolerance of selected lines was tested under submergence stress and anaerobic germination conditions, and lines tolerant to each stress condition were identified through phenotypic and gene expression analyses. The Ciherang-Sub1 + AG1 + Pi9 (CSA-Pi9) line showed similar agronomic performance to its recurrent parent, CSA, but had significantly reduced chalkiness in field trials conducted in temperate regions. Unexpectedly, the CSA-Pi9 line also showed salinity tolerance. Thus, the breeding line newly developed in this study, CSA-Pi9, functioned under stress conditions, in which Sub1, AG1, and Pi9 play a role and had superior grain quality traits compared to its recurrent parent in temperate regions. We speculate that CSA-Pi9 will enable the establishment of climate-resilient rice cropping systems, particularly in East Asia.

Farmers in the region suffer severely from extreme climatic conditions, with floods among the most devas-tating disasters. This study uses binary logistic regression model and the Poisson count model to address this threat to food security by analyzing the nexus between flood risk perception and farm households' adoption of flood disaster adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, including sig-nificant factors such as off-farm employment, cooperative memberships, and access to credit. Results indicate that the flood disaster adaptation rate was low among farmers in the region, with only 41% adopting at least one adaptation strategy. Flood disaster risk perception had a signif-icant effect on farm households' preparedness. Farm households with the perception of severe floods, high probability of flood occurrence, sense of worry, and threats to farm inputs and yield from flood disasters were more likely to adopt more strategies to adapt and mitigate flood risks. Additionally, off-farm employment, cooperative membership, access to credit, extension services, household income, and education significantly affected farmers' flood disaster adaptation behaviour. This study recommends that great attention be shifted towards empowering farm households on flood risk awareness and the fundamental strategies involving on-farm (agronomic practices and farm water distribution) and off-farm practices (off-farm employment and coop-erative memberships) to mitigate flood risks.

These wetlands are highly productive, and support relevant environmental services related to anthropogenic climate change mitigation. From a landscape point of view, and assuming that connectivity among coastal processes does exist among coastal processes, the evaluations of the aboveground and belowground C stocks were carried out in eight landscape units, along a wetland continuum located at the northern coast of Yucatan, called " coastal transverse corridor". The ecosystem C stock for the corridor was 3 837 160 Mg C. The dwarf mangrove presented the largest total carbon stock per unit area (371 Mg C ha(-1)), being also the dominant in extension. The gradient of the aboveground C stocks followed flood patterns, the elevation of the wetland, interstitial salinity, and the specific tolerance of the species. The mangroves stored more carbon per hectare than wetlands dominated by emergent herbaceous and submerged vegetation. The first ones were dominated by production and accumulation rates of C, while the other two, were dominated by the production, and the recycling which caused a low C storage. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the C stocks patterns in the salinity and topographic gradients along karst coastal wetlands. The results could be used to evaluate the potential of local and regional effects in the medium and long term caused by natural and anthropogenic impacts.

The coarse-grained flood deposit in oxbow lakes emerges as a promising paleoflood proxy due to its sensitivity to flood magnitude and high preservation potential. Previous work has established a coarseness-discharge correlation for the instrumental period that was subsequently used to retrodict paleodischarge of older flood deposits. However, it has not been tested whether this correlation applies to older deposits that may represent different lake hydrological connectivity due to plug-bar growth and river migration. Furthermore, overbank sedimentation is known to be episodic and may not scale with flood magnitude. Here we investigate this issue by comparing peak annual discharge and the coarseness of a two-stage infill sequence of a similar to 60 yr old oxbow lake in South Carolina, USA. We found that local morphology had the first-order control and was responsible for the sedimentation shift in the lake. There is a strong linear coarseness-discharge correlation in the upper section of the lake infill. However, this correlation overestimated the flood magnitude for flood deposits in the lower section. This finding suggests that oxbow lake sediments can be greatly useful for paleoflood reconstruction, but this may be complicated by shifting hydrological connectivity. Therefore, the stratigraphic context of an oxbow lake needs to be well understood to derive paleodischarge from the sediments properly.

The degree of direct benefits (thermal comfort, reduced flood risk, and mental health) varies across temporal and spatial scales, and it can be modelled and quantified. Less clear are the indirect benefits related to opportunities to learn about the environment and its influence on personal behaviour and action. The present study, based on survey data from 1955 participants across 17 cities worldwide, addressed whether participation in NbS through two types of interactions (a passive learning experience about NbS and a more active experience based on Citizen Science) stimulates motivation and willingness to be more environmentally sustainable. Over 75% of participants improved their understanding of environmental sustainability and were highly motivated and more confident in their ability to improve sustainability in their local environment/nature. Similar percentage improvements arose from both types of activity across all cities. Those NbS that had elements of both blue and green infrastructure rated higher than those that had predominantly green NbS. Interestingly, a large percentage of the participants did not live near the NbS that were the focus of these activities. This indicated that expected spatial limitations between benefit and recipient may be overcome when dedicated programmes involve people in learning or monitoring NbS. Therefore, opportunities have arisen to expand inclusion from the immediately local to the larger community through participation and Citizen Science, with potential benefits to social cohesion and urban sustainability.

However, questions remain about the impact of this historical development on the environment. The settlement of La Silla del Papa, an important hillfort in southern Andalusia (Cadiz), was occupied during the entire Iron Age, replaced by the coastal town Baelo Claudia during Roman times, and re-occupied during Early Medieval times. As such, La Silla del Papa and its territory represent an ideal location for long-term studies on human-environment interactions. Within the framework of the interdisciplinary project "Archeostraits," geoarchaeological investigations in the surroundings of La Silla del Papa aimed at constraining ecological conditions and human-environment interactions during the mid- and late Holocene and during major human occupation phases. Our results document an early mid-Holocene marine embayment in the lower floodplain of the Rio del Cachon, rapidly turning into a coastal lagoon and later into freshwater-dominated wetlands. After approximately 2100 BP (c. 150 BC), fluvial and alluvial deposition increased, suggesting a high anthropogenic impact on the local landscape during Roman or post-Roman times. Palynological results reveal fluctuating agricultural and pastoral activities and distinct periods of landscape opening during the Neolithic and Iron Age.

Tree-soil Interactions Through Water Release to a Floodplain Ecosystem: a Case Study of Black Box (<i>Eucalyptus largiflorens</i>) on Loamy Sands	WETLANDS			English	Article						Lake Konardin; Lake Woterap; Lake Mournpall; Hattah Kulkyne; Environmental watering; Nutritional dynamics; Murray&#8208; darling Basin	MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; RED MAPLE SEEDLINGS; MANGANESE TOXICITY; SUGAR MAPLE; ALUMINUM TOXICITY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; LIGHT; REQUIREMENTS; DYNAMICS; FOREST	Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) is an agriculturally and ecologically valuable region impacted by water abstraction and climate change. Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens (Myrtaceae)), an important floodplain tree largely endemic to the Basin is of concern because its overall condition is sub-optimal. Knowledge about key aspects of Black Box tree function such as mineral nutrition remains limited. This field study examined the latter by measuring essential plant nutrients, aluminium, and soil chemistry over 12 months spanning an environmental water release event. Samples were collected 4-8 weekly from mature trees on loamy sands of the Hattah Lakes system in north-western Victoria. This commenced prior to water release, continuing through peak levels at the study sites, to recession. Paired leaf and soil samples were obtained from/beneath mature trees at 8 time-points in 2017-2018. Flooding induced mostly temporary soil chemical changes in the surface horizon, which enhanced trace-nutrient access to trees. Results suggest that the short-term flooding of Black Box on drained loamy sands likely provides nutritional advantage by generating soil chemical fluxes. They also raise questions about flooding-induced movement of nutrients through the soil profile, and about the combined effects of pedology and duration of flooding on the nutritional health of Black Box.

At the core it entails innovation to halt ongoing and reverse past degradation. It aims for increased functionality, not necessarily recovering past system states. Location-specific interventions in social-ecological systems reducing proximate pressures, need to synergize with transforming generic drivers of unsustainable land use. After reviewing pantropical international research on forests, trees, and agroforestry, we developed an options-by-context typology. Four intensities of land restoration interact: R.I. Ecological intensification within a land use system, R.II. Recovery/regeneration, within a local social-ecological system, R.III. Reparation/recuperation, requiring a national policy context, R.IV. Remediation, requiring international support and investment. Relevant interventions start from core values of human identity while addressing five potential bottlenecks: Rights, Know-how, Markets (inputs, outputs, credit), Local Ecosystem Services (including water, agrobiodiversity, micro/mesoclimate) and Teleconnections (global climate change, biodiversity). Six stages of forest transition (from closed old-growth forest to open-field agriculture and re-treed (peri)urban landscapes) can contextualize interventions, with six special places: water towers, riparian zone and wetlands, peat landscapes, small islands and mangroves, transport infrastructure, and mining scars. The typology can help to link knowledge with action in people-centric restoration in which external stakeholders coinvest, reflecting shared responsibility for historical degradation and benefits from environmental stewardship.

Although there is a large amount of literature, there is a gap for consolidating frameworks of migration-related to the interaction and correlation between drivers. We review scientific papers and research reports about three categories of drivers: Environmental Change (EC), Food Security (FS), and Violent Conflict (VC). First, we organize the literature to understand the explanations of the three drivers on migration individually, as well as the interactions among each other. Secondly, we analyse the literature produced regarding Colombia, Myanmar, and Tanzania; countries with different combinations of the driving factors for migration. Although we find that many correlations are explained in the literature, migration is mostly driven by structural vulnerabilities and unsustainable development paths in places that have a low resilience capacity to cope with risk. For example, food insecurity, as a product of environmental changes (droughts and floods), is seen as a mediating factor detonating violent conflict and migration in vulnerable populations. The paper contributes to the literature about multi-driven migration, presenting an overview of the way in which different driver combinations trigger migration. This is important for determining the best governance mechanisms and policy responses that tackle forced migration and improve the resilience of vulnerable communities as well as sustainable development.

Large-scale stable isotope characterization of a Late Cretaceous dinosaur-dominated ecosystem	GEOLOGY			English	Article							WESTERN INTERIOR; OXYGEN; BIOGEOGRAPHY; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; GRADIENTS; NICHE	In the Cretaceous of North America, environmental sensitivity and habitat specialization have been hypothesized to explain the surprisingly restricted geographic ranges of many large-bodied dinosaurs. Understanding the drivers behind this are key to determining broader trends of dinosaur species and community response to climate change under greenhouse conditions. However, previous studies of this question have commonly examined only small components of the paleo-ecosystem or operated without comparison to similar modern systems from which to constrain interpretations. Here we perform a high-resolution multi-taxic delta C-13 and delta O-18 study of a Cretaceous coastal floodplain ecosystem, focusing on species interactions and paleotemperature estimation, and compare with similar data from extant systems. Bio-apatite delta C-1(3) preserves predator-prey offsets between tyrannosaurs and ornithischians (large herbivorous dinosaurs), and between aquatic reptiles and fish. Large ornithischians had broadly overlapping stable isotope ranges, contrary to hypothesized niche partitioning driven by specialization on coastal or inland subhabitat use. Comparisons to a modern analogue coastal floodplain show similar patterns of ecological guild structure and aquatic-terrestrial resource interchange. Multi-taxic oxygen isotope temperature estimations yield results for the Campanian of Alberta (Canada) consistent with the few other paleotemperature proxies available, and are validated when applied for extant species from a modern coastal floodplain, suggesting that this approach is a simple and effective avenue for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Together, these new data suggest that dinosaur niche partitioning was more complex than previously hypothesized, and provide a framework for future research on dinosaur-dominated Mesozoic floodplain communities.

Understanding the long-term natural variability of dryland regions via paleo-reconstructions is therefore highly desirable. The delta O-18 of two coeval modern speleothems from Cathedral Cave, Wellington, in semi-arid SE Australia are compared to the instrumental record to assess its efficacy as a proxy of past hydrological variability. Stalagmite delta O-1(8) was modulated by the frequency of recharge events and epikarst evaporation of storage water. Prolonged intervals between recharge events, such as droughts, resulted in higher stalagmite delta O-1(8). Conversely, periods with more frequent recharge events and a positive water balance, resulted in lower delta O-1(8). Disequilibrium cave processes are likely to be enhanced during dry conditions, although it is argued that these will modulate delta O-1(8)spel in the same direction as epikarst evaporation, effectively amplifying the response of delta O-1(8)spel. Extreme events, such as floods and droughts, were also captured in the stalagmite records, although potentially with a lag of several years. We verify that modern speleothems from semi-arid regions can be used to reconstruct hydroclimate due to variations in delta O-1(8)spel modulated by karst processes. Such records are archives of past changes in recharge rather than precipitation amount or surface temperature, as is commonly applied to speleothem records from non-water-limited regions.

The European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative has released both Combined and Passive datasets, which include multiple satellites' measurements of soil moisture conditions since the 1980s. In this study, both volumetric soil moisture and soil moisture standardized anomalies from the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) were compared with ESA's Combined and Passive datasets. Results from this study indicate the importance of using standardized anomalies over volumetric soil moisture conditions as satellite datasets were unable to capture the frequency of conditions observed at the extreme ends of the volumetric distribution. Overall, the Combined dataset had slightly lower measures of soil moisture anomaly errors for all regions; although these differences were not statistically significant. Both satellite datasets were able to detect the evolution from worsening to amelioration of the 2012 drought across the central United States and 2019 flood over the upper Missouri River basin. While the ESA datasets were not able to detect the magnitude of the extremes, the ESA standardized datasets were able to detect the interannual variability of extreme wet and dry day counts for most climate regions. These results suggest that remotely sensed standardized soil moisture can be included in hydrological monitoring systems and combined with in situ measures to detect the magnitude of extreme conditions.

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) model-based predictions often fail to predict the extremes. This could be due to several reasons, including insufficient model resolution to capture the sub-grid scale processes, inadequate high-quality observational data for assimilation, uncertainty in initial conditions and approximations in model physics. Estimation of rainfall for different return periods (RP) using extreme value analysis (EVA) can aid in better decision-making. RP of an event indicates its probability and rarity over the region. The current study shows how EVA can be used to supplement model predictions. This study uses the high-resolution (0.25x0.25) gridded observed rainfall data from India Meteorological Department (IMD), which has been available for 117 years (1901-2017). The generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution is applied with suitable goodness-of-fit tests. Rainfall amounts corresponding to 100-year RP are estimated using EVA over the entire data period (1901-2017) and three epochs (1901-1940, 1941-1980, and 1981-2017). The results indicate increasing rainfall amounts corresponding to 100-year RP. Similarly, rainfall amounts for 25, 50, 100, and 200-year RP over Kerala are computed to compare with the extremely heavy rainfall (<= 21 cm/day) amounts reported during JJAS 2018 and 2019. Further, this approach supplements the operational forecasts of NCUM-G model forecasts.

In the midst of climate change, and particularly of intensifying and/or more frequent storms around the globe, accurate information about the frequency and magnitude of extreme storm surge becomes increasingly important. To date, such information is mostly available where tide gauges are installed. However, for comprehensive coastal zone management this information is equally important at ungauged sites, especially when coastal communities exist nearby. In this work, we use still water level measurements from tide gauges along the US Gulf Coast, and in conjunction with atmospheric reanalysis data (ERA5) we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) to estimate extreme storm surge frequency. Our analysis demonstrates that the model yields extreme storm surge return levels with relatively small uncertainty compared to best-practice Maximum Likelihood analysis. The structure of our model allows us to provide spatial maps of extreme storm surge frequency information along the entire Gulf Coast, even at unmonitored coasts. These maps indicate that the BHM successfully captures the interconnectivity of extreme seas and clearly show meaningful clusters of storm surge hazard around the domain of interest. The results of this study will be of interest to decision makers, engineering design firms, and flood insurers, assisting them in adapting to imminent coastal flood risk.

In this study, we reconstructed the natural flow in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MRYR) not regulated by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) based on a long- short-term memory model. We then evaluated the dynamics of eco-hydrological regimes using environmental flow components and ecohydrological risk indicators and quantified the impacts of the TGR. The results showed that the hydrological stability has increased after TGR construction, with significant decreases in the frequency and duration of extremely low -flows, large floods, and small floods. In addition, there is a high eco-hydrological risk in the MRYR, with a higher ecodeficit and showing a continuous upward trend. The impact of the TGR on environmental flow components decreases along the river, averaging 42.1%, with the strongest impact on small floods, accounting for 56.2%. Overall, reservoir regulation has counteracted the increased eco-risk caused by climate change. Considering only the TGR, the ecosurplus in the spring and winter seasons increased, while the ecodeficit increased in the autumn season, with corresponding contribution rates of 81.4, 82.7, and 53.1%, respectively.

Improving urban flood risk resilience has become a critical issue for city management. However, urban flood assessment models on the resilience perspective are rare. Meanwhile, in the perspective of resilience, the existing studies using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) assessment method for disaster assessment lack consideration of evaluation scenarios located in the midpoint of positive and negative ideal solutions. To address these issues, this study establishes an urban flood disaster resilience assessment model, selects indicators according to the TOSE (Technical, Organizational, Social and Economic) framework, ranks cities through the VIKOR-GRA (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje, Grey Relational Analysis) method, and proposes measures to improve urban disaster resilience through the resilience assessment. Chongqing is taken as an example in this study to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model, and practical management opinions are presented to improve flood resilience in these cities. Through the analysis of actual cases, it can be seen that the model has good applicability and can better reflect the actual situation. The knowledge of flood resilience assessment methods is of particular value to policy makers, researchers and industry professionals in assessing potential risks and recognizing the importance of flood prevention mechanisms.

Although the preservation of coastal ecosystems is of the utmost importance, it is often sub-optimally pursued by Governments and Societies because of the high costs involved. We consider salt-marsh ecosystems in the Venice Lagoon as an example of a threatened landscape, calling for innovative, integrated management strategies, and propose an application-driven methodological framework to support policymakers in the identification of cost-effective incentive policies to ecosystem preservation. By combining group decision-making and Value-Focused-Thinking approaches, we provide a multiple-criteria decision model, based on pairwise comparisons, to identify which ESs are top-priority policy targets according to a cost-effective perspective. We implemented an online Delphi survey process and interviewed a pool of experts who identified "recreation and tourism", "coastal protection from flooding", "carbon storage", "biodiversity and landscape", and "nursery habitats for fisheries" as the five most relevant ESs for the Venice Lagoon taking into consideration the Environmental, Economic, and Social perspectives. Our results suggest that the Environmental perspective is the most important criteria, whereas "biodiversity and landscape" is acknowledged as the most important ES.

However, the issues on whether and how the building-induced rainfall redistribution (BIRR) influences hydrologic responses are still not well understood despite the numerous downspouts in the urban area. Hence, this study brings the roof layer into a grid-based urban hydrologic model (gUHM) to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of BIRR, aiming to enhance the understanding of building effects in urban hydrology and subsequently to identify the necessity of incorporating BIRR into flood forecasting. Nine land development strategies and 27 rainfall conditions are considered herein to characterize the changing circumstance. Results indicate that the impacts of BIRR depend on multiple circumstance factors and are nonnegligible in urban hydrology. The BIRR causes not only bidirectional impacts on the hydrologic characteristic values (e.g., peak flow and runoff volume) but also an obvious alteration of the hydrograph. Overall, the BIRR tends to increase the peak flow, and more importantly, the impact will be aggravated by the increase of rainfall intensity with the maximum relative error of peak flow approaching 10%. This study contributes to a better understanding of building effects on urban hydrology and a step forward to reduce the uncertainty in urban flood warnings.

This study presents baseflow and baseflow index (BFI) trend analyses for 10 undisturbed watersheds in Michigan using (1) multi-objective optimization (MOO) and (2) modified Mann-Kendall (MK) tests corrected for short-term autocorrelation (STA). Results indicate a variability in mean baseflow (0.09-8.70 m(3)/s) and BFI (67.9-89.7%) that complicates regional-scale extrapolations of groundwater recharge. Long-term (>60 years) MK trend tests indicate a significant control of total precipitation (P) and snow- to rainfall transitions on baseflow and BFI. In the Lower Peninsula Rifle River watershed, increasing P and a transition from snow- to rainfall has increased baseflow at a lower rate than streamflow; an overall pattern that may contribute to documented flood frequency increases. In the Upper Peninsula Ford River watershed, decreasing P and a transition from rain- to snowfall had no significant effects on baseflow and BFI. Our results highlight the value of an objectively constrained BFI parameter for shorter-term (<50 years) hydrologic trend analysis because of a lower STA susceptibility.

One of the major limitations is the avocado wilt complex disease (AWC) caused by biotic and abiotic factors which have increased under the El Nino southern oscillation ENSO phenomenon (El Nino, La Nina). The objective of this study was to evaluate different strategies for mitigating the adverse effects associated with the ENSO phenomenon and AWC in avocado crops. We evaluated native materials, mulches, and parameters associated with the production of seedlings and planting practices in the field. The response variables tested were plant development, incidence, severity, mortality, and microbial dynamics, among others. The results indicated that native genotypes ofPersea americanahad different levels of adaptability to drought and flooding conditions. These genotypes also showed some degree of resistance toPhytophthora cinnamomiandVerticilliumsp. infection with several degrees of rootstock-scion incompatibility with the Hass cultivar. In addition, mulch reduced the variability of soil moisture and temperature in the soil profile. Adequate selection of genotypes and new tools for planting have decreased the susceptibility to adverse effects associated with the ENSO phenomenon and the incidence and mortality caused by diseases under drought and flooding conditions. This work presents alternatives to mitigate adverse effects of climate variability in avocado crops under tropical conditions.

Having detected the inability of conventional storm-water management to cope alone with e.g. urban flooding, the incorporation of SuDS in action plans can enable a shift towards a more sustainable handling of storm-water. The principles underlying adaptive storm-water management can potentially be realised through the implementation of SuDS. However, the SuDS concept remains undeveloped and poorly researched in Mediterranean countries. This paper explores the extent to which SuDS have been used to manage floods in Italy and Southern France. Examples of SuDS are identified through a review of grey literature and then analysed by a set of socio-technical criteria that evaluate the adoption of the principles of adaptive storm-water management. Findings show an ongoing transition towards an adaptive approach, although mature adaptive storm-water management has been neither supported in policy nor realised in practice. SuDS are fostered in both countries but while a recent increase in their adoption can be observed in Southern France, their implementation is more limited in Italy. However, a conservative and technically focused policy and implementation process has been promoted. Governance practices have, for instance, undergone almost no change.

In order to prevent damages, an early warning system (EWS) has been planned for the Sirba River, the major tributary of the Middle Niger River Basin. The EWS uses the prior notification of Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) to realize adaptive measures in the exposed villages. This study analyzed the performances of GloFAS 1.0 and 2.0 at Garbey Kourou. The model verification was performed using continuous and categorical indices computed according to the historical flow series and the flow hazard thresholds. The unsatisfactory reliability of the original forecasts suggested the performing of an optimization to improve the model performances. Therefore, datasets were divided into two periods, 5 years for training and 5 years for validation, and an optimization was conducted applying a linear regression throughout the homogeneous periods of the wet season. The results show that the optimization improved the performances of GloFAS 1.0 and decreased the forecast deficit of GloFAS 2.0. Moreover, it highlighted the fundamental role played by the hazard thresholds in the model evaluation. The optimized GloFAS 2.0 demonstrated performance acceptable in order to be applied in an EWS.

J	Guang, M				Guang, Ma			Re-evaluating the <i>Wokou</i> Problem in East Asia During the 1220s and 1390s from the Perspective of Environmental History	JOURNAL OF ASIAN HISTORY			English	Article						Wokou; East Asia; climate change; natural disasters; maritime trade	TEMPERATURE	Previously, scholars have focused almost exclusively on the wokou (Japanese pirates) during the late Ming. (1368-1644) dynasty but paid little attention to the serious wokou problem in Yuan. (1271-1368) China and during the Koryo (918-1392) dynasty. As early as 1223, the wokou began to raid Koryo, and from 1309 on they began to invade China's coasts, including those of the provinces Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong and Liaodong . The causes of these wokou raids are very complex and should be analyzed from a broader East Asian perspective. The traditional explanations are a politically unstable situation and turmoil in Japan and weaknesses in the coastal defenses in Korea and China. However, as will be argued in this study, a crucial factor was also various natural disasters, including droughts, typhoons, epidemics and floods, and possibly changes in the climate. This paper aims to explore wokou raids in China and Korea and discuss their activities while taking these causes into account, in particular, changes in the local climate. The Chinese and Korean governments did not close their doors and block trade; on the contrary, they permitted Japanese merchants to conduct trade along the coasts freely at the time, showing that the presence of wokou was not necessarily related to whether or not there was a prohibition against maritime trade, which is very different from the situation during the Jiajing period (1522-1566) of the Ming.

J	Tran, TA				Thong Anh Tran			From free to forced adaptation: A political ecology of the 'state-society-flood' nexus in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article						adaptation; flood management; human-environment interactions; political ecology; Vietnamese Mekong Delta	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; KNOWLEDGE; RIVER; HOUSEHOLDS; SYSTEMS	This paper investigates the adaptation processes with reference to the narrative analysis of human-environment interactions in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. From the political ecology perspective, it focuses on the discourses of the power relationships embedded within the 'state-society-flood' nexus over the course of its 'opening-up and closing-off' processes (e.g. excavating large-scale canals for human settlements and agricultural expansion (opening-up) and human interventions into natural systems through water control structures (closing-off)). Drawing on empirical data gathered from 33 interviews and nine focus group discussions in three study areas and relevant literature, the paper argues that human interactions with the flood environments are intertwined with adjustments of adaptation patterns as evidenced through three periods: free adaptation (pre-1975), transitional adaptation (1976-2010) and forced adaptation (after 2010). These processes have witnessed a gradual power shift in the 'state-society' relations in manipulating floods, which moves from the top-down towards a more collaborative fashion. By unravelling the political ecology of the 'state-society-flood' nexus, this paper exhibits the skewed development in the delta, which is largely bound to short-term development planning to prioritise local socio-economic and political objectives. The paper contributes important policy implications for achieving socially just and environmentally sustainable development in the delta.

This study was aimed, by a two-years side-by-side comparison, at verifying the hypothesis whether "Alternate Wetting and Drying" (AWD) affects the concentrations of health-related compounds and minerals in brown grains of three japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cvs ('Baldo', 'Gladio', and 'Loto') usually grown in temperate areas in continuous flooding (CF). Due to the rotational turns in water distribution imposed by local authorities and to the weather behavior, different AWD timing and severity occurred in the two years of the study. AWD induced in both seasons yield losses in 'Baldo' and 'Gladio' but not in 'Loto'. In the brown grains of 'Loto', AWD increased the concentrations of total tocols, gamma-oryzanol, flavonoids, and the antioxidant activity. AWD affected the concentrations of minerals, particularly increasing copper, cadmium and nickel, and decreasing manganese, arsenic and zinc. In the sensitive cultivars, 'Baldo' and 'Gladio', AWD seems to affect plant yield, rather than for severity of the dry period, for prolonged absence of ponded water that exposes plants to cooler temperatures. The selection of suitable cultivars, like 'Loto', tolerant to AWD-related stresses, could combine environmental, yield-related, and nutritional benefits improving the product quality.

J	Chang, SE; Yip, JZK; Tse, W				Chang, Stephanie E.; Yip, Jackie Z. K.; Tse, Wendy			Effects of urban development on future multi-hazard risk: the case of Vancouver, Canada	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Risk; Projection; Urban development; Earthquake; Flood; Coastal	VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE; LOSSES; FLOOD; PROJECTIONS	Disaster risk reduction should anticipate how future natural hazard risk would be influenced by changes in urban vulnerability. This paper investigates the effect of one key driver of change, urban development. It models current and future risk for the year 2041 in a rapidly growing urban area, Vancouver, Canada, from both earthquake and coastal flood hazard. Three urban development futures are considered-status quo, compact, and sprawled development-that differ in the housing stock configuration used to accommodate an identical, projected increase in population and dwellings. Results indicate that while exposure is expected to increase substantially in future, the implications for risk vary greatly between hazards and impact types. For earthquake, population increase is attenuated by improvements in the building stock, whereas for flooding, disaster impacts increase at a much higher rate than population growth. Overall, disruption impacts are more sensitive than damage to changes in population and development. The effect of urban development on future risk is not unidirectional, but depends upon hazard type, impact type, and degree of climate change. None of the development futures is consistently best from a risk perspective, but along many dimensions, compact development yields more severe disaster impacts relative to status quo development. The findings underscore the importance of considering natural hazard risk in urban development planning, and of recognizing the inherent differences between hazards and impact types in this planning.

J	Henrique, KP; Tschakert, P				Henrique, Karen Paiva; Tschakert, Petra			Contested grounds: Adaptation to flooding and the politics of (in)visibility in Sao Paulo's eastern periphery	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Urban political ecology; Feminist political ecology; Climate justice; Exclusion; Displacement; Everyday resistance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGY; JUSTICE; RESILIENCE; RIGHTS; VULNERABILITY; PATHWAYS; IMPACTS; POLICY	As flood events become more intense and frequent, cities throughout the world increasingly devise projects for flood management and control, including hard and soft infrastructural solutions. Among these, an emblematic example is the project Parque Varzeas do Tiete (PVT) or Tiete Lowlands Park a 75 km-long floodplain restoration scheme proposed by the government of Sao Paulo, Brazil, to allegedly solve the city's flooding problem. The project's execution, however, is contingent on the removal of approximately 7500 low-income families, raising questions on the intertwined relationship between adaptation to flooding and the exclusion of informal urban settlements. Drawing on urban and feminist political ecology, we use the PVT as a case study to examine the politics and uneven outcomes of adaptation in Sao Paulo's eastern periphery. We combine archival and ethnographic work to expose the persistent politics of invisibility that sustain the project's exclusionary contours. In the process, we also demonstrate the various ways floodplain residents reshape their invisibility to contest, negotiate, and resist the PVT in the spaces of their everyday lives. As a result, the analysis identifies the project's perverse effects but also opportunities for productive engagements between the government and local communities towards more just, inclusive, and equitable adaptation futures in Sao Paulo, and beyond.

J	Park, E; Lewis, QW; Sanwlani, N				Park, Edward; Lewis, Quinn W.; Sanwlani, Nivedita			Large lake gauging using fractional imagery	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Lakes; Water level; Floodplains; Rivers; Optical remote sensing	SEDIMENT DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; TONLE-SAP LAKE; AMAZON RIVER; WATER-LEVEL; FLOOD DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFRASTRUCTURE; VEGETATION; CAMBODIA; WETLANDS	Large floodplain lakes provide riparian habitat, are sediment and nutrient sinks, help control flow connectivity and flooding along rivers, and are both used by humans and strongly impacted by human activity. However, water level in many remote large floodplain lakes, especially in developing countries, is often monitored inconsistently or not at all. In this study, a novel method for estimating large lake water level using passive, optical remote sensing data combined with any digital elevation model (DEM) is presented. The method obtains water level estimates at 30 m(2) resolution using Landsat, in this case in conjunction with SRTM elevation data, nested within a 240 m(2) grid "fishnet". A probabilistic mean of elevation values for all water-designated pixels (between 5% and 95% filled within each grid) produces lake water levels often accurate to within +/- 50 cm of gauged reference data on Lake Curuai in the Amazon River and Tonle Sap Lake along the Mekong River. The method is relatively insensitive to cloud cover, especially as lake size increases. This study is the first to use solely passive optical remote sensing data for water level estimation and thus could be used to produce accurate, long-term estimations of water level in many large lakes globally. The use of optical sensors to obtain lake water level is both an important complement and potential alternative to methods that use active sensors.

The present study is an attempt to assess the near-future water stress zones of the basin by analysing seven variables under GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA): dryness intensity (DI), dry-episodes frequency (DF), wet-episodes frequency (WF), annual rainfall trend (RfT), dry days trend (DD), population growth rate (P-GR) and groundwater fluctuation rate (G(WR)). The weight of the variables was assigned by analytical hierarchical process (AHP), and water stress regions were identified using weighted linear combination (WLC) under GIS-MCDA. DI, DF and WF for the last three decades of this basin were calculated using the 9-month Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-9). Mann-Kendall's test and Sen's slope were used to examine the dry and wet trends in SPEI-9 and estimate the groundwater fluctuation rate. The analysis shows that if the current trends of the seven climatic, hydrologic and demographic variables persist, then the interior districts of the basin will be prone to high water stress risk in the near future. This study has identified the districts that need urgent structural and non-structural changes in the current water resource management practices to sustain the future climate change challenges.

The hatching of terrestrial amphibian eggs in response to flooding may be basal within the group, but amphibian lineages in tropical Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have not received as much attention as their Neotropical counterparts. We investigated submergence-induced hatching in Feihyla hansenae, a Rhacophorid tree frog with terrestrial eggs. We quantified natural rates of clutch submergence at our study site in Thailand. Using submergence experiments, we found that embryos are capable of hatching early to escape flooding, and that failure to hatch results in mortality. Among the embryos that were able to hatch early, only the earliest, youngest hatchlings experienced a trade-off in body size that persisted for 6 days, while later, older hatchlings were not significantly smaller than spontaneous hatchlings under control conditions. By incorporating our natural and experimental data into Monte Carlo methods to simulate and compare survival probabilities with and without hatching plasticity, we found an overall 3.1% increase in submergence survival due to hatching plasticity. Our findings support the idea that flooding-induced hatching is widespread across amphibians with terrestrial eggs and highlight the importance of researching understudied tropical regions. As climate change is projected to affect rainfall patterns, the ability of embryos to escape abiotic egg-stage threats may be an indicator of species' ability to flexibly navigate a changing environment.

The focus is on comparing different irrigation techniques in terms of their water savings, cost efficiency, and crop yields, in relation to the conventional flooding method (CFM). Specifically, the research considers the responsive drip irrigation system (RDI), subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and raised-bed irrigation method (RSB). The data for this study relates to a 1-hectare tomato farm located in the Potohar plateau of Pakistan. Joint interview sessions were conducted to gather integrated data, along with information from previous studies. To analyze the cost-effectiveness of the irrigation techniques, the study utilizes system dynamics (SD) and employs "VENSIM PLE" software. A single SD model was created to meet the requirements for cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), simulating the implicated techniques over a period of 25 years. Additionally, an optimization scenario was developed using geometric mean maximization, aiming to maximize monetary benefits while maintaining environmental benefits in equilibrium. The findings of this study indicate that the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) for water-saving capacity is highest for RDI, which can save 0.135 million m3 of water over 25 years. Furthermore, RDI achieves a 78% higher crop yield compared to the CFM. On the other hand, SDI demonstrates the highest CER for crop yield, offering 41.5% more benefits to farmers when compared to the CFM.

J	Zhou, Y; Wu, XF				Zhou, Yuan; Wu, Xuefei			Identification of priority areas for green stormwater infrastructure based on supply and demand evaluation of flood regulation service	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Green stormwater infrastructure(GSI); Flood regulation services(FRS); Supply and demand evaluation	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; URBAN STORMWATER; RISK-ASSESSMENT; SOCIAL DEMAND; RESILIENCE; LANDSCAPE; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; PROVINCE	Under global climate change and rapid urbanization, urban waterlogging has become increasingly severe in the world. Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI), which can provide flood regulation service (FRS), is seen as a key measure to help address this challenge in the construction of a sponge city. With less consideration given to social and economic factors, most current methods for the layout of GSI only lay emphasis on the management, control, and mitigation of flooding. As a result, the service provided by GSI cannot reach the people or areas in most need, leading to inefficient utilization of the construction funds. This study provides a new framework for identifying the priority areas of GSI that considers both flood mitigation benefits and socio-economic benefits by introducing the evaluation of FRS supply and demand into GSI planning. In addition, land use measurement and disaster risk assessment were used to quantify and visualize the supply and demand of FRS, respectively. Based on the evaluation results, the priority areas for GSI can be identified. The research results provide a new basis and guidance for the planning and layout of GSI, and optimization of GSI spatial layout at a macro-scale, which also can guide the construction of sponge city. Finally, a case study of Wuhan was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the framework.

Some literature reviews have provided valuable background on a specific LID optimization part, such as tools, objectives or planning, etc. However, a systematic review covering a complete optimization process remains lacking. In this study, a comprehensive optimization framework involving seven steps was first constructed. Eighty-eight research papers were retrieved and thor-oughly analyzed. Results showed a growing trend about large-scale optimization on numerous small-scale achievements, which would alter optimization objectives (society, environment or ecology, etc.) and furtherly determine tool selection. Nonetheless, large-scale optimization is challenging due to theoretical and technical limitations. Besides, most studies focused on a single scale, of which objective quantification and related multi-scale matching may be problematic. Coupled green-grey optimization is the common conduction for better benefits (average 61% and 54% runoff volume and pollution reduction). Nevertheless, water body (blue) re-sponses have not been fully incorporated into optimization and assessment. Therefore, objectives downscaling decomposition and schemes up-scaling theory were proposed to integrate green-grey-blue system for multi-scale optimization. This study complemented review through an optimization process, contributing to explore future perspectives of this field more comprehensively.

However, spatial and temporal patterns of cloud bases embedded within atmospheric currents flowing over mountainous terrain still need to be more adequately described. To advance understanding, hourly observations of barometric pressure and ambient and dew point temperatures from 1948 to 2017 were acquired for seven airports located at 40.21 degrees N (average) and crossing the Allegheny Mountains of the northeastern United States. Daily LCL trends were quantified, and large positive (2.3 m yr(-1)) and negative (-1.3 m yr(-1)) LCL trends were found to be greatest near seasonal transition dates (17 April and 9 November 2022). Cool season LCLs (795 m) increased significantly (p < 0.007) at five sites resulting in an average LCL increase of 81 m and implying a deeper and drier sub-cloud layer. Average warm season LCLs (773 m) decreased by 23 m, suggesting a deeper convective cloud layer and less sub-cloud evaporation that may facilitate higher hydrometeor growth and precipitation rates. Collective results indicate divergent seasonally averaged LCLs characterized by more rapid seasonal transitions, warmer and less cloudy cool seasons, and cloudier and more humid warm seasons that may be partly attributable to aggressive reforestation and contribute to more significant rainfall events and higher flood risks.

More recently, geomorphometric characteristics have been added to determine more suitable locations for dams and reservoirs depending on their dimensions. This study presents a fully automatized ArcGIS Pro model, suitable for working with several digital elevation model resolutions and for evaluating best potential reservoir locations to reduce evaporation losses. Here, a smart location strategy to preserve water resources is used based on the premise that the higher the ratio of water stored to water surface area of the reservoir, the lower the water evaporation. The model was tested in two dissimilar basins in the province of Cadiz (SW Spain) and the results are compared with the nearby existing reservoirs. The methodology presented in this paper allows selecting the most suitable sites where it is possible to build a reservoir with a water surface smaller than other reservoirs but also able to hold an equal or greater volume of water; this also allows reducing the area occupied by the reservoir. As an example, in the first study case presented in this paper, a new reservoir could store 30.7 m(3)/m(2) versus the current 9 m(3)/m(2) stored in the nearby existing reservoir. This may reduce the flooded area from 25.4 to just 6.7 km(2).

On steep slopes, it behaves like a large specific-weight sediment-water mixture, rather than general fluid. Thus, its momentum rapidly increases, damaging human lives and properties. This study developed a numerical model of debris flow considering driftwood and entrainment erosion, and performed numerical simulations based on the 2011 observation data of Mt. Umyeon. To develop the debris-flow model, the Nays2DFlood model, which is a flooding model based on the shallow-water equation, was coupled with the advection and diffusion of the sediment-water mixture, debris-flow bottom shear-stress, and entrainment-erosion modules. The simulation better reproduced the depth, flow velocity, and debris-flow volume of Mt. Umyeon. In particular, the driftwood generation and motions, by debris flow, were well demonstrated in the numerical simulation. Moreover, the driftwood partially reduced the drag force, and the shielding effect of the forest caused a delay in the runoff duration-time. The results of this study are expected to help establish measures to reduce debris disasters that can respond to the current situation, wherein debris damage is increasing, owing to the increased rainfall because of climate change. This subsequently increases the possibility of debris flows and the consequent damage. In particular, the predictive methodology of the refined model expands the understanding of numerical treatment for debris flow and driftwood, by reflecting the detailed physical regime.

Enhanced agriculture, infrastructure development, changes in hydrological regime, forest fires, and natural resources exploitation are the key variables that caused the depletion of these two wetland areas. Land cover, particularly vegetation coverage, has been changed considerably during the post-war period and agriculture has been intensified in the surrounding areas of U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim wetlands. The current water management strategies in U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim were designated to ensure proper water circulation during the dry and wet seasons in a way helpful to agriculture in the buffer zones and to prevent forest fires during the dry season. It is found that the water management strategies to prevent forest fires in both the parks resulted in the accumulation of toxic agrochemicals within the park during the wet season. Both U Minh Thuong and Tram Chim wetlands are invaded by alien plant species which is threatening the natural biodiversity of the area. Proper monitoring and control of invasive species is necessary for protecting the natural biodiversity of these wetland ecosystems. Proper law enforcement and an interactive and inclusive wetland management should be practiced in order to conserve these valuable wetland ecosystems.

J	Tempa, K				Tempa, Karma			District flood vulnerability assessment using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with historical flood events in Bhutan	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COASTAL CITIES; RISK; HAZARD; DECISION; INDEX; RECONSTRUCTION; IMPACT; BASIN; LIFE; CITY	Flood hazards are common in Bhutan as a result of torrential rainfall. Historical flooding events also point to flooding during the main monsoon season of the year, which has had a huge impact in many parts of the country. To account for climate change patterns in flood hazards in Bhutan, 116 historical flood events between 1968 and 2020 for 20 districts were retrieved and reviewed. The preliminary review revealed that the frequency of flood occurrence has increased by three times in recent years. In this study, seven flood vulnerability (FV) indicators were considered. Five are the attributes of historical floods, classified into a number of incidents for flood events, fatalities, affected population, and infrastructure damages including economic losses. Additionally, the highest annual rainfall and existence of a flood map were other two indicators considered. Using historical data, flood hazard and impact zonation were performed. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed to derive a multi-criteria decision model. This resulted in priority ranking of the seven FV indicators, broadly classified into social, physical/economic, and environmental. Thereafter, an indicator-based weighted method was used to develop the district flood vulnerability index (DFVI) map of Bhutan. The DFVI map should help researchers understand the flood vulnerability scenarios in Bhutan and use these to mediate flood hazard and risk management. According to the study, FVI is very high in Chhukha, Punakha, Sarpang, and Trashigang districts, and the index ranges between 0.75 to 1.0.

The results indicated that the annual and seasonal T-min and T-max are increasing for all the six climatic stations, whereas four of them exhibit significant increasing trends at (alpha = 0.05). Moreover, this increase in T-min and T-max was found more pronounced at higher altitude stations, i.e., Pahalgam (2650 m asl) and Gulmarg (2740 m asl). The annual and seasonal precipitation patterns for all climatic stations showed downward trends. For instance, Gulmarg station exhibited a significant downward trend for the annual, spring, and winter seasons (alpha = 0.05). Whereas, Qazigund showed a significant downward trend for the annual and spring seasons (alpha = 0.05). The overall analysis revealed that the increased T-min and T-max trends during the winter season are one of the reasons behind the early onset of melting of snow and the corresponding spring season. Furthermore, the observed decreased precipitation trends could result in making the region vulnerable towards drier climatic extremes. Such changes in the region's hydro-meteorological processes shall have severe implications on the delicate ecological balance of the fragile environment of the Kashmir valley.

Sea level rise and low sediment supply are widely recognized as the two main factors contributing to land-to-water conversion. To determine what marsh areas are more resilient, it is fundamental to identify the drivers that regulate marsh accretion and degradation. In this study, a combination of field data and aerial images is used to determine these drivers in Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana, USA. We find that accretion and degradation patterns depend on whether the marsh is located inland in a sheltered area or facing open water. In the first case, the distance to the nearby channel is important, because during flooding of the marsh platform more sediment is deposited in the proximity of channel banks. The accretion rates of marshes facing open water are high and correlate to fetch, a proxy for the ability of waves to resuspend bottom sediment. These areas are more resilient to sea level rise, but waves are also the main mechanism of degradation, as these marshes tend to degrade by edge erosion. Consequently, we propose a bimodal evolution trajectory of the marshes in Terrebonne Bay: marshes close to the bay and facing open water accrete rapidly but are affected by lateral erosion due to waves, whereas sheltered marshes accrete slowly and degrade in large swathes due to insufficient sediment supply.

Studies aiming at defining potential risk scenarios represent a valuable tool for the identification of the most suitable coastal adaptation measures. After outlining sea level rise implications at the Mediterranean scale, this paper deals with inundation risk scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100 for the north-eastern sector of the Island of Gozo (Malta), central Mediterranean Sea. The analysis, carried out by applying an index-based procedure, firstly required the evaluation of the susceptibility to inundation of the investigated coastal stretch under different sea level projections. Then, the spatial combination of inundation susceptibility with the exposure and vulnerability of the area allowed identification of the most critical sectors in terms of coastal risk. The results of the analysis showed that, under the worst-case climate scenarios, 5.5% and 8.1% of the investigated coastal sector are prone to very high inundation risk (Class R4) in 2050 and 2100, respectively. In particular, the bays of Ramla and Marsalforn, which are characterized by significant economic and touristic activities, were found to be the sites where the expected impacts of future sea level rise will be higher if no management strategy and adaptation action are taken in the near future.

This gives rise to the need of having advanced methods, e.g., computational intelligence tools, to improve upon the results from flooding events simulations and, in turn, design best practices for riverbed maintenance. In this context, being able to accurately estimate the roughness coefficient, also known as Manning's n coefficient, plays an important role when computational models are employed. In this piece of research, we propose an optimal approach for the estimation of 'n'. First, an objective function is designed for measuring the quality of 'candidate' Manning's coefficients relative to specif cross-sections of a river. Second, such function is optimised to return coefficients having the highest quality as possible. Five well-known meta-heuristic algorithms are employed to achieve this goal, these being a classic Evolution Strategy, a Differential Evolution algorithm, the popular Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, a classic Particle Swarm Optimisation and a Bayesian Optimisation framework. We report results on two real-world case studies based on the Italian rivers 'Paglia' and 'Aniene'. A comparative analysis between the employed optimisation algorithms is performed and discussed both empirically and statistically. From the hydrodynamic point of view, the experimental results are satisfactory and produced within significantly less computational time in comparison to classic methods. This shows the suitability of the proposed approach for optimal estimation of the roughness coefficient and, in turn, for designing optimised hydrological models.

Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the relationship between the occurrence of disasters and extreme climate, sociosanitary, and demographic conditions in the Northeast region of Brazil (NEB) during the period from 1993 to 2013. Initially, we analyzed the spatial pattern of the incidence of events; subsequently, generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape were used to identify and estimate the magnitude of associations between factors. Results showed that droughts are the predominant disasters in NEB representing 81.1% of the cases, followed by events triggered by excessive rainfall such as flash floods (11.1%) and floods (7.8%). Climate conditions presented statistically significant associations with the analyzed disasters, in which indicators of excess rainfall positively contributed to the occurrence of flash floods and floods but negatively contributed to the occurrence of drought. Sociosanitary factors, such as percentage of households with inadequate sewage, waste collection, and water supply, were also positively associated with the model's estimations, that is, contributing to an increase in the occurrence of events, with the exception of floods, which were not significantly influenced by sociosanitary parameters. A decrease of 19% in the risk of drought occurrence was estimated, on average. On the other hand, events caused by excessive rainfall increased by 40% and 57%, in the cases of flash floods and floods, respectively.

The concept of resilience proposes new solutions to manage flood disaster. An urban flood resilience evaluation framework considering the flood disaster cycle of actual historic flood event and objective physical-socio-economic status is necessary for future flood mitigation. This paper proposes a holistic evaluation framework for evaluating urban flood resilience with VIKOR and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method. The proposed framework consists of indicators of resistance, coping, recovery and adaptation capacity of resilience for three stages of the flood disaster cycle, namely pre, during and post-flood. The framework has been applied to Yangtze River Delta (YRD) consisting 27 cities in China. Following a rigorous analysis, the cities are ranked and mapped, among which Nanjing stands out to be the first, whereas the entire region presents a moderate level of urban flood resilience varying from city to city. The detailed comparison with sensitivity analysis of resilience at regional, provincial and city level suggests a better resilience in pre-flood stage than post-flood stage. Finally, practical recommendations to regional and local level are provided for further flood mitigation and resilience improvement. The proposed framework is generalizable and useful to develop flood related standards, establish benchmarks, perform evaluation at regional, provincial and city levels across China and other parts of the world.

Reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities in the Caribbean through sustainable mangrove management	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal flood risk; Opportunity mapping; NDVI analysis; Virgin Islands	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROTECTION; ECOSYSTEMS; RESPONSES; FORESTS	The 2017 Atlantic storm season caused widespread damage to Caribbean nations including the British Virgin Islands. The winds and rainfall associated with Hurricanes Irma and Maria played their part in the destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and the environment. With an increased interest in nature-based solutions to reduce flood risk, increasing the resilience of coastal communities and a focus on three of the most vulnerable communities in the Virgin Islands, we report on the use of flood risk vulnerability models based on remotely sensed satellite data and ecosystem services principles. Models were created with 4 primary aims to: (1) monitor the impact of storms and the recovery of mangroves, (2) assess the risk of flooding due to hurricane storm surges and extra-tropical storms (ground seas), (3) model opportunity areas for the restoration of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) and (4) model and produce maps highlighting the predicted benefits that mangrove restoration will have on vulnerable coastal communities. Results highlight that between 75 and 94% of red mangroves in the three communities were negatively impacted by hurricanes in 2017. However, vulnerability models predict that even small-scale mangrove restoration initiatives can help to reduce the flood risk of homes and infrastructure up to 475 m inland. This work has provided the rationale for mangrove restoration in the Virgin Islands and presents an important tool for expansion across the wider Caribbean region that can be used to inform coastal restoration and resiliency building activities.

Using a wide range of sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios, socioeconomic pathways and discount rate assumptions, 21st century coastal migration is assessed at global scale assuming local cost-benefit optimal protection decisions for about 12,000 coastal segments with homogeneous coastal and socioeconomic characteristics. Costs considered include investment and maintenance cost for protection, migration cost in the case of no protection, and expected annual damage to assets by extreme sea-level events that over-top existing protection. Robust decisions in favor of protection over all scenarios are found for about 3% of the global coastline, covering 78% of global coastal population and 92% of global coastal floodplain assets. For the remaining 97% of global coastline cumulative 21st century land loss ranges from 60,000 to 415,000 km(2) and coastal migration ranges from 17 to 72 million people. Big countries with long uninhabited coastlines suffer the biggest land losses. In absolute terms big countries in South and South-east Asia account for the highest coastal migration, while in relative terms small island nations suffer most. Global cost of 21st century SLR can be lowered by factor two to four if local cost-benefit decisions also consider, next to protection, coastal migration as an adaptation option.

Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of HMPs across China is important for enabling better disaster estimation and prevention at the national scale. However, few studies have focused on the spatiotemporal HMP characterization under various geomorphic settings in China, which may shed light on their regional/national evolution. To bridge this research gap, we analysed the longest HMP time series available in China, which including 47,483 HMP records, to detect spatiotemporal patterns. Specifically, we run several tests namely, Mann-Kendall test, wavelet analysis, Monthly Frequency, and Index of Dispersion, with the objective of detecting the temporal evolution, trends, period, and clustering of HMPs in six geomorphological regions (geomorphic-regions): Eastern Plain, South Eastern Mountain (SEM), North Central Plateau, North Western Basin, South Western Mountain (SWM), and Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that in the last decades have been associated with a marked increase in HMPs and this should be accounted for, especially in those areas where we have retrieved high spatiotemporal clustering (e.g., SEM, SWM). Besides, the main periodicity of HMPs is approximately 12-25 years for most of China since the 1980s, which showed analogous patterns with precipitation anomalies. This study provides a preliminary reference for revealing the spatiotemporal characteristics of HMPs in the context of climate change; therefore, the information provided can be crucial to plan engineering applications with specific return period.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as a gaseous signal molecule, plays an important role in plant development and stress adaptation. Previous studies suggested that H2S acts as an oxygen sensor when animals experience hypoxia. However, the role of H2S in the response and adaptation to flooding-induced hypoxia stress in plants is poorly understood. Here, we report that pretreatment with exogenous H2S or Cys significantly improved tolerance to submergence in Arabidopsis. Total submergence of soil-grown Arabidopsis increased the levels of endogenous H2S and its main endogenously generated product, cysteine (Cys) over time, and altered the expression of H2S or Cys biosynthesis- or metabolism-related genes, implying that the H2S-Cys homeostasis may contribute to regulation of tolerance to flooding. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated that exogenous H2S-pretreatment activated hypoxia-responsive transcription factors and hypoxia sensing-related genes in a timely manner and limited cellular activities associated with growth through regulation of hormonal signaling, but had less influence on transcripts associated with photosynthesis. H2S-pretreatment also altered the levels of metabolites, particularly of amino acids and plant hormones, during submergence. Taken together, this study provides new insight into how H2S regulates tolerance to submergence-induced hypoxia stress and lays the foundation to design new strategies for the improvement of submergence resistance in crops.

The effects of a sudden injection of anoxic bottom water into surface waters are well known, as well as the degradation of phytoplankton blooms and the release of phytoplankton toxins. However, in this study we report on a new, climate-related cause of fish kills in a shallow lake. We observed that a long period of drought in a hot summer followed by heavy rain resulted in a large input of labile organic matter. This was followed by a condition of whole-lake anoxia and fish kill in the lake basin receiving the input, while the second basin, immediately downstream, was left unaffected. To test the causal relationship between these events, an oxygen model calculated that respiration had increased by 230% following the organic input and caused whole-lake nocturnal anoxia for four days despite unaltered daytime photosynthesis. One year after the fish kill, roach and bream had migrated from the downstream lake basin and re-established dense populations, while large predatory perch and pike remained very few. This imbalance in the fish food webs may last for several years and in turn increase predation on zooplankton and release phytoplankton from grazing control.The prolonged effects of fish kills on fish and lake community structure demand further research, as weather-induced anoxia can be expected to become more common.

In Europe, several flood events of this type have been recorded in the past century in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy and UK. First projections of compound flood hazard under climate change have been made, but no study has so far analysed whether existing, independent climate and hydrodynamic models are able to reproduce the co-occurrence of storm surges, precipitation, river discharges or waves. Here, we investigate the dependence between the different drivers in different observational and modelled data set, utilizing gauge records and high-resolution outputs of climate reanalyses and hindcasts, hydrodynamic models of European coasts and rivers. The results show considerable regional differences in strength of the dependence in surge-precipitation and surge-discharge pairs. The models reproduce those dependencies, and the time lags between the flood drivers, rather well in north-western Europe, but less successfully in the southern part. Further, we identified several compound flood events in the reanalysis data. We were able to link most of those modelled events with historical reports of flood or storm losses. However, false positives and false negatives were also present in the reanalysis and several large compound floods were missed by the reanalysis. All in all, the study still shows that accurate representation of compound floods by independent models of each driver is possible, even if not yet achievable at every location.

Such risks are expected to become worse given projected changes in climate, degradation of ecosystems, population growth and urbanisation. In this respect, nature-based solutions (NBSs) have emerged as effective means to respond to such challenges. A NBS is a term used for innovative solutions that are based on natural processes and ecosystems to solve different types of societal and environmental challenges. The present paper provides a critical review of the literature concerning NBSs for hydro-meteorological risk reduction and identifies current knowledge gaps and future research prospects. There has been a considerable growth of scientific publications on this topic, with a more significant rise taking place from 2007 onwards. Hence, the review process presented in this paper starts by sourcing 1608 articles from Scopus and 1431 articles from the Web of Science. The full analysis was performed on 146 articles. The analysis confirmed that numerous advancements in the area of NBSs have been achieved to date. These solutions have already proven to be valuable in providing sustainable, cost-effective, multi-purpose and flexible means for hydro-meteorological risk reduction. However, there are still many areas where further research and demonstration are needed in order to promote their upscal- ing and replication and to make them become mainstream solutions.

Changing Arctic River Dynamics Cause Localized Permafrost Thaw	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						permafrost; floodplains; rivers; thermal regime; modeling; climate change	ACTIVE-LAYER THICKNESS; SEASONAL SNOW COVER; KUPARUK RIVER; WATER; ALASKA; BASIN; TEMPERATURE; DEPTH; ICE; HYDROLOGY	Permafrost in the Arctic regions is degrading in response to decades of amplified warming. Advanced degradation of ice-rich permafrost could significantly alter the water balance by increasing runoff and flooding. How do the hydrological changes in river systems, in turn, affect the permafrost thermal state, specifically in floodplains? First, we develop a first-order heat budget approach to simulate evolving river-water temperature. The river-water thermal model includes heat exchanges at both the air-water and water-subsurface interfaces and can accurately estimate water temperature. Then, river-water temperature is employed as an upper boundary condition for the control volume permafrost model, which models the thermal state of shallow permafrost. The combined model is validated and applied in the Kuparuk River floodplain, Alaska. Results indicate that permafrost warms rapidly during inundation and that channelbelt active layer thickness can deepen by more than 1 m. We find that earlier arrival of the spring freshet and associated earlier inundation onset, as well as increase in river discharge, can significantly increase subsurface permafrost temperature and lead to a deepening of the active layer. In recent years Kuparuk River streamflow has arrived earlier, and mean annual river discharge has increased by 35% since the 1970s. New permanent water and seasonal water appeared throughout the river network of the Kuparuk River since the 1980s according to satellite observations. These hydrological changes likely have contributed to the expansion of riverbed thaw bulbs and the degradation of floodplain permafrost.

Adaptation strategies to cope with low, high and untimely floods: Lessons from the Gash spate irrigation system, Sudan	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Spate irrigation; Gash agricultural scheme; Adaptation strategies; Floods; Uncertain water supply; DPSIR framework	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; PERCEPTIONS; CATCHMENT; DROUGHT; EASTERN; FOOD	In arid areas, water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is often the only source of water for crop production. Stakeholders in spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply related to low, high and untimely floods. This research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the MULINO Decision Support System (mDSS4) tool which is based on the Driving force-PressureState-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. Using data from interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers, 17 water user associations (WUAs), and 7 system water managers in the Gash spate irrigation system in Sudan, we compare the effectiveness with the rate of adoption. The results reveal the most effective measures are 1) pre-flood preparedness, 2) risk sharing measures through water and land management during and after flood by WUAs, 3) crop management by farmers; and 4) flexibility in operation by water managers. Unfortunately, the most effective measures are not the most adopted ones. The level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the farmers, WUAs and water managers to implement the measures without outside support. Generally, measures taken by downstream farmers are less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources. Supporting farmers, WUAs and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence food security in the study area.

Recently, the impacts of droughts caused higher economic losses in comparison to, for example, floods and landslides. This study focuses on the spatio-temporal behaviour of cumulative rainfall deficits across Central America attempting to provide an historical context to the most recent drought episodes. We developed a long-term (1950-2014), monthly rainfall data set that merged large-scale interpolated products with a station observation network to spatially and temporally evaluate the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI12) across the region. We found that El Nino cannot always be associated with drier conditions and that severe droughts are likely to spatially develop from localized phenomena to cover the entire region beyond the Central American drought corridor (CADC). Furthermore, there is not always a clear separation into the Pacific and Caribbean domain in terms of drought behaviour, but generally El Nino episodes can be associated with drier conditions on the Pacific slope and wetter conditions in the Caribbean. We could also show that trends in the SPI series are spatially variable and that more localized significant positive and negative trends exist throughout Central America. For example, central pacific Nicaragua was identified as a hot spot for significant drying conditions related to El Nino. We aim at developing this effort into a nearreal time and publicly available drought monitor in the near future to increase resilience and adaption efforts in the region.

GIS-analyses of past land use changes in three Flemish river valleys since the late 18th century	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Land use/ land cover changes (LULCC); Floodplain management; Historical maps; Rural history	HISTORICAL MAPS; COVER CHANGES; LONG-TERM; WETLAND; FLOODPLAINS; DRIVERS	The restoration of riverine ecosystem services and floodplain landscapes has become an important tool in climate mitigation, however, it is often unclear what landscape a restoration is (or should be) referring to. Little is known moreover, about long-term transitions in historic valley land use or how they echo in contemporary perceptions of floodplain landscapes. Also in densely populated Flanders (in the north of Belgium), where floodplains are quickly losing their natural functions, policymakers are actively in pursuit of climate change adaptation strategies and sustainable valley management. We present the results of a GIS-based reconstruction of historical land use in three Flemish river valleys from 1771 to 2002 and compare them to changes in regional land use. We find that while grasslands initially and to a vast extent covered our selected floodplains, the latter were by the mid19th century cultivated for agricultural production, in line with a global expansion of arable land and regional demographic growth. Also forest cover in the studied river valleys grew exponentially from the late 19th century, unmatched by regional forest cover. After the Second World War, a denser road network, more area that is builtup and forest plantations visually contributed to valley compartmentalisation and the perception of a closed landscape. Varying soil textures and drainage levels or the (in)ability to manage them properly accounted for different(ly) (timed) land use changes between the studied floodplain areas. Regional changes in historic land use were of lesser importance.

Projections of precipitation extremes over the Volta Basin: insight from CanESM2 regional climate model under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 forcing scenarios	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						CanESM2; RCP; RCM; GCM; Precipitation extremes; Volta Basin	WATER-RESOURCES; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; SIMULATION; RAINFALL; AFRICA; PERFORMANCE; DROUGHT; INDEXES	Perturbations in extreme precipitation characteristics are investigated over the Volta Basin (VB) and its three subdomains (Sahel, Soudano-Sahel and Guinea Coast) for the early-21st (2030-2053) and mid-twenty-first centuries (2057-2080) under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Seven climate indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices were selected to examine future extreme precipitation features. Owing to its performance over the West African sub region, CanESM2 model results were used with Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC v7) dataset serving as reference data. Results generally show lowering trends in extreme precipitation events over the VB. The declines in extremes were dominant in the Sahel and Soudano-Sahel zones with some degree of upsurges observed in the Guinea Coast. Spatially over the basin, wet spells (CWD) were projected to shorten under RCP 8.5 (similar to 7-27 days/year) relative to RCP 4.5 (similar to 8-30 days/year). Similar pattern was observed for dry spells (CDD) with ranges of similar to 64-198 days/year and similar to 61-186 days/year respectively for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. As revealed, future alterations in precipitation events have the propensity to cause alternating drought or flood events. In this line, sustainable adaptation measures and coping strategies need to be devised in time to minimize the consequences of these events, particularly those on water resources availability and ecosystem functions and services.

This paper tried to explain this about the confluence reach of the Dwarka and Brahmni rivers in Moribund deltaic India. In order to explain the linkages 16 tie channels' change depicting variables and seven wetland area and hydrological transformation (consistency, hydro-period, water depth, water richness etc.) related variables were taken. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression was applied for explain the linkage. Machine learning approaches were applied for water richness mapping. Tie channel evolution was digitized from the Survey of India (SOI) toposheet (1974) and historical Google Earth images. The result revealed that, the tie channel witnessed morphological and hydrological degradations like channel constriction, channel clogging, flow lowering etc. and these were further identified as some vectors of areal shrinkage and growing hydrological insecurity in the linked wetlands. The total wetland area declined from 44.89 km2 to 16.86 km2 from 1991 to 2021. The rate of areal loss, shallowing WD, growing inconsistency of water presence, narrowing HP, and weakening WR was found high in recent times due to de-linking and degradations of tie channels. This approach of explanation of hydrological insecurity of wetland in relation to tie channel degradations, de-linking and findings are quite unique. So, re-linking and morphological correction of the tie channels would be a good policy for wetland restoration.

This study aimed to evaluate potential environmental hazards using machine-learning techniques. This study applied maximum entropy, random forest, boosted regression tree, generalized additive model, and support vector machine methods to model environmental hazards and evaluated the impact of affecting agents and their area of influence. After data collection and preprocessing, the models were implemented, tuned, and trained, and their accuracies were determined using the "receiver operating characteristic curve". The results indicate the high importance of climatic and human variables, including rainfall, temperature, presence of shepherds, and villagers for fire hazards, elevation, transit roads, temperature, and rainfall for the formation of floodplains, and elevation, transit roads, rainfall, and topographic wetness index in the occurrence of landslides in the national park. The boosted regression tree model with a "AUC value" of 0.98 for flooding, 0.97 for fire, and 0.93 for landslides hazards, had the best performance. The modeling estimated that, on average, 16.2% of the area of Golestan National Park has a high potential for landslides, 14% has a high potential for fire, and 7.2% has a high potential for flooding. So, results of this study can be applied by land use planners, decision makers, and managers of various organizations to decrease effects of these hazards Golestan National Park (GNP).

Rice is the world's greatest water-consuming plant, and, thus, water-saving practices such as alternative wetting and drying (AWD) are widely recommended worldwide. However the AWD still has concerns such as lower tillering, shallow rooting, and an unexpected water deficit. The AWD is a possibility to not only save water consumption but also utilize various nitrogen forms from the soil. The current study tried to investigate the transcriptional expression of genes in relation to the acquisition-transportation-assimilation process of nitrogen using qRT-PCR at the tillering and heading stages and to profile tissue-specific primary metabolites. We employed two water supply systems, continuous flooding (CF) and alternative wetting and drying (AWD), during rice growth (seeding to heading). The AWD system is effective at acquiring soil nitrate; however, nitrogen assimilation was predominant in the root during the shift from the vegetative to the reproductive stage. In addition, as a result of the greater amino acids in the shoot, the AWD was likely to rearrange amino acid pools to produce proteins in accordance with phase transition. Accordingly, it is suggested that the AWD 1) actively acquired nitrate from soil and 2) resulted in an abundance of amino acid pools, which are considered a rearrangement under limited N availability. Based on the current study, further steps are necessary to evaluate form-dependent N metabolism and root development under the AWD condition and a possible practice in the rice production system.

The potential economic and social damages of this largely unseen, and often poorly characterised natural hazard are substantial. To support risk-based decision making in response to this emerging hazard, we present a Bayesian modelling framework (or workflow), which maps the spatial distribution of groundwater level uncertainty and inundation under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of Sea Level Rise (SLR). Such probabilistic mapping assessments, which explicitly acknowledge the spatial uncertainty of groundwater flow model predictions, and the deep uncertainty of the IPCC-SLR projections themselves, remains challenging for coastal groundwater systems. Our study, therefore, presents a generalisable workflow to support decision makers, that we demonstrate for a case study of a low-lying coastal region in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our results provide posterior predictive distributions of groundwater levels to map susceptibility to the groundwater inundation hazard, according to exceedance of specified model top elevations. We also explore the value of history matching (model calibration) in the context of reducing predictive uncertainty, and the benefits of predicting changes (rather than absolute values) in relation to a decision threshold. The latter may have profound implications for the many at-risk coastal communities and ecosystems, which are typically data poor. We conclude that history matching can indeed increase the spatial confidence of posterior groundwater inundation predictions for the 2030-2050 timeframe.	[Chambers, Lee A. A.; Cox, Simon C.

We studied the trends in ROS in HMA over the past two decades from 2001 to 2018 using the land surface model Noah-MP driven by an ensemble precipitation data set. Our results show that changes in precipitation phase and rainfall are altering ROS. Because of the strong physical heterogeneity and atmospheric dynamics of HMA, ROS characteristics and trends are region-dependent and ROS occurs predominantly over the Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and northwestern basins. In the Indus, ROS representing similar to 5% of the annual precipitation and similar to 20% of the annual snowmelt, has an increasing trend. This is contrary to the Ganges-Brahmaputra characterized by decreasing ROS trends, where it represents similar to 11% of the annual precipitation and similar to 60% of the annual snowmelt. In the northwestern basins, ROS has bidirectional trends due to elevation patterns and trends in rainfall, and it constitutes similar to 5 to similar to 10% of the annual precipitation. Increasing trends in ROS over Indus contribute to reducing the snowpack in late summer, with concerns of reduced water availability and increased groundwater exploitation. Similarly, because of its high amount and contribution to snowmelt, the decreasing ROS trends in the Ganges-Brahmaputra will have consequences of decreased recharge from the headwaters and exacerbated use of groundwater unless increasing trends in rainfall compensate for the decreasing snowmelt. These results provide new insights on ROS-driven changes in the hydrological cycle over HMA.

In reality, multiple HMs often co-exist in field, while details regarding coexisting HMs migration in flooded soil at elevated CO2 levels remain unclear. A pot experiment in open-top chambers (CO2 at 400 and 600 mu mol mol(-1)) was conducted to explore the uptake and transfer of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica DC.) grown in flooded soils contaminated with Cd and Pb. Results showed that elevated CO2 significantly reduced soil pH, promoting the release of Cd and Pb (by 63.64-106.90% and 10.66-30.99%, respectively) into soil porewater. In the harvested O. javanica, elevated CO2 decreased the root uptake of Cd but promoted that of Pb. Further mechanism analysis showed that elevated CO2 promoted the formation of iron plaque on root surface by 44.60-139.57%, with lower adsorption capacity to HMs (0-34.93% and 63.61-67.69% for Cd and Pb, respectively). Meanwhile, Pb showed lower adsorbability in iron plaque but higher transfer capacity when compared with Cd. Ultimately, elevated CO2 increased the target hazard quotient values of Pb in O. javanica. These findings provide new insights on the effects of elevated CO2 on the transfer of coexisting HMs in soil-plant system, and the risk of HMs pollution under climate changes needs to be more fully assessed.

Due to climate change, intensive storms with prolonged rain episodes will continue to cause even more destructive flooding. The good understanding and forecasting of such events are thus of uttermost importance. One of the ways to improve weather forecasts is the assimilation of external data, such as the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). In this study, a preparation of the multi-GNSS tropospheric products-zenith total delays, tropospheric gradients and slant total delays-for future operational assimilation is shown. For a severe precipitation event in July 2021 in Germany, the GNSS parameters from three systems-GPS, GLONASS and Galileo-are compared to three Numerical Weather Models (NWMs)-ERA5 reanalysis of ECMWF, ICON run by the German Weather Service and GFS run by the US Weather Service. The flood that followed the rainfall was the deadliest natural disaster in Germany since 1962. The results show that all considered GNSS solutions have a similar level of agreement with the NWMs. However, for the flood region in western Germany, the biases from the multi-GNSS solutions are smaller compared to the GPS-only solution. From the models, ICON has the highest agreement with the GNSS data for all considered tropospheric parameters. The best agreement with the ICON is probably due to its high horizontal resolution and, thus, low representative errors and the fine tuning of DWD's regional model for the specific region (Germany).

In this research, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to investigate hydrological parameters characteristics, simulating uncertainties as well as spatial and temporal patterns of both blue and green water resources for the whole basin. The results revealed a strong correlation between the observed and simulated streamflow at six hydrological stations. The overall hydrological water balance analysis showed that 58.1 % of annual water yield is contributed by surface runoff, while groundwater flow contributes 38.8 % of annual water yield. The annual average blue water resource was higher accounting for 65.1 % of the total water resources. Green water coefficient was 34.9 % for the entire basin, varying from 26 % to 50 %. The spatial distribution of blue water resource was uneven in the basin with higher value in parts of the Ganjiang, Xinjiang and Raohe subbasins. While distribution of green water resource was more homogeneous. Blue water resource decreased significantly in Raohe subbasin with-37.1 mm/a whereas having no significant variability in other river basins from 1992 to 2010. The change of green water resource is caused mainly by the increase of green water flow in most subbasins. The results provide insights into prediction uncertainty reduction of simulation as well as green and blue water endowments. This research is of great significance to improve water resources management in Poyang Lake basin.

Here we investigate the diversification of spiny rats in the genus Makalata, whose species are strongly associated with seasonally flooded forests, watercourses and flooded islands. We use a biogeographical approach based on a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene through divergence time estimation and reconstruction of ancestral areas and events. Our findings indicate an ancient origin of Makalata for the Guiana Shield and Eastern Amazonia as ancestral area. A first cladogenetic event led to a phylogeographic break into two broader clades of Makalata through dispersal, implying a pattern of western/Eastern Amazonian clades coinciding with the Purus Arch (middle Miocene). Most of subclades we infer originated between the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene, with few recent exceptions in the early Pliocene through dispersal and vicariant events. The hypothesis of rivers as dispersal barriers is not corroborated for Makalata, as expected for mammalian species associated with seasonally flooded environments. We identify two key events for the expansion and diversification of Makalata species: the presence of geologically stable areas in the Guiana and Brazilian shields and the transition from lacustrine conditions in western Amazonia (Acre system) to a river system, with the establishment of the Amazon River transcontinental system and its tributaries. Our results are congruent with older geological scenarios for the Amazon basin formation (Miocene), but we do not discard the influence of recent dynamics on some speciation events and, mainly, on phylogeographic structuring processes.

Wetland vegetation regeneration in response to tidal reinstatement on an abandoned sugar cane farm	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						coastal freshwater wetland; restoration; sea level rise; swamp forest	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SEED-BANK; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; FORESTED WETLANDS; WATER; SALINITY; GROWTH; DROUGHT; FLORIDA; TREE	Supratidal wetlands are threatened by agricultural production and are highly vulnerable to climate change, particularly through sea level rise (SLR). While vegetation structure and composition of supratidal wetlands will likely change under projected SLR with run-on effects for ecosystem service provision, these changes can provide opportunities for restoration of adjacent agricultural land. Here, we investigated the natural regenerative potential of supratidal wetlands on abandoned agricultural land in Southeast Queensland, Australia, specifically, responses of wetland vegetation communities to simulated SLR, through tidal reinstatement. In 15 years since crop abandonment, distinct communities of typical supratidal wetland vegetation have naturally reestablished, in predominately freshwater conditions, with minimal management intervention. Reinstating tidal floodwater increased the flooded extent and permanence of brackish water. Four repeat surveys of vegetation composition, structure, and condition were conducted in permanent plots established in Casuarina swamp, Melaleuca swamp, herbaceous marsh, and riparian zone vegetation communities, to observe change over time. Species richness decreased in all regenerating communities (Herbaceous marsh, Casuarina, and Melaleuca) post flood gate removal. Understory vegetation cover also decreased in Melaleuca and Casuarina plots, but increased in herbaceous marsh plots, with increased cover of salt-tolerant species throughout. Changes in woody vegetation community and structure were not observed during this short study (2.5 years), although the regenerative capacity of woody and herbaceous species was reduced. Supratidal wetland vegetation communities can naturally reestablish in areas of abandoned agricultural land, however, increased saltwater flooding (likely with SLR) will put these communities at risk of transition to salt-tolerant vegetation.

For each cluster, the top-cited references construct the knowledge base, and the most-coverage cities are taken as the research frontier. Three indicators, namely betweenness centrality, citation burstness strength, and Sigma, were used to identify the research outputs with pioneering and transformative value. The changes in the research topics and hotspots are closely related to the planning, construction, and operation progress of hydropower engineering, that affected by the gaming results of all parties. The 2009-2010 is an important time boundary, with the original research hotspots including the impact of upstream reservoirs on the hydrological regime and sediment (Clu#3) and arsenic contamination of groundwater in the Lower Mekong (Clu#4) that obtained periodical achievements and reached consensus to some extent around 2008, and the new research boom turns to the Tonle Sap Lake and flood pulse (Clu#2) in short-term characterized literatures with the highest burstness strength mainly concentrated around 2012. HIGHLIGHTS The intellectual bases and research frontiers of 14 identified topics were analyzed based on Document Co-citation Network analysis. Vietnamese Mekong Delta is the topic with the largest size and arsenic contamination is the cluster with the longest time span. Evolution of research hotspots is related to the widespread controversy over the planned dams in the Lower Mekong mainstream and the progress of the multi-party games.

Here, this challenge was addressed using partial wavelet coherency (PWC), which can detect localized and scale-specific bivariate relationships between predictor and response variables after removing the impact of other variables. The analysis was done for groundwater systems in a humid area (Tuscaloosa, Alabama) and an arid area (Lake Havasu City, Arizona). The results indicate that the total precipitation and precipitation duration show the advantage in controlling the groundwater flow in humid and arid areas, respectively. Precipitation has more significant impacts on the coherence between surface water and groundwater in an arid area, which decreases by 3% on small time scales (< 120 days) and increases by 6% on large scales (> 120 days). However, surface water shows more important effects on the coherence between precipitation and groundwater on large scales in a humid area, which decreases by 47%. Overall, the analysis highlights that the impacts of precipitation (or surface water) on the coherence between surface water (or precipitation) and groundwater level are changing with the time scale and climatic belt. The temporal scale dependency is primarily led by the seasonality of the influence factors, while the spatial dependency is mainly due to various evapotranspiration rates and drought/flood episodes. These findings provide useful insights into untangling the localized and scale-specific bivariate relationships in a groundwater system, which is an important topic in water-resource prediction.

In this study, we examined multiscale relationships between hydrology, vegetation, and geomorphology after a record-breaking flood event along the Seomjin River of South Korea in the summer of 2020. We conducted numerical modeling at the broad scale to identify the flow characteristics (e.g., depth and shear stress) of the flood event. A field survey was performed to investigate the impact of the flood on individual plants at the fine scale. The results showed widespread devastation of all vegetation types, from reed and willow communities to large, late-successional trees taller than 10 m, which typically survive under ordinary flooding conditions. A higher threshold of shear stress was estimated for these trees (124 N m(-2)) than for willow (120 N m(-2)) and reed plants (26 N m(-2)), indicating that a greater level of stress is required to cause vegetation damage as ecological succession progresses. In the presence of vegetation, the average water depth increased by 9%-23% compared to the absence of vegetation. Many rivers in northeast Asia have undergone substantial vegetation expansion and succession due to the infrequency of extreme flood events. Our findings indicate that dense communities of large plants in these systems can raise the maximum water levels of flood events, thereby increasing the future flood risk to surrounding areas utilized for agriculture, transportation, industry, and housing.

However, less attention has been paid to the questions of whether and how trees respond to changes in precipitation regime with different rainfall amounts. To investigate the effects of water availability on sapling's growth, tissue levels of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), and nutrients, we carried out a greenhouse experiment with Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) saplings grown in precipitation amounts of 300, 500, and 700 mm (3 levels) in combination with two levels of a watering regime (i.e., regular watering vs. pulsed watering, i.e., frequent low rainfall coupled with fewer instances of heavy rain) for a growing season in subtropical China. Pulsed watering caused higher soil pH (>7.5) but lower soil organic carbon and soil nutrients, and consequently led to smaller plant biomass and height of the saplings than regular watering, especially in the water amount treatment of 300 and 500 mm. Additionally, higher levels of NSCs in plant tissue concentrations were observed under pulsed watering than under regular watering, due to greater carbon consumption for supporting higher growth rate and a dilution effect by bigger plant size and biomass in the latter. Our results indicated that the growing season precipitation amount of 300 mm is sufficient for the drought-tolerant tree species P. massoniana. In such a case, the growing season precipitation regime rather than the precipitation amount will have a much stronger impact on the tree performance.

Predicted Sea-Level Rise-Driven Biogeomorphological Changes on Fire Island, New York: Implications for People and Plovers	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						sea level rise; erosion; coastal habitats; barrier island; shorebirds	CHARADRIUS-MELODUS; LANDWARD MIGRATION; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; ATLANTIC COAST; PIPING PLOVERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LONG-ISLAND; IMPACTS; EVOLUTION; SCALE	Forecasting biogeomorphological conditions for barrier islands is critical for informing sea-level rise (SLR) planning, including management of coastal development and ecosystems. We combined five probabilistic models to predict SLR-driven changes and their implications on Fire Island, New York, by 2050. We predicted barrier island biogeomorphological conditions, dynamic landcover response, piping plover (Charadrius melodus) habitat availability, and probability of storm overwash under three scenarios of shoreline change (SLC) and compared results to observed 2014/2015 conditions. Scenarios assumed increasing rates of mean SLC from 0 to 4.71 m erosion per year. We observed uncertainty in several morphological predictions (e.g., beach width, dune height), suggesting decreasing confidence that Fire Island will evolve in response to SLR as it has in the past. Where most likely conditions could be determined, models predicted that Fire Island would become flatter, narrower, and more overwash-prone with increasing rates of SLC. Beach ecosystems were predicted to respond dynamically to SLR and migrate with the shoreline, while marshes lost the most area of any landcover type compared to 2014/2015 conditions. Such morphological changes may lead to increased flooding or breaching with coastal storms. However-although modest declines in piping plover habitat were observed with SLC-the dynamic response of beaches, flatter topography, and increased likelihood of overwash suggest storms could promote suitable conditions for nesting piping plovers above what our geomorphology models predict.

As a critical component of a pumping station, a large-scale slanted axial-flow pump (SAFP) featuring high specific speed plays a critical role in mitigating urban flooding and waterlogging. In this study, to reveal the transient characteristics of a SAFP at shut-off conditions, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based approach with dynamic mesh was proposed. Multiple shut-off conditions with various shut-down speeds of the sluice gate (SG) were modeled. Our analysis demonstrated that both the shut-off conditions and the slanted structure have conspicuous impacts on the hydrodynamic performance of a SAFP. Reducing the shut-down speed leads to a greater reverse flow rate and higher runner speed. The water hammer effect was simulated with different shut-down speeds, increasing the water head by 5.07-10.42 m, the axial force by 163.46-297.06 kN center dot m, and the axial moment by 116.05-224.01 kN center dot m. Compared with the axial direction, moments in the radial directions were found with more obvious oscillation as a result of stronger rotor-stator interaction. Due to the gravitational effect of the slanted structure, the fluctuation of the runner in vertical direction presented an off-axis characteristic compared with the horizontal one. As the SG speed increased, pressure fluctuations gradually decreased at various locations across the SAFP.

We also wish to verify the applicability of flood event predictions for a river with flood events lasting only a few hours, with the aid of hydrometric control stations. This methodology allows for the creation of a system able to identify flood events with acceptable errors within several hours' notice. In terms of errors, the results obtained in this study can be compared to those obtained by using physics-based models for the same study area. These kinds of models use few types of data, unlike physical models that require the estimation of several parameters. However, the deep learning models are data-driven and for this reason they can influence the results obtained. Therefore, we tested the stability of the models by simulating the missing or wrong input data of the model, and this allowed us to achieve excellent results. Indeed, the models were stable even if several data were missing. This method makes it possible to lay the foundations for the future application of these techniques when there is an absence of geological-hydrogeological information preventing physical modeling of the run-off process or in cases of relatively small basins, where the complex system and the unsatisfactory modeling of the phenomenon do not allow a correct application of physical-based models. The forecast of flood events is fundamental for correct and adequate territory management, in particular when significant climatic changes occur. The study area is that of the Arno River (in Tuscany, Italy), which crosses some of the most important cities of central Italy, in terms of population, cultural heritage, and socio-economic activities.

Coastal flooding events are expected to grow in frequency and magnitude, increasing the potential economic losses and costs of adaptation. In Italy, a large share of the population and economic activities are located along the low-lying coastal plain of the North Adriatic coast, one of the most sensitive areas to relative sea level changes. Over the last half a century, this stretch of coast has experienced a significant rise in relative sea level, the main component of which was land subsidence; in the forthcoming decades, climate-induced sea level rise is expected to become the first driver of coastal inundation hazard. We propose an assessment of flood hazard and risk linked with extreme sea level scenarios, under both historical conditions and sea level rise projections in 2050 and 2100. We run a hydrodynamic inundation model on two pilot sites located along the North Adriatic coast of Emilia-Romagna: Rimini and Cesenatico. Here, we compare alternative extreme sea level scenarios accounting for the effect of planned and hypothetical seaside renovation projects against the historical baseline. We apply a flood damage model to estimate the potential economic damage linked to flood scenarios, and we calculate the change in expected annual damage according to changes in the relative sea level. Finally, damage reduction benefits are evaluated by means of cost-benefit analysis. Results suggest an overall profitability of the investigated projects over time, with increasing benefits due to increased probability of intense flooding in the near future.

The classical approach to this problem has been to fit parametric probability functions to annual maxima streamflow data and use them to calculate the risk of failure. An underlying assumption of this approach is the stationarity of the time series. However, the stationarity of streamflows may not hold due to the effect of land cover change and climate change on rainfall runoff processes on watersheds. This study assesses the effect of considering non-stationarity in the estimation of design peak flows at 33 gauging stations in the state of Antioquia, Colombia. Particularly, the effect of non-stationarity in the mean of Gumbel-distributed peak flows is evaluated. This study focuses on the 5-yr and 10-yr return period annual flood flows, which are customary in the design of type sewerage systems. The results show similar behaviours for both return periods. All gauge stations show an asymptotically tendency in the risk of failure to 100% as the project lifetime tends to 30 years. In general, 71.4% of gauging stations show that the estimated risk of failure is larger when non-stationary conditions are assumed, relative to assuming stationary conditions, and that the magnitude of the difference increases for larger return periods. The rest of gauging stations shows the opposite behaviour. Our results support the use of a probability model that includes non-stationary in the mean, and they suggest that a model that also includes non-stationary in the variance could be important.

J	Lachaut, T; Tilmant, A				Lachaut, Thibaut; Tilmant, Amaury			Possibilistic response surfaces: incorporating fuzzy thresholds into bottom-up flood vulnerability analysis	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; DECISION-MAKING; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; PROSPECT-THEORY; FUTURE; MODEL; ROBUSTNESS; FRAMEWORK; UNCERTAINTY; PERFORMANCE	Several alternatives have been proposed to shift the paradigms of water management under uncertainty from predictive to decision-centric. An often-mentioned tool is the response surface mapping system performance with a large sample of future hydroclimatic conditions through a stress test. Dividing this exposure space between acceptable and unacceptable states requires a criterion of acceptable performance defined by a threshold. In practice, however, stakeholders and decision-makers may be confronted with ambiguous objectives for which the acceptability threshold is not clearly defined (crisp). To accommodate such situations, this paper integrates fuzzy thresholds to the response surface tool. Such integration is not straightforward when response surfaces also have their own irreducible uncertainty from the limited number of descriptors and the stochasticity of hydroclimatic conditions. Incorporating fuzzy thresholds, therefore, requires articulating categories of imperfect knowledge that are different in nature, i.e., the irreducible uncertainty of the response itself relative to the variables that describe change and the ambiguity of the acceptability threshold. We, thus, propose possibilistic surfaces to assess flood vulnerability with fuzzy acceptability thresholds. An adaptation of the logistic regression for fuzzy set theory combines the probability of an acceptable outcome and the ambiguity of the acceptability criterion within a single possibility measure. We use the flood-prone reservoir system of the Upper Saint Francois River basin in Canada as a case study to illustrate the proposed approach. Results show how a fuzzy threshold can be quantitatively integrated when generating a response surface and how ignoring it might lead to different decisions. This study suggests that further conceptual developments could link the reliance on acceptability thresholds in bottom-up assessment frameworks with the current uses of fuzzy set theory.

J	Lechowska, E				Lechowska, Ewa			Approaches in research on flood risk perception and their importance in flood risk management: a review	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Review						Flood; Risk perception; Review; Rationalist approach; Constructivist approach; Resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; SOCIAL IDENTITY MODEL; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS; NATURAL HAZARDS; SAFE ENOUGH; DISASTER; PREPAREDNESS; RESILIENCE; INSURANCE	The study of flood risk perception factors can be considered by using different paradigms. In an attempt to understand risk perception, two basic paradigms can be distinguished: rationalist and constructivist. The rationalist approach tends to focus on modeling, characterizing, and predicting behavioral results regarding various threats. According to the constructivist paradigm, threats are perceived as socially constructed. This review paper aims to assess the importance of the rationalist and constructivist approaches in research on flood risk perception and flood risk management more broadly by answering the questions: (1) Which paradigm dominates the research of flood risk perception?, (2) What is the relationship between rationalistic and constructivistic factors (e.g., stimulation, weakening, strengthening, etc.)?, (3) which factors are more effective in moderating attitudes toward flood risk? The paper concludes by pointing out the desired direction of research on flood risk perception from the perspective of improving flood risk management. In contemporary empirical works managing the perception of flood risk, a rationalistic approach that psychometrically searches for cognitive models dominates. Often, statistically obtained dependencies are mutually exclusive. Studies on perception that apply the constructivist approach are in an early stage of development, nevertheless providing consistent results. They indicate that the social, political, cultural, religious, and historical contexts shape the perception of flood risk. On the basis of the aforementioned information, research on flood risk in a constructivist approach should be expanded, as it provides a clear, often underappreciated catalog of contextual factors shaping risk perception and, importantly, simultaneously moderating the influence of rationalist factors on flood risk perception.

Forecast of winter low flows in a cold-region river under the impact of climate warming	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cold region river; Winter low flow; Cumulative watershed temperature; Climate change; Fraser River; Low flow prediction	BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CANADA; FLOODS	Changes in winter low flow (WLF) in cold-region rivers affect engineering design, water quality, and river ecosystem health. This paper aims to quantify to what extent WLF will change under climate warming and to propose a practical forecasting model for WLF predictions. The new concept of cumulative watershed temperature (CWT) is used as a convenient lumped surrogate for complicated hydrological processes that influence WLF. Statistical analyses of century-long flow data from the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada show a strong dependence of WLF on CWT. In winter season, time series of CWT and WLF are shown to each divide into a falling and a rising limb at the data point of their lowest values, being -358 degrees C and 827 m3/s (historical averages), respectively. The falling and rising limbs describe the cumulative freezing and thawing effects of air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point on WLF changes. The correlation between CWT and WLF (time series) data points on the rising limbs forms the forecasting model, expressing WLF as a function of CWT in terms of their z-scores. The model takes input of Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections of temperature increases by the end of 21st century under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and predicts changes of Fraser River WLF from the historical average. RCP4.5 causes a 22.6% increase (ensemble average from six GCMs). RCP8.5 increases WLF by 20% (for some future years) to 44% (for others). The methods reported in this paper can be adapted to other cold regions.	[Kochukrishnan, Aneesh; Li, S.

Numerical daemons of hydrological models are summoned by extreme precipitation	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RAINFALL; FLOOD; STATE; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTIONS; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; FRAMEWORK; SCHEMES	Hydrological models are usually systems of nonlinear differential equations for which no analytical solutions exist and thus rely on numerical solutions. While some studies have investigated the relationship between numerical method choice and model error, the extent to which extreme precipitation such as that observed during hurricanes Harvey and Katrina impacts numerical error of hydrological models is still unknown. This knowledge is relevant in light of climate change, where many regions will likely experience more intense precipitation. In this experiment, a large number of hydrographs are generated with the modular modeling framework FUSE (Framework for Understanding Structural Errors), using eight numerical techniques across a variety of forcing data sets. All constructed models are conceptual and lumped. Multiple model structures, parameter sets, and initial conditions are incorporated for generality. The computational cost and numerical error associated with each hydrograph were recorded. Numerical error is assessed via root mean square error and normalized root mean square error. It was found that the root mean square error usually increases with precipitation intensity and decreases with event duration. Some numerical methods constrain errors much more effectively than others, sometimes by many orders of magnitude. Of the tested numerical methods, a second-order adaptive explicit method is found to be the most efficient because it has both a small numerical error and a low computational cost. A small literature review indicates that many popular modeling codes use numerical techniques that were suggested by this experiment to be suboptimal. We conclude that relatively large numerical errors may be common in current models, highlighting the need for robust numerical techniques, in particular in the face of increasing precipitation extremes.

Since the area lies in the monsoon region, abundant precipitation and the resultant increase in river discharge have raised a flood risk for the coastal area. Although the effects of atmospheric forces have been investigated intensively, the influence of precipitation on extreme sea levels in this area remains unknown. In this study, the influence of precipitation on extreme sea levels for three different stations were investigated by multivariate regression using the meteorological drivers of precipitation, sea level pressure, and wind. The prediction of sea levels considering precipitation effects outperformed predictions without precipitation. The benefit of incorporating precipitation was greater at Cox's Bazar than at Charchanga and Khepupara, reflecting the hilly landscape at Cox's Bazar. The improved prediction skill was mainly confirmed during the monsoon season, when strong precipitation events occur. It was also revealed that the precipitation over the Bangladesh area is insensitive to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole mode. The precipitation over northern Bangladesh tended to be high in the year of a high sea surface temperature over the Bay of Bengal, which may have contributed to the variation in sea level. The findings suggest that the effect of precipitation plays an essential role in enhancing sea levels during many extreme events. Therefore, incorporating the effect of terrestrial precipitation is essential for the better prediction of extreme sea levels, which helps coastal management and reduction of hazards.

In this study, we first delineated the hydroclimatic changes at both regional and local scales within and around the lower Yellow River floodplain and then examined the relationships of human settlements with hydroclimatic settings between the pre-Longshan and Longshan periods. The results indicate that the site distribution, site density and hydroclimatic conditions exhibited significant shifts during the pre-Longshan and Longshan periods. In the pre-Longshan period, the intense East Asian summer monsoon and abundant monsoon-related precipitation caused widespread development of lakes and marshes in the lower Yellow River floodplain. As a result, the circumjacent highlands of the lower Yellow River floodplain contained concentrated human settlements. However, the persistent weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and consequent precipitation decline, in conjunction with accelerated soil erosion due to decreasing forest vegetation and strengthening of human activities on the upstream Loess Plateau in the Longshan period, are likely to have jointly caused both shrinking and faster filling of preexisting lakes and marshes. Subsequently, a large area of arable land had been created in the lower Yellow River floodplain and thus was occupied by locally rapid increasing population, resulting in the notable spatial expansion of human settlements during the Longshan period.

An outstanding question is whether biodiversity responses to hydrological disturbance depend on background climatic context - and if so, which contexts increase vulnerability to disturbance. Answering this question requires comparison of organismal responses across environmental gradients. However, opportunities to track disturbed communities against an undisturbed baseline remain rare. Here we gathered a global dataset capturing responses of aquatic invertebrate communities to river drying, which includes 112 sites spanning a gradient of climatic aridity. We measured the effects of river drying on taxonomic richness and temporal beta-diversity (turnover and nestedness components). We also measured the relative abundance of aquatic invertebrates with strategies that confer resilience (or resistance) to drying. Contrary to our expectations, we found that taxonomic richness recovered from drying similarly across the aridity gradient. The turnover component of beta-diversity (i.e. species replacements over time) largely accounted for differences in community composition before versus after drying. However, increasing aridity was associated with greater nestedness-driven compositional changes at intermittent sites - that is, after drying communities became subsets of those before drying. These results show that climatic context can explain variation in community responses to the same hydrological disturbance (drying), and suggest that increased aridity will constrain biodiversity responses at regional scales. Further consideration of the climatic context in hydroecological research may help improve predictions of the local impacts of hydrological disturbance by identifying climate regions where communities are more (or less) sensitive to extremes, including river drying events.

Severe coastal inundation usually happens when wind-induced waves and storm surges coincide with high tides. A Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS) was established and placed into the 24/7 forecast operations starting in 2007. Using a well-validated "end to end" FVCOM inundation model of NECOFS, we examined the impact of climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) on the future extratropical storms-induced coastal inundation over the Massachusetts coast. The assessment was done by making the model experiments to project the storm-induced inundation over the coastal areas of Scituate and Boston Harbors with different SLR scenarios under a hundred-year storm condition. The results suggest that with sustained SLR, the northeastern US coast will be vulnerable more severely to wave runup-induced splashing/overtopping than wind-induced storm surges. This finding is consistent with the change in the intensity of storm-generated surface waves in the last decade. The model also suggests that the responses of surge and surface waves to SLR are fully nonlinear. The assessment of the impacts of SLR on the future storm-induced coastal inundation should be investigated with a model including wave-current interactions.

Such influence generally varies based on reclamation duration. Therefore, a study on changes in soil C stock along the reclamation chronosequence can help reveal the impact of reclamation on terrestrial C cycling. Materials and methods We chose natural floodplains (as the control) and croplands reclaimed for 13, 24, and 33 years in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and determined soil organic C (SOC) and soil inorganic C (SIC) contents at different depths and the stocks in 0-100 cm profiles. Results and discussion The SOC and SIC stocks generally increased at average rates of 2.73 and 5.54 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, and the SIC stock was closely related with the SOC stock across the reclamation chronosequence. The SOC content increased more at 0-20 cm depth in the profile along the reclamation chronosequence, but the SIC content often had a higher rate of increase in the deep soil layers. Significantly, the contents of SOC and SIC were both positively correlated with the proportion of silt fractions. Conclusions Our findings suggest that reclaimed croplands from riparian floodplain play an important role in C accumulation, highlighting the importance of soil inorganic C in C budget. Moreover, soil C accumulation relates closely to soil texture, which changes continuously along the reclamation chronosequence and often varies due to spatial heterogeneity.

These pressures create issues around preserving braided river physical environments and associated ecosystems, and managing hazards such as floods, aggradation and erosion. A need for more robust understanding and quantification of braided river morphodynamic processes underpins many of these issues. Here, we present eight morphodynamic research challenges to service this need. The first four research challenges relate to managing aggradation-related flooding hazards; the last four address issues stem largely from recent dairy expansion, which has created huge pressure to take land and irrigation water from the alp-fed braided rivers and to alter flow regimes at their mouths. Hapua, the freshwater lagoons found where most braided rivers meet the coast, show complex morphodynamic behaviour in response to the interplay of river and coastal processes, and their special ecosystems are sensitive to river flow and sediment load changes. We discuss how physical laboratory experiments and novel numerical modelling can help to understand the morphological processes braided rivers undergo, and we show how those research advances could inform planning and legal decisions to regulate land rights and irrigation water allocation on New Zealand's braidplains. We illustrate these environmental and engineering issues and research challenges with examples from the Kowhai, Waiho, Waiau, Rangitata and Hurunui Rivers. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Hicks, D.

Recent studies have taken the combination of flood peak, flood volume, and duration into account when assessing flood risk. Nevertheless, the dynamics of multivariable flood risk considering project reasonable service life remains unresolved. To this end, flood peak and flood volume were considered, and Copula function was used to describe their dependent structure, considering project effective service life based on the joint return period to calculate the risk rate for characterizing flood risk. Then, a sliding window of 25 years was adopted to explore its dynamics, and attribution analysis was subsequently conducted. The Pai-lung River, which belongs to the Yangtze River Basin in China, was selected as a case study. Results show that: (1) on basis of "and (boolean AND)" joint return period, considering 50-year reasonable service life, the risks of slight, moderate, severe, and extreme floods are 1.00, 0.96, 0.66, and 0.06, respectively; (2) the flood risk dynamics vary with different levels, where the risks of slight and moderate floods tend to decrease whilst the risk of severe and extreme floods shows a significant increase; (3) the risk dynamics of severe and extreme floods are positively related to Sunspots, El Nino Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation, while Pacific Decadal Oscillation has a weaker influence on flood risk dynamics. Generally, this study sheds new insights into multivariable flood risk assessment in a changing environment.

This may be due to the widespread use of cross-sectional survey designs, which infer causality from theoretical considerations alone. The present longitudinal study, in contrast, builds on the logic that cause precedes effect to confirm the direction of effects. Drawing on two-wave survey data from 554 flood-prone households in Austria, cross-lagged autoregressive models analyze pairwise combinations between risk perception, fear, five nonprotective responses (fatalism, denial, wishful thinking, reliance on social support, reliance on public protection), and seven specific protective responses (ranging from coordination with neighbors to structural modifications of the building). These factors show substantial temporal stability, in particular for nonprotective responses and fear. Only in very few instances can effects over time be confirmed statistically. Nonprotective responses emerge as the major drivers; foremost, denial, and reliance on public protection limit private flood mitigation. This overall null finding on causality may trace back to the 1.5 years' time span and the absence of any policy intervention or flood disaster between survey waves, and the high stability of protection motivation theory components. This finding puts into question the theoretically assumed causal relationships and the effects found in cross-sectional studies. The high trait-like stability requires perseverance in risk management efforts to change attitudes and capabilities. Finding nonprotective responses as key determinants in an overall picture of stability suggests that this factor merits a stronger role in future risk research.

The relevance of city size to the vulnerability of surrounding rural areas: An empirical study of flooding in Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						City size; Urban centers; Disaster; Sensitivity; Adaptation; Rural-urban linkages; Spatial disparity; Pakistan	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN COMMUNITIES; RISK; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; MODELS; IMPACT; INDEX; LIVELIHOODS; POPULATION	Research on the dynamics of vulnerability has to-date either focused on a regional or national scale or assessed the influence of city size on the vulnerability of the city itself. Little attention has been paid to how city size influences the vulnerability of surrounding rural areas-this has been investigated in this study. A conceptual framework-City Size and Rural Vulnerability (SCARV)-is proposed and operationalised in the context of Pakistan. A household survey was conducted to collect 325 samples from the flood-affected rural population surrounding three different sized cities in Punjab Province, Pakistan. Indicators of vulnerability were identified and an index-based approach was used to get the composite values of the three components of vulner-ability-namely, exposure, susceptibility and capacity. The composite values were then classified to identify the level of vulnerability of each household. Statistical tests were performed to investigate the differences in vulnerability between the study areas. The results indicate that rural populations surrounding smaller cities are less exposed but more vulnerable compared to rural communities surrounding larger cities. This is largely because rural populations adjoining large cities have better capacities to deal with flood hazards. This points to a need to focus on increasing the coping capacity of small and medium-sized cities and their rural surroundings. Moreover, the research highlights the importance of rural-urban linkages in the hazard vulnerability discourse. These results can help disaster managers, regional and rural development planners, and practitioners to develop relevant flood risk reduction strategies which considers spatial and regional development aspects of hazard vulnerability.

Integration of palaeo-and-modern food webs reveal slow changes in a river floodplain wetland ecosystem	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; STABLE-ISOTOPE; SHALLOW LAKE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIME SHIFTS; CARBON; NITROGEN; PALEOLIMNOLOGY; ZOOPLANKTON; DELTA-C-13	Large rivers, including the Murray River system in southeast Australia, are disturbed by many activities. The arrival of European settlers to Australia by the mid-1800s transformed many floodplain wetlands of the lower Murray River system. River impoundment and flow regulation in the late 1800s and, from the 1930s, resulted in species invasion, and elevated nutrient concentrations causing widespread eutrophication. An integrated palaeoecology, and palaeo-and-modern food web approach, incorporating mixing models, was undertaken to reveal changes in a regulated wetland (i.e. Kings Billabong). The lack of preserved sediment suggests the wetland was naturally intermittent before 1890. After this time, when used as a water retention basin, the wetland experienced net sediment accumulation. Subfossil cladocerans, and delta C-13 of Daphnia, chironomid, and bulk sediment, all reflected an early productive, likely clear water state and shifts in trophic state following river regulation in the 1930s. Food web mixing models, based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 in subfossil and modern Daphnia, fish, and submerged and emergent macrophytes, also indicated a shift in the trophic relationships between fish and Daphnia. By the 1970s, a new state was established but a further significant alteration of nitrogen and carbon sources, and trophic interactions, continued through to the early 2000s. A possible switch from Daphnia as a prey of Australian Smelt could have modified the food web of the wetland by c. 2006. The timing of this change corresponded to the expansion of emergent macrophytes possibly due to landscape level disruptions. The evidence of these changes suggests a need for a broader understanding of the evolution of wetlands for the management of floodplains in the region.

J	Safavi-Rizi, V; Herde, M; Stöhr, C				Safavi-Rizi, Vajiheh; Herde, Marco; Stoehr, Christine			RNA-Seq reveals novel genes and pathways associated with hypoxia duration and tolerance in tomato root	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LYSIGENOUS AERENCHYMA FORMATION; END RULE PATHWAY; NITRIC-OXIDE; LOW-OXYGEN; EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; FLOODING TOLERANCE; STRESS; ARABIDOPSIS; ETHYLENE; RICE	Due to climate change, economically important crop plants will encounter flooding periods causing hypoxic stress more frequently. This may lead to reduced yields and endanger food security. As roots are the first organ to be affected by hypoxia, the ability to sense and respond to hypoxic stress is crucial. At the molecular level, therefore, fine-tuning the regulation of gene expression in the root is essential for hypoxia tolerance. Using an RNA-Seq approach, we investigated transcriptome modulation in tomato roots of the cultivar `Moneymaker', in response to short- (6 h) and long-term (48 h) hypoxia. Hypoxia duration appeared to have a significant impact on gene expression such that the roots of five weeks old tomato plants showed a distinct time-dependent transcriptome response. We observed expression changes in 267 and 1421 genes under short- and long-term hypoxia, respectively. Among these, 243 genes experienced changed expression at both time points. We identified tomato genes with a potential role in aerenchyma formation which facilitates oxygen transport and may act as an escape mechanism enabling hypoxia tolerance. Moreover, we identified differentially regulated genes related to carbon and amino acid metabolism and redox homeostasis. Of particular interest were the differentially regulated transcription factors, which act as master regulators of downstream target genes involved in responses to short and/or long-term hypoxia. Our data suggest a temporal metabolic and anatomic adjustment to hypoxia in tomato root which requires further investigation. We propose that the regulated genes identified in this study are good candidates for further studies regarding hypoxia tolerance in tomato or other crops.

Evaluation of threshold freezing conditions for winter road construction over discontinuous permafrost peatlands, subarctic Canada	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Winter roads; Permafrost; Freezing index; Guidelines; Overflow	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BASIN; AIR	Winter roads provide an important transportation service in northern regions. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR), traversing subarctic Canada, is the busiest heavy-haul road in the world with as many as 10,900 truckloads per season. In addition to lake-ice thickness, trafficability on the TCWR depends upon adequate freezeback of overland portages, which are primarily peatlands underlain by discontinuous permafrost. We investigate threshold requirements for the initiation of winter road operations in this region and assess the use of a recommended 305 degrees C-day air-freezing index (FDD305a) value as an operational predictor of ground freezing at 30 cm depth, the desired depth to allow winter road construction to commence. Snow compaction and flooding were found to enhance freezeback of portages with early winter overland flow having a similar effect. The majority of winter road portages were not adequately frozen to a depth of 30 cm by FDD305a. Our results indicate that for drained and wet peatlands in this discontinuous permafrost environment, an FDD a threshold of 1100 degrees Cdays is more appropriate than the 305 degrees C-day threshold. However, TCWR winter road operators presently plan the construction of the winter road by a calendar date rather than by evaluation of the air-freezing index. This practice results in a conservative approach to the start of the construction season, close to 1100 degrees C-days with a higher percentage of sites frozen to 30 cm depth than would be if the 305 degrees C-day air-freezing index was used as a guideline. In addition, the use of low-pressure vehicles for snow compaction during the start of the construction season is an effective adaptation practice to accelerate freezing penetration.	[Sladen, W.

However, in recent decades, climate change and anthropogenic activities have changed hydrological processes, and stationary assumption has been questioned. To test the flood scaling invariance (simple scaling or multiscaling) and analyze the influence of environmental change on flood scaling parameter, in this study, eight mesoscale sub-watersheds in Daqinghe River basin were selected as the study area, and the trend and change point of annual maximum flood peak (AMFP) series were detected, respectively. All the AMFP series had downward trend, and the change point was around 1979. Therefore, the AMFP series are nonstationary. To analyze the flood scaling issue in the Daqinghe River basin, the AMFP series were reconstructed under the environmental conditions before and after the change point, respectively. Then, flood quantiles were calculated using the reconstructed stationary series. We also used GAMLSS (Generalized Additive Model in Location, Scale and Shape) to calculate flood quantiles based on the observed nonstationary AMFP series. According to the flood quantiles calculated by the above methods, the relationship of the drainage areas of the sub-watersheds and the flood quantiles was fitted with power function. Flood quantiles of the reconstructed stationary and observed nonstationary series showed obvious flood multiscaling. The increase in rainfall depth causes the increase in flood scaling exponents with the increase in return period, and different change ratios of land use before and after change point resulted in the flood scaling exponents of reconstructed series before 1979 were smaller than those after the change point at same return period.

However, we lack a thorough understanding of which of these is the dominant driver of channel bed elevation change. This lack hampers flood hazard prediction, as changes to the bed elevation can either augment or reduce flood heights. Here, we explore the drivers of channel change using multidecadal time series of river bed elevation at 49 United States Geological Survey (USGS) gage sites in the uplands of Washington State, USA. We find that channel bed elevations at many of the gages change remarkably little over >80 years, while others are highly unstable. Despite regionally synchronous decadal fluctuations in flood intensity, there is a lack of regional synchrony of channel response at the decadal scale. At the monthly scale, the magnitude of antecedent high flow events between gage measurements does not predict either the direction or magnitude of shift in channel bed elevation. That variations in flood magnitude are insufficient to explain changes in bed elevation suggests that fluctuations in sediment supply, rather than variation in peak flows, are the primary driver of change to river bed elevation. In this region, channels downstream from glaciers have statistically significantly greater variability in bed elevation compared to those lacking upstream glaciers. Together, these findings suggest that aggradation and incision signals in this region predominately reflect fluctuations in sediment supply, commonly associated with glaciogenic sources, rather than response to high flow events.

To this trend is added the sea level rise expected in 100 years, which leads to an increased coastal flood risk. This research analyzes how inhabitants perceive the exposure to coastal flood risk at different spatial and temporal levels. In this way, 318 individuals were surveyed in four coastal municipalities in France (Barneville-Carteret, Saintes-Maries-de-lamer, Chatelaillon-Plage and Sainte-Anne). Our research is based on two major assumptions that relate to the optimistic bias. First, we assumed that individuals are likely to perceive proximate areas more favorably than distant areas, in other words their assessment of exposure to coastal flood risk may increases as spatial level increases. Second, we assumed that individuals tend to believe that risk would be greater in the future than in the present, so their assessment of exposure may increases as temporal levels increases. We confirmed those assumptions and determined local and global level as significant levels of assessment. Respondents tend to assess their home exposure lower than the one of more distant spatial levels. However, it is precisely at the local level that prevention and risk reduction measures are the most carried out as they are relevant to community engagement.

J	Möller, I				Moller, Iris			Applying Uncertain Science to Nature-Based Coastal Protection: Lessons From Shallow Wetland-Dominated Shores	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						nature-based adaptation; coastal protection and management; coastal wetlands; science-policy advice; flood and erosion risk	SALT MARSHES; WAVE ATTENUATION; NORFOLK	Climate change and associated sea-level rise alongside the potential for alterations in the magnitude and frequency of extreme storm events, rapidly rising coastal populations, and a legacy of coastal land reclamation are forcing the need for sustainable coastal protection on shallow, wetland-dominated coasts. In this context, practitioners, and academics in the field of coastal flood and erosion risk reduction have been highlighting the flood protection value of natural coastal features for some time. Examples of the implementation of nature-based coastal flood and erosion risk reduction schemes, however, are few and far between and can certainly not (yet) be considered mainstream. One key problem around the implementation of these types of approaches has arguably been the relative lack of perceived scientific certainty around the efficiency with which natural landforms, such as coastal wetlands, reduce wave action on landward lying structures and the persistence of such landforms in an uncertain future. This makes nature-inclusive approaches less attractive to more traditional engineering-only approaches that rely solely on one "hard" structure with a well-defined impact on waves and a specified design life. Using the example of wave dissipation over coastal wetland surfaces, this paper provides a way forward for an easily applicable scientifically informed assessment of the minimum difference any given wetland makes to wave heights at landward locations. Such a "minimum function" approach could be rolled out to other ecosystem services provided by natural features and thus allow decision makers and coastal planners to consider nature-inclusive approaches to coastal management with greater confidence.

This study develops a novel approach to predictive statistical modelling of the probability of flooding at major road-stream intersection sites, where water, sediment and debris can accumulate and cause failure of drainage facilities and associated road damages. Two areas in south-west Sweden, affected by severe floods in August 2014, are used in representative case studies for this development. A set of physical catchment-descriptors (PCDs), characterizing key aspects of topography, morphology, soil type, land use, hydrology (precipitation and soil moisture) and sediment connectivity in the water-and sediment-contributing catchments, are used for the predictive flood modelling. A main novel contribution to such modelling is to integrate the spatiotemporal characteristics of remotely-sensed soil moisture in indices of sediment connectivity (IC), thereby also allowing for investigation of the role of soil moisture in the flood probability for different road-stream intersections. The results suggest five categories of PCDs as especially important for flood probability quantification and identification of particularly flood-prone intersections along roads (railways, etc.) These include: channel slope at the road-stream intersection and average elevation, soil properties (mainly percentage of till), land use cover (mainly percentage of urban areas), and a sediment connectivity index that considers soil moisture in addition to morphology over the catchment.

Under nonstationary conditions, the exceedance probability of a given multivariate flood event varies over time. This suggests that the traditional return-period concept cannot apply to engineering practice under nonstationary conditions, since by such a definition, a given multivariate flood event would correspond to a time-varying return period. In this paper, average annual reliability (AAR) was employed as the criterion for multivariate design rather than the return period to ensure that a given multivariate flood event corresponded to a unique design level under nonstationary conditions. The multivariate hydrologic design conditioned on the given AAR was estimated from the nonstationary multivariate flood distribution constructed by a dynamic C-vine copula, allowing for time-varying marginal distributions and a time-varying dependence structure. Both the most-likely design event and confidence interval for the multivariate hydrologic design conditioned on the given AAR were identified to provide supporting information for designers. The multivariate flood series from the Xijiang River, China, were chosen as a case study. The results indicated that both the marginal distributions and dependence structure of the multivariate flood series were nonstationary due to the driving forces of urbanization and reservoir regulation. The nonstationarities of both the marginal distributions and dependence structure were found to affect the outcome of the multivariate hydrologic design.

Location The South Atlantic Ocean. Methods A comprehensive compilation of the scientific literature was performed to examine the distribution, human impacts and conservation status of the South Atlantic MEs. Results Our review indicated that the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) is one of the major MEs areas in the world's oceans. The South Atlantic MEs are composed of a mosaic of distinct seascapes, mainly rhodolith beds, mesophotic reefs (i.e., rocky and biogenic) and marine animal forests (e.g., sponge aggregations, octocoral and black coral forests) that occur along the East South American and West African coasts, seamounts and oceanic islands. Throughout the SAO, the distinct seascapes of MEs are usually formed on the middle and outer continental shelves, shelf-edge, seamounts, submarine canyons, incised valleys and paleochannels, reef structures and insular shelves. We highlighted sea temperature anomalies, ocean acidification, extreme floods and droughts, fisheries, invasive species, marine debris, mining, and oil and gas exploitation as major threats to these ecosystems. Main conclusions Given the threats to the South Atlantic MEs, growing human pressures may degrade these ecosystems in the next years and undermine their unique biodiversity as well as their potential to provide connectivity between regions and depths. Our review revealed the existence of some extensive and unprotected formations, which urgently demand in-depth investigations and conservation action.

The study employs a multi-criteria assessment (MCE) approach and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate flood-vulnerable zones, wards, and sub-category-wise flood locations in Greater Mumbai. The AHP technique is used to evaluate flood-vulnerable impacting parameters such as rainfall (29.42%), slope (20.96%), land use/land cover (17.52%), vicinity to sewers and storm-water drainage (13.99%), vicinity to natural drainage (8.97%), vegetation (5.58%), and soil (3.56%). The study area is classified under different vulnerable categories as severe vulnerable (46.72%), high to very high (18.74%), and slight to moderate (34.54%). Researchers analysed 234 waterlogged locations, revealing that 85.46% (200 locations) were in the severe to very high vulnerability category, and only 14.52% (34 locations) were in the other three categories. Flood locations are more affected by slope (under the categories of < 5 m and 5.01-10 m), built-up land, sewers and storm water drainage (< 125 m), natural drainage (< 250 m), rainfall (< 2000 to 2200 mm), lowest dense vegetation, and coastal alluvium in soils. These model-based flood vulnerability maps are crucial for planning flood conservation and mitigation measures.

J	Zheng, J; Wang, L; Li, CX				Zheng, Jie; Wang, Lei; Li, Changxiao			Trends and Hotspots in Riparian Restoration Research: A Global Bibliometric Analysis during 1990-2022	FORESTS			English	Review						bibliometric analysis; riparian ecosystems; riparian restoration; floodplain forests; Web of Science	STREAM RESTORATION; RIVER; BIODIVERSITY; FIELD; FISH	Human activities and climate change have increased damage to riparian forest and their functions, stimulating interest in riparian restoration research and resulting in a surge of related publications. However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of riparian restoration research has been lacking until recently. To understand trends and hotspots in riparian restoration research, we performed a literature search of riparian restoration publications from 1990 to 2022 based on the Web of Science database. We found 2121 peer-reviewed articles, and then each paper was bibliometrically researched, analyzing authors, institutions, countries, citations, journals, publication years, and keywords. The results showed a growing number of annual articles during 1990-2022, but declining average citations. Environmental science, ecology, biodiversity conservation, engineering, and forestry were popular fields in riparian restoration. Publications on the riparian restoration field were widely dispersed in different journals, but Restoration Ecology and Ecological Engineering have higher influence and more publications and citations than other journals. Lorenz A. W., Nilsson C., and Kondolf G. M. were the most competitive authors because of their high number of publications and citations. The USA had the greatest research output and the most citations. American scientists preferred national collaboration, while Switzerland scientists engaged more in international collaborations. Research focus shifted from ecosystems and rivers before the 21st century to management topics after 2001 and biodiversity and conservation after 2011. This study provides valuable insights into the progress of riparian restoration research globally.

The widespread and costly nature of flood hazards, with the economically disadvantaged disproportionately victimized population, makes flood risk assessment particularly important. Here, flood risk is assessed as incurred by the homeowner vs. the flood insurer for insured U.S. properties through the derivation of average annual loss (AAL). AAL is estimated and partitioned using Monte Carlo simulation at the individual home scale, considering insurance coverage and deductible, and the first-floor height (i.e., height of the first floor above the ground), to determine the AAL proportion of homeowners (i.e., apportionment factor) for building and contents, distinguished from that borne by the insurer. In general, AAL estimates suggest that a large portion of the U.S. property flood risk is borne by the flood insurer. The flood insurance policy deductible directly influences the apportionment factor, whereby higher deductibles leave homeowners with a higher annual risk; however, the apportionment factor remains relatively insensitive to coverage values, especially for higher coverage amounts. The homeowner's flood risk is further reduced by freeboard, with AAL, following an exponential decay trend as freeboard increases. These results reveal new perspectives about how flood insurance protects homeowners from flood risk. In general, the results enhance the proactive decision-making process that allows homeowners to self-assess their degree of preparation and vulnerability to the devastating economic impacts of flood.

This study developed a deep-learning-technique-based data-driven model for flood predictions in both temporal and spatial dimensions, based on an integration of long short-term memory (LSTM) network, Bayesian optimization, and transfer learning techniques. A case study in northern China was applied to test the model performance, and the results clearly showed that the model can accurately predict the maximum water depths and flood time series for various hyetograph inputs, with substantial improvements in the computation time. The model predicted flood maps 19 585 times faster than the physically based hydrodynamic model and achieved a mean relative error of 9.5 %. For retrieving the spatial patterns of water depths, the degree of similarity of the flood maps was very high. In a best case scenario, the difference between the ground truth and model prediction was only 0.76 %, and the spatial distributions of inundated paths and areas were almost identical. With the adoption of transfer learning, the proposed model was well applied to a new case study and showed robust compatibility and generalization ability. Our model was further compared with two baseline prediction algorithms (artificial neural network and convolutional neural network) to validate the model superiority. The proposed model can potentially replace and/or complement the conventional hydrodynamic model for urban flood assessment and management, particularly in applications of real-time control, optimization, and emergency design and planning.

Remote sensing imagery has become the primary data source for surface water mapping due to its high spatiotemporal resolution and wide coverage. However, the reliability of current water products during flood seasons is limited due to the influence of clouds on optical remote sensing images. Moreover, annual and seasonal surface water mapping cannot capture intra-month variations of water bodies. To address these challenges, we proposed a high spatiotemporal surface water mapping framework on Google Earth Engine that combines multi-source remote sensing data. Our framework can generate 10 m spatial resolution surface water maps at a 15-day time step. We classified water bodies using Sentinel-2 images and a classification tree algorithm, and then used Sentinel-1 data to compensate for cloudy and missing data areas in Sentinel-2 images, resulting in seamless cloud-unaffected surface water maps. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed framework in six floodplains around the world, and experimental results demonstrate that the water maps generated by our framework outperform existing public datasets and our framework has great potential for hydrological applications. Our proposed framework can capture the details of surface water dynamics with higher spatial and temporal resolution and is free from cloud influence, which is necessary for water resources management, flood monitoring, and disaster response.

In an era of global environmental change, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a hotspot of natural hazards. Improving the capability of rural housing disaster insurance to foster local residents' disaster resilience is of great significance but remains under addressed. We used a discrete choice experiment approach to provide the first estimates of rural residents' preferences for rural housing disaster insurance attributes in central and western Tibet. We estimated residents' preferences and willingness-to-pay for the sum insured, subsidy rate, insured object, and perils covered. The potential impacts of increasing the sum insured, expanding the insured object, and lowering subsidy rates were evaluated. Our results suggest that residents prefer products with a high sum insured, high subsidy rate, and a complete list of insured objects. Residents who have experienced specific hazards tend to prefer the corresponding perils covered. Females and residents who have a closer social network are more likely to purchase insurance. Product improvement and policy simulation results suggest that, while lowering the subsidy rate, increasing the sum insured and expanding the insured object could promote participation and improve residents' welfare. Our results could improve the understanding of the preferences of households in remote regions and support policy implementations.

However, the data for the sewer system are not freely available, and it requires much work and time to design a physical model based on such data. Thus, a vector autoregressive model to develop a water level forecast system that uses observed rainfall and water level is being used. Additionally, this model was used to ensure information conducive to evacuation approximately 20 min in advance and to assess its forecast accuracy, despite the very limited data-water levels at one point and average rainfall at another-without the need to build a physical model such as that which is used in sewer pipe calculations. Compared to the observed water level, the calculated water level increased faster; and thus, the forecast leaned toward safety in evacuation. Furthermore, the data from past five torrential rainfall events to achieve a stable forecast; this method can be applied to basins with limited observation data. Therefore, these results indicate that this method can be applied as a water level forecast method for basins with an extremely fast flood arrival time.

Anfushi's Necropolis is located near the western harbour (Island of Pharos) and dates back to the 2nd century BC. Sea level rises, earthquakes, flooding, storminess, variations in temperature, rainfall, and wind are the factors that have the largest effect on the destruction and decay of Anfushi's Necropolis building materials. This paper's main objectives were to characterize this necropolis's building materials and assess its durability problems and risks regarding the coastal environment. Additionally, the vector mapping of its architectural and structural elements was applied for documentation and recording purposes for the necropolis. To achieve these aims, field (recording and photographs), desk (engineering drawing and mapping), and laboratory works (X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, binocular microscopy, polarizing microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy) were carried out. The results confirmed the probabilistic risk of sea level rises and its impact on the submergence of Anfushi's Necropolis. The structural deficiencies of the tombs were caused by the effect of earthquake tremors along with anthropogenic factors. In addition, chemical and microscopic investigations showed that salt weathering (halite and gypsum) induced the decay of the building materials.

In this study, moraine-dammed glacial lakes in the Yi'ong Zangbo River basin were recognized based on Landsat ETM+/TM/OLI images in 2000 and 2019. Also, GLOFs for the Jionglaco, the largest glacial lake in this basin, were simulated using the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The results show that the total number and area of moraine-dammed glacial lakes in this basin increased by 10 (10.52%) and 5.49 km(2) (48.24%) from 2000 to 2019, respectively, in which the area of the Jionglaco increased by 3.22 km(2). The peak discharge at the breach outlet for five scenarios with different combinations of breach width (80 and 120 m), depth (2.5 and 5 m), and flood time (1.5 and 3 h) are 489 , 1,327.43, 444.32, 617.47, and 1,570.61 m(3)/s. With the addition of baseflow in the river, the peak discharge at bridge site 15,138.93 km from Jionglaco, is 1,040.89, 1,724.00, 1,024.85, 1,162.25, and 1,990.52 m(3)/s. The combination of baseflow in river and the GLOF discharge results in an increasing peak discharge in the further downstream region. However, the arrival of peak discharge in downstream areas is delayed, which increases the chances of people escaping.

In this review, five different types of wetlands were observed (marshes, swamps, flooded grasslands, flooded palms and mangroves) in which their carbon pool/carbon sequestrations in Mexican zones were studied. In addition, it was shown that swamps (forested freshwater wetlands) sequestered more carbon in the soil (86.17 +/- 35.9 Kg C m(-2)) than other types of wetlands (p = 0.011); however, these ecosystems are not taken into consideration by the Mexican laws on protection compared with mangroves (34.1 +/- 5.2 Kg C m(-2)). The carbon pool detected for mangrove was statistically similar (p > 0.05) to data of carbon observed in marshes (34.1 +/- 5.2 Kg C m(-2)) and flooded grassland (28.57 +/- 1.04 Kg C m(-2)) ecosystems. The value of carbon in flooded palms (8.0 +/- 4.2 Kg C m(-2)) was lower compared to the other wetland types, but no significant differences were found compared with flooded grasslands (p = 0.99). Thus, the carbon deposits detected in the different wetland types should be taken into account by policy makers and agents of change when making laws for environmental protection, as systematic data on carbon dynamics in tropical wetlands is needed in order to allow their incorporation into global carbon budgets.

A vulnerability assessment framework is used to calculate the flood vulnerability indexes (FVIs) under socio-economic, environmental, and physical aspects. We first analysed socio-economic data to examine the provincial socio-economic development from 2004 to 2019. We interviewed 573 residents and 111 officials during 2017 and 2018 in 111 communes of 9 districts to add detailed socio-economic and physical data, which were then classified, processed, and standardized based on 34 indicators for the FVIs calculations. All calculated indexes were then mapped for visual assessments. Results show that 29 communes are at high vulnerability levels (FVIs = 0.4-0.6). Notably, Gio Linh, Dong Ha, and Vinh Linh districts present the highest vulnerability, with five vulnerable communes. These communes present moderate probabilities of flood occurrence due to their low-lying terrain and agricultural production dominance. Our calculations also reveal that 81 communes (73.8% of the communes in Quang Tri province) were indexed with low vulnerability levels (FVIs = 0.2-0.4); of which Gio Linh has 17 out of 22 communes (77%), and Vinh Linh has 16 out of 21 communes (76%). Our findings suggest that the local government considers effective floodwater management strategies for the region, especially those with high vulnerability indexes and adaptation measures to mitigate flood damages.

A large number of flood disaster knowledge were buried in the scientific literature. This study mines research trends and hotspots on flood disasters and identifies their quantitative and spatial distribution features using natural language process technology. The abstracts of 14,076 studies related to flood disasters from 1990 to 2020 were used for text mining. The study used logistic regression to classify themes, adopted the dictionary matching method to analyze flood disaster subcategories, analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of research institutions, and used Stanford named entity recognition to identify hot research areas. Finally, the disaster information was integrated and visualized as a knowledge graph. The main findings are as follows. (1) The research hotspots are concentrated on flood disaster risks and prediction. Rainfall, coastal floods, and flash floods are the most-studied flood disaster sub-categories. (2) There are some connections and differences between the physical occurrence and research frequency of flood disasters. Occurrence frequency and research frequency of flood disasters are correlated. However, the spatial distribution at the global and intercontinental scales is geographically imbalanced. (3) The study's flood disaster knowledge graph contains 39,679 nodes and 64,908 edges, reflecting the literature distribution and field information on the research themes. Future research will extract more disaster information from the full texts of the studies to enrich the flood disaster knowledge graph and obtain more knowledge on flood disaster risk and reduction.

Given the significant measures taken in HCMC to reduce groundwater extraction and sea-level rise (SLR) inundation since the most recent subsidence studies, we aim to update and contribute to the subsidence information of HCMC with continuous temporal coverage from 2017 to 2019. In this study, we use Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) with Copernicus Sentinel-1 data and open source tools to determine current subsidence rates within the urban center of HCMC. Additionally, the scalability of this method and use of freely accessible data allows for continuous updating and monitoring of this high-vulnerability region. The observed average subsidence rates were 3.3 mm per year with a maximum local subsidence of 5.3 cm per year. These results largely align with findings of previous studies and reflect similar spatial distributed subsidence patterns. Inundation risk awareness is enhanced by not only continued improved subsidence analysis, but also incorporating latest advancements in Digital Elevation Model (DEM) accuracy. This study compares local differences between traditionally used AW3D30 DEM with the CoastalDEM. Our findings indicate that although we identify lower than previously accepted elevations in the urban core, that stabilization of subsidence is observed in this same region.	[Duffy, C.

The main objective of this work was to determine and analyze the flooding potential of watersheds by integrating morphometric attributes and the HAND (Height Above Nearest Drainage) model. The study focused on the Bocaina Stream Basin (BSB), located in the State of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil. The BSB fully covers the urban area of the city of Passos, which has long suffered from flooding. In this work, the following cartographic products were generated at a scale of 1:50,000: a map of the morphometric susceptibility to flooding, which classifies the subbasins of the BSB based on five morphometric parameters; a map of the height above the nearest drainage, which was obtained via the HAND model; and map of the topographic predisposition to flooding, which was obtained through the integration of the morphometric flood susceptibility information and the HAND model information. Based on the map of the topographic predisposition to flooding, the BSB area shows the following classes of flood susceptibility: 75%-very low, 11%-low, 9%-medium, and 6%-high. Although the high and medium classes represent the lowest percentages in terms of basin area, they are predominantly located in areas near the drainage channels. When these areas are occupied, as is the case in the city of Passos, flooding can have considerable impacts.

J	Lawrence, D				Lawrence, Deborah			Uncertainty introduced by flood frequency analysis in projections for changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate in Norway	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Climate change impacts; Nordic; Extreme value analysis; Ensemble uncertainty; HBV hydrological model	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CHANGE IMPACTS; MODEL; RISK; SEASONALITY; SHIFTS	Study region: The study considers 115 unregulated catchments in Norway, with areas from 6 to 15,449 km(2) and flood generation regimes ranging from snowmelt-dominated to 'mixed' (snowmelt and rainfall) to fully rainfall-driven. Study focus: Bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX RCM output for RCP 8.5 is used to generate an ensemble of 500 hydrological simulations for assessing changes in flood magnitudes under a future climate. Flood estimates are based on three extreme value distributions (EVDs), Gumbel, Generalised Extreme Value and Generalised Pareto, with confidence intervals calculated using parametric bootstrapping, and uncertainty introduced into the ensemble by the flood estimation is evaluated using variance decomposition. Changes in EVD parameters under future conditions are also assessed. New hydrologic insight for the region: There are large differences in projected changes between catchments, with median estimates ranging from -48 % to +99 % for the 200 year flood. Flood magnitudes in all catchments with rainfall-dominant or mixed flood regimes are expected to increase. EVDs with a shape parameter (GEV and GPD) indicate larger increases in higher flood quantiles than the Gumbel distribution (e.g. by 5-8 percentage points for the 200 year flood). Flood frequency estimation contributes 30-52 % of the total ensemble range in individual catchments. Location and scale parameters generally increase in catchments with increasing flood magnitudes, and some catchments with mixed flood regimes also exhibit increases in the shape parameter under future conditions.

Quantifying the UFRES has attracted increasing attention for urban sustainable development. However, few studies have focused on how to identify urban flood regulation priority areas. In this study, we simulated urban surface runoff by using the soil conservation services-curve number model, and quantified UFRES supply and demand by using relative indicators (i.e., runoff reduction ratio and urban vulnerability) at the subdistrict scale in Beijing, China. Then, an urban flood regulation priority index was developed by integrating UFRES demand and supply, and further used to identify priority areas. The results show that the mean runoff reduction ratio in Beijing decreased from 38.70% (for a 1-year rainfall return period) to 24.74% (for a 100-year rainfall return period). Subdistricts with low UFRES supply were mainly located in the urban central area and the southeastern zone, while subdistricts with high UFRES demand were mainly located in the urban central region. Meanwhile, places with high priority for flood regulation were mainly located in the inner city, and low priority areas were mainly located in northwestern, southwestern, and northeastern Beijing. Our results also imply that the urban flood regulation priority index is an effective indicator to identify urban flood regulation priority areas. These findings could provide urban planners with a comprehensive understanding of UFRES and scientific guidance to improve them.

The Asia-Pacific region, which has the highest concentration of human population in the world, represents one of the larger areas on Earth being threatened by the rise of sea level. Recent studies indicate a global sea level of 3.2 mm/yr as measured from 20 years of satellite altimetry. The combined effect of sea level rise and local land subsidence, can be overwhelming for coastal areas. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry technique is used to process a time series of TerraSAR-X images and estimate the land subsidence in the urban area of Singapore. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements are merged to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 sea-level rise scenarios to identify projected inundated areas and provide a map of flood vulnerability. Subsiding rates larger than 5 mm/year are found near the shore on the low flat land, associated to areas recently reclaimed or built. The projected flooded map of Singapore are provided for different sea-level rise scenarios. In this study, we show that local land subsidence can increase the flood vulnerability caused by sea level rise by 2100 projections. This can represent an increase of 25% in the flood area in the central area of Singapore for the RCP4.5 scenario.

J	Hämmerling, M; Kociecka, J; Liberacki, D				Hammerling, Mateusz; Kociecka, Joanna; Liberacki, Daniel			Analysis of the Possibilities of Rainwater Harvesting Based on the AHP Method	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA			English	Article						rainwater harvesting; Multi-Criteria Decision Making; AHP; green roof; drainage boxes; underground storage tank; infiltration basin	HIERARCHY PROCESS AHP; MANAGEMENT; WASTE	In the face of the current climate change, the increasing incidence of extreme weather events, prolonged periods of drought and water scarcity, attention should be paid to rational water management with particular emphasis on rainwater. Excessive development and sealing of urban catchments result in a faster outflow of water to the sewage system, which prevents it from reaching the soil and plants. This situation intensifies the drought effect and contributes to the occurrence of urban floods. In order to mitigate the negative impact of this process, solutions allowing for rainwater harvesting should be implemented. A wide variety of systems are currently available on the market to harvest and reuse rainwater. In the publication, the authors analysed four solutions: a green roof, drainage boxes, an underground storage tank, and an infiltration basin. The AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method was used to select the best rainwater harvesting system, which is one of the methods of Multi-Criteria Decision Making. The analyses considered two different variants in terms of land use: a detached house located in the suburbs of a large agglomeration and a block of flats placed in the city center. According to the analysis and the assumed factors, in both cases, the best solution was to use an underground storage tank. This system proved to be the most advantageous due to the possibility of reuse of water, low construction costs, and ease of exploitation.

In the course of the research, it has been proven that changes in mobility (and the related travel speed) are too significant to be ignored when studying accessibility in unusual circumstances. The vast majority of existing accessibility studies rely primarily on speed models, which - in the event of a flood - do not indicate the external effects of the natural disaster. On the basis of the conducted research it has been stated that the occurrence of a flood has a significant impact on changes in the spatial distribution of traffic and its related speeds. Such changes vary depending on the particular means of transport. With the most commonly applied methods of measuring accessibility, which are customarily based on speed models, the changes we observed would not be recorded. The application of mobility-based research in the analyses of accessibility - especially in the event of a flood - indicates the disaster's influence on the capacity of the road network, and thus, it allows for more effective flood-risk management. Furthermore, this article also demonstrates the possibility of applying source materials available in most member states of the EU, i.e., flood-risk maps and digital terrain models (NMPT), for the purposes of analysing and identifying road section closures within the transport network after the occurrence of a flood.

Study focus: This study assessed the influence of antecedent moisture condition on flood frequency, based on an experimental application scheme and pre-processing. For this purpose, T-year flood simulations were conducted using a distributed hydrologic model. Distributed precipitation patterns which have an amount of precipitation corresponding to a specific T-year return period were generated by representative radar-based precipitation fields and precipitation frequency analysis. Dry, normal, and wet of antecedent moisture condition were applied to each T-year flood simulation to reflect variable initial soil moisture states. New hydrological insights for the region: The relationship among flood frequency, antecedent moisture condition, and precipitation frequency was derived for a specific target storm event. For normal antecedent moisture states, the relation showed that T-year precipitation could generate floods having return intervals nearly identical to those derived using gage records. For saturated soil conditions, a 7-year precipitation event could trigger a 100-year flood. Conversely, a 200-year precipitation event with dry soil conditions might generate only a 15-year flood event. The results emphasize the importance of soil moisture to flood runoff and suggest that soil-moisture monitoring could aid in improving flood forecasting.

However, they are of crucial importance for cities; this can be seen when a city faces floods resulting in extensive and expensive damage. The increase of rain intensity due to climate change may cause deficiencies in drainage networks built for certain defined flows which are incapable of coping with sudden increases, leading to floods. This problem can be solved using different strategies; one is the adaptation of the network through rehabilitation. A way to adapt the traditional network approach consists of substituting some pipes for others with greater diameters. More recently, the installation of storm tanks makes it possible to temporarily store excess water. Either of these solutions can be expensive, and an economic analysis must be done. Recent studies have related flooding with damage costs. In this work, a novel solution combining both approaches (pipes and tanks) is studied. A multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the NSGA-II is proposed for the rehabilitation of urban drainage networks through the substitution of pipes and the installation of storage tanks. Installation costs will be offset by damage costs associated with flooding. As a result, a set of optimal solutions that can be implemented based on the objectives to be achieved by municipalities or decisions makers. The methodology is finally applied to a real network located in the city of Bogota, Colombia.

The environmental impacts of snowpack were analysed in a small forest catchment (Jizera Mountains, Czech Republic) in the context of forest dynamics, atmospheric deposition, and climate, 1982-2021. Snowmelt dominates in March-May with 41% of the long-term annual water yield; however, there is also seasonal acidification of stream water. Forest clear-cutting together with air pollution control has contributed to a decrease in the acid atmospheric load, but, in the spring, streams' pH is often below the environmental threshold of 5.3. Snowmelt volumes did not show significant transformation with forest canopy and do not affect summer low flows. Peak flows in the springtime do not exceed summer flash floods (frequencies up to 0.13 against 0.02). Mean annual air temperature is increasing by 0.26 & PLUSMN; 0.08 & DEG;C per decade with more intensive warming (0.64 & PLUSMN; 0.1 & DEG;C per decade) in the winter season.

Additionally, as an NbS, NFM aims to provide further multiple benefits, such as increased biodiversity and improved water quality as well as improved mental health. The implementation of NbS often needs private-owned or managed land, yet can create conflicts between the different stakeholders which can undermine the social consensus required for successful implementation. Consequently, a main question is how the multiple benefits and requirements of NFM can be delivered to meet the different goals of the wide variety of stakeholders who must be involved. This article discusses the challenges and potential of implementing NFM as an alternative to the traditional technical mitigation measures in flood risk management. We outline four opportunities in the implementation of NFM: physical conditions of the catchment, social interaction, financial resources, and institutional setting. Their importance is then demonstrated and compared to different examples across the globe. Nevertheless, the core drivers reflect the social interaction and institutional setting and the role of stakeholders in the successful implementation of NFM.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Planning WaterHuman Water > Water GovernanceScience of Water > Water ExtremesWater and Life > Conservation, Management, and Awareness	[Thaler, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria; [Hudson, Paul] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, England; [Viavattene, Christophe; Green, Colin] Middlesex Univ, Flood Hazard Res Ctr, London, England	BOKU University; University of York - UK; Middlesex University	Thaler, T (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Inst Mt Risk Engn, Vienna, Austria.	thomas.thaler@boku.ac.at	Hudson, Paul/GPS-9348-2022; Thaler, Thomas/O-7112-2014	Hudson, Paul/0000-0001-7877-7854; Thaler, Thomas/0000-0003-3869-3722	Austrian Climate and Energy Fund [B960201]; European Cooperation in Science and Technology [CA16209]	Austrian Climate and Energy Fund; European Cooperation in Science and Technology(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST))	Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, Grant/Award Number: B960201; European Cooperation in Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: CA16209		119	9	9	7	21	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2049-1948			WIRES WATER	Wiley Interdiscip.

J	Qiu, YA; Lu, ZY; Tang, HB				Qiu, Yunan; Lu, Zhenyu; Tang, Haibo			A Short-Term Regional Precipitation Prediction Model Based on Wind-Improved Spatiotemporal Convolutional Network	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						short-term precipitation prediction; improved GCN; GRU	SYSTEM; ASSIMILATION; FORECASTS	Accurate precipitation prediction can help decision makers judge the trend of climate change and formulate more effective measures, and prevent flood and drought disasters. In this paper, we propose a short-term regional precipitation prediction model based on wind-improved spatiotemporal convolutional network. Among them, the improved graph convolution network integrates the effects of wind direction and geographic location at past moments to capture the spatial dependence, whilst the gated recurrent unit captures the temporal dependence by learning the dynamic changes of data. The spatio-temporal memory flow module and attention module are added to capture spatial deformation and temporal variation more accurately, thereby better matching the physical properties of precipitation. The proposed model achieves better prediction results on real data sets. Experiments show that our method is better at extracting the spatio-temporal information of precipitation data and capturing its time dependence and spatial correlation. Plain Language Summary Deep-learning technology has not been fully explored in regional short-term precipitation prediction. The traditional graph convolution neural network does not consider the practical significance of wind direction in precipitation. Therefore, we introduce a novel short-term regional precipitation prediction model based on wind improved spatiotemporal convolution network (ASS-TGCN). Measured data of automatic meteorological station in Jiangsu Province, China have been utilized. Compared with the comparison model, our proposed model has achieved better performance in various indicators.

Integrative Phylogeography Reveals Conservation Priorities for the Giant Anteater <i>Myrmecophaga tridactyla</i> in Brazil	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						Cerrado; conservation genetics; ensemble forecasting; population expansion; population structure; Xenarthra	BRADYPUS-TORQUATUS PILOSA; EMAS NATIONAL-PARK; PROTECTED AREAS; ATLANTIC FOREST; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HABITAT SELECTION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; XENARTHRA PILOSA; CLIMATE-CHANGE	The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) is a strictly myrmecophagous xenarthran species that ranges from Honduras to northern Argentina, occupying various habitats, from grassland and floodplains to forests. According to the IUCN, it is a vulnerable species mainly threatened by poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, and road kills. Here, we investigate the phylogeography, distribution, ecology, and historical demography of Brazilian populations of the giant anteater. We analysed two mitochondrial (mtDNA) and three nuclear (nDNA) markers in 106 individuals from the Cerrado, Pantanal, Atlantic Forest, and Amazon Forest biomes through analyses of population structure and demography, phylogeography, and ecological niche modelling. Two divergent mtDNA clusters were found, one in the Amazon (AM) and another in the Cerrado, Pantanal, and Atlantic Forest biomes (CEPTAF). At the population level, CEPTAF presented higher mtDNA haplotype richness than AM and a unidirectional mtDNA gene flow was identified from AM to CEPTAF, which could be linked to more favourable habitat conditions for the species in Cerrado and Pantanal. Paleodemographic reconstructions with mtDNA and nDNA data indicate a large population expansion of the species starting at the end of the Pleistocene. Finally, the integrative phylogeographic analyses of giant anteater populations reinforce the importance of the Brazilian Cerrado as a priority biome for the species' conservation.

Extreme Precipitation Events in Alaska: Historical Trends and Projected Changes	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						Alaska; precipitation; floods; extreme events; climate change	CLIMATE EXTREMES; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES	While recent increases in heavy precipitation events in some midlatitude regions are consistent with climate model simulations, evidence of such increases in high latitudes is more tenuous, partly because of data limitations. The present study evaluates historical and future changes in extreme precipitation events in Alaska. Using the ERA5 reanalysis, station data, and output from two downscaled global climate models, we examine precipitation-driven flood events at five diverse locations in Alaska where major historical floods provide benchmarks: Fairbanks (August 1967), Seward (October 1986), Allakaket/Bettles (August 1994), Kivalina (August 2012), and Haines (December 2020). We place these precipitation events into a framework of historical trends and end-of-century (2065-2100) model projections. In all but one of the flood events, the amount of rainfall was the highest on record for the event duration, and precipitation events of this magnitude are generally projected by the models to remain infrequent. All of the cases had subtropical or tropical moisture sources. None of the locations show statistically significant historical trends in the magnitude of extreme precipitation events. However, the frequencies of heavy precipitation events are projected to increase at most of the locations. The frequency of events with 2 year and 5 year historical return intervals is projected to become more frequent, especially in the Interior, and in some cases increase to several times per year. Decreases are projected only for Seward along Alaska's southern coast.

New glacier lakes are forming and potential connected opportunities (e.g., geosystem services) and risks (e.g., floods) are emerging. In the last decades, glacier lakes in the European Alps have increased in number and size, including in the study area (Aosta Valley Region, NW Alps, Italy). This work presents a methodology for a regional scale assessment of the potential of glacier lakes for socio-environmental development of mountain territories. Within the Aosta Valley, 337 glacier lakes were identified, covering a total area of about 1.55 km(2). These lakes were numerically evaluated and ranked through a semi-automatic analysis in a GIS environment that was based on a set of parameters related to: 1) the geo-environmental value; 2) the existence of human infrastructures and/or activities close to the lakes; 3) the potential interaction of natural instabilities within the areas surrounding the lakes. Results showed the robustness of the assessment considering some of the highest scored lakes (e.g., Lago del Miage, lakes at the Rutor Glacier, etc.) and mountain sectors (Mont Blanc and Matterhorn areas). The application of the proposed methodology represents an initial step towards the identification of hot-spot lakes for a sustainable and integrated management, that also takes into account potential risk conditions connected to natural instabilities.

Within NSRPS, the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) produces snow analyses that are used to initialise the land surface model, which in turn is used to force the river routing component. Originally, CaLDAS was designed to improve atmospheric forecasts with less focus on hydrological processes. When snow data assimilation occurs, the related increments remove/add water from/to the system, which can sometimes be problematic for streamflow forecasting, in particular during the snowmelt period. In this study, a new snow analysis method introduces multiple innovations that respond to the need for higher quality snow analyses for hydrological purposes, including the use of IMS snow cover extent data instead of in situ snow depth observations. The results show that the new snow assimilation methodology brings an overall improvement to snow analyses and substantially enhances water conservation, which is reflected in the generally improved streamflow simulations. This work represents a first step towards a new snow data assimilation process in CaLDAS, with the final objective of producing a reliable snow analysis to initialise and improve NWP as well as environmental predictions, including flood and drought forecasts.

Snowmelt floods occur frequently, especially in mountainous areas, and they pose serious threats to natural and socioeconomic systems. The current forecasting method relies on basic snowmelt accumulation and has geographic limitations that restrict the accuracy and timeliness of flood simulation and prediction. In this study, we clarified the precipitation types in two selected catchments by verifying accumulated and maximum temperatures' influences on snow melting using a separation algorithm of rain and snow that incorporates with the temperatures. The new snow-melting process utilizing the algorithm in the soil and water assessment tool model (SWAT) was also developed by considering the temperatures. The SWAT model was used to simulate flooding and snowmelt in the catchments. We found that the contributions of snowmelt to the river flow were approximately 6% and 7% higher, according to our model compared to the original model, for catchments A and B, respectively. After the model improvement, the flood peaks increased by 49.42% and 43.87% in A and B, respectively. The contributions of snowmelt to stream flow increased by 24.26% and 31% for A and B, respectively. Generally, the modifications improved the model accuracy, the accuracy of snowmelt's contributions to runoff, the accuracy of predicting flood peaks, the time precision, and the flood frequency simulations.

Historically, avulsions on deltas occurred at persistent locations, causing some of the deadliest recorded floods. Climate change and human activities are threatening to drown deltas but it is unknown how avulsions will respond because they occur infrequently on large, lowland deltas. Here, we use a low-gradient river delta formed on the margin of a lake in the Qaidam Basin, China, as a natural laboratory to explore how lowland deltas will respond to river-mouth retreat from accelerated relative sea-level rise. Using satellite imagery from 1973 to 2010 C.E., we identified and analyzed the response of 6 lobe-scale avulsions on the Sulengguole River delta to the seasonal expansion of the North Huoluxun Lake in the Qaidam Basin. We show that the seasonal lake-water area increase caused punctuated river-mouth retreat. In response, avulsion sites migrated upstream at a commensurate rate such that the avulsion length-streamwise distance of avulsion site to the river mouth-remained consistent and scaled with the backwater lengthscale, similar to large, lowland deltas. Results indicate that the drowning of lowland deltas from accelerated relative sea-level rise will shift avulsion hazards tens-to-hundreds of kilometers upstream, exposing new upstream communities to the risk of catastrophic flooding.

To deal with these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and methods for robust decision-making can be combined. This paper sequentially applies CBA, robust optimisation methods and info-gap analysis to find efficient and robust coastal flood protection strategies for the German Baltic Sea coast. The CBA results suggest that - under flood risk assumptions - a share of the coast of Schleswig-Holstein (9.3-10.1%; 60-65 km) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4.1-10.0%; 78-189 km) with relatively high flood exposure, might currently be under-protected from a social welfare perspective. Present Value estimates of regional investment costs of five regret or loss minimising strategies range from 1.7 to 4.8 billion Euro across robustness metrics at 3% discounting. The info-gap analysis suggests that some of these strategies will fail to prevent large-scale damages under high-end scenarios. We conclude that a multi-method cost-benefit approach can be used to narrow down the number of solutions that are both potentially efficient and sufficiently robust by investigating strategy performance within, across and beyond predefined scenarios.

In this study, the difference in tolerance to flooding between grafted trees and seedlings was investigated in mango trees (Mangifera indicaL.). Two levels of flooding treatment were established, in addition to a non-treated control. One was "30-flood," in which trees were submerged up to 30 cm from the soil surface, and another was "10-flood," in which trees were submerged up to 10 cm from the soil surface. Grafted trees treated with the 30-flood were submerged up to 5 cm above the graft union. Only the grafted trees in the 30-flood treatment began to decrease Fv/Fm and the root sugar content during treatment, then died after the completion of treatment. In grafted trees and seedlings alike, both flooding treatments also reduced root vigor, as determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride reduction tests and root starch content. However, root vigor and root starch content in grafted trees treated with the 10-flood as well as seedlings treated with both 10- and 30-flood recovered within two months after the completion of treatment, so that no significant differences were detected between the control. These results suggest that the submergence of the graft union into water causes the decline in photosynthesis of the scion first and the death of the grafted trees as a result.

To reveal the specific roles of these three major factors in changing the seasonal discharges of the whole Yangtze River, this paper analyzes daily discharges during 1961-2014 at 16 hydrological stations from the far upper reach (the Jinshajiang Reach) to the estuary. We found that precipitation has only homogenized in areas 427 km downstream of the TGR, contributing 9.5-23.6% to the homogenized discharges. Even though the TGR is the largest hydraulic works in the world, it only contributes 17.5-27.2% to the downstream homogenization of seasonal discharge. By comparison, dams in sub-regions are a major contributor (61.1-100%) in the homogenized reach either upper or lower to the TGR. Of all the sub-basins, dams in Hanjiang River basin have the most significant effect (16.9%) on changing the allocations of seasonal discharges to the sea, followed by Wujiang (11.5%), Jialingjiang (10.1%), Yalongjiang (9.4%), Qingjiang (8.4%), and Daduhe-Minjiang (4.7%) river basins.

Four lithostratigraphic sections were constructed at the Gohatsion, Dejen, Mugher and Jemma localities. Lithofacies analysis of the succession at outcrop and petrographic scales indicate a broad tidal belt influenced by seasonal and regional climate and sea level changes. Integrated lithofacies depositional models for the corresponding informal members have been proposed in order to demonstrate the lithological response to local and global climate change and sea level fluctuations that occurred during the initial phase of the Tethyan Sea transgression during the early to middle Jurassic. Lithofacies of the Lower Mudrock Member show deposition within a siliciclast-dominated back barrier tidal flat system. Deposition of the Gypsum Member occurred in a marine coastal sabkha belt, whereas the Upper Mudrock Member was deposited in a broad coastal shelf prone to seasonal marine flooding. The models show that all the members of the Gohatsion Formation were formed within a broad coastal tidal belt with continental influence and sediment delivery from the northwest, and a slowly encroaching transgressive marine influence from the southeast.

Flood hazard mapping using a multi-criteria decision analysis and GIS (case study Gaza Governorate, Palestine)	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Gaza; Flood-prone areas; GIS-multi-criteria decision analysis; Analytical hierarchy process; Sensitivity analysis	REGION; AREAS	As a result of ongoing urbanization and climate change, urban areas (e.g., Gaza Strip (GS)) experienced many floods recently. These floods posed threats to human lives and turned many regions to disaster areas; however, municipalities' managers attempt to combat this challenge. This study aims to present a geographic information system multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) method to identify flood-prone areas. Five criteria are considered: distance to stormwater drainage network, land use (cover), height, slope, and groundwater depth. Three steps are carried out to classify the areas according to its vulnerability to flooding into five categories: "Very high," "High," "Moderate," "Low," and "Very low." These steps are the following: standardization, weighting, and overlaying of the criteria. After that, a sensitivity analysis was performed to show how areas' classes are changed. The proposed methodology was demonstrated in Gaza Governorate (Palestine) were most people and infrastructures were severely affected by flood in the last two decades. The results show that Nafaq Street, Zaytoon, Toffah, and Daraj regions are the most vulnerable areas in Gaza Governorate. This was consistent with historical floods inundation data. This study is a powerful tool with low cost and time that guides decision-makers to allocate the proper management in flood-prone areas in Gaza Governorate. Further research includes taking advantage of the flood-prone area map to implement spreading managed aquifer recharge projects.

A sediment-derived climatic proxy was inferred from a 93.5-cm-deep core (Mh1), whose dating by tephrochronology has already been achieved in previous works. Multiple geochemical, sedimentological, magnetic susceptibility, and quartz grain microtexture proxies were used to determine the shifts in regional climatic conditions. The Sebkha core captured sensitive changes in the precipitation/evaporation (P/E) balance by adjustments in salinity, and is especially valuable for reconstructing variability over centennial timescales. The Sebkha Mhabeul area showed higher salinity during the Roman Warm Period (RWP: 2100-1400 cal yr BP), the Medieval Warm Period (MWP: 1000-600 cal yr BP) and the present era, and generally lower salinity during the Dark Ages (DA: 1400-1000 cal yr BP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA: 600-200 cal yr BP). In southeastern Tunisia, the hydrological behavior was sometimes consistent with the flood activities in the eastern Mediterranean, and sometimes contemporaneous with the flood pulsations of the western Mediterranean.

The interglacial episodes of aggradation suggest a decreasing fluvial accommodation. While T4 terrace fill partially buried the cut terrace T5 in the upstream part of the studied area (Lower Danube-Arges-Dambovita), younger deposition did not compensate the previous incisions. Black Sea level fallings during glaciations were followed by Lower Danube incisions which propagated upward through knickpoints. Loess deposits can be correlated with these periods. Five episodes of incision were recognized based on terrace levels T5 to T1. Their ages and of the covering loess were obtained through optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and were correlated with MIS 6 - MIS 3 and classic glacial chronological events (latest Rissian-middle Wurmian). The maximum limiting age of Danube oldest terrace (T5) in the studied area is 141 +/- 25 kyr, while of the youngest (T1) is 50 +/- 6 kyr. The equivalent terraces on tributaries are younger. The time delays between terrace incisions on the Lower Danube system were estimated. The 32.7-15.9 kyr Danube floodplain deposits and the 5 kyr forests buried up to 7 m under Arges floodplain suggest that younger than 44-40 kyr terraces may be buried.

A 36 m long sediment core was mechanically drilled in the wave-dominated region of the RRD. The covariation of lithological characteristics, sediment grain-size distribution and geochemical proxies (LOI, TOC, C/N, delta C-13) suggested that the sediment core could be divided into six depositional environments, consisting of sub-and inter-tidal flats (formed before 8860 cal. year BP), shelf-prodelta, delta front slope (formed from 8860 to 2290 cal. year BP), delta front platform, tidal flat, and flood plain (from 2290 to 0 cal. year BP). Covariation of delta C-13 and C/N ratios in the sediment core allowed for tracing the origin of sedimentary organic carbon, which shifted from the dominance of mangroves and C3 plants at the suband inter-tidal flats to marine phytoplankton at the shelf-prodelta and delta front slope. The sedimentary sources of the delta front platform, tidal flat and flood plain were a mixture of phytoplankton and C3 plants, with the later source being dominant.

For land use characterization, we used a recently introduced method of mapping urban morphology types (UMTs), followed by land cover analysis (within the identified UMTs) for 2006 and 2016 by distributing sample points randomly over the extent of each UMT. Additionally, ecosystem service supply and demand data were collected using expert assessment. The UMT maps revealed 14 primary and 38 sub-UMTs for 2006 and 14 primary and 41 sub-UMTs for 2016. From primary UMTs, agriculture UMT (37%) in 2006 and residential UMT (32%) in 2016 are dominant, revealing a recently increasing transformation of UMTs into residential UMTs. The land cover change analysis shows a decrease in evapotranspiring surfaces (from 46% in 2006 to 32% in 2016) and an increase in built surfaces (from 24% in 2006 to 32% in 2016), indicating rapid urbanization within the catchment that will possibly lead to degradation of ESs. The ESs capacity map shows that agriculture UMTs deliver very high relevant food and high relevant capacity for flood regulation. Vegetation UMT shows very high relevant capacity for temperature regulation, recreation UMT for recreation service, and waterbodies for water supply. Overall, this paper demonstrated that rapid urbanization at the expense of ecologically essential land covers most likely degrade ESs in the Little Akaki River catchment, contributing to the global ecosystem service degradation and climate change. Hence, we highly recommend the application of green infrastructure planning that protects evapotranspiring surfaces that supply multiple ESs in the catchment. This in addition contributes to the global effort to protect green spaces that supplies multiple ecosystem service.

J	Fernández-Urrutia, M; Arbelo, M; Gil, A				Fernandez-Urrutia, Manuel; Arbelo, Manuel; Gil, Artur			Identification of Paddy Croplands and Its Stages Using Remote Sensors: A Systematic Review	SENSORS			English	Review						rice crops; multispectral; multisource; radar; machine learning; vegetation indices	RICE CROP; SAR DATA; MODIS; AREA; SOUTH; FIELDS; FLOOD; YIELD; ASIA; IMAGERY	Rice is a staple food that feeds nearly half of the world's population. With the population of our planet expected to keep growing, it is crucial to carry out accurate mapping, monitoring, and assessments since these could significantly impact food security, climate change, spatial planning, and land management. Using the PRISMA systematic review protocol, this article identified and selected 122 scientific articles (journals papers and conference proceedings) addressing different remote sensing-based methodologies to map paddy croplands, published between 2010 and October 2022. This analysis includes full coverage of the mapping of rice paddies and their various stages of crop maturity. This review paper classifies the methods based on the data source: (a) multispectral (62%), (b) multisource (20%), and (c) radar (18%). Furthermore, it analyses the impact of machine learning on those methodologies and the most common algorithms used. We found that MODIS (28%), Sentinel-2 (18%), Sentinel-1 (15%), and Landsat-8 (11%) were the most used sensors. The impact of Sentinel-1 on multisource solutions is also increasing due to the potential of backscatter information to determine textures in different stages and decrease cloud cover constraints. The preferred solutions include phenology algorithms via the use of vegetation indices, setting thresholds, or applying machine learning algorithms to classify images. In terms of machine learning algorithms, random forest is the most used (17 times), followed by support vector machine (12 times) and isodata (7 times). With the continuous development of technology and computing, it is expected that solutions such as multisource solutions will emerge more frequently and cover larger areas in different locations and at a higher resolution. In addition, the continuous improvement of cloud detection algorithms will positively impact multispectral solutions.

Furthermore, there has been no study of the vulnerability of the Munda minority in the Southwestern part of Bangladesh. The Sundarbans, the Gorai River, the Rupsa-Pasur River, and the coastline region are visible in Bangladesh's Southwest. It is often referred to as the Ganges Tidal Plain and consists of a delta that is only partially active. Numerous creeks and canals run through it. This study assesses the vulnerability of the Munda community to cyclones using 28 social, economic, physical, institutional, and cultural indicators. After the cyclone Aila, the education level of 84 Munda households in Gabura and Munshiganj Unions of Shyamnagar Upazila, Satkhira District, increased. Many members of the Munda community live in poverty (less than US$100 monthly income). About 70% of them rely on agriculture and fish-ing as their primary source of income. They also have alternative sources of income, such as daily labor. However, they were physically vulnerable. Only 7% of Munda houses were semi-pucca (partially concrete houses). Additionally, 85% of Munda houses were built over a decade ago. Cy-clones severely damaged approximately 89% of houses in the past. Many (88%) did not have ac-cess to proper sanitation. The physical vulnerability was also found to be significantly greater (P < 0.05) in Gabura Union (0.54 & PLUSMN; 0.09) than in Munshiganj Union (0.48 & PLUSMN; 0.13). However, they reported strong institutional support for disseminating cyclone warning messages, informa-tion on cyclone shelters, and evacuation procedures during cyclone emergencies. National and in-ternational disaster risk reduction strategies should encompass all people of all races, ethnicities, and nationalities.

Accordingly, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of optimal groundwater utilization and artificial recharge systems on groundwater level fluctuations and changes in pollution concentration of the Shahriar plain aquifer. Therefore, there was a need for a comprehensive multi-objective simulator-optimizer model that would be able to solve existing problem. For this purpose, a multi-objective modeling platform was developed that included two independent simulator-optimizer models. In the first model, the artificial neural network (ANN) was used to simulate the changes of groundwater level (GWL) and its quality as a function of the TDS index in the Shahriar Plain aquifer. The regression was then used to predict groundwater quality. Finally, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to optimize groundwater resources harvesting. The second model simulated the flood storage volume in the reservoirs of the artificial recharge system (ARS) using ANN and then optimized utilization of the artificial recharge system using (NSGAII). The results of the first model showed that the optimal volume of water withdrawn from the aquifer and the optimal TDS value of the aquifer decreased by 29 and 18%, respectively, while the changes of the optimal groundwater level increased by 28 m. Furthermore, based on the second model results, the total volume of optimal recharge will increase by 119% in the studied period due to the artificial recharge system, followed by a 14% increase in the changes of the optimal groundwater level. Overall, it can be concluded that the multiobjective modeling platform method can meet the objectives of this research simultaneously.

For this study, rainfall datasets from 30 rainfall stations were selected from the eight homogeneous rainfall zones of East Africa (EA) after preliminary quality assessment and tests, including outliers, normality, and homogeneity tests. The Morlet wavelet technique was used to establish the periodicity of monthly rainfall for typical March-May (MAM) and October-December (OND) seasons. Mann-Kendall's (MK) statistical test and Sen's slope estimator (SE) were used to examine the trend and the magnitude of change in seasonal and annual rainfall over EA, respectively. Wavelet transform approaches were used to show the linkages between the seasonal rainfall and the two atmospheric indices: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Results revealed a 1-year band as a dominant period of variability over EA. MK results indicate that 97% of the stations had a decreasing trend during MAM rainfall seasons, while nearly 60% of the stations presented a positive trend for OND and annual rainfall. A statistically significant negative correlation was established between ENSO and MAM rainfall, indicating a strong link between ENSO/La Nina and drought events during 1973/1974 and 1983/1984. Meanwhile, a statistically significant positive correlation between IOD and OND seasonal rainfall coincided with the 1972/1973 and 1997/1998 El Nino events. This established relationship could be used in drought and flood early warning systems to predict extreme events like drought and floods over EA. Besides, for the highly variable rainfall in the region, tailor-made climate information for planning economic programs like agriculture, energy, and disaster preparedness is highly recommended.

For wetlands, which are a special type of ecosystems that are based on water as their main medium, a decline in external hydrological connectivity often leads to wetland degradation inside biodiversity hotspots. In this context, the relationship between hydrological connectivity changes inside and outside hotspots is worth exploring. Based on the wetland biodiversity hotspots identified using systematic conservation planning, this study selected eight representative biodiversity hotspots with concentrated area. Integral index of connectivity, probability of connectivity (representing structural connectivity), and morphological spatial pattern analysis (representing functional connectivity) were used to analyze the hydrological connectivity changes inside various hotspots for 1995-2015. By taking the catchment area involved as the minimum basin perimeter, this study calculated the external hydrological connectivity changes of various hotspots during this period and analyzed the relationship between hydrological connectivity changes inside and outside of hotspots. The internal and external hydrological connectivity of wetland biodiversity hotspots were found to be significantly correlated. Moreover, the internal hydrological connectivity of hotspots not only declined with declining external structural connectivity, but also changed with the proportion of core wetlands, the proportion of edge wetlands, and the proportion of branch corridors. In addition, hotspots located at intersections of high-grade rivers were more significantly affected by climate change than by human activities and their hydrological connectivity increased with increasing rainfall. The internal hydrological connectivity of hotspots near low-grade rivers presented a declining trend, mainly because of human activities. This study clarified the relationship between internal and external hydrological connectivity of wetland biodiversity hotspots. Targeted internal and external control strategies are proposed, with the aim to offer references for the conservation of wetland biodiversity.

Yet, they are increasingly threatened by factors ranging from local resource exploitation to global climate change, with an estimated 35% of mangrove forests lost in the past two decades. These threats are difficult to manage due to the intrinsic characteristics of mangrove systems and their provisioning services, and their transboundary and pan-global nature. Due to their unique intertidal ecological niche, mangroves are often treated as a "common pool resource" within national legal frameworks, making them particularly susceptible to exploitation. Moreover, they form ecological connections through numerous biotic and abiotic processes that cross political boundaries. Because of these qualities a cross-scale nested framework of international, regional, and local coordination is necessary to successfully sustain mangrove ecosystems and their valuable services. Although coordination across the geopolitical spectrum is often cited as a need for effective management of common resources such as mangroves, there has been no formal analysis of mangrove multiscale governance. In this paper we address this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of interactions between and within international, regional, and local mangrove management regimes and examine the challenges and opportunities such multiscale governance frameworks present. We highlight Costa Rica as a case study to demonstrate the universal relevance and potential of multi-scale governance and explore its downscale potential. Using Elinor Ostrom's principles for self-governance of the commons as our touchstone, we identify where improvements to the status quo could be implemented to increase its effectiveness of the current frameworks to meet the ongoing challenge of managing mangrove-derived resources and services in the face of a changing climate and human needs.

The annual occurrence number of days of extreme precipitation over the Indochina Peninsula exhibits a significant change in 2003, with an abnormally higher occurrence number during the period 2003-2015 than that during 1951-2002. The extreme precipitation and such decadal change are contributed by more moisture sources associated with an enhanced dipole circulation over the Indian Ocean, which could be linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The daily large-scale meteorological pattern directly associated with extreme precipitation is characterized by an enhanced dipole of the typical summer monsoon pattern, with a zonally elongated Mascarene high and a deepened monsoon trough from northern India to the South China Sea. Such an intensified dipole provides two major channels of water vapor: one along the low-level westerly jet over the Indian Ocean and the other along the gyre of monsoon trough over the South China Sea. Compared with that during the period 1951-2002, the dipole is enhanced from northern India to the Indian Ocean and weakened over the Indochina Peninsula during the period 2003-2015. Although the Lagrangian analysis shows that the trajectory of air masses is displaced southward to the Indian Ocean, the intensified low-level westerly jet increases the evaporation of water from the ocean and thus not only enhances the water channel over the Indian Ocean but also yields a parallel water channel over the Bay of Bengal. In contrast, in spite of the increased trajectory density of air masses over the South China Sea, the lingering of air mass suppresses the evaporation of water and thus provides a declined contribution to the extreme precipitation during 2003-2015.

Consequently, submerged plants experience hypoxia stress which limits agronomic and horticultural crop growth and production. Hypoxia causes oxidative damage by accelerating the lipid peroxidation associated with O-2- and H2O2 levels. Additionally, hypoxia increases the accumulation of organic osmoprotectants and antioxidant activity, whereas it decreases the macronutrient (N, P, K, and Zn) uptake. This study aimed at investigating the effects of flooding-induced hypoxia stress on the growth and the physiological, biochemical, and nutritional characteristics of the hydroponically grown southern highbush blueberry (cv. Jewel) plants. In addition, the hypoxia-mitigating effects of conventional silicon (Si-C) and silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) and their application methods (foliar vs. foliar and rootzone application) were also appraised. Both the Si-C and the SiNPs efficiently alleviated hypoxia-induced oxidative and osmotic damage to cells by enhancing the activities of the enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, dehydroascorbate reductase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate, reductase); the non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid and glutathione contents); and the accumulation of compatible solutes (proline and glycinebetaine) in leaves and roots. However, the SiNPs were more effective than Si-C at improving antioxidant activities and osmolytes formation. A strong negative correlation between the antioxidant activities and the lipid peroxidation rate was observed in the SiNP-treated plants under hypoxia stress. The SiNPs also regulated nutrient uptake by increasing the K, N, P, and Zn concentrations while decreasing Fe and Mn concentrations to a less toxic level. Blueberry plants treated with SiNPs responded more effectively to hypoxia stress by maintaining higher antioxidant and osmoprotectant concentrations than blueberry plants treated with Si-C. Additionally, the foliar and rootzone applications yielded better results than the foliar applications only.

Gazing inside a giant-hail-bearing Mediterranean supercell by dual-polarization Doppler weather radar	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Weather radar; Mediterranean supercell; Doppler analysis; Dual polarization analysis	X-BAND; POLARIMETRIC SIGNATURES; FLANK DOWNDRAFTS; Z(DR) COLUMNS; THUNDERSTORM; MOBILE; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; MESOSCALE; ALGORITHM	Ongoing climate change is considered to be responsible for the intensification and increased frequency of extreme weather events. The Mediterranean basin is not exempted by such modification processes as testified by the recent increase in the number of severe convective storm and mesocyclones. In recent years this kind of events caused many victims and damages in the such area, due to its geomorphological configuration and to the massive urban development of the last decades. Due to their local-scale nature Mediterranean extreme events can hardly be forecast with the use of numerical weather prediction systems and cannot adequately observed by using satellite platforms. These methods are not as straightforward as those based on radar observations because their spatial-temporal resolution is not necessarily adequate to resolve exceptional atmospheric phenomena as a weather radar can indeed offer. This article uses weather radar observations of an exceptional Mediterranean hail-bearing supercell that hit the central-eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea on 10 July 2019 causing flash flood and giant hail. Two operational dual-polarization Doppler C-band radars, managed by the Civil Protection Department of Italy, were able to observe, in an operational framework, the genesis and the evolution of the supercell, allowing for a detailed analysis of the event. Exploiting the unique time-resolved high-resolution threedimensional available measurements, the combined use of a wind-field retrieval scheme and the interpretation of the dual-polarization radar observed features reveals some unique microphysical processes, rarely documented through radar observations at the Mediterranean latitudes. Results of this work improve the understanding of mechanisms and processes of giant hail formation and it is crucial to improve the nowcasting and forecasting skill for the early detection of hazardous meteorological events.

On an overgrazed floodplain in north-western Australia, a native rodent (Pale Field Rat, Rattus tunneyi) constructs its burrows primarily beneath an invasive tree (Chinee Apple, Ziziphus mauritiana) rather than native trees. The dense thorny foliage of the Chinee Apple may allow high rat densities either because of abiotic effects (shade, in a very hot environment) or biotic processes (protection from trampling and soil compaction by feral horses, and/or predation). To distinguish between these hypotheses, we manipulated Chinee Apple foliage to modify biotic factors (access to horses and predators) but not shade levels. We surveyed the rat population with Elliott traps under treatment and control trees and in the open woodland, in two seasons (the breeding season-January, and the nesting season-May). In the breeding season, we ran giving-up density experiments (GUD) with food trays, to assess the perceived risk of predation by rats across our three treatments. Selective trimming of foliage did not affect thermal regimes underneath the trees but did allow ingress of horses and we observed two collapsed burrows as a consequence (although long term impacts of horses were not measured). The perceived predation risk also increased (GUD values at food trays increased) and was highest in the open woodland. Our manipulation resulted in a shift in rat sex ratios (indicating female preference for breeding under control but not foliage-trimmed trees) and influenced rat behaviour (giving-up densities increased; large dominant males inhabited the control but not treatment trees). Our data suggest that the primary benefit of the Chinee Apple tree to native rodents lies in physical protection from predators and (potentially) feral horses, rather than in providing cooler microhabitat.

Beaver dams: How structure, flow state, and landscape setting regulate water storage and release	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Castor; Ecohydrology; Green infrastructure; Stream hydrology; Rocky Mountains	CASTOR-CANADENSIS; STREAMS; CLIMATE; PONDS; CLASSIFICATION; WETLANDS; FAILURE; BASIN	Beaver (Castor canadensis and Castor fiber) are regarded widely as ecosystem engineers and the dams they create are well-known for their ability to drastically alter the hydrology of rivers. As a result, beaver are increasingly being included in green infrastructure practices to combat the effects of climate change and enhance ecosystem resilience. Both drought and flood mitigation capabilities have been observed in watersheds with beaver dam structures; however, how dams possess contrasting mitigation abilities is not fully understood since most studies neglect to acknowledge variation in beaver dam structures. In this study, an extensive cross-site survey of the physical and hydrologic properties of beaver dams was conducted in the Canadian Rocky Mountains in Alberta. This research aimed to improve the understanding of the hydrology of beaver dams by categorizing dams using their intrinsic properties and landscape settings to identify fundamental patterns that may be applicable across landscape types. The dam flow type classification from Woo and Waddington (1990) was evaluated in this new context and adapted to include two new flow types. The survey of intrinsic beaver dam properties revealed significant differences in dam structure across different sites. Physical differences in dam structure altered the dynamics and variance of pond storage and certain dam attributes related to the landscape setting. For instance, dam material influenced dam height and water source influenced dam length. However, a closer analysis of large rain events showed that the physical structure of dams alters seasonal dynamics of pond storage but not the response to rain events. Overall, this research shows that beaver dams can be both structurally and hydrologically very different from each other. Establishing broadly applicable classifications is vital to understanding the ecosystem resilience and mitigation services beaver dams provide. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detection of changes in the characteristics of the rainfall events that can be regarded as triggering factor is therefore of primary importance for policy-makers, practitioners, civil protection units and others. This study evaluated changes in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events above selected empirical rainfall thresholds at the pan-European level. For areas classified as at least moderately susceptible to landslides according to the ELSUS v2 map (i.e. around 1.8 * 10(6) km(2); around 37% of the area), changes were evaluated for the 1961-2018 period. The regional rainfall reanalysis data was used as input. Four different empirical rainfall thresholds were selected and changes in the frequency of rainfall events above the thresholds and their characteristics were analysed. The results showed that, on average, 14% more rainfall events above the threshold were recorded in the 1991-2018 period compared to 1961-1990 at the European level according to the selected empirical rainfall threshold. Moreover, several regions were found where frequency and intensity of rainfall events above the four selected global empirical rainfall thresholds were positive and statistically significant. These regions were for example Italy, Carpathian Mountains, British Isles and some other parts of Europe. Some of these areas are also regions where landslides susceptibility is high or even very high and where multiple landslides were recorded in the past. On the other hand, there are also regions where frequency and intensity of events above the threshold were negative and statistically significant. These regions were parts of Central Europe, Alps and Pyrenees. Also, in these regions landslides frequently occur. According to different empirical thresholds, no significant change in the frequency of rainfall events above the thresholds could be detected for around 50% of the investigated area.

UVB radiation sensitivity varies extensively in Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) and African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud. and Oryza barthii A. Chev.) cultivars, and the activity of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase that repairs UVB-induced CPD is an essential factor underlying UVB sensitivity in rice. Unlike Asian varieties, African rice possesses different origins, and it is cultivated in the African continent under environmental stresses and unstable climatic conditions and is well-adapted to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, information regarding UVB sensitivity in African rice remains lacking. In this review, we describe recent research examining the sensitivity of rice species to UVB radiation, and we focus on UVB sensitivity and CPD photolyase genotypes with emphasis on African rice species. Consequently, the novel CPD photolyase genotype found only in African rice species results in a more severe phenotype termed "Super-hypersensitive" in cultivars grown only in West Africa, particularly at O. glaberrima domestication centres. We also describe possible reasons for the high UVB sensitivity of African rice cultivars in relation to plant morphology and other environmental stresses such as floods and pathogens. Finally, using the available knowledge, we suggest possible ways to develop multiple stress-resistant plants that can cope well in tropical environments under numerous environmental stresses. This review provides more tools for increasing food production for feeding the outgrowing population, particularly in tropical areas such as Africa.

J	Anni, AH; Cohen, S; Praskievicz, S				Anni, Afrin Hossain; Cohen, Sagy; Praskievicz, Sarah			Sensitivity of urban flood simulations to stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Urban; Flooding; Hydraulic; Modeling; Stormwater infrastructure; Soil infiltration	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; DRAINAGE; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; SYSTEM	Flooding from intense rainfall is a major hazard in many urban areas. One of the major challenges in urban flood simulations is lack of data about the location and properties of stormwater infrastructure and land cover. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of urban flood simulations to inputs of stormwater infrastructure and soil characteristics. We use a 2D hydrodynamic model (MIKE URBAN) to simulate flood events on the University of Alabama (UA) campus in Tuscaloosa U.S.A. Infiltration rate, soil moisture, and soil texture were measured in the field. Soil texture was found to be homogeneous across campus (sandy loam) but with a high degree of spatial and temporal variation in infiltration rate and soil moisture. Comparison between different storm event return periods (10, 25, 50, and 100 years) shows that the same flooding hotspots are persistent but with considerable variation in water depth and flood extent. To investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to stormwater infrastructure, simulations without the stormwater infrastructure input were conducted. The results show that stormwater infrastructure decreases flooding volume of RP 10, 25, 50, and 100 by factors of 20, 14, 12, and 8, respectively. This shows that urban flood simulation is highly sensitive to the inclusion of stormwater infrastructure, though with decreasing relative impact for larger events. To investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to soil characteristics, four land-cover simulations (actual, uniform, entirely pervious, entirely impervious) were compared. The results show flood simulation predictions are sensitive to both the value and spatial explicitness of the soil input data. We discuss challenges in urban flood simulation and their potential solutions in the context of emerging frameworks for national and global hyper-resolution flood forecasting and analysis.

The record is composed of glacial/interglacial intervals estimated to span similar to 0.5 Ma (Marine Isotope Stages [MIS] 1-14). Nd versus Sr isotope data show two end member groups, further elaborated using Pb isotopes. Glacial data mostly point at North American sources with unradiogenic epsilon Nd and high Sr-87/Sr-86 values, including detrital carbonate (dolomite) layers originating from Paleozoic rocks eroded by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The opposite end member group including estimated MIS6 and MIS4 samples indicates the Siberian Large Igneous Province eroded by the Eurasian Ice Sheet as the major source, possibly with additional inputs from the East Siberian Ice Sheet. The limited evidence for Siberian Ice Sheet provenance may result from the predominant distribution of this glaciation on the continental shelf providing weak, fine-grained sediments. Glacial-time western Arctic circulation inferred from isotopic data is mostly similar to the modern Beaufort Gyre but was more streamlined toward the Fram Strait during some glacial events. Interglacial/major interstadial, presumably sea ice transported sediments, shows a mixture of North American and Siberian sources, consistent with historically observed variations in the Transpolar Drift versus Beaufort Gyre circulation. Isotope pattern in major interglacials (e.g., MIS5e, MIS11, and MIS 13) resembles the recent trend of increased sediment ice transport from the East Siberian/Chukchi Sea, possibly in relation to the ongoing Arctic warming.

Knowledge of the historical range of river adjustment can be used to develop an understanding of a river's 'expected' character and behaviour. Drawing upon the case study of Richmond River Catchment, New South Wales, Australia, we track the history of geomorphic river adjustment from the time of European colonisation in the mid-late nineteenth century. We use this study to develop an approach, called the 'Behavioural sensitivity logical tree' that can be applied to assess and quantify reach scale behavioural sensitivity, defined as the ease with which geomorphic units and associated water, sediment and vegetation interactions adjust within the expected behavioural regime. We use the results to categorise rivers as Fragile, Active sensitive, Passive sensitive, In-sensitive and Resistant. Fragile rivers have a behavioural sensitivity >75% and have the propensity to undergo wholesale river change such that a new river type and behavioural regime is created. Active sensitive rivers have a behavioural sensitivity ranging from 50%-75% and have the ability to re-configure within their contemporary behavioural regime. The behavioural sensitivity of Passive sensitive rivers lies between 20%-50%. These rivers have the ability to maintain their behavioural regime and withstand adjustment. Insensitive rivers have a behavioural sensitivity ranging from 5%-20%. They do not readily adjust and may contain significant antecedent elements that limit geomorphic adjustment. Resistant rivers have a behavioural sensitivity <5% and because of the imposed geological setting cannot readily adjust. We further discuss the evolutionary nature of behavioural sensitivity itself and how rivers can dynamically evolve and shift to a different sensitivity category over time in response to different forms of direct and indirect disturbances.

Nonstationary Based Framework for Performance Enhancement of Coastal Flood Mitigation Strategies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Flood adaption; Surge modeling; Nonstationary analysis; Coastal protection strategies; Copula theory; Design value	EXTREME-VALUE ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; MODEL; INFRASTRUCTURE; STATISTICS; RESISTANCE; RAINFALL; DESIGN; COPULA; SERIES	The flood protection topic has been the centerpiece of many studies due to the amplification of coastal vulnerabilities, especially on the east coast of the United States. In this study, increasing the reliability of the urban infrastructure has been addressed by a more accurate understanding of flood hazards and coastal protection strategies. The first step in this study is the hydrologic data analysis. Climate change and human activities have often caused an invalidation of stationarity assumption for simulation and forecasting flood hazards. Also, hydrological events often coincide with two or more natural events. Therefore, for a more accurate analysis, three approaches are introduced to assess the nonstationarity in data. Then, the nonstationary frequency analysis on a univariate distribution function and the joint probability distribution have been applied to define the frequency of flood hazards. First, a trade-off curve is plotted to contain all results of a nonstationary joint probability analysis that can be used to select the design value curve based on decision-makers' preferences. The second step is the selection of coastal protection strategies. Strategies are selected based on their suitability and the characteristics of the protected area. The final step is to utilize a hydrologic distribution model, with the ability to simulate both rainfall and storm surge for obtaining a flood inundation map in order to test the strategies. Although, this model has certain limitations of not including wave dynamics and setup and wind speed. It succeeds in the integration of hydrologic and systems analyses, which is the main advantage of the methodology. The results show the significant value of a nonstationary analysis for obtaining design values and selecting comprehensive coastal protection strategies. The proposed methodology can be implemented in other coastal geographic settings.

J	Jon, I				Jon, Ihnji			Deciphering posthumanism: Why and how it matters to urban planning in the Anthropocene	PLANNING THEORY			English	Article						Anthropocene; Bruno Latour; cities; climate change; disasters; feminist ecopolitics; material turn in planning; new materialism; political ecology; posthumanism	CHALLENGES; ADVOCACY	This article responds to the call for planning theorists to develop a posthumanist approach to planning, especially in the context of the Anthropocene or planetary environmental degradation. In the wake of often unexpected and brutal feedback from nature - frequent flooding, heat waves, tornadoes or cyclones - the positioning or conceptualisation of 'the environment' in planning has changed; rather than being discounted as an inanimate background that merely hosts human affairs, it is now considered an active agent that influences how we design and plan for a city. The posthumanist framing of the planning agenda is closely related to the previous 'material turn' in planning, which initially introduced 'distributive agency', where human agency or our willingness to act is activated only via our relation with non-human surroundings. 'More-than-human' approaches to planning, inspired by the new ecology movement that debunks the idea of human exceptionalism, attempt to extend that logic even further by proclaiming how we can critically reframe planning to develop more inclusive and ethical relationships with non-human species. As a continuation of this dialogue, I provide the philosophical background behind the recent rise of posthumanist or 'new materialist' ecopolitics and argue why and how they can offer important insights for planning theory and practice. I lay out specifically how planners would execute this 'posthumanist normativity' in their everyday planning practices, focusing on three lessons that could be directly applicable: (1) understanding environment politics as a mundane politics of representation - which eventually allows us to consider non-human species as social minorities, (2) learning to 'stay with the trouble' - recognising the webs of our material dependency on non-human critters that encourage us to cultivate 'response-ability' and (3) activating political mobilisation based on empirical experiences - thinking of immediate physical experiences and sensory values as major sources of environmental activism.

An 1800-year water-quality and vegetation record from Junction Park Billabong, Murray River, Australia: an assessment of European impacts and sensitivity to climate	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Diatom; Wetland; River regulation; Salinity; Climate; Holocene	SOUTH-EASTERN AUSTRALIA; DARLING BASIN; HOLOCENE PALEOENVIRONMENTS; DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES; FLOODPLAIN LAKE; VARIABILITY; VICTORIA; WETLANDS; BACILLARIOPHYCEAE; CALIBRATION	The Murray River is Australia's economically most important river system. As a result of its economic importance, land use change and river regulation have resulted in ecological degradation of the river and associated river wetlands (known throughout Australia as "billabongs"). Palaeolimnology can provide otherwise unobtainable information about the relative impacts of stressors and identify "refuges" from such impacts. We examine an approximately 1800 year history of water quality and vegetation at Junction Park Billabong, on the Murray River approximately 25 km upstream of the Murrumbidgee River confluence. Throughout this period the billabong has maintained a strong connection to the Murray River. Planktonic Aulacoseira granulata has been the dominant diatom in the Murray River, while surrounding vegetation has been dominated by open eucalpyt woodland. Around 500 years before present (BP), there was an increase in effective rainfall as indicated by a decline in Chenopodioideae (Amaranthaceae: saltbush) and an increase in Callitris (native pine) pollen. At the same time, there was an expansion in wetland submerged aquatic macrophytes, as evidenced through increases in the relative abundance of the epiphytic diatom, Cocconeis placentula and sediment organic matter. European settlement resulted in declines in aquatic macrophytes and nutrient enrichment but minimal increases in diatom-inferred salinity. There was relatively little post-settlement change in both the diatom stratigraphy and inferred water quality from Junction Park Billabong which contrasts somewhat with that observed in floodplain water bodies both upstream and downstream of Junction Park. The record from Junction Park Billabong highlights the sensitivity of floodplain wetlands to climate change and suggests that examination of these records can provide insights into late Holocene climate from a region where few high-resolution records from other sources exist.

Seasonal flood and drought conditions were simulated with the objective to evaluate their effect on the survival, growth (stem length and number of leaves), as well as biomass accumulation in Brosimum alicastrum and Psidium sartorianum seedlings from the tropical forest of Campeche, Mexico. Methods: A nursery experiment was established with a completely random design with three treatments (flooding, regular irrigation and drought). For each treatment 45 seedlings were used for each species. The survival, height and number of leaves of the seedlings were measured at the beginning of the experiment and at 30 days intervals until the experiment ended at 120 days. The seedlings were then harvested and the length of the roots and the biomass accumulation were measured. Key results: The flood decreased the survival of B. alicastrum and did not change the survival of P. sartorianum. Likewise, it limited the length of the stem, the number of leaves and the biomass accumulated in both species, except for the biomass in roots of P. sartorianum. The survival of the seedlings exposed to drought and regular irrigation were not altered and showed increases in growth and accumulated biomass. Conclusions: The responses of the species contributed to understand the role of the environmental filter in the establishment of arboreal species seedlings in the lowlands of Calakmul, Campeche. Seasonal flooding in the lowlands acts as an environmental filter because it eliminates B. alicastrum seedlings, while it predominates in areas with well-drained soils, such as the hills adjacent to the low floodplains. Psidium sartorianum was well adapted to the conditions of drought and flood, as observed in its natural habitat.

Wecombine our analysis, focusing on the global level, as well as on individual G20 countries, with the corresponding stylized RCP mitigation efforts in order to understand the implications of interactions across mitigation, adaptation and sea level rise on a macroeconomic level. Our global results indicate that until the middle of this century, differences in macroeconomic impacts between the two climatic scenarios are small, but increase substantially towards the end of the century. Moreover, direct economic impacts can be partially absorbed by substitution effects in production processes and via international trade effects until 2050. By 2100 however, we find that this dynamic no longer holds and economy-wide effects become even larger than direct impacts. The disturbances of mitigation efforts to the overall economy may in some regions and for some scenarios lead to a counterintuitive result, namely to GDP losses that are higher in RCP26 than in RCP45, despite higher direct coastal damages in the latter scenario. Within the G20, our results indicate that China, India and Canada will experience the highest macroeconomic impacts, in line with the respective direct climatic impacts, with the two first large economies undertaking the highest mitigation efforts in a cost-efficient global climate action. A sensitivity analysis of varying socioeconomic assumptions highlights the role of climate-resilient development as a crucial complement to mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Dependence Between Extreme Rainfall Events and the Seasonality and Bivariate Properties of Floods. A Continuous Distributed Physically-Based Approach	WATER			English	Article						stochastic weather generation; AWE-GEN; distributed hydrological model; tRIBS; storm identification; bivariate flood frequency curve	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITIES; LARGE DAMS; SIMULATION; MODEL; BASIN; IDENTIFICATION; GENERATION; ABATEMENT	This paper focuses on proposing the minimum number of storms necessary to derive the extreme flood hydrographs accurately through event-based modelling. To do so, we analyzed the results obtained by coupling a continuous stochastic weather generator (the Advanced WEather GENerator) with a continuous distributed physically-based hydrological model (the TIN-based real-time integrated basin simulator), and by simulating 5000 years of hourly flow at the basin outlet. We modelled the outflows in a basin named Peacheater Creek located in Oklahoma, USA. Afterwards, we separated the independent rainfall events within the 5000 years of hourly weather forcing, and obtained the flood event associated to each storm from the continuous hourly flow. We ranked all the rainfall events within each year according to three criteria: Total depth, maximum intensity, and total duration. Finally, we compared the flood events obtained from the continuous simulation to those considering the N highest storm events per year according to the three criteria and by focusing on four different aspects: Magnitude and recurrence of the maximum annual peak-flow and volume, seasonality of floods, dependence among maximum peak-flows and volumes, and bivariate return periods. The main results are: (a) Considering the five largest total depth storms per year generates the maximum annual peak-flow and volume, with a probability of 94% and 99%, respectively and, for return periods higher than 50 years, the probability increases to 99% in both cases; (b) considering the five largest total depth storms per year the seasonality of flood is reproduced with an error of less than 4% and (c) bivariate properties between the peak-flow and volume are preserved, with an error on the estimation of the copula fitted of less than 2%.

Long-term streamflow trends in Hawai'i and implications for native stream fauna	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						goby; Hawai'i; intermittent streams; Mann-Kendall; running trend analysis; streamflow trends	CLIMATE-DRIVEN CHANGES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; RAINFALL; ISLANDS; ELEVATION; PATTERNS; FUTURE; FLOWS; DISTRIBUTIONS; DISTURBANCES	Climate change has fundamentally altered the water cycle in tropical islands, which is a critical driver of freshwater ecosystems. To examine how changes in streamflow regime have impacted habitat quality for native migratory aquatic species, we present a 50-year (1967-2016) analysis of hydrologic records in 23 unregulated streams across the five largest Hawaiian Islands. For each stream, flow was separated into direct run-off and baseflow and high- and low-flow statistics (i.e., Q10 and Q90) with ecologically important hydrologic indices (e.g., frequency of flooding and low flow duration) derived. Using Mann-Kendall tests with a running trend analysis, we determined the persistence of streamflow trends through time. We analysed native stream fauna from similar to 400 sites, sampled from 1992 to 2007, to assess species richness among islands and streams. Declines in streamflow metrics indicated a general drying across the islands. In particular, significant declines in low flow conditions (baseflows), were experienced in 57% of streams, compared with a significant decline in storm flow conditions for 22% of streams. The running trend analysis indicated that many of the significant downward trends were not persistent through time but were only significant if recent decades (1987-2016) were included, with an average decline in baseflow and run-off of 10.90% and 8.28% per decade, respectively. Streams that supported higher native species diversity were associated with moderate discharge and baseflow index, short duration of low flows, and negligible downward trends in flow. A significant decline in dry season flows (May-October) has led to an increase in the number of no-flow days in drier areas, indicating that more streams may become intermittent, which has important implications for mauka to makai (mountain to ocean) hydrological connectivity and management of Hawai'i's native migratory freshwater fauna.

Effects of sediment transport on flood hazards: Lessons learned and remaining challenges	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Flood hazards; Flood risk; Sediment transport; Fluvial geomorphology	LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEBRIS-FLOW; BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; FLUVIAL GEOMORPHOLOGY; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CHANNEL CHANGE; FLASH FLOODS; LAND-USE; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT	Sediment transport (bedload and suspension) plays a relevant role in the morphological response of river channels to large floods. Sediment load controls erosion and aggradation patterns during high flows, drives the migration of macroforms and contributes to the definition of thresholds for bank erosion and channel instability. Given this influence on channel morphology, it is clear that sediment transport influences both the channel geometry and water stage reached during floods and should therefore be considered in flood hazard analysis. So far, however, legislation on flood hazard and flood management plans still continues to typically disregard sediment transport. This is due mainly to the paucity of available data on sediment transport and the lack of standardized approaches for its integration into flood hazard analysis. The present work, which aims to provide some guidance on how to advance in this issue, has undertaken a bibliometric study and thorough review of the published scientific literature that had previously addressed the implications of sediment transport on flood hazards assessment. This review showed that: i) most studies on the influence of sediment transport on flood risk have focused on mountain streams, as they are highly sensitive systems to changes in sediment supply; ii) research has also focused on explaining historical changes in channel-conveyance capacity and flood frequency based on long-term trends in sediment supply; and iii) recent developments in hydrodynamic and morphodynamic numerical models provide opportunities to explicitly incorporate sediment transport in flood hazard analysis. However, despite the recent advances, we have identified important challenges and discussed needs to better consider sediment transport in flood hazards at different spatial and temporal scales.

This study explored the spatio-temporal variations of DFD risks in China from the past (2000-2020) to future (2020-2100) based on the natural and socio-economic datasets. The main findings include: (1) The spatial pattern of disaster vulnerability decreased from 2000 to 2100. The overall vulnerability distribution showed a spatial pattern of high east and low west, and its eastern distribution presented high north and low south. (2) The drought hazard danger degree showed a trend of de-creasing first and then increasing with obvious spatial heterogeneity. The flood hazard danger degree had a decreasing spatial distribution from southeast to northwest, with an overall gradually increasing trend. (3) The DFD risks showed a spatial pattern of high east and low west, and were more closely related to disaster vulnerability. Overall, the flood and drought risks had good consistency at the highest level (VI), mainly distributed in the North China Plain, Northeast Plain, eastern Sichuan, and southern Guangdong. This level means that the most severe damage to life and property will occur in these regions. (4) The DFD showed the direction of "north(east)-south (west)", and the main axis of the ellipse moved north eventually. The DFD hot spots were mainly distributed in North China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The DFD cold spots were mainly distributed in the southwest, Qinghai-Tibet region, and Gansu province.

Accurate rainstorm and waterlogging simulation is of significant value for disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper proposed a numerical model for urban rainstorm and waterlogging based on the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and Geographic Information System (GIS), and the model was applied in Lianhu district of Xi'an city of China. Furthermore, the effects of rainfall characteristics, pipe network implementation level and urbanization level on waterlogging were explored from the perspectives of spatial distribution of waterlogging points, drainage capacity of pipe network and surface runoff generation and confluence. The results show that: (1) with the increase of rainfall recurrence period, the peak of total water accumulating volume, the average decline rate of water accumulating volume and the number of waterlogging nodes increase; (2) optimizing the pipe diameter can shorten the average overload time of the pipe network from the entire pipe network, but for a single pipe, optimizing the pipe diameter may lead to overloading of unoptimized downstream pipeline; (3) the lower the imperviousness, the less the number of waterlogging nodes and average time of water accumulating, and (4) the west, northwest and southwest areas are relatively affected by the imperviousness, only improving the underlying surface conditions has limited influence on waterlogging in the study area. This study can provide reference for urban waterlogging prevention and reduction and pipe network reconstruction.

Beyond a 'just add water' perspective: environmental water management for vegetation outcomes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptive management; Decision making; Environmental flows; Floodplain; Murray-darling basin; Wetland plants	SOIL SEED BANK; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; RIPARIAN; WETLAND; FLOWS; BIODIVERSITY; SCIENCE; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION	Practitioners of environmental water management (EWM) operate within complex social-ecological systems. We sought to better understand this complexity by investigating the management of environmental water for vegetation outcomes. We conducted an online survey to determine practitioners' perspectives on EWM for non woody vegetation (NWV) in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia with regards to: i) desirable outcomes and benefits; ii) influencing factors and risks; iii) challenges of monitoring and evaluation, and iv) improving outcomes.Survey participants indicated that EWM aims to achieve outcomes by improving or maintaining vegetation attributes and the functions and values these provide. Our study reveals that EWM practitioners perceive NWV management in a holistic and highly interconnected way. Numerous influencing factors as well as risks and challenges to achieving outcomes were identified by participants, including many unrelated to water.Survey responses highlighted six areas to improve EWM for NWV outcomes: (1) flow regimes, (2) vegetation attributes, (3) non-flow drivers, (4) management-governance considerations, (5) functions and values, and (6) monitoring, evaluation and research. These suggest a need for more than 'just water' when it comes to the restoration and management of NWV. Our findings indicate more integrated land-water governance and management is urgently required to address the impacts of non-flow drivers such as pest species, land-use change and climate change. The results also indicate that inherent complexity in EWM for ecological outcomes has been poorly addressed, with a need to tackle social-ecological constraints to improve EWM outcomes.

Overrepresentation of Historically Underserved and Socially Vulnerable Communities Behind Levees in the United States	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						infrastructure equity; levees; flood risk; historically underserved and socially vulnerable communities (HUSVCs)	HAZARDS	Infrastructure equity is an immediate concern with levees, constituting the backbone of the U.S. protection against flooding. Flooding patterns are exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change in several regions, posing a significant risk to the economy, safety, and well-being of the nation. The evolving risk of flooding is shown to disproportionately affect historically underserved and socially vulnerable communities (HUSVCs). Here we compare the sociodemographic and socioeconomic composition of leveed and non-leveed U.S. communities and show a substantial overrepresentation of HUSVCs in leveed areas at the state, regional, and national levels. Further, we analyze the proportion of communities designated as "disadvantaged" in leveed versus non-leveed areas, revealing a substantially larger population of disadvantaged communities residing behind levees. Our analyses show that nationally, Hispanic are the most overrepresented population in leveed areas yielding a disparity percentage of 39.9%, followed by Native American (18.7%), Asian (17.7%), and Black (16.1%) communities. Communities characterized by low education, poverty, and disability exhibit a disproportionately higher presentation of 27.8%, 20.4%, and 5.4% in leveed areas across the U.S. In 43 states, disadvantaged communities are overrepresented behind levees, with a national disparity percentage of 40.6%. At the regional level, the highest disparity was observed in the Northeast (57.3%), followed by the West (51.3%), Southeast (38%), Midwest (29.2%), and Southwest (25%). The findings can enable decision- and policy-makers to identify hotspots within HUSVCs that need to be prioritized for enhancing the integrity and climate adaptation of their levee systems.

These events can cause widespread destruction and can lead to long-term socio-economic disruption often affecting the most vulnerable populations in society. Computational modeling provides an essential tool to estimate the damage by incorporating spatial uncertainties and examining global risk assessments. Classical stationary models in spatial statistics often assume isotropy and stationarity. It causes inappropriate smoothing over features having boundaries, holes, or physical barriers. Despite this, nonstationary models like barrier model have been little explored in the context of natural disasters in complex land structures. The principal objective of the current study is to evaluate the influence of barrier models compared to classical stationary models by analysing the incidence of natural disasters in complex spatial regions like islands and coastal areas. In the current study, we have used tsunami records from the island nation of Maldives. For seven atoll groups considered in our study, we have implemented three distinct categories of stochastic partial differential equation meshes, two for stationary models and one that corresponds to the barrier model concept. The results show that when assessing the spatial variance of tsunami incidence at the atoll scale, the barrier model outperforms the other two models while maintaining the same computational cost as the stationary models. In the broader picture, this research work contributes to the relatively new field of nonstationary barrier models and intends to establish a robust modeling framework to explore spatial phenomena, particularly natural hazards, in complex spatial regions having physical barriers.

We applied the SWAT+ model in the Uruguay River Basin, an international river basin in South America with a total surface area of 370,000 km2, in order to (1) assess the water balance components, (2) represent their spatial distribution, and (3) examine their changes over time. The catchment was divided into uplands and floodplains and a decision table rule was developed based on streamflow data. The SPOTPY Python library was linked to SWAT+ and used as a tool to perform sensitivity analyses and calibration. The model represented the fluctuations of discharge well, although there was a general tendency to underestimate peak flows. Blue (precipitation and runoff) and green (evapotranspiration and soil water content) hydrological components were spatially plotted. Overall, SWAT+ simulated a realistic spatial distribution of the water cycle components. A seasonal Mann-Kendall test suggests a positive increasing trend in the average temperature (p-value = 0.007; Sen's slope = 0.09), the soil water content (p-value = 0.02; Sen's slope = 1.29), and evapotranspiration (p-value: 0.03; Sen's slope = 1.97), indicating that the ecosystem experienced a changing climate during the simulation period. The findings presented in this study are of significant value for the impacts of sustainable management and the evaluation of climate change on water resources in the Uruguay River Basin.

Factors influencing flood risk mitigation after wildfire: Insights for individual and collective action after the 2010 Schultz Fire	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Wildfire; Post-fire flooding; Collective action; Risk mitigation; Mixed-mode survey; Cross-jurisdictional management	WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE; NONRESPONSE BIAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY; US; HOMEOWNERS; BEHAVIOR; ARIZONA; OPPORTUNITIES; PREPAREDNESS	Post-fire flooding is of significant concern in the U.S. Southwest, where burned areas can drastically alter local hydrology to increase the risk of floods and debris flows, posing new and dynamic flood risk to communities downslope that necessitate coordinated response across jurisdictional boundaries. However, limited research explores how residents in affected communities respond to post-fire flood risk, both individually and collectively. We address this need by exploring factors that may influence the uptake of individual and collective actions for postfire flood mitigation after an extreme fire event. We conducted a mixed-mode survey of 1,804 households in Flagstaff, Arizona, within the 100-year modeled post-fire flood risk area created by the Schultz Fire in 2010. We received 407 completed questionnaires for a 22.6% response rate. Survey questions focused on mitigation actions, addressing community flood risk, and responsibility for post-fire management among other topics. We found that respondents most readily engage in temporary mitigation actions, such as sandbag placement, that require less time and lower financial commitment. Respondent mitigation actions were primarily influenced by their personal flood experience and risk perceptions, with concerns about longevity of flood risk prioritized above current risk levels. Those who participated in individual actions were more likely to participate in collective action and vice versa, indicating a close relationship between mitigation actions across scales. We provide implications for practitioners working in post-fire environments, with a focus on communication and outreach about flood risk that motivate resident action to facilitate shared responsibility and cross-jurisdictional management of post-fire flood risk.

A synthesis based on the perspective of a half-century (1971-2020) flood outlook	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Review						Flood loss scenario; Nepal; Spatial mapping; Flood risk management; River basin	RIVER-BASIN; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	One of the most common and severe natural hazards, flood has been intensified by anthropogenic climate change in many mountain regions affecting socioeconomic conditions during the twenty-first century. The study synthesized the past 50 years (1971-2020) flood loss data; then generated district-wise flood loss spatial maps and explored flood loss mitigation gaps in diverse topography of Nepal Himalaya through literature reviews. Over the past 50 years, on an average, all disasters together caused two deaths per day while more than 300 families got affected daily in Nepal. The proportion of flood disaster alone found 11.43% flood occurrences, 9.33% fatalities, 38.42% missing, 0.75% injury, 61.60% family suffering, and 10.16% property damages. Compared to the 1970s, the number of flood occurrence has increased to more than six folds causing four times human fatalities in the post 2000s. While acknowledging the population growth, the flood loss still shows increasing trend, but the incremental rate is found reduced to almost half. District-wise flood loss spatial maps depict the highest number of flood occurrences in Jhapa while Sarlahi, Surkhet, Chitwan, Mahottari, Sunsari, and Bardiya districts experienced the highest number of peoples' fatalities, missing, injuries, family suffering, fully and partially damages of privately-owned houses, respectively. Although proactive legislations are promulgated, our study found no subsequent reduction in flood loss arguing no progression in holistic flood risk management in Nepal. Our synthesis and identified research gaps highlight the urgent need for adopting evidence-based basin-scale approach to develop effective and sustainable flood mitigation measures.

One key finding is that while temperature and rainfall are essential drivers of tree growth in tropical regions, the specific effects of these factors can vary widely depending on local conditions. For example, in some areas, increased rainfall may lead to higher rates of wood formation, while in others, it may have little effect or even be detrimental to tree growth. Another key finding is that tree species can exhibit different cambium activity and wood formation patterns, even within the same region. These observations highlight the need for careful species-level studies to understand the factors influencing tree growth in tropical regions fully. Some studies have also found that extreme events, such as droughts and floods, can significantly impact tree growth and wood formation in tropical regions. These events can lead to cambium activity and wood density changes and may have long-term effects on forest structure and composition. Overall, this review suggests that much is still to be learned about the complex interactions between climate, soil, and other environmental factors that influence tree growth and wood formation in tropical and subtropical regions. Continued research and monitoring efforts will be essential for understanding these important ecosystems and developing effective conservation and management strategies.

Rooftop water harvesting for managed aquifer recharge and flood mitigation in tropical cities: Towards a strategy of co-benefit evaluations in Joa∼o Pessoa, northeast Brazil	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flood control; Groundwater; Injection well; Stormwater management; Urban drainage; Aquifer storage and recovery	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; SEMIARID REGION; RAINWATER; CLIMATE; GROUNDWATER; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; SYSTEMS; RUNOFF; LEVEL	Intense urbanisation in many coastal areas has led to intensification of groundwater consumption, while reducing permeable areas and increasing the frequency and magnitude of flooding. Among the potential strategies to compensate for these adverse effects, which are expected to become worse as a result of climate change, rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH) in combination with managed aquifer recharge (MAR), may be indicated. This work investigated the performance of different configurations of such a system, tested as a twofold sustainable stormwater and domestic water management tool in a tropical metropole (Joa similar to o Pessoa, Brazil). This area located over a sedimentary aquifer system illustrates the water security challenges of densely urbanised areas in southern cities. To that end, several configurations of rooftop catchments and storage volumes were evaluated, by simulating a MAR-RWH system connected to the regional unconfined aquifer (Barreiras Formation) through a 6 '' diameter injection well. Rainfall-runoff-recharge processes and water balances were simulated using monitored high-temporal resolution rainfall data. The results showed that catchments ranging from 180 to 810 m2, connected to tanks from 0.5 to 30.0 m3, are the optimal solutions in terms of efficient rainwater retention and peak flow reduction. These solutions provided mean annual estimates of aquifer recharge between 57 and 255 m3/yr from 2004 to 2019. The results of this study highlight the opportunity for MAR schemes to reconcile stormwater management and water supply goals.	[Baptista, Victor S. G.; Bertrand, Guillaume F.; da Silva, Gustavo B.

In recent years, along with flood, this very heavy rainfall often causes landslides in the hilly regions of Bangladesh, which is now an emerging concern of Bangladesh disaster's management authority. Landslide incidence happened on 28th July of 2021 at Chattogram Hill Tracts region after consecutive days of very heavy rainfall. Rainfall peak is observed before the day of the LPS. Hence, the aim of the present study was to reveal the atmospheric conditions which results in very heavy rainfall before the day of LPS genesis. In this study, WRF model of version 4.3.1 is used to simulate the atmospheric condition responsible for very heavy rainfall before the day of LPS. The present study found that the WRF model is good enough to simulate the LPS in advance for the Bay of Bengal region. On the day before LPS, moisture-laden strong low-level westerly dynamically facilitate the updraft by hitting the north-south elongated coastal mountains of Chattogram. The strong updraft supplied the abundant moisture to the mid-level of the atmosphere resulted in very heavy rainfall over Chattogram. The findings of this study will improve the understanding on the rainfall forecasting due to LPS over Bangladesh. Moreover, the vertical extension of the LPS was found higher than the usual which would be a matter of interest for the global scientific community to work on the impact of climate change on the characteristic features of the LPS.

Nonlinear response of N<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub> emissions to increasing soil nitrate availability in a tropical sugarcane soil	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Denitrification; Climate change; N2O priming; N2O from nitrification; N2O from denitrification	MEASURING DENITRIFICATION; RESIDUE RETENTION; FERTILIZER; UREA; QUANTIFICATION; REDUCTION; RECOVERY; NITROGEN; CARBON; N-15	PurposeThe reduction of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to dinitrogen (N-2) via denitrification and N2O source partitioning between nitrification and denitrification remain major uncertainties in sugarcane systems. We therefore investigated magnitude and product stoichiometry of denitrification and production pathways of N2O from a tropical sugarcane soil in response to increasing soil nitrate (NO3-) availability.MethodsMicrocosms were established using a tropical sugarcane soil (Qld, Australia) and emissions of N2O and N-2 were measured following fertilisation with (NO3-)-N-15-N equivalent to 25, 50 and 100 mu g N g(-1) soil, simulating soil NO3- contents previously observed in situ, and mimicking flood irrigation by wetting the soil close to saturation.ResultsCumulative N2O emissions increased exponentially with NO3- availability, while cumulative N-2 emissions followed an exponential increase to maximum. Average daily N-2 emissions exceeded 5 mu g N-2-N g soil(-1) and accounted for > 99% of denitrification. The response of N2O suggests preferential NO3- reduction with increasing NO3- availability, increasing N2O even when NO3- levels had only a diminishing effect on the overall denitrification rate. The fraction of N2O emitted from denitrification increased with NO3- availability, and was a function of soil water, NO3- and heterotrophic soil respiration.ConclusionsOur findings show the exponential increase of N2O driven by excess NO3-, even though the complete reduction to N-2 dominated denitrification. The low N2O/(N2O + N-2) product ratio questions the use of N2O as proxy for overall denitrification rates, highlighting the need for in-situ N-2 measurements to account for denitrification losses from sugarcane systems.

There are indications that grasslands and savanna are being lost to woody encroachment across the ecoregion. A significant fraction of plant and animal taxa are endemic to grasslands, so the decline of grasslands is likely to impact biodiversity and ecosystem function. We assessed large-scale vegetation changes to Terai habitats over three decades (1989-2019) and quantified the role of environmental factors in driving the observed changes. Selecting eight large protected wildlife habitats (four each from India and Nepal), we performed su-pervised vegetation classification for three-time points. We then quantified grassland-woodland transitions and used Bayesian Conditional Autoregressive spatial models to test the influence of climatic, environmental, and anthropogenic factors on observed changes. Including the protected sites with substantial grassland areas, we found that the total extent of grasslands was 1417 km2 (28 % of total area) in 1988-1989, which declined by 34.4 % to 923 km2 in three decades, while woodland area increased by 8,7% from 3235 km2 to 3516 km2. Grasslands were also converted to cropland or inundated by flooding, but to a lesser extent. Dry season grass fire had the strongest influence on grassland persistence, followed by anthropogenic impacts. However, the eight sites differed with respect to the nature and extent of the changes in vegetation transitions, perhaps reflecting site differences in climatic conditions and anthropogenic influence.

Overall, Turkey's monthly precipitation declined over the last five decades. While decreasing precipitation trends were dominant in the wet season, consistently increasing trends prevailed in the dry season. The monthly monotonic trends were marked by larger downward trends, especially in early winter and spring. The trend magnitudes in annual and wet season precipitation decreased from north to south and west to east, reaching a maximum value of 7.5 mm/year increase in the eastern Black Sea. The magnitude of dry season trends was much smaller but consistent across the country, varying by 1-5 mm/year. Monthly changes in the trend magnitudes varied between - 2.2 and 3.4 mm, reflecting both decrease and increase, respectively. The magnitude of the downward precipitation trends was higher in inland regions than in other regions. Spatial patterns in the trends evidenced that wet season precipitation variability largely governs annual precipitation variability. The wavelet spectrum indicated a strong annual signal for the monthly precipitation. The inland regions experienced the periodicity of wet years at much longer durations. An average 8-year periodicity was dominant for the annual precipitation, underlining its inter-annual variability and coincided well with the NAO spectrum. Assuming the identified trends persist in the future, a further increase in the magnitude of precipitation trends in coastal areas can enhance the flood risk. However, the precipitation decreases during the wet season are bound to have adverse consequences on sectoral-dependent water availability.

Many studies have investigated their possible variations under the effects of climate changes, while their intraseasonal-to-seasonal characteristics have received less attention. Based on observation-constrained monthly soil moisture (SM) datasets since 1980, we analysed the spatiotemporal characteristics of global SM at the intraseasonal-to-seasonal time scales and the associated influencing factors. The results were then used to evaluate the performance of simulations by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. It is found that the frequencies of extreme wet events are slightly higher than those of extreme dry events, but their spatial distributions are similar and are both affected by precipitation variability. Extreme events tend to have longer durations than nonextreme events, and their global mean durations are 4-5 months. Globally, dry events persist longer than wet events. Maximum SM anomalies are strongly affected by earlier precipitation and this effect is stronger in a transitional climate. The onset and peak times of SM anomalies in a year occur most frequently near the peak time of precipitation rather than that of SM. Approximately half of CMIP6 models overestimate the durations of both dry and wet events and approximately one third of models only underestimate wet events durations. Different versions of the same model produce similar event durations. The findings of this study enhance understanding of the intraseasonal-to-seasonal variabilities of global droughts and floods and could provide guidance for future study of land-atmosphere interactions and prediction of extreme events.

Effectively, urbanisation is steadily contributing to increasing impervious areas and reducing the time-to-peak. The effect of nature based solutions (NBSs) on mitigating these phenomena is recognised. Nevertheless, these kinds of sustainable infrastructures are still barely known and scarcely adopted in many parts of European Countries. The LIFE BEWARE project aims to enhance hydraulic safety and spread good practices in rainwater management by promoting and facilitating the adoption of NBSs in the Altovicentino area (Northern Vicenza Province, Veneto Region, Italy). To support the dissemination activities, some full-scale NBSs have been created within the municipality areas involved in the project. The hydrological impact of the structures is continuously monitored thanks to the installation of devices measuring inlet and outlet runoff and rainfall patterns. This study aims to analyse the monitoring data of the first two years of the built NBSs. Results show that the structures managed almost all the water runoff through processes of infiltration and retention, providing additional insights into understanding the real behaviour of NBSs exposed to the specific environmental conditions of a very rainy foothills area. In particular, mean rain intensity and rainfall duration are the variables that mostly affected the structure performance, especially for events prolonged over time (2-3 days) with mean rainfall intensity in the range of 2-3 mm/h. Therefore, the overall outcomes from this analysis were useful for improving the design of NBSs and further promoting their installation in urban areas.

J	Sangsefidi, Y; Bagheri, K; Davani, H; Merrifield, M				Sangsefidi, Yousef; Bagheri, Kian; Davani, Hassan; Merrifield, Mark			Data analysis and integrated modeling of compound flooding impacts on coastal drainage infrastructure under a changing climate	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Sea -level rise; Coastal areas; Compound flooding; Groundwater infiltration; Stormdrain system	SEA-LEVEL RISE; GROUNDWATER INFILTRATION; INUNDATION; CALIFORNIA; TIDES	Low-lying coastal areas are susceptible to multiple types of flooding from marine, subsurface, and surface sources. The co-occurrence of a rainfall event with high sea level, which raises coastal groundwater tables conjointly, may result in a compound flooding event, which could be much more widespread and dangerous than that of an individual flooding source. Focusing on Imperial Beach as a low-elevation coastal community in California, this paper provides a generalized methodology to determine the vulnerability of coastal stormdrain systems to compound seawater, groundwater, and stormwater flooding under a changing climate. Although marine inundation by itself is expected to flood only 7% of the study area by 2100 under the most pessimistic scenario (i.e. 2 m rise), our results show that more than 20% of the study area's subterranean stormdrain system is already at the risk of subsurface flooding at current sea levels. While marine inundation is a concern near the coastline as sea level rises, the results show that seawater intrusion into the stormdrain system can impact areas kilometers away from the coastline. The consequences of sea-level rise (SLR) can be exacerbated by an under-resourced stormdrain system, caused by groundwater infiltration through system defects. As such, by a 2 m rise in current sea-level, the flooding volume may double in an ideal system (i.e., no defects) while this ratio can increase six fold in a slightly defective stormdrain system (with 0.25 % porosity systemwide). The continuous simulations of the stormdrain system performance indicate that flood events will be more destructive and frequent under these circumstances.

To address coastal inundation risk for impact studies, integrated approaches accounting for flood hazard modelling, exposure and vulnerability of human and environmental systems are crucial. In this study, we model the impacts of sea level rise on coastal inundation depth for County Dublin, the most extensively urbanized area in Ireland, for the current period and for 2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 4.5 and 8.5. A risk-centred approach has been considered by linking the information on coastal flood-prone areas to the exposure of the urban environment, in terms of potential future land cover changes, and to the socioeconomic vulnerability of the population. The results suggest significant challenges for Dublin city and the surrounding coastal areas, with an increase of around 26% and 67% in the number of administrative units considered at very high risk by the end of the century under a RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. This study aims to contribute to existing coastal inundation research undertaken for Ireland by (i) providing a first-level screening of flooding hazards in the study area, (ii) demonstrating how land cover changes and socioeconomic vulnerability can contribute to the level of experienced risk and (iii) informing local authorities and at-risk communities so as to support them in the development of plans for adaptation and resilience.

Within a very simple model structure, precipitation and soil moisture data are used to estimate the quick-flow river discharge component while TWSAs are used for obtaining its complementary part, i.e., the slow-flow river discharge component. The two are then added together to obtain river discharge estimates. The method is tested over the Mississippi River basin for the period 2003-2016 by using precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), soil moisture data from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), and total water storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Despite the model simplicity, relatively high-performance scores are obtained in river discharge estimates, with a Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) index greater than 0.64 both at the basin outlet and over several inner stations used for model calibration, highlighting the high information content of satellite observations on surface processes. Potentially useful for multiple operational and scientific applications, from flood warning systems to the understanding of water cycle, the added value of the STREAM approach is twofold: (1) a simple modeling framework, potentially suitable for global runoff monitoring, at daily timescale when forced with satellite observations only, and (2) increased knowledge of natural processes and human activities as well as their interactions on the land.

J	Bremard, T				Bremard, Thanawat			Monitoring Land Subsidence: The Challenges of Producing Knowledge and Groundwater Management Indicators in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Bangkok; groundwater; institutional challenges; monitoring; subsidence; threshold indicators; uncertainties	UPLIFT; TIME	Multiple major coastal cities face the threat of sea level rise with global climate change. This vulnerability can be further exacerbated by local contexts of urbanization and flood management. Land subsidence caused by groundwater over-extraction has long been identified as a factor that exposes cities to the threat of submergence through its interaction with the sea's tidal regime or a river basin's precipitation pattern and flood regime. Decision-making in regards to environmental issues such as land subsidence ultimately relies on monitoring data to frame the problem and formulate policies accordingly. Thus, in examining how subsidence has been shaped into a scientific reality in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, this article reviews the limits and uncertainties of subsidence monitoring tools and their associated indicators for risk management (safe yield, piezometric level, and subsidence rate). Our analysis of existing technical reports, supported by interviews conducted with key actors involved in the processes of knowledge production and policy-making, has pointed out how such uncertainties give way to varied interpretations of these indicators, which continue to fuel the debate concerning the establishment of a safe yield for groundwater management. Furthermore, our research has also revealed that the monitoring of land subsidence has been receiving less priority due to institutional challenges within concerned governmental agencies. Ultimately, we argue that in order to use the resource sustainably, it is crucial to keep monitoring groundwater overdraft in the neighboring provinces of Bangkok to diligently anticipate long-term flooding risks associated with the changing hydrogeological regime of the delta.

Extreme events such as floods are responsible for additional local species loss or population decline. Tributaries might provide refugia and subsequent source populations for the colonization of downstream sites in connected riverine networks with metapopulations of plant species. In this study, we analyzed the metapopulation structure of the endangered riparian shrub species Myricaria germanica along the river Isel, Austria, which is part of the Natura 2000 network, and its tributaries. The use of 22 microsatellite markers allowed us to assess the role of tributaries and single populations as well as gene flow up- and downstream. The analysis of 1307 individuals from 45 sites shows the influence of tributaries to the genetic diversity at Isel and no overall isolation by distance pattern. Ongoing bidirectional gene flow is revealed by the detection of first-generation migrants in populations of all tributaries as well as the river Isel, supporting upstream dispersal by wind (seeds) or animals (seeds and pollen). However, some populations display significant population declines and high inbreeding, and recent migration rates are non-significant or low. The genetic pattern at the mouth of river Schwarzach into Isel and shortly thereafter river Kalserbach supports the finding that geographically close populations remain connected and that tributaries can form important refugia for M. germanica in the dynamic riverine network. Conservation and mitigation measures should therefore focus on providing sufficient habitat along tributaries of various size allowing pioneer plants to cope with extreme events in the main channel, especially as they are expected to be more frequent under changing climate.

In order to support flood resilience efforts, it is important to anticipate and quantify potential changes in design standards under future climate conditions. This study assessed how extreme precipitation is expected to change over the 21st century in relation to current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 design standards over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We used the Community Earth System Model Version 2 large ensemble (CESM2-LE) simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and incorporated future changes into flood engineering design standard with a spatially distributed quantile delta mapping method. Relative changes in extreme daily precipitation were computed for multiple average recurrence intervals (ARIs) up to 100-year and different planning horizons (2020, 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100). The results indicated an intensification of extreme precipitation by approximately 10%-40% in northern regions and 20%-80% in southern regions by 2100. The current 100-year ARI with 24-hr duration from NOAA Atlas 14 is projected to become the 50-year ARI in the Northern Great Plains, less than the 25-year ARI in Southwest areas, and approximately the 25-year ARI in the other regions by 2100. While a nationwide consensus is still needed, this work presents a possible methodology for incorporating climate uncertainty in engineering design. A comparison across major metropolitan areas also illustrates regional variability in projected changes relative to NOAA Atlas 14, suggesting a need for varied local-scale responses.

Analyzing the change trends and correlation of temperature and extreme precipitation indicators can effectively identify natural disasters. This study aimed to detect the correlation and change trends of temperature and extreme precipitation indicators in Inner Mongolia from 1960 to 2019. Panel vector autoregression (PVAR) models based on Stata software were used to detect the correlation between temperature and extreme precipitation indicators at 35 climatological stations throughout Inner Mongolia. The temperature and extreme precipitation indicator trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope method. The spatial distribution characteristics of the annual precipitation and rainfall intensity were more significant in the southeast and more minor in the northwest, while an increase in the annual wet days was noticeable to the northeast. The Granger cause tests of the temperature and the extreme precipitation indicators showed a correlation between each indicator and temperature at the significance level of 1%. The temperature positively correlated with only the rainfall intensity while negatively correlating with the remaining indicators. There is no doubt that trend analysis showed significant increasing trends in rainfall intensity at all stations, which means increased risk in extreme precipitation events. By contrast, the annual precipitation and annual wet days showed significant decreasing trends, which means that the precipitation is concentrated, and it is easier to form extreme precipitation events. The study can provide a basis for decision-making in water resources and drought/flood risk management in Inner Mongolia, China.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on precipitation-induced uncertainties in hydrological simulations using process-based land surface models. This study examines the propagation of precipitation uncertainty into hydrological simulations over the entire MRB using the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) at a high spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) and without any parameter calibration. Simulations conducted using different precipitation datasets are compared to investigate the discrepancies in streamflow, terrestrial water storage (TWS), soil moisture, and evapotranspiration (ET) caused by precipitation uncertainty. Results indicate that precipitation is a key determinant of simulated streamflow in the MRB; peak flow and soil moisture are particularly sensitive to precipitation input. Further, precipitation data with a higher spatial resolution did not improve the simulations, contrary to the common perception that using meteorological forcing with higher spatial resolution would improve hydrological simulations. In addition, since high flow indicators are particularly influenced by precipitation data, the choice of precipitation data could directly impact flood pulse simulations in the MRB. Notable differences are also found among TWS, soil moisture, and ET simulated using different precipitation products. Moreover, TWS, soil moisture, and ET exhibit a varying degree of sensitivity to precipitation uncertainty. This study provides crucial insights on precipitation-induced uncertainties in process-based hydrological modeling and uncovers these uncertainties in the MRB.

This study investigated the trends and variability of precipitation extremes to explore statistically significant trends in extreme hydrological conditions over the last 35 years in the Wabi Shebele basin of Ethiopia. Two reanalysis climate products: Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) were evaluated against ground observations using cumulative distribution function and statistical measures. The result shows that the CHIRPS data set performed well and captured the precipitation extremes measured by rain gauges. The Mann-Kendall trend test analysis conducted using three extreme precipitation indices: annual maximum precipitation (AMP) (i.e., annual highest 1-day precipitation amount), R10 (i.e., the yearly count of days when precipitation >= 10 mm), and R95P (i.e., 95% percentile precipitation events). The result indicates an increasing tendency over the western-eastern highland and southern part of the basin; In contrast, it indicates decreasing trends over the middle of the study area. Quantile perturbation analysis using R95P reveals high oscillations at 5-year intervals within a confidence interval (CI), particularly at the basin's western-eastern highlands and southern lowlands. Since the 2000s, a periodicity analysis of maximum yearly precipitation using the autocorrelation function has revealed cycles at 2-year to 5-year intervals over the western-eastern highlands of the basin.

The role of railway traffic and extreme weather on slab track long-term performance	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Railway slab track; Concrete deterioration; Soil settlement; Extreme weather; Long -term analysis; Numerical modelling	DAMAGE; DESIGN; VIBRATIONS; INTERFACE	Railway traffic is reaching new limits of train speed, axle load and frequency. To cope with these new demand standards, ballastless tracks emerge around the globe as high performance, long-life and low maintenance solutions. In addition, growing concerns with climate change require resiliency to extreme weather scenarios as anticipated characteristics for future slab track systems. With this goal in mind, an innovative and iterative train-track-soil system model (HI-Track) was tailored developed and validated using finite element modeling so that it can accurately simulate the short- and long-term response of the track under train and atmospheric actions. The modelling process encompasses the dual approach between two dedicated sub-models: a reduced dynamic model (DL-Track) and a detailed nonlinear model (SPTrack). The long-term effect is simulated through the interaction between these two sub-models. The proposed hybrid model simulates several years of track life and at each cycle, various parameters are updated using empirical mechanistic formulations to predict the evolution of concrete slab damage and the permanent deformation of the soil. Several scenarios of combinations of intense traffic (train speed and axle load) and extreme weather conditions (temperature and rainfall) were conducted to evaluate the resiliency performance of railway slab tracks to such events. Simulations performed enabled us to assess important results, revealing for instance that high speed traffic is conducive to faster concrete deterioration in the later years of the track, while freight causes an accelerated degradation in the early years that stabilizes afterwards. Heavy rainfall and flooding have a major impact on track settlement while negative temperature differentials are the main thermal cause for concrete deterioration in unit slab track systems.

Climatic factors, accelerated transformation of water bodies, and changes in runoff patterns were evaluated based on long-term field observations. Subsequently, we estimated that changes in climatic factors have prolonged the ablation period and accelerated warming since 1990. Additionally, the glacier retreat rate during 2001-2013 was accelerated by approximately 16.23% compared with that during 1976-2001, whereas the ratio of snowfall in annual precipitation has decreased by 2.37% since 1990. The beginning of the freezing cycles of lakes along with the complete cycles were delayed. Moreover, snow sublimation significantly increased after 1990. Amplitudes of frost days (number of days with daily minimum temperature below 0 degrees C) during 1991-2019 were eight times higher than those during 1960-1990. Furthermore, the contribution of moisture recycling to precipitation increased by 9.74% from 1979 to 1990 to 1991-2019. The variations in actual evaporation increased from 1.257 mm/a during 1980-1990 to 0.865 mm/a during 1991-2017 and the runoff increased by 66.83x10(8) m(3)/10a during 1991-2012. July experienced the highest rainfall and runoff. During the multiphase water transformation, the runoff recharge sources changed significantly, thus, changing the historical trend of recharge in the headwaters of rivers only by the glacier snow meltwater by providing a new recharge mode. However, the accelerated multiphase water transformation caused by climate warming increased the challenges in water resource management and flood control in alpine regions.

Frontiers in assessing septic systems vulnerability in coastal Georgia, USA: Modeling approach and management implications	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TOPOGRAPHIC WETNESS INDEX; NEW-YORK; AREAS; PERFORMANCE; NUTRIENT	Threats to public health and environmental quality from septic systems are more prevalent in areas with poorly draining soils, high water tables, or frequent flooding. Significant research gaps exist in assessing these systems' vulnerability and evaluating factors associated with higher rates of septic systems replacement and repair. We developed a novel GIS-based framework for assessing septic system vulnerability using a database of known septic system specifications and a modified Soil Topographic Index (STI) that incorporates seasonal high groundwater elevation to assess risks posed to septic systems in coastal Georgia. We tested the hypothesis that both the modified STI and septic system specifications such as tank capacity per bedroom and drainfield type would explain most of the variance in septic system repair and replacement using classification inference tree and generalized logistic regression models. Our modeling results indicate that drainfield type (level vs. mounded) is the most significant variable (p-value < 0.001) in predicting septic systems functionality followed by septic tank capacity per bedroom (p-value < 0.01). These show the importance of septic system design regulations such as a minimum requirement for horizontal separation distance between the bottom of trenches and seasonal water table, and adequate tank capacity design. However, for septic systems with a mounded drainfield and a larger tank capacity per bedroom, the modified STI representing hydrological characteristics of septic system location is a significant predictor of a high septic system repair and replacement rate. The methodology developed in this study can have important implications for managing existing septic systems and planning for future development in coastal areas, especially in an environment of rapid climatic change.

J	Zhan, P; Zhu, WQ; Li, N				Zhan, Pei; Zhu, Wenquan; Li, Nan			An automated rice mapping method based on flooding signals in synthetic aperture radar time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Rice; Mapping; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); China	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; PLANTING AREA; CHINA; IMAGERY; WATER; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS	Paddy rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world, feeding over 50% of the global population. A quick and accurate mapping of the extent of paddy rice is of critical importance for ensuring food security, studying climate change and monitoring water resources. Based on Sentinel-1A data and rice flooding features, we proposed a rice mapping method called the Automated Rice Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar Flooding Signals (ARM-SARFS), in which the key "V" shaped feature in the Sentinel-1A VH backscatter time series rising from the flooding before and after rice transplanting was used for rice mapping. The ARM-SARFS was validated at three study sites in Hubei, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces in China under different rice cropping systems and different geographical and climate conditions. The results showed that even without any training samples, the ARM-SARFS was able to provide a satisfying classification result with an overall accuracy of over 86% and an F-1 score of over 0.85 at all three study sites. With the aid of training samples, the classification performance increased further. When compared with the previously proposed Sentinel-1-based rice mapping methods, the ARM-SARFS improved the overall accuracy by 13.3-37.2%, and the most significant improvement was in the producer's accuracy. The sensitivity test showed that the ARM-SARFS is not sensitive to thresholding, and a high classification accuracy can be achieved at thresholds ranging from -0.025 to 0. These results demonstrated the robustness of ARM-SARFS for automated rice mapping with a high accuracy at large scales.

Planning approaches for adaptation often merges with socioeconomic development, applying a top-down, technocratic rational paradigm. Whereas the bottom-up process of planning encourages communities to participate for sharing the power of decision making, incorporating its knowledge, ideas, and concerns. Particularly in developing countries, non-governmental organization (NGO)s, collaborating with communities and governmental organizations, conduct community development projects. The community reactions towards these projects and condition of community participation in their planning process are needed to be evaluated to develop a better understanding about the scope of community participation in the local level development activities for reducing future risks. This case study based research, employing qualitative tools, studies two settlements in the Haor region of Bangladesh to investigate NGO-driven development projects and their planning process through the lens of community participation. The region is a vast tectonic depression where its inhabitants live with significant seasonal flood risks, accommodating themselves on constructed islands. The empirical evidences are evaluated to identify levels of community participation and it has been found as ritualistic in most of the cases, where the community concerns and demands are ignored through convincing them, manipulating their ideas and providing therapies. It also does not often allow to empower the community to take control over the project, which is considered as necessary in a disaster context to coincide adaptation with development, aiming to enhance community resilience.

Effects of heavy rainfall on waterborne disease hospitalizations among young children in wet and dry areas of New Zealand	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Waterborne diseases; Heavy rainfall; Short-term effect; Long-term exposure; Child cohort; Nested case-crossover	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; GROWING-UP; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; TIME-SERIES; TEMPERATURE; ASSOCIATION; INFECTION; OUTBREAKS; EXPOSURE; EVENTS	Heavy rainfall is associated with increased risk of waterborne disease. However, it is not known whether the risk increment differs between wet and dry regions. We examined this question in New Zealand, which has a wide geographical variation of annual rainfall totals (10th-90th percentile difference >3000 mm). We conducted a nested case-crossover study within a prospective child cohort (born in 2009-2010) for assessing transient health effects when modified by longitudinal exposures to rainfall. Short-term heavy rainfall effects on hospitalizations due to enteric bacterial and viral infectious causes at lag of 0-14 days were assessed using a Cox regression model adjusted for daily temperature, relative humidity and evapotranspiration. We derived quantiles of time-weighted long-term rainfall levels at the children's homes and these were added as an interaction term to the short-term effect model. Hospitalization risks were higher two days after heavy rainfall days (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.73 [1.10-2.70]). The lowest-observable-adverse-effect-level was detected at the 94th percentile of daily rainfall total. Hospital admissions 1-2 days after heavy rainfall increased most in locations with the lowest and highest long-term rainfall. An interaction of this kind between short-term weather and long-term climate has not been reported previously. It is relevant to climate change risk assessments given global projections of increasing intensity of precipitation, against a background of more severe, and possibly more frequent, droughts and flooding.

Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES) approach has been employed to assess the ecosystem services extended by Purbasthali Oxbow Lake. A total 37 ecosystem services, grouped into 4 major categories (10 provisioning, 9 regulating, 7 cultural and 11 supporting) have been identified that have directly or indirectly influenced the lifestyle of the native villagers. With the help of RAWES questionnaire and calculation spreadsheet numeric transformation of ecosystem services has been conducted by Ecosystem Service Index. The results unveil existence of spatial dynamics in ecosystem services and the wetland utilization pattern by the rural folks of five adjacent villages, namely Purbasthali, Chupi, Kashthashali, Ramchandrapur and Indrakpur. Subsequently, Kruskal-Wallis test reveals significant village-level variation in utilization pattern of the services (The p value is .0005. The result is significant at p < .05). Priority of acceptance to diverse services generates the conflicts of interest to the wetland user groups bracketed in wetland-people association. A dual and contrasting societal perception have been emerged from a geographically resembling region due to the locational specialty and varying degrees of economic dependency of the villagers. The overall benefits of the wetland services in the life of the residents of Purbasthali, Chupi and Ramchandrapur have been reduced with the increasing distances from the wetlands, while Kasthashali and Indrakpur exhibit a contrasting situation with dissimilar perspectives.

One of the worst affected basin was Pampa river which experienced a severe flood. Aims of this investigation were to define the quality of Pampa river water after the flood. The analysis of physico-chemical parameters indicated transitory variations from pre-flood status as reported by former workers. The pre-flood neutral to the acidic property of water shifted towards alkaline conditions throughout the river stretch post flood. Alkalinity and salinity was almost twice the pre-flood scenario, though the values were within the ranges required for fish survival and growth. Decreased conductivity and increased dissolved oxygen were also the major changes observed post flood. The study indicates that this large-scale flood resulted in a considerable reduction in the concentration of heavy metals and nutrients in the water. Based on water quality index, spatially Pampa river water can be categorised from 'Good' to 'Unsuitable' category. The cluster analysis distinctly differentiates the middle stream stations from lower stream stations. PCA/FA loadings indicate that electrical conductivity, alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, and PO4 (3 -) P show strong positive loadings which indicate that salinity factor and natural weathering are the main factors controlling the water quality. This information would be practical to forecast the health of the ecosystem after the flood and also to develop adequate management plans.

Furthermore, information and complexity metrics can reveal invaluable information about the unseen processes that occur within a system. In this study, hourly streamflow records obtained from five gauging stations of a mountainous river were analyzed to quantify different patterns and characterize system states at both low and high frequencies using increasing aggregation lengths. In addition, we propose a new extension for the information and complexity theory, allowing it to be customized for flood assessment. Moreover, we clarify how a pattern (i.e., a word length) can be suitably defined by means of information and complexity metrics. Regarding low-frequency analyses, our results related to information and complexity metrics indicate two scaling regimes for river discharge, one of which may describe river memory characteristics. Regarding high-frequency analyses, our findings indicate the presence of an additional scaling regime that occurs along an hourly scale, captured by streamflow data, and is obtained using a novel hydroacoustic system. Additionally, power spectral density results confirmed our findings. A further significant result from our study is the clear correlation between complexity and fractal fluctuations, which should be addressed in future studies. In summary, this research focuses on new aspects of information and complexity metrics to be customized for the detection and understanding of temporal structures of streamflow patterns during both standard and extreme events.

Here, an AR detection algorithm is applied to global reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), to objectively and consistently characterize ARs regionally across the continental United States (CONUS). The characteristics of AR and associated precipitation are computed at the gridpoint scale and summarized over the sevenU.S. National ClimateAssessment regions. ARs aremost frequent in the autumn and winter in theWest, spring in the Great Plains, and autumn in the Midwest and Northeast. ARs show regional and seasonal variability in basic geometry and IVT. AR IVT composites reveal annually consistent northeastward-directed moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean in the West, whereas moisture transport patterns vary seasonally across the Southern Great Plains and Midwest. Linked AR precipitation characteristics suggest that a substantial proportion of extreme events, defined as the top 5% of 3-day precipitation totals, are associated with ARs over many parts of CONUS, including the East. Regional patterns of AR-associated precipitation highlight that seasonally varying moisture transport and lifting mechanisms differ between the East and the West where orographic lifting is key. Our study aims to contribute a comprehensive and consistent CONUS-wide, regional-scale analysis of ARs in support of ongoing NCA efforts. Given the CONUS-wide role ARs play in extreme precipitation, findings motivate continued study of associated climate change impacts.

A previous flood had harshly affected the UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS) and the surrounding communities. The aims of this study were to assess the spatial distribution of flood hazards and analyze how past experience contributed to community flood readiness. Both GIS analysis and household surveys (n = 405) were systematically performed. According to the Analytic Hier-archy Process (AHP) technique, approximately half of the whole community area (52.63%) and the WHS (44.8%) were at high risk of flooding. Pratuchai, the most populated subdistrict, was at the highest flood hazard level. Runoff and road density were the main contributors to flooding in a community. Regression analysis found that there was a negative correlation between past flood experience and residents' flood readiness. According to the cluster analysis, there were two groups of respondents: i) those who had more experience with both flood hazards and the inaccessibility of urban services during a flood and were less likely to prepare themselves for future floods (n = 313) and ii) those who had less experience with floods and the inaccessibility of urban services and were more likely to prepare for future floods (n = 92). This implies, in short, that the local populace had not learned much from past experiences of a flood disasters. Advance urban flood management, multi-hazard zoning, and effective flood risk communication are urgently needed to improve flood resilience in the WHS communities.

The coupling mechanism among hydrology, edaphic factors, and vegetation is the key to coastal wetland management. The current study conducted in the Yellow River Delta used an improved-comprehensive hydrological connectivity structure index, Topographic Over Field Capacity Index (TOFCI), based on both soil water conditions (SWC) and topography to highlight the role of hydrological connectivity on intertidal flat (IF), tidal marsh (TM), semi-artificial pond (AP) and riverside intermittent flooded (RS) wetland classes among other environmental variables. The results showed plant community distributions and structures among wetland classes differed from each other significantly, and hydrological connectivity structure is one of the driving factors. The results provided three pieces of evidence for this inference: 1) according to PCA results, the contribution of TOFCI is the highest among all environmental variables; 2) TOFCI values show significant difference among different plant communities; 3) TOFCI is also significantly correlated to species composition and distribution according to the CCA and RDA results. TOFCI values are positively linearly correlated to the plant coverage and biomass in intertidal flat wetlands according to linear regression analysis. Furthermore, salinity, soil total nitrogen and soil total phosphorus also influence plant community distribution and species composition. Finally, simple parameters for soil water conditions or topographic characteristics do not show significant explanatory power to hydrology-vegetation interaction. The results of the current study provide a new perspective for coastal wetland conservation and restoration.

Adaptation to uncertain sea-level rise; how uncertainty in Antarctic mass-loss impacts the coastal adaptation strategy of the Netherlands	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sea-level rise; Antarctica; adaptation pathways; deep uncertainty; decision making; coastal adaptation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY-ANALYSIS; THAMES ESTUARY; PROJECTIONS; MANAGEMENT; SCENARIOS; PATHWAYS; SYSTEM; BASIN; TIDE	Uncertainties in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise (SLR) complicate decision making on coastal adaptation. Large uncertainty arises from potential ice mass-loss from Antarctica that could rapidly increase SLR in the second half of this century. The implications of SLR may be existential for a low-lying country like the Netherlands and warrant exploration of high-impact low-likelihood scenarios. To deal with uncertain SLR, the Netherlands has adopted an adaptive pathways plan. This paper analyzes the implications of storylines leading to extreme SLR for the current adaptive plan in the Netherlands, focusing on flood risk, fresh water resources, and coastline management. It further discusses implications for coastal adaptation in low-lying coastal zones considering timescales of adaptation including the decisions lifetime and lead-in time for preparation and implementation. We find that as sea levels rise faster and higher, sand nourishment volumes to maintain the Dutch coast may need to be up to 20 times larger than to date in 2100, storm surge barriers will need to close at increasing frequency until closed permanently, and intensified saltwater intrusion will reduce freshwater availability while the demand is rising. The expected lifetime of investments will reduce drastically. Consequently, step-wise adaptation needs to occur at an increasing frequency or with larger increments while there is still large SLR uncertainty with the risk of under- or overinvesting. Anticipating deeply uncertain, high SLR scenarios helps to enable timely adaptation and to appreciate the value of emission reduction and monitoring of the Antarctica contribution to SLR.

Climatology of thunderstorms, convective rainfall and dry lightning environments in Australia	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Thunderstorms; Convection; Precipitation; Climate; Bushfires	TRENDS; VARIABILITY	The thunderstorm climatology of Australia is examined, including convective rainfall events. Lightning observations are used to train a systematic method for indicating thunderstorm activity, with the method applied to environmental variables obtained from reanalysis data from 1979 to 2016. A range of maps showing seasonal averages in thunderstorm conditions as well as associated rainfall are presented. Long-term climate change trends are also examined, as well as the influence of large-scale drivers such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole and Southern Annular Mode. Rainfall observations are examined for days on which thunderstorm activity is indicated based on this method, enabling new insight on convection-related rainfall. Low rainfall days are also used to examine the climatology of dry lightning as this is important for understanding the risk of wildfire ignitions. A long-term decrease in thunderstorm activity is indicated for many regions of Australia, as well as some regions of increase. The results also indicate a long-term increase in thunderstorm-related rainfall, noting implications for water availability, design standards and flood risk factors. The findings for northern Australia help provide insight on some aspects of the Australian monsoon, including based on a reduced frequency of days with convective environments as well as indicating an increased intensity of convective rainfall events. An increase in convective rainfall is indicated for both northern and southern Australia, while for non-convective rainfall the results indicate an increase in northern Australia and a decrease in southern Australia. Long-term changes in dry lightning events are also identified, depending on the region and season, noting implications for wildfire management.

The effects of these events are a cause of concern for both authorities and citizens, so they prioritize actions that reduce adverse impacts, especially in cities with higher risk. Therefore, the objective of this work was to measure the degree of socio-environmental vulnerability of households to identify the risk areas in the city of La Paz, Baja California Sur, one of the regions with a high degree of incidence of hurricanes in the northwest of Mexico. For this, surveys were carried out with heads of households in 251 homes, and information was aggregated to calculate the vulnerability index through principal components analysis (PCA), which were stratified by the Dalenius-Hodges method, the degree of vulnerability was classified into three categories by the Opiyo method, considering three strata of the Likert scale, 1 = highly vulnerable, 2 = moderately vulnerable, 3 = less vulnerable. The results showed that households that are in the highly vulnerable category are 33% within a range of the index 3.77243 to 0.939141. Moderately vulnerable households constitute 36% with values from 0.929141 to 0.956385. While the least vulnerable represent 31% of households with an index range of 0.966385 to 5.6952. The results have revealed the levels of high and moderate socio-environmental vulnerability by tropical cyclones of 69% homes in La Paz. The above allowed to generate risk maps that will be taken into account in planning and civil protection over adverse events.

Based on a forecast and pre-defined trigger level, a Red Cross Red Crescent project distributed an unconditional cash grant of BDT 5000 (USD 60 equivalent) to 1039 poor households in highly vulnerable, flood-prone communities in the Brahmaputra river basin before an early flood peak. Systems that can deliver forecast-based cash grants are a potential adaptation strategy to deal with changes in extreme events linked to climate change. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study, based on a post-disaster household survey. The research assesses the effectiveness of the forecast-based cash distribution in helping beneficiaries to take preparatory early actions and reduce the negative impacts of the flood on their health, well-being, assets and livelihoods. The assessment shows that the cash grants contributed to improving households' access to food, a reduction in high-interest debt accrual of vulnerable households, and reduced psychosocial stress during and after the flood period, compared to a control group of similarly vulnerable and flood-affected communities that did not receive the forecast-based cash assistance. The intervention may also have prevented households from being forced to make destitution sales of valuable assets, as indicated by qualitative data collected in July, but we do not see these benefits sustained after a second flood peak in August 2017. There is a need for further research to assess the longer-term effects of forecast-based cash on the socio-economic development and well-being of the most vulnerable.

Modeling the Impact of Extreme River Discharge on the Nutrient Dynamics and Dissolved Oxygen in Two Adjacent Estuaries (Portugal)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Minho estuary; Lima estuary; water quality; Delft3D-FLOW; Delft3D-WAQ; ecological flows	WATER-QUALITY MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; PATUXENT RIVER; MINHO ESTUARY; NORTH-SEA; EVENTS; SYSTEM; RIA; TEMPERATURE	The Minho and Lima are adjacent estuaries located in the north of Portugal, with high ecological and economic importance. To address gaps in knowledge about changes in nutrient patterns in adjacent estuaries subject to different freshwater inflows, a numerical model, Delft3D, was implemented and developed, using a single domain, which allowed physical communication between estuaries. Calibration and validation of the model was successfully performed. Three numerical simulations were carried out, in which only river flows were varied (1st corresponds to a baseline numerical run, the 2nd a flood scenario, and the 3rd a drought scenario). Under flooding conditions, similar patterns were verified in both estuaries, with high fluvial discharges showing to have a reduced impact on both estuarine dynamics. In this case the nutrients were not a limiting factor for the biota, both for summer and winter seasons, since there was no significant decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration. For the drought scenario, it was observed that the estuary with the lower inflow of freshwater (Lima) was the most affected, with a significant decrease in the concentration of nutrients and oxygen dissolved in the winter season (decrease of 2 mg O-2/L). In conclusion, this work reveals that it is essential to continuously monitor dam-controlled estuarine systems, as a significant decrease in river discharge will cause significant changes in the variables analysed (O-2, PO4, and NO3) and may cause loss of biodiversity.

Tracking spatio-temporal changes in inundation patterns of these wetlands remains a challenge for remote sensing. Water In Wetlands (WIW) was predicted using a dichotomous partitioning of reflectance values encoded based on ground-truth (n = 4038) and optical-space derived (n = 7016) data covering all land cover types (n = 17) found in the Rhone delta, southern France. The models were developed with spectral data from Sentinel 2, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 sensors, hence providing a monitoring tool that covers a 35-year period (same sensor for Landsat 5 and 7). A single model combining the near infrared (NIR <= 0.1558 to 0.1804, depending on sensors) and short-wave infrared (SWIR2 <= 0.0871 to 0.1131) wavelengths was identified by three independent analyses, each one using a different satellite. Overall accuracy of water maps ranged from 89% to 94% for the training samples and from 90% to 94% for the validation samples, encompassing standard water indices that systematically underestimate flooding duration under vegetation cover. Sentinel 2 provided the highest performance with a kappa coefficient of 0.82 for both samples. Such tool will be most useful for monitoring the water dynamics of seasonal wetlands, which are particularly sensitive to climate change while providing multiple services to humankind. Considering the high temporal resolution of Sentinel 2 (every 5 days), cumulative water maps built with the WIW logical rule could further be used for mapping a wide range of wetlands which are either periodically or permanently flooded.

A Case Study from Vorarlberg, Austria	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						EU Floods Directive; flood risk management; risk-based approach; tipping points; Austria	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; MOUNTAIN HAZARDS; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; INITIATIVES; GOVERNANCE; PROTECTION; CAPACITY; DYNAMICS	Environmental change is subject to discussion among scientists, practitioners, and policymakers. As increasing threats to both environment and society are on the agenda, alternative management approaches are gaining importance. This paper focuses on the influence of policy changes on flood risk management. There is evidence that shifts in settlement patterns and population growth might influence the dynamics of flood damage and loss. There is increased pressure to intensify land use, but also to keep free spaces for hazard mitigation and adaptation. In this paper, we focus on new regulative and management approaches associated with the implementation of the European (EU) Floods Directive in Austria. The concept of tipping points, which are defined as turning points for system change, has been applied. Based on semi-structured interviews we evaluate whether or not the implementation of the EU Floods Directive has triggered a system change in flood risk management. Our results show that triggers for change are past flood events and a general need for action rather than the implementation of the directive itself. Changes related to the EU Floods Directive are likely to happen in the long-term; however, these cannot yet be determined. The main challenges are associated with transparency and communication between policymakers and the affected society. So far, the requirements of the first policy cycle of the directive have been fulfilled. The second policy cycle will show further outcomes and potential needs.

Interactive community responses to disturbance in streams: disturbance history moderates the influence of disturbance types	OIKOS			English	Article						channel experiment; community composition; drying; flooding; resilience; resistance; species traits; streams	SPECIES TRAITS; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; HABITAT TEMPLET; BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS; EXTREME EVENTS; FLOW; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; RESILIENCE	Both disturbance history and disturbance type act to structure communities through selecting for particular species traits but they may also interact. For example, flooding selects for species with flood-resistant traits in streams, but those traits could make communities susceptible to other disturbances and so could cause shifts in community composition due to anthropogenic climate change. To better understand the interactive influences of disturbance history and type on community composition, we investigated the response of macroinvertebrate communities to disturbance using in-stream channels. Using a split-plot design, individual channels in five 'stable' streams and five 'frequently disturbed' streams (disturbance history) were subject to different disturbance type treatments (flooding, drying and a control). Disturbance type independently drove effects on species diversity, but all other effects of disturbance type depended on disturbance history. In particular, the interaction of disturbance type and history determined overall community response. Both disturbance types tested produced similar community responses in frequently disturbed streams, including changes in community composition and alterations to the abundance of less mobile taxa, but low-flow had a significantly greater effect in stable streams. Macroinvertebrate drift was greatest in the rock-rolling treatments and significantly less in the low-flow treatment for both disturbance histories. Therefore, disturbance history moderated the effects of disturbance type and determined the mechanism of community response by determining how well species were adapted to disturbance. This outcome suggests that previous disturbances strongly influence how vulnerable communities are to changes in disturbance, and so should be considered when predicting how changes in disturbance regimes will affect future community composition.

A new paradigm for the prevention of disaster damages has been required. To date, LID technologies using porous materials has been paid attention to control direct runoff, floods and NPSs. Permeable pavement among LID technologies which prevent floods and reduce NPSs can be actively applied to sidewalks, parking lots and driveways in lowlands and coastal areas. However, the loss of permeability in the material matrix has been considered as a critical issue when pore is clogged by particles for maintaining the constructed facility in the field. Herein, we conducted particle loading test at constant head to obtain the permeability coefficient and TSS removal efficiency to evaluate the cyclic performance of the permeable pavement system, and further determine their correlation. We found that the change of permeability coefficient was 273 similar to 72 mm/s when the similar to 4.2 kg/m(2) particles were loaded for 60 minutes. Trend of permeability coefficient depends on amount of particle per time. This means that loading particles in a short time make more clogging than a long time. The TSS removal efficiency was >80% at different hydraulic gradient and inflow concentration. Trend of TSS removal efficiency increased as particles were loaded. The correlation between the permeability coefficient and TSS removal efficiency is inversely proportional. Although the results will vary depending on the specification of the pavement system, this method can be used to estimate the effective replacement period with further researches.

Spatio-temporal changes in terrestrial water storage in the Himalayan river basins and risks to water security in the region: A review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Himalayan river basins; Terrestrial water storage; Groundwater abstraction; Climate change; South Asia	GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; NORTHWEST INDIA; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY	Nearly one-fifth of the Earth's accessible freshwater is stored in the densely-populated, alluvial floodplains of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, Irrawaddy and Meghna River Systems in the Himalayan region where extreme hydrological conditions exist due to the seasonal variability in terrestrial water storage (TWS). Groundwater storage (GWS) - a hidden resource underneath the land surface, plays a critical role in sustaining irrigated agriculture in these river basins, particularly during the dry season when rice crops are generally grown in irrigated lands across South Asia. Although monitoring of groundwater levels has been operational in the region for a number of decades, a basin-wide comprehensive assessment of GWS is lacking in most river basins. The NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites offer an opportunity to map basin-wide changes in GWS where in-situ observations are limited in time and space. GRACE-derived assessments of GWS vary substantially in these basins and have not been reconciled with in-situ observations in most cases. Recent declining trends in GWS over the Himalayan river basins are attributed primarily to over-abstraction of groundwater due to dry-season irrigation. Seasonal variability in terrestrial water is likely to increase or become unpredictable in the future as a result of increased climate variability. The consequent impacts may potentially threaten the security of water supply and food in the region, where there is currently a growing demand for food grains from irrigated agriculture, energy, and domestic and industrial water supplies.

Traditional spatial indices, however, fall short in accurately characterizing complex courtyards and local spatial features. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces pixel-level spatial indicators that effectively overcome these constraints. These indicators are implemented using computational geometry algorithms such as Ray Tracing, Flood Fill, and A*, enabling simulation of various courtyard spatial indicator maps. We also utilize Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based rapid thermal comfort simulation technology to generate thermal comfort maps. By applying data mining methods such as Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Pearson correlation, and Nearest-neighbor interpolation, we explore the relationships between spatial indicators and thermal comfort, ultimately identifying key indicators and determining the guiding thresholds and influencing trends corresponding to heat discomfort frequency. Six key indicators and th emerge: Building View Factor (BVF), indicating building coverage visibility (prefer above 0.11); Solar Beam Fraction (BEAM), illustrating Summer solstice sun shading condition (prefer below 0.78); Averaged View Factor (AVF), showing overall visibility (prefer below 0.40); Directional Sky View Factor (DSVF(W)), reflecting sky visibility in a specific orientation (prefer below 0.73); Tree View Factor (TVF), denoting tree coverage visibility (prefer above 0.18); and Plan Water Ratio (PWR), signifying water surface proportion (aim for below 0.44). These insights, integrated into design tools, contribute to evidence-based microclimate regulation strategies, thereby enhancing urban residents' thermal comfort and overall well-being.

To better understand the impact of hydrological and phenological variables on floodplain waterbird habitats during drought conditions, we employed hydrological modeling and remote sensing techniques to calculate fine scale environmental variables. We constructed habitat suitability models using nine years of field surveys of waterbirds and identified the impact of the interaction effects between hydrological and phenological variables on waterbirds under drought and non-drought conditions. The results showed that hydrological and phenological variables can provide useful information for quantifying the habitat suitability of waterbirds. Drought-induced early water recession negatively impacted the quality of waterbird habitats, reducing their habitat suitability. Sedge eaters exhibited the most significant reduction of 34.47% in the total area of the lake, followed by seed eaters, fish eaters and invertebrate eaters. Tuber eaters had the largest increasing trend, with a significant increase area of 7.44% in total area. Our findings suggest that various feeding guilds exhibit distinct interactions in response to drought, which can be strengthened or weakened by alterations resulting from drought. For sedge eaters, seed eaters, and fish eaters, drought could result in a faster decline in habitat suitability by strengthening the interaction effects between variables. In contrast, for invertebrate eaters and tuber eaters, drought could weaken interaction effects between variables, resulting in a slower decline in habitat quality. The results provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of overwintering waterbirds and can inform conservation efforts in wetlands.

Stochastic Modeling of Nonstationary Time Series for Future Water-Related Risk Management	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						stochastic simulation; nonstationary; trend; shifting mean; oscillation; water resources	VARIABILITY; BOOTSTRAP; DYNAMICS; TESTS; LAKES; PART	Hydrological time series often present nonstationarities such as trends, shifts, or oscillations due to anthropogenic effects and hydroclimatological variations, including global climate change. For water managers, it is crucial to recognize and define the nonstationarities in hydrological records. The nonstationarities must be appropriately modeled and stochastically simulated according to the characteristics of observed records to evaluate the adequacy of flood risk mitigation measures and future water resources management strategies. Therefore, in the current study, three approaches were suggested to address stochastically nonstationary behaviors, especially in the long-term variability of hydrological variables: as an overall trend, shifting mean, or as a long-term oscillation. To represent these options for hydrological variables, the autoregressive model with an overall trend, shifting mean level (SML), and empirical mode decomposition with nonstationary oscillation resampling (EMD-NSOR) were employed in the hydrological series of the net basin supply in the Lake Champlain-River Richelieu basin, where the International Joint Committee recently managed and significant flood damage from long consistent high flows occurred. The detailed results indicate that the EMD-NSOR model can be an appropriate option by reproducing long-term dependence statistics and generating manageable scenarios, while the SML model does not properly reproduce the observed long-term dependence, that are critical to simulate sustainable flood events. The trend model produces too many risks for floods in the future but no risk for droughts. The overall results conclude that the nonstationarities in hydrological series should be carefully handled in stochastic simulation models to appropriately manage future water-related risks.

At the core of flood resilience is the development of a resilient green-grey-blue infrastructure system that can resist, absorb, and recover from floods in a timely manner. Current flood resilience research, however, is limited to evaluating single infrastructure systems, failing to examine the dynamic process or find ideal spatial infrastructure designs for decision-makers. This research proposes a scenario-based assessment framework for integrated green-grey-blue infrastructure systems to improve flood resilience during urban design decision-making. Rainfall-runoff, drainage networks, and river system models are interlinked to provide quantitative simulation evaluations of water quantity and urban impact in various spatial organisations of infrastructure design. A dynamic, multi-criteria decision-making process is used to reveal the importance of five temporal indicators and rank design alternatives. In Guangzhou, China, the efficiency of this architecture is demonstrated on Pazhou Island, a typical river network area. Given the limited water and green space available, the results demonstrate that submerged areas exert a greater influence during peak rainfall, and blue infrastructure storage becomes an essential factor following rainfall. Furthermore, from a spatial perspective, the looped network of green-blue infrastructure enhances flood resilience, and downstream waterway connections and green space-aligned waterways boost the water storage capacity of green-grey-blue infrastructure. This paradigm can improve flood resilience in the Greater Bay Area in the future, especially in response to heavy rainstorms and river floods.

The emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are often influenced by the water level in wetland ecosystems. However, the effects of soil freeze-thaw alternation under different water levels on soil C emissions in wetland ecosystems are still not clear. We examined the impacts of soil freeze-thaw alternation under different water levels on the emission of CO2 and CH4 in a wetland dominated by Phragmites australis, and the soil microbial community structure and enzymatic activities were studied. The results showed that freeze-thaw treatments promoted soil carbon emissions, and flooding significantly lowered soil CO2 and CH4 emissions under freeze-thaw treatments. The soil water content (SWC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the activities of beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (PER) were the main predictors of soil carbon emissions under freeze-thaw treatments. Flooding played a direct role in carbon emissions during the freeze-thaw processes, and the interpretation rates of soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were 65% and 37%, respectively. The high-water level indicated fewer carbon emissions during the freeze-thaw period. Therefore, appropriately raising the water level is conducive to reducing carbon emissions from wetlands in areas of seasonal frost.

In this study, event-based extreme precipitation (EEP) was defined as continuous precipitation that includes at least one day of EP. We analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of four EEP types (front EEP, late EEP, balanced EEP, and single day EEP) across the Loess Plateau (LP) based on data acquired from 87 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2019. Precipitation on the LP basically maintained a spatial pattern of "low in the northwest region and high in the southeast region", and EP over the last 10 a increased significantly. The cumulative precipitation percentage of single day EEP was 34% and was dominant for 60 a, while the cumulative precipitation percentage of front, late, and balanced EEP types associated with PSP accounted for 66%, which confirms to the connotation of EEP. The cumulative frequencies of front and late EEP types were 23% and 21%, respectively, while the cumulative frequency of balanced EEP had the lowest value at only 13%. Moreover, global warming could lead to more single day EEP across the LP, and continuous EEP could increase in the northwestern region and decrease in the eastern region in the future. The concept of process-oriented EP could facilitate further exploration of disaster-causing processes associated with different types of EP, and provide a theoretical basis for deriving precipitation disaster chains and construction of disaster cluster characteristics.

Dynamic emergent leaf area in tidal wetlands: Implications for satellite-derived regional and global blue carbon estimates	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Blue carbon; Salt marshes; Tidal wetlands; Leaf area; Carbon modeling; Remote sensing	GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; ACTIVE RADIATION; CO2 EXCHANGE; SALT MARSHES; MODIS; INUNDATION; BUDGET; TOWER	The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate highlights the importance of blue carbon in tidal wetlands in combating climate change. In this study, we highlight the uncertainty associated with leaf area index (LAI) estimations in tidal wetlands, specifically salt marshes, a key vegetation parameter for productivity models and Earth System Models (ESM). LAI, derived from satellite reflectance data, is linked to atmospheric carbon exchange and gross primary production (GPP) across vegetative ecosystems. However, estimating salt marsh LAI is challenging because canopy height and density vary across short distances, and tidal flooding alters the atmosphere-exposed leaf area, hereafter called emergent leaf area index (ELAI), at short time scales. Further, in tidal wetlands dominated by species such as Spartina alterniflora, canopy height and density vary across short distances. We present a novel approach for measuring spatiotemporal dynamics in tidal wetland ELAI. We modeled ELAI from vertical LAI profiles and created spatial estimates across tidal periods. We then linked ELAI with eddy covariance carbon (C) fluxes through footprint modeling and revealed correlations between emergent leaf area and C fluxes. Next, we demonstrated that ELAI can be readily estimated across 10-m spatial scales using Sentinel-2 satellite data, even during high tides (R2 = 0.89; NRMSE = 10%). Finally, we showed a common product, MODIS MYD15A2H, underestimated (20%) LAI during dry conditions but overestimated (7-93%) during high flooding. Dynamic ELAI could reduce uncertainties in satellite-derived global GPP products when developing blue carbon budgets for ecosystems threatened by accelerated sea level rise.

Governing wildfire in a global change context: lessons from water management in the Netherlands	FIRE ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						Adaptive management; Wildfire; Risk management; Participation; Stakeholder engagement; Prevention; Holistic approach; Netherlands; Disaster risk reduction; Water management	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIRE MANAGEMENT; URBAN INTERFACE; LANDSCAPES; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; CAPACITY; SCIENCE; SYSTEM	Background Wildfire management is increasingly shifting from firefighting to wildfire prevention aiming at disaster risk reduction. This implies fuel and landscape management and engagement with stakeholders. This transition is comparable to the history of water management in the Netherlands, which shifted from fighting against water to flood risk reduction and living with water. Here, we draw lessons from water management for integrated fire management that are useful for society, agencies, and government. To this end, we review the literature on integrated and adaptive water management in the Netherlands. Results Based on the results, we argue that (1) a holistic and integrated approach, (2) adaptive management, and (3) resilient landscapes through stakeholder participation are necessary to improve the resilience against and prevention of wildfires within integrated fire management. Conclusion To make society more resilient to wildfires and shift to a greater focus on prevention within disaster risk reduction, there is a need to take a more long-term perspective and include a wider range of stakeholders to develop new wildfire policies. Integrated fire management should facilitate and promote community initiatives to implement fire risk reduction measures in different landscapes and the wildland urban interface (WUI) including the use of nature-based solutions. Inspired by the successes in Dutch water management, fire management needs greater participation of stakeholders and collaboration between stakeholders to share responsibility and knowledge to make wildfire prevention more attractive and implementable by society, landowners, civil protection, and policymakers.

J	Punzo, G; Arbabi, H				Punzo, Giuliano; Arbabi, Hadi			The intrinsic cybernetics of large complex systems and how droughts turn into floods	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Systemic resilience; Cybernetics; Water security; Brisbane flood	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; MANAGEMENT; CITY; INFRASTRUCTURE; IMPACTS	The cyber-physical nature of engineering systems requires the smooth integration of decision making across soft and hard infrastructure. This need is common to any systems where decision making considers multiple complex systems such as the climate, the natural and built environment, and the dynamics of large organisations. As an example, in the Anthropocene, acute droughts and floods cannot only be imputed to more extreme variations of the climate patterns, but also to the alteration of the habitable environment and of the resources that support it, hence to their governance and management. In this discussion paper we present arguments about the extent to which the natural environment is modified to support urbanisation. We expose the cyber-physical nature of large infrastructure systems taking as an exam-ple the events of the 2011 Brisbane flood and the operations of the damming system of the river Brisbane. Using literature resources and data, we show how flood defence devices had to provide for a population of almost 2 million people, while being engineered when the population was less than one million, with increase in water withdrawal mainly due to resi-dential utilities. We show how the cyber-physical aspects of the problem materialised in moth-long delays in the gover-nance and management structure and made the flood event transcend the boundary of a purely climatic or engineering incident. Looking beyond the Brisbane example, our conclusions point at overcoming the discontinuity between opera-tion, management and political layers when operating on cyber-physical systems such as freshwater networks.

J	Custódio, DA; Ghisi, E				Custodio, Diego Antonio; Ghisi, Enedir			Impact of residential rainwater harvesting on stormwater runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Rainwater harvesting; Residential buildings; Stormwater runoff; Floods; Computer simulation	GREEN ROOFS; URBAN; SYSTEMS; URBANIZATION; MITIGATION; BASIN	Population increase, climate change and soil impermeability are factors causing floods in large urban centres. Such places also always have water shortage problems. This research aims to evaluate the influence of rainwater harvesting in residential buildings on stormwater in a basin located in southern Brazil (Rio Cachoeira Basin). Urbanised and non-urbanised areas, soil types, curve numbers and time of concentration of each sub-basin were taken into account. Through the HEC-HMS programme, it was possible to calculate hydrographs for the base scenario (when there is no rainwater harvesting). Then, rainwater tanks for the residential buildings were sized using the computer programme Netuno. In the second scenario, there is rainwater harvesting in all residential buildings. Thus, the hydrographs for the second scenario were also calculated. The peak flow reduction poten-tials for the sub-basins ranged from 2.7% to 14.3%. The highest percentage (14.3%) did not occur in the sub -basin with the most extensive roof area; such highest peak flow reduction occurred in Bom Retiro sub-basin. In Bom Retiro sub-basin, there are more houses than multi-storey residential buildings. Even when considering the full potential of rainwater harvesting for roof areas of all existing buildings in the Rio Cachoeira Basin, the average potential reduction in peak flow was 7.2%. The conclusion is that rainwater tanks in residential buildings have little influence on stormwater runoff, and the stormwater runoff will be less affected when the area of the hydrographic basin is larger. Thus, the reduction in peak flows is insignificant when considering the flooding in the region.

Modeling the Role of Compaction in the Three-Dimensional Evolution of Depositional Environments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						autocompaction; depositional environments; modeling; evolving domain; adaptive mesh	SEA-LEVEL RISE; DIMENSIONAL VERTICAL FLOW; SEDIMENT COMPACTION; HOLOCENE EVOLUTION; OXBOW LAKES; DELTA; AUTOCOMPACTION; SUBSIDENCE; EQUATION; RIVER	Natural environments such as coastal wetlands, lowland river floodplains, and deltas are formed by sediment, transported by watercourses and the sea, and deposited over century to millennium timescales. These dynamic environments host vulnerable ecosystems with an essential role for biodiversity conservation, coastal protection and human activities. The body of these landforms consists of unconsolidated sediments with high porosity and compressibility. Consequently, they often experience significant compaction due to their own weight, that is, autocompaction, which creates an important feedback within the geomorphological evolution of the landform. However, this process is generally oversimplified in morphological simulators. We present a novel finite element (FE) simulator that quantifies the impact of natural compaction on landform evolution in a three-dimensional setting. The model couples a groundwater flow and a compaction module that interact in a time-evolving domain following landform aggradation. The model input consists of sedimentation varying in time, space and sediment type. A Lagrangian approach underlies the model by means of an adaptive mesh. The number of FEs gradually increases to accommodate newly deposited sediments and each FE changes its shape, that is, becomes compressed, following sediment compaction. We showcase the model capabilities by simulating three long-term depositional processes at different spatial scales: (a) vertical growth of a tidal marsh, (b) infilling of an oxbow lake, and (c) progradation of a delta lobe. Our simulations show that compaction is the primary process governing the elevation and geomorphological evolution of these landforms. This highlights that autocompaction is an important process that determines the resilience of these low-lying landforms to climate change.	[Xotta, R.; Zoccarato, C.; Minderhoud, P. S.

In this context, we assessed the spatial occupancy, local abundance, and diel activity in three forest columbid species of hunting interest, the Ruddy Quail-Dove (RQD), Geotrygon montana; the Bridled Quail-Dove (BQD), Geotrygon mystacea; and the Zenaida Dove (ZD), Zenaida aurita, in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), using 5 camera-traps over 14 days on 24 survey stations, resulting in 1680 trap days. The number of observed RQD was too small to allow for a statistical comparison between habitats. BQD were more frequently observed at camera-trap stations that were dominated by tropical rainforest than those that were dominated by flooded forest. Conversely, ZD were more frequently observed at stations that were dominated by flooded forest and dry forest than at those that were dominated by tropical rainforest. High temperatures negatively affected the abundance of BQD, while the abundance of ZD was significantly lower in tropical rainforests compared to dry and flooded forests and tended to increase with canopy openness. The three species were diurnal. BQD significantly positively co-occurred spatially and temporally with small Indian mongooses, Urva auropunctata, whereas the temporal and spatial distribution of ZD overlapped significantly with that of domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, and domestic cats, Felis catus. Our results provide firm evidence that RQD remains scarce and is largely outnumbered by BQD in Guadeloupe which is in contrast with has been reported for other Caribbean islands.

We use Scotland as a case study. Here, like in other parts of Europe, communities there are greater expectations and responsibilities placed on communities to tackle water concerns. In this context, frontline workers are required to collaborate closely with communities to encourage their involvement in public services whilst being more attentive to their needs and concerns. Doing so brings the relationship between the frontline workers and communities into focus. In water services, a research gap exists as to how frontline workers interact with communities and influence engagement. Although frontline workers in water services have a highly influential role, evidence of how they perform their daily duties remains limited. This gap hinders understanding the challenges that frontline workers experience and how they can be overcome. Responding to this gap, we look to administration and policy studies, where a tradition of studying frontline workers exists in diverse public policy areas. Using the concepts of biasing, aligning and negotiating, we explore the activities of frontline workers. Using interview and observational data, we demonstrate how they (i) bias services to limit and control engagement, (ii) align resources and people to enhance opportunities for engagement and (iii) negotiate with colleagues and communities to deliver goals. We unpack the role of frontline workers and explore their pertinent position in water governance as they work inside and outside their organisations. We finish with conclusions and future avenues for research.

Both interact and contribute to crop productivity at the expense of nutrients and future water sustainability. The objective of this study was to understand the on-farm potential response of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) to water management practices in rice farming within the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. Soil samples were collected from three villages in the study area at four depths: 0-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 cm. Four water management regimes, namely: A = traditional flooding (rainfed) without intensification of rice farming; B = traditional flooding (rainfed) involving a system of rice intensification (SRI); C = alternative wetting and drying (AWD) involving SRI for one cropping season; D = abandoned fields (fallow); and E = AWD involving SRI for two cropping seasons, were investigated as regards their impact on SOC, TN, and TP. There were significant (p < 0.05) effects of water management regimes on SOC, TN, and TP. AWD involving SRI for one cropping season indicated a positive effect on SOC and TN across all depths as compared to other practices. We conclude that water management practice that involves AWD with SRI for one cropping season is a plausible approach to maintaining high SOC and TN, with the potential for increasing crop production while minimizing water consumption.

It is aimed at monitoring holistically the land use change and flooding situation in the region, addressing the reasons for land use change, and assessing the impacts of land use change on hydraulic aspects and farmer livelihoods during the last 21 years. MODIS products, in particular, are used to study the dynamics of land use and floods after demonstrating high validation with statistical data and radar satellites, with R-2 = 0.96 and R-2 >= 0.97 for land use and flood maps, respectively. The results show that rice cultivation is the most dominant land use type, accounting for 40% to 46% of the delta area, while aquaculture accounts for 10% to 22%, respectively. The total rice cultivation area increased from 3764 thousand hectares (thous. ha) in 2001 to 4343 thous. ha in 2015 based on the intensive development of triple rice cropping in the upper zone, then decreased to 3963 thous. ha in 2020. In contrast, aquaculture areas are farmed mainly in the coastal area and remained relatively steady, increasing slightly from 619 thous. ha in 2001 to 856 thous. ha in 2020. The massive construction of dikes for triple rice cropping in the upper zone appears to cause a significant impact on the annual flooding regime. Land use policies have influenced the changes in land use patterns, flooding situations, and the livelihoods of local farmers. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Study focus: Climate change and urbanization pose a serious threat to rising water levels and flooding in the estuary region. In particular, tidal river, which is located in the estuary area, is impacted by many hydrological factors such as tide, wave height, and rainfall. This paper develops a new rating curve that can predict the water level of the tidal river. It also assesses the accuracy of the developed rating curve through the verification event. New hydrological insights: Tidal rivers show non-linear hydrological characteristics that are influenced by various hydrological factors. Thus, no rating curve has been developed for them. This study proposes a method to develop a rating curve that can estimate the water level by using the runoff from rainfall in a tidal river. To develop the rating curve, the water level at Ulsan station, Korea was decomposed into four components, which are tide, wave, noise and runoff component by using wavelet analysis, curve fitting, and a high pass filter. A distributed grid-based rainfall-runoff model (GRM) was applied to simulate the runoff. The simulated runoff and the water level components influenced by rainfall were used to develop a rating curve and estimate the water level from the simulated runoff. The results were then added to the other three components (tide, wave, noise) to calculate an integrated water level, which was compared with the observed water level at Ulsan station. With less than 10 % error during validation, the results are expected to contribute to the accurate prediction of water level of tidal river during flood season.

Shaping urbanization to achieve communities resilient to floods	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						urbanization; adaptation policies; flood risk; resilience; urban planning	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SAN-FRANCISCO; LAND-USE; IMPACT	Flood risk is increasing in urban communities due to climate change and socioeconomic development. Socioeconomic development is a major cause of urban expansion in flood-prone regions, as it places more physical, economic, and social infrastructure at risk. Moreover, in light of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations, it has become an international imperative to move toward sustainable cities. Current approaches to quantify this risk use scenario-based methods involving arbitrary projections of city growth. These methods seldom incorporate geographical, social, and economic factors associated with urbanization and cannot mimic city growth under various urban development plans. In this paper, we introduce a framework for understanding the interactions between urbanization and flood risk as an essential ingredient for flood risk management. This framework integrates an urban growth model with a hazard model to explore flood risk under various urban development scenarios. We then investigate the effectiveness of coupling nonstructural flood mitigation measures-in terms of urban planning policies and socioeconomic incentives-with urban growth processes to achieve sustainable and resilient communities. Using this framework, we can not only simulate urban expansion dynamics through time and its effect on flood risk but also model the growth of a region under various urban planning policies and assess the effectiveness of these measures in reducing flood risk. Our analysis reveals that while current urban development plans may put more people and assets at flood risk, the nonstructural strategies considered in this study mitigated the consequences of floods. Such a framework could be used to assist city planners and stakeholders in examining tradeoffs between costs and benefits of future land development in achieving sustainable and resilient cities.

Estimating regional susceptibility of glacial lakes has largely relied on qualitative assessments by experts, thus motivating a more systematic and quantitative appraisal. Before the backdrop of current climate-change projections and the potential of elevation-dependent warming, an objective and regionally consistent assessment is urgently needed. We use an inventory of 3390 moraine-dammed lakes and their documented outburst history in the past four decades to test whether elevation, lake area and its rate of change, glaciermass balance, and monsoonality are useful inputs to a probabilistic classification model. We implement these candidate predictors in four Bayesian multi-level logistic regression models to estimate the posterior susceptibility to GLOFs. We find that mostly larger lakes have been more prone to GLOFs in the past four decades regardless of the elevation band in which they occurred. We also find that including the regional average glacier-mass balance improves the model classification. In contrast, changes in lake area and monsoonality play ambiguous roles. Our study provides first quantitative evidence that GLOF susceptibility in the HKKHN scales with lake area, though less so with its dynamics. Our probabilistic prognoses offer improvement compared to a random classification based on average GLOF frequency. Yet they also reveal some major uncertainties that have remained largely unquantified previously and that challenge the applicability of single models. Ensembles of multiple models could be a viable alternative for more accurately classifying the susceptibility of moraine-dammed lakes to GLOFs.

Recently, these models have been developed at continental scales with applications in operational flood forecasting, hydrologic prediction, and process representation. As use of large-scale model configurations increases, it is exceedingly important to have a common method for performance evaluation and validation, particularly given challenges associated with accurately representing large domains. Here, we present phase 1 of a comparison project for continental-scale, high-resolution, processed-based hydrologic models entitled the Continental Hydrologic Intercomparison Project (CHIP). The first phase of CHIP is based on past Earth System Model intercomparisons and comprised of a two-model proof of concept comparing the ParFlow-CONUS hydrologic model, version 1.0 and a NOAA US National Water Model configuration of WRF-Hydro, version 1.2. The objectives of CHIP phase 1 are: (a) describe model physics and components, (b) design an experiment to ensure a fair comparison, and (b) assess simulated streamflow with observations to better understand model bias. To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of continental-scale, high-resolution, physics-based models which incorporate lateral subsurface flow. This model intercomparison is an initial step toward a continued effort to unravel process, parameter, and formulation differences in current large-scale hydrologic models and to engage the hydrology community in improving hydrology model configuration and process representation.

For this reason, the prediction of such events usually deals with very accurate model tuning and validation, which is usually site-specific and based on climatological data, such as discharge time series or flood databases. In this work, we developed and tested two hydrological-stress indices for flood detection in the Italian Central Apennine District: a heterogeneous geographical area, characterized by complex topography and medium-to-small catchment extension. The proposed indices are threshold-based and developed considering operational requirements of National Civil Protection Department end-users. They are calibrated and tested through the application of signal theory, in order to overcome data scarcity over ungauged areas, as well as incomplete discharge time series. The validation has been carried out on a case study basis, using flood reports from various sources of information, as well as hydrometric-level time series, which represent the actual hydrological quantity monitored by Civil Protection operators. Obtained results show that the overall accuracy of flood prediction is greater than 0.8, with false alarm rates below 0.5 and the probability of detection ranging from 0.51 to 0.80. Moreover, the different nature of the proposed indices suggests their application in a complementary way, as the index based on drained precipitation appears to be more sensitive to rapid flood propagation in small tributaries, while the discharge-based index is particularly responsive to main-channel dynamics.

J	Carozza, DA; Boudreault, M				Carozza, David A.; Boudreault, Mathieu			A Global Flood Risk Modeling Framework Built With Climate Models and Machine Learning	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						flood determinants; flood risk management; global flood risk; statistical flood model	LOSSES	Large scale flood risk analyses are fundamental to many applications requiring national or international overviews of flood risk. While large-scale climate patterns such as teleconnections and climate change become important at this scale, it remains a challenge to represent the local hydrological cycle over various watersheds in a manner that is physically consistent with climate. As a result, global models tend to suffer from a lack of available scenarios and flexibility that are key for planners, relief organizations, regulators, and the financial services industry to analyze the socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic factors affecting exposure. Here we introduce a data-driven, global, fast, flexible, and climate-consistent flood risk modeling framework for applications that do not necessarily require high-resolution flood mapping. We use statistical and machine learning methods to examine the relationship between historical flood occurrence and impact from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (1985-2017), and climatic, watershed, and socioeconomic factors for 4,734 HydroSHEDS watersheds globally. Using bias-corrected output from the NCAR CESM Large Ensemble (1980-2020), and the fitted statistical relationships, we simulate 1 million years of events worldwide along with the population displaced in each event. We discuss potential applications of the model and present global flood hazard and risk maps. The main value of this global flood model lies in its ability to quickly simulate realistic flood events at a resolution that is useful for large-scale socioeconomic and financial planning, yet we expect it to be useful to climate and natural hazard scientists who are interested in socioeconomic impacts of climate.

The present study aims to use palynological, isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15 and C-14), and anthracological indicators in cores taken from three abandoned meander bends to make inferences about environmental evolution, vegetation reconstruction, and climatic inferences. The study area is located in the Mogi Guacu River Basin, in the countryside of Sao Paulo State. The studies show that similar to 2,730 BP (stage I), the area underwent through a more humid climatic phase compared to the current one, which allowed the expansion of the Riparian Semideciduous Forest. After that date, in stage II (1,800 to 510 BP), the percentage of the Cerrado (Cerradao Forest) increased, due to a drier period. From 510 BP to the present day (stage III), humidity has taken place with a new expansion of the Riparian Semideciduous Forest, although elements of Cerrado are present. Microscopic charcoal fragments were found in all stages and may infer the incidence of paleo-wildfires during the Late Holocene. The results indicate that both phytophysiognomies remained for the studied period, varying their expansion depending on the humidity present in each stage. Although lakes formed by abandoned meanders are not areas with the best palynological record, they are frequent environments in the interior of the continents. If properly interpreted, they may provide relevant information to vegetation and climatic changes for the areas.

Submergence impedes the cellular membrane integrity, consequently affecting the membrane fluidity. Different abiotic stresses influence membrane lipid composition. Therefore, the remodeling of membrane lipids plays a major role in stress adaptation. Submergence-induced membrane lipid peroxidation is well established in plants. However, dynamic changes in lipid composition for regulating submergence tolerance in rice remain so far unexplored. The present study explored the effect of submergence on the lipidomic profile of the Sub1 near-isogenic lines (NILs) of rice, viz. Swarna, and Swarna Sub1 with contrasting submergence tolerance. The study also examined the association of lipidomic alteration with the membrane integrity and submergence tolerance. Submergence caused increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was significantly higher in Swarna than Swarna Sub1. The lipid profile was also considerably altered under submergence. Following submergence, Swarna exhibited a significant decrease in phospholipid content accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage. Furthermore, the disintegration of the thylakoid membrane resulted in a significant decrease in the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis rate under submergence. Submergence-induced hypoxic condition also promoted starch depletion to fulfill the energy requirement. In contrast, submergence acclimation in Swarna Sub1 was associated with the shift to anaerobic respiration mediated by increased alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity. Effective ROS detoxification in Swarna Sub1 facilitated by increased antioxidant enzyme activities contributed to the submergence tolerance by maintaining membrane integrity and photosynthetic activity. The present study established the direct association of lipid remodeling with membrane integrity, cell viability, and photosynthesis and also devised a crop model to reveal the molecular background of submergence tolerance in plants.

J	White, L; Catterall, C; Taffs, K				White, Laura; Catterall, Claudia; Taffs, Kathryn			The effect of disturbance and drought on Hairy Jointgrass (<i>Arthraxon hispidus</i>) in north coast New South Wales: Understanding threatened species populations in a dynamic landscape	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arthraxon hispidus; Australia; biodiversity conservation; disturbance; drought; fire; grazing; slashing; wetlands	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT; FLOODING GRADIENT; GRAZING EXCLUSION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; FIRE REGIMES; BYRON SHIRE; VEGETATION; RESPONSES; IMPACTS	Ecological disturbances such as fire, grazing or mechanical cultivation can promote or suppress plant populations within vegetation communities. Therefore, such processes can threaten vulnerable species, or play a significant role in their conservation, so an understanding of a species' ecological response to disturbance is foundational to threatened species management. Various types of anthropogenic disturbance are listed as threats to the vulnerable-listed Arthraxon hispidus (Hairy Jointgrass) (Poaceae) in NSW; however, there is evidence that slashing, grazing and fire can stimulate the recruitment and establishment of this annual species in some circumstances. We undertook field experiments to investigate the effects of each of these disturbance regimes on A. hispidus populations over two growing seasons within modified wetlands/moist pastures in north coast NSW. We found that the application of fire in winter had a stronger promotional effect on A. hispidus recruitment than slashing, though both treatments increased its abundance and reduced the height and cover of surrounding vegetation, particularly exotic perennial grasses. Following initial establishment, A. hispidus declined under drought conditions during the study, and continuous grazing exacerbated this effect. Drought also increased the abundance of introduced species relative to native wetland species across the study sites. Results confirm that disturbance, particularly fire, can promote A. hispidus populations in some vegetation communities; however, climatic variation also plays a role in its population dynamics. Consideration of each of these factors and their potential interactions is important when developing conservation approaches for this threatened species.

This study provides a comparative assessment of the population exposed to flood hazards for the entire Conterminous United States and answers the following four fundamental questions: 1) how many people are exposed? 2) who are they? 3) how are they distributed? 4) how do the estimations from other floodplains differ from the estimations from FEMA floodplain? In light of the limitations of previous flood exposure studies in the U.S, this study uses the recently released Microsoft building footprint dataset to capture the heterogeneity of population distribution at the micro-level. The population at block group level from ACS 5-year estimates (2013-2017) is further disaggregated to residential buildings, identified via NLUD 2010 and OpenStreetMap Land Use polygons. A comparative study is then conducted to investigate the 100-year flood exposure from FEMA and from the other three publicly available 100-year floodplains. Although the exposure analysis shows varying spatial patterns for selected floodplains, it indicates that a large number of exposed residents are found in regions where FEMA floodplain product is unavailable, presumably responsible for the uncaptured losses reported from other studies. In addition, the inequitably high flood risk experienced by the poor revealed at the national level underscores the significance of flood vulnerability studies to emphasize the need for this vulnerable group.

Each 0.5°C of Warming Increases Annual Flood Losses in China by More than US$60 Billion	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; STATIONARITY; PROJECTIONS; REDUCTION; IMPACTS; HAZARD; EUROPE; DEAD	In the warming climate, flood risk is likely to increase over much of the globe. We present projections of changes of flood losses in China for a range of global warming scenarios, from 1.5 degrees to 4.0 degrees C above the preindustrial temperature, with a 0.5 degrees C step. Projections of flood losses in China are based on river runoff simulations by a distributed hydrological model driven by multiple downscaled general circulation models, the national GDP projected at shared socioeconomic pathways, and the "intensity-loss rate" function. When interpreting changes caused by the combined effect of economic and climatic conditions, flood losses in China are projected to soar in the future, particularly in lowland regions subject to rapid economic growth. Under global warming of 1.5 degrees and 4.0 degrees C, in an average year, flood losses are projected to be, respectively, 4 and 17 times that at present. Pursuing the international climate policy target of limiting global warming is projected to reduce exposure to floods in China. In this way, flood losses in China can be reduced by tens of billions of U.S. dollars (on average, US$67 billion and up to 0.04% of GDP) for each 0.5 degrees C that warming is reduced. Our study improves understanding of the impact of climatic and nonclimatic changes on flood risk. Our scientific contribution is the first study to quantify flood impacts across China under different development pathways (shared socioeconomic pathways) for a broad range of global warming levels.

Integrating collapse theories to understand socio-ecological systems resilience	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						socio-ecological systems; societal collapse; robustness; resilience; environmental change; El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)	DYNAMICS; SUSTAINABILITY; HISTORY; MAYA	The world is facing new environmental challenges that may trigger the collapse of some social-ecological systems (SES). More extreme weather events may be much more common in the decades to come due to climate change. Although we have an idea of what climatic events to expect in each region, we know less about how SES can cope with these challenges. We study The Peruvian Piura Basin, which has been exposed to harsh environmental events associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for centuries. The Piura basin was home to the ancient Moche civilization, which collapsed due to a combination of factors, but strong El Nino events likely played a significant role. To analyze the resilience of The Piura Basin to flood events, we used as guidance the Robustness Framework and different propositions from prominent collapse theories to carry out a longitudinal study based on both primary and collected secondary data. We found that the Piura basin is very fragile based on almost all of the predictions of collapse theories (especially with respect to selfish elites, centralized governance, systems interconnection, anticipation capacity and sensitive dependence on resources), but the biggest strength is its growing stock of social capital. In small steps, user associations have been collectively working towards solutions for water conservation and public-infrastructure maintenance. There is a long way to go, but with the right policies to encourage the strengthening of these associations, the Piura basin could become more resilient to future El Nino events. This study also provides methodological and theoretical insights that can contribute to theory building for the resilience of SES.

An increase in worldwide Earth surface temperatures has been already observed, together with an increase in the intensity of other abiotic stress conditions such as water deficit, high salinity, heavy metal intoxication, etc., generating harmful conditions that destabilize agricultural systems. Stress conditions deeply affect physiological, metabolic and morphological traits of plant roots, essential organs for plant survival as they provide physical anchorage to the soil, water and nutrient uptake, mechanisms for stress avoidance, specific signals to the aerial part and to the biome in the soil, etc. However, most of the work performed until now has been mainly focused on aerial organs and tissues. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the effects of different abiotic stress conditions on root molecular and physiological responses. First, we revise the methods used to study these responses (omics and phenotyping techniques). Then, we will outline how environmental stress conditions trigger various signals in roots for allowing plant cells to sense and activate the adaptative responses. Later, we discuss on some of the main regulatory mechanisms controlling root adaptation to stress conditions, the interplay between hormonal regulatory pathways and the global changes on gene expression and protein homeostasis. We will present recent advances on how the root system integrates all these signals to generate different physiological responses, including changes in morphology, long distance signaling and root exudation. Finally, we will discuss the new prospects and challenges in this field.

Review article: Natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Review							EXTREME SEA LEVELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; FLOOD RISK; PROBABILISTIC ASSESSMENT; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; FRAGILITY CURVES; BUILDING DAMAGE; DROUGHT RISK; EXPOSURE	Since 1990, natural hazards have led to over 1.6 million fatalities globally, and economic losses are estimated at an average of around USD260-310 billion per year. The scientific and policy communities recognise the need to reduce these risks. As a result, the last decade has seen a rapid development of global models for assessing risk from natural hazards at the global scale. In this paper, we review the scientific literature on natural hazard risk assessments at the global scale, and we specifically examine whether and how they have examined future projections of hazard, exposure, and/or vulnerability. In doing so, we examine similarities and differences between the approaches taken across the different hazards, and we identify potential ways in which different hazard communities can learn from each other. For example, there are a number of global risk studies focusing on hydrological, climatological, and meteorological hazards that have included future projections and disaster risk reduction measures (in the case of floods), whereas fewer exist in the peer-reviewed literature for global studies related to geological hazards. On the other hand, studies of earthquake and tsunami risk are now using stochastic modelling approaches to allow for a fully probabilistic assessment of risk, which could benefit the modelling of risk from other hazards. Finally, we discuss opportunities for learning from methods and approaches being developed and applied to assess natural hazard risks at more continental or regional scales. Through this paper, we hope to encourage further dialogue on knowledge sharing between disciplines and communities working on different hazards and risk and at different spatial scales.

J	Totaro, V; Gioia, A; Iacobellis, V				Totaro, Vincenzo; Gioia, Andrea; Iacobellis, Vito			Numerical investigation on the power of parametric and nonparametric tests for trend detection in annual maximum series	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							EXTREME-VALUE ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RETURN PERIOD; MANN-KENDALL; RISK; STATIONARITY; NONSTATIONARITY; EVENTS	The need to fit time series characterized by the presence of a trend or change points has generated increased interest in the investigation of nonstationary probability distributions in recent years. Considering that the available hydrological time series can be recognized as the observable part of a stochastic process with a definite probability distribution, two main topics can be tackled in this context: the first is related to the definition of an objective criterion for choosing whether the stationary hypothesis can be adopted, whereas the second regards the effects of nonstationarity on the estimation of distribution parameters and quantiles for an assigned return period and flood risk evaluation. Although the time series trend or change points are usually detected using nonparametric tests available in the literature (e.g., Mann-Kendall or CUSUM test), the correct selection of the stationary or nonstationary probability distribution is still required for design purposes. In this light, the focus is shifted toward model selection criteria; this implies the use of parametric methods, including all of the issues related to parameter estimation. The aim of this study is to compare the performance of parametric and nonparametric methods for trend detection, analyzing their power and focusing on the use of traditional model selection tools (e.g., the Akaike information criterion and the likelihood ratio test) within this context. The power and efficiency of parameter estimation, including the trend coefficient, were investigated via Monte Carlo simulations using the generalized extreme value distribution as the parent with selected parameter sets.

Hydraulic analysis, using the Sedimentation and River Hydraulic-2D model (SRH-2D), shows that the responsible peak paleoflood discharges ranged between 500 and 7500 m(3) /s. At least 14 of these paleoflood discharge peaks exceed a level twice that of the maximum systematic record of gauged flows: 1929 m(3)/s. Geochronological analyses, employing optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating techniques, demonstrate that these 14 largest paleoflood peaks occurred during the past 700 years. Integration of the paleoflood data into flood frequency analyses (FFA) reveals considerably higher values for the upper tails of the flood distribution than does a FFA based solely on the systematic gauged record, indicating that extreme floods are larger and more frequent than implied by the relatively short gauged record. Through examination of three approaches to extreme flood estimation - conventional FFA, probable maximum flood estimation (PMF), and paleoflood hydrology (PFH) - we show the significance of the natural evidence for advancing scientific understanding of extreme floods that naturally occur in the Colorado River system. We argue that this kind of scientific understanding is absolutely essential for achieving a credible evaluation of extreme flood risk in a watershed of immense importance to economic prosperity of the southwestern U.S.	[Liu, Tao; Baker, Victor R.; Ji, Lin] Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Liu, Tao; Onken, Jill] Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Greenbaum, Noam] Univ Haifa, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Haifa, Israel; [Weisheit, John] Living Rivers, Moab, UT USA; [Porat, Naomi] Geol Survey Israel, Lab Luminescence Dating, Jerusalem, Israel; [Rittenour, Tammy] Utah State Univ, Dept Geol, Logan, UT 84322 USA	University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Haifa; Geological Survey Israel; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University	Liu, T; Baker, VR (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Hydrol & Atmospher Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Liu, T (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Geosci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.	liutao@email.arizona.edu; baker@email.arizona.edu	Rittenour, Tammy/H-7916-2013; Porat, Naomi/R-1474-2019; Liu, Tao/AAO-8419-2021	Liu, Tao/0000-0002-7394-9415; Porat, Naomi/0000-0002-5900-2460; Rittenour, Tammy/0000-0003-1925-0395	U.S. Bureau of Reclamation [R16AC00021]; U.S. National Science Foundation	U.S. Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))	This research was supported by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation under Assistance Agreement no.

Time-Varying Emulator for Short and Long-Term Analysis of Coastal Flood Hazard Potential	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						coastal hazards; extreme events; climate variability; statistical modeling; compound events	MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; WATER LEVELS; JOINT PROBABILITY; CLIMATE EMULATOR; WAVE CLIMATE; EXTREME; SCALE; VARIABILITY; EROSION; MODEL	Rising seas coupled with ever increasing coastal populations present the potential for significant social and economic loss in the 21st century. Relatively short records of the full multidimensional space contributing to total water level coastal flooding events (astronomic tides, sea level anomalies, storm surges, wave run-up, etc.) result in historical observations of only a small fraction of the possible range of conditions that could produce severe flooding. The Time-varying Emulator for Short- and Long-Term analysis of coastal flood hazard potential is presented here as a methodology capable of producing new iterations of the sea-state parameters associated with the present-day Pacific Ocean climate to simulate many synthetic extreme compound events. The emulator utilizes weather typing of fundamental climate drivers (sea surface temperatures, sea level pressures, etc.) to reduce complexity and produces new daily synoptic weather chronologies with an auto-regressive logistic model accounting for conditional dependencies on the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, seasonality, and the prior two days of weather progression. Joint probabilities of sea-state parameters unique to simulated weather patterns are used to create new time series of the hypothetical components contributing to synthetic total water levels (swells from multiple directions coupled with water levels due to wind setup, temperature anomalies, and tides). The Time-varying Emulator for Short- and Long-Term analysis of coastal flood hazard potential reveals the importance of considering the multivariate nature of extreme coastal flooding, while progressing the ability to incorporate large-scale climate variability into site specific studies assessing hazards within the context of predicted climate change in the 21st century.

This study aims to establish what horizontal resolution and physical process settings are suitable for the first ensemble of convection-permitting climate projections for the United Kingdom. For this purpose, 12-year-long simulations were run using three different convection-permitting resolutions (grid spacing of 4 km, 2.2 km and 1.5 km) each with several configurations. The focus is on the ability to represent sub-daily precipitation due to its potential for high impacts on society through flooding. The analysis shows that the use of a finer grid spacing within the convection-permitting regime improves the representation of sub-daily precipitation but the added value decreases as the grid becomes increasingly finer, while the computational costs substantially increase. Changes in the representation of physical processes can have as much impact as the grid spacing and can lead to similar differences in the diurnal cycle as between convection-parametrized models and CPMs. Although the 4km model shows some key deficiencies that make it unreliable for climate projection, the 2.2km model performs as well as the 1.5km model for most of the metrics examined with considerable benefits in terms of computer cost. The optimal configuration and resolution identified here is being used for an ensemble of simulations run within the UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) project, which allows, for the first time, an estimate of uncertainty in future changes at convection-permitting scale and providing more reliable climate change projections at local and hourly scales.

Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of flash floods can help emergency managers and stakeholders in devising solutions to mitigate the associated risks and damages. In this study, a data-driven approach is employed to characterize flash flood hazard across the contiguous United States (CONUS). The National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Events database is utilized, and a total of 74,814 flash flood events are assessed during 1996-2017. The frequency, duration, property damages, and fatalities of flash floods are investigated across spatial domains (i.e. county, state, regional, and entire CONUS) and multiple temporal scales (i.e. annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal). Results indicate that flash flood frequency has slightly increased over the CONUS in the past 22 years, and the property damages have substantially raised. Flash floods are found to be more frequent in summer and less frequent but longer in winter. Our analyses indicate distinct regional patterns for duration of median versus extreme flash floods. In addition, the diurnal distribution of flash floods indicate that they are more likely to initiate in the evening and terminate around midnight. The average duration of flash floods in the past 22 years has been about 3.5 h, yet in some rare cases, they persisted for about two days. The findings of this study can shed light on flash flood hazard across the CONUS, which can be useful for mitigating flash flood risks.

Deposition and provenance of the Early Pleistocene Siliceous Member in Westbury Cave, Somerset, England	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Cave sedimentation; Clast lithology; Early Pleistocene; Palaeomagnetic dating; Siliceous Member; Westbury Cave	HUMAN OCCUPATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTHERN NETHERLANDS; RIVER THAMES; EAST-ANGLIA; QUATERNARY; LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; BRITAIN; HISTORY	The Early Pleistocene is an important interval in the Quaternary period as a time not only of climatic and environmental change, but also of key events in human evolution. However, knowledge of this period in northwest Europe is hampered by the limited extent of deposits of this age. Westbury Cave in the Mendip Hills of Somerset preserves an understudied example of fossil-bearing Early Pleistocene sediments, with rare potential to inform our understanding of British Early Pleistocene stratigraphy and landscape evolution outside the East Anglian Crag Basin. This study identifies the processes responsible for deposition of the Early Pleistocene Siliceous Member in Westbury Cave, thereby aiding taphonomic and palaeoenvironmental interpretations of associated fossil assemblages. New excavations revealed over ten metres of Siliceous Member stratigraphy, dominated by fine-grained silts/clays with interbedded sands and gravels, interpreted as being deposited within a subterranean lake or flooded conduit with fluvial input. All sediments sampled were reversely magnetised and are assigned to the Matuyama Reversed Chron. Lithological analysis of gravel clasts revealed variable components of durable non-local and non-durable local clasts. Gravels containing the latter are interpreted as distal talus slope deposits, and those lacking non-durable lithologies as stream or flood deposits. However, it remains unclear from available data whether apparently non-local clasts were sourced from long distance or stem from a more local, now denuded catchment. Siliceous Member bio- and magnetostratigraphy suggest that deposition occurred late in the Early Pleistocene, a period apparently otherwise unrepresented in the UK.

Characterizing the Indian Ocean sea level changes and potential coastal flooding impacts under global warming	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Flooding; Indian Ocean; Interpolation; Inundation mapping; Sea level	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTERPOLATION; VARIABILITY; INFERENCE; MOTION; RISE	The Indian Ocean which is home to many islands and the low-lying coastal zones have attracted considerable attention due to regional sea level changes. In this study, we examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. Various interpolation methods are evaluated to predict values at locations where data is unavailable. Based on the cross-validation analysis, the radial basis function is identified as the most optimal interpolation method and is used to analyze the spatial patterns of sea level changes. The analysis reveals that Bangladesh, Seychelles, and Cocos (Keeling) Islands have relatively high rates of sea level rise. These regions would thus be highly vulnerable to coastal flooding induced by the accelerating sea level rise in future decades, posing significant threats to coastal communities and ecosystems. Flooding impacts are examined through inundation mapping in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. In addition, relationships between regional factors (sea surface temperature, air temperature, and vertical land motions) affecting sea level rise are investigated. Our findings indicate that vertical land motion is an important factor affecting sea level changes for the regions of Seychelles and Cocos Islands. There is a strong relationship between air temperature and sea level rise for all studied regions. This study is a first attempt to examine regional changes in sea level of the Indian Ocean and potential coastal flooding impacts by using tide gauge data. The methods used in this study can be applied to other coastal regions around the world.	[Carvalho, K.

In tropics, climate change will severely impact livestock production affecting water availability, forage quality and food for cattle. We investigated the isolated and combined effects of soil water deficit (wS) and + 2 degrees C increase in canopy temperature (eT) on leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, carbohydrate content, forage quality and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of a field-grown C4 tropical forage grass Panicum maximum Jacq. using a temperature-free air-controlled enhancement (T-FACE) system. The wS and eT treatments showed no effects on photosystem II photochemistry. However, wS under ambient temperature decreased net photosynthesis rate (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and maximum rate of carboxylation of Rubisco (V-cmax), leading to a reduced starch content in leaves. A 16% reduction in leaf dry mass (LDM) and reduction in forage quality by increasing fibers, reducing crude protein (CP) and decreasing the IVDMD was also observed by effect of wS. Warming under adequate soil moisture (eT) significantly increased LDM by 25% but reduced the forage quality, increasing the lignin content and reducing starch, CP and digestibility. The combined wSeT treatment reduced A, g(s), V-cmax and the forage quality. When compared to control, the lignin content in leaves increased by 43, 28 and 17% in wS, eT and wSeT, respectively, causing a significant reduction in IVDMD. We concluded that despite physiological mechanisms to acclimate to warming, both warming and water deficit will impair the quality and digestibility of C4 tropical pastures.

J	Dimelisová, E				Dimelisova, Eleni			Possibilities and limits in the management of mountain watersheds: Lessons from the Maya civilization	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Mountain watersheds; Downhill impacts; Maya settlements; Land use policy		This study focused on three pre-Columbian centres of the Maya society: Kaminaljuyu, Copan and Tikal. Historical method was used to compare their development in relation to the hydrological regime. Kaminaljuyu is based on a catchment-lake relationship, Copan on a downstream impact of a large mountain watershed, and Tikal represents an upland settlement based on a headwater spot. The main aim is to analyse water management of these centres, particularly, in view of their rise and collapse. Selected ancient Maya centres used very sophisticated water management systems with several signs of environmental and social implications. That water technology ensured their economic prosperity and consolidation of the administrative and political power for a long time. The water supply of the Maya settlement faced a serious impact of seasonal rainfall with relatively long dry periods (4-5 months) as well as fast runoff formation in the karstified bedrock. While in the Copan centre, surrounded by a large mountain watershed, the flood control was the highest priority, headwater located Kaminaljuyu and Tikal concentrated mainly on the harvest and storage of rain water. Later, these centres had to adapt to the increasing population, changing society, environment and landuse. For a long time their water management was able to adapt to the increasing demand of water and decreasing recharge of water resources. The exact reason of the collapse of these Maya centres was probably a superposition of the climate change, overexploitation of natural resources, and exceeding the carrying capacity of their environment. All those societies reached an extremely high level of hydraulic engineering, but, they were still limited in knowledge of hydrology and watershed management. Finally, it was probably a series of extreme droughts leaded to their final collapse.

J	Lombardi, R; Davis, MAL				Lombardi, Ray; Davis, M. A. Lisa			Incorporating alluvial hydrogeomorphic complexities into paleoflood hydrology, magnitude estimation and flood frequency analysis, Tennessee River, Alabama	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Paleoflood hydrology; Floodplain aggradation; Bayesian flood frequency; Alluvial rivers	UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; SEDIMENTATION; RECORD; VALLEY; STREAM; DELTA; RATES	Extreme floods are underrepresented in stream gauge records. Sedimentological evidence of past floods (paleofloods) yields longer records, allowing extreme floods to be examined over several Holocene climate periods. This study examines the influence of hydrogeomorphic complexity (floodplain aggradation and spatially variable flood deposition) on paleoflood record "completeness" and their implications for flood magnitude estimates made with paleoflood hydrologic data. We collected two sediment cores 500 m apart from the same elevation on a natural levee along a bank of the Tennessee River near Guntersville, Alabama. We measured grain size from each core at a 1-cm resolution using a Malvern 3000 laser granulometer. Optically stimulated luminescence dating of flood deposits revealed approximate age ranges of 50 - 6500 years calibrated before present (yrs. B.P.) for the downstream 3.5 m core (i.e., BO1) and 190 - 8500 yrs. B.P. for the upstream 4.18 m core (i.e., EL2). First, a sensitivity analysis revealed adjusted floodplain elevations (AFE) for each paleoflood cross-sectional geometry to reflect floodplain aggradation over time enabled the detection of paleoflood magnitude differences, suggesting floodplain aggradation should be considered in paleoflood reconstruction within alluvial settings. Minimum paleodischarge intervals were estimated in a 1D HEC-RAS step backwater model by calculating the minimum paleoflood stage needed to transport the d90 of each paleoflood deposit. Big Oak and East Levee 2 sediment cores each contained 15 high magnitude, identifiable paleofloods. The majority of the BO1 paleofloods occurred in the last 2,000 years, while most EL2 paleofloods occurred between 2,000 and 5,000 yrs. B.P., suggesting localized geomorphic complexity produced distinct paleoflood records for the same hydrogeomorphic surface. Four paleoflood events correlate across the two cores based on their ages and grain size distributions, and we combined these four floods to create a `harmonized' flood chronology for the site. The timing of these four floods corresponds with paleofloods that occurred in the last 2000 years in the middle section of the Tennessee River identified by prior paleoflood hydrologic studies. Flood frequency analysis (Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) scenarios with ten configurations of paleoflood hydrologic data revealed differences in the number and timing of paleofloods in three paleoflood chronologies (BO1, EL2, and the harmonized) resulting from hydrogeomorphic complexities affected model distribution parameters, goodness-of-fit, and the estimated discharges of annual exceedance probabilities used to inform the design of critical flood infrastructure. As a consequence of longer records containing smaller floods, the estimated discharge of the 0.01 (100-yr), 0.001 (1000-yr), and 0.0001 (10,000-years) AEPs for EL2 were 16%, 11%, and 5% smaller, respectively, than BO1 estimates. Alluvial rivers present more challenges for reconstructing paleoflood records than bedrock, confined channel settings. The strategies presented in this paper can help integrate paleoflood hydrologic data into flood frequency analyses for alluvial rivers identifying and minimizing error stemming from hydrogeomorphic complexity. These strategies offer opportunities to expand the use of paleoflood hydrologic data in flood frequency analyses to include more rivers located in temperate environments where climate change is intensifying precipitation and a compelling need exists to anticipate and plan for changes in extreme flood occurrence.

The analysis was based on baseflow separation and resulting baseflow index (BFI). The year 2020 was intentionally chosen as a way to reflect the expected effects of climate change in the region where more extreme hydroclimatic events are expected. Our team demonstrated that in case of hydroclimatic extremes, there are significant differences in the runoff response from these catchments, depending especially on the tree species composition in the forest stands. Three forest types with the predominance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and mixed forest were analyzed. The observed different values of BFI were interpreted in relation to the ability of forest stands to retain water and slow runoff in extreme runoff events determined by the stormflow component as an indication of their flood control efficiency. A significantly worse flood control efficiency and an overreaction of runoff response to precipitation events were observed in the spruce catchment. This also suggests that the spruce catchment is more prone to suffer from drought since twice as much water was lost from the system during extreme hydroclimatic events as opposed to the other two with less spruce in the stands and less water is thus available for groundwater recharge.

Taking Beijing, a large city in China, as an example, a meteorological disaster risk assessment model was established based on the framework of hazard factors, disaster-bearing body exposure, and vulnerability of underlying surface. Combined with 11 years of observation data from 293 high-density weather stations, the rainstorm and high-temperature risks of urban, agriculture, and ecological spaces were studied. The results show that (1) rainstorms and high-temperature are mainly distributed in the built-up areas of plain towns, which are the climate risk factors that need to be considered. (2) The central city of Beijing is at a high risk of rainstorms and high temperature, indicating that the underlying surface and disaster-bearing body are highly vulnerable to meteorological disasters. (3) In suburbs with agricultural land, there is a certain rainstorm risk in Fangshan and Daxing districts, and a risk of high temperatures in the southern part of Tongzhou and Daxing. (4) The risk of high temperatures in the ecological space (eco-zone) is relatively low, but the rainstorm risk is relatively high in Pinggu and Miyun. (5) The strategies of coping with rainstorm and high-temperature disaster risk in Beijing's territorial space planning were discussed.

However, studies that evaluate FMs suitability for monitoring the hydrodynamic stressors impact are lacking. Since future climatic scenarios predict an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events, understanding how flood conditions affect freshwater organisms are crucial for their conservation. In this study, we performed experiments in an artificial flume to evaluate the eligibility for FMs behaviour for developing a tailored biological early warning system (BEWS). For this, we used the valvometric technique (Hall magnetic sensors) to measure the FMs valve gaping behaviour when subjected to increasing discharges/sediment transport mimicking the onset of floods. After analysing baseline behaviour in non-stressful conditions, we performed experiments in steady and transient conditions to verify the FMs' response and the threshold that prompted it. Under steady conditions, FMs maintained a constant gaping frequency that characterizes their normal behaviour. The FMs promptly reacted to discharge variations with sediment transport, showing a transition from their normal behaviour to higher valve gaping frequencies. We demonstrated that FM transition behaviour is a useful tool to measure hydrodynamic stressors. A future step will be the application of this BEWS on natural ecosystems to assess possible hydrodynamic changes in real-time.

To address this reality, MODCEL, a conceptual cell-based model, had been applied and calibrated in a previous project. In this research, we compare MODCEL with IBER, a well-known, physically based 2D hydraulic model. The purpose is twofold: (i) to illustrate how system schematization can be carried out in the two modeling frameworks, which is not a trivial task and implies several choices and assumptions; (ii) to point out the strengths and weaknesses of these two models in a comparative fashion. Here, IBER has been calibrated and validated with the same data used for MODCEL. MODCEL performs slightly better, both in calibration and validation possibly because of the low resolution of the topographic information, an essential element for IBER. Furthermore, in IBER it is not possible to represent adequately all the different hydraulic works spread across the town. MODCEL, in turn, is not easy to apply because it requires a deep insight into the actual behavior of the physical system and time-consuming schematization attempts where a deep experience is needed; furthermore, it is by far less user-friendly than IBER. In any case, the two models capture sufficiently well the behavior of urban flooding and its changes according to hypothetical interventions.

However, NbSs remain poorly acknowledged and mostly absent from coastal planning for disaster risk reduction policies in the Caribbean, as well as from ex-post disaster reconstruction funds. With the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the region, NbSs are now more needed than ever. Taking Mexico as a representative case study for the wider Caribbean, we here seek to identify and analyze the barriers and opportunities perceived by relevant stakeholders for mainstreaming coastal-marine NbSs into coastal management and disaster risk reduction policies (e.g., mangroves as green infrastructure) to protect coastal societies and national economies against hurricanes. We conduct semi-structured, in-depth interviews with twenty stakeholders covering academic, governmental, tourism, NGO, coastal planning, and financial domains. Among the twenty-three identified barriers, governance, institutional, financial, and human-capacity aspects are the most dominant perceptions behind the current lack of NbS implementation. Future action for the policy integration of NbSs requires widespread political will and better quantification of both the provision of ecosystem services and their economic benefits under conventional markets.

A field study of a two-year organic horticultural rotation (2015-16 and 2016-17) was conducted to evaluate the effects of soil hydraulic arrangement and cover crops management on cash crops productivity, soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and C balance. The experiment consisted of two simultaneous rotation systems, a cauliflower-tomato rotation on raised beds and a zucchini-lettuce one on flat strips between them, combined with cover crops as living mulch or break crops. The results pointed out that the use of proper hydraulic arrangements may partially reduce the exposure of crops to extreme climate events, like heavy rains and floods, allowing the preservation of soil fertility. The cover crops increased the yields and enhanced the soil nutrient pools. Our study showed the important role of cover crops since the soil C stock values were significantly higher when they were used in the rotations. The analysis of the GHG emissions, C balance and C efficiency revealed that combining agro-ecological and conservation practices can improve environmental sustainability in organic farming in the Mediterranean area, allowing farmers to maintain/increase their agricultural systems sustainability.

In 2013, the Chinese government proposed a nationwide initiative, Sponge City, for managing the flood risk using the nature-based solution (NBS) approach. Pilot projects have been implemented among thirty selected cities, including Wuhan. Because the effectiveness of implementing NBS relies on the participation of the well-informed public, this study aims at identifying the factors affecting the awareness of the public about the Sponge City program. The viewpoint of people in Wuhan on urban floods and the Sponge City initiatives was surveyed among 1600 participants using a face-to-face questionnaire in mostly Wuchang area of Wuhan; more than 900 of them were further interviewed. The majority of participants, though recognising the threats from flooding, were lacking awareness and understanding of the Sponge City initiatives. The Chi-square analyses of association revealed that the level of awareness is affected by education, age and residential time; these demographic factors also affected their interpretation of the direct experiences of the water environment and governmental water management. To optimise communicating the relevant policy to the public, the content and the advertising tools for promoting Sponge City may need to be mindfully customised for targeted demographic groups.

The Xiangjiang River basin, which is the largest river in Hunan Province of China, is highly inclined to floods. This paper aims to investigate the annual maximum flood peak (AMFP) risk of Xiangjiang River basin under the climate context employing the Bayesian nonstationary time-varying moment models. Two climate covariates, i.e., the average June-July-August Artic Oscillation and sea level pressure in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, are selected and found to exhibit significant positive correlation with AMFP through a rigorous statistical analysis. The proposed models are tested with three cases, namely, stationary, linear-temporal and climate-based conditions. The results both indicate that the climate-informed model demonstrates the best performance as well as sufficiently explain the variability of extreme flood risk. The nonstationary return periods estimated by the expected number of exceedances method are larger than traditional ones built on the stationary assumption. In addition, the design flood could vary with the climate drivers which has great implication when applied in the context of climate change. This study suggests that nonstationary Bayesian modelling with climatic covariates could provide useful information for flood risk management.

Hence, this study aims to determine the most vulnerable segments (in terms of physical impact) of the Rhodes coastline through the widely accepted coastal vulnerability index (CVI), applying a combination of well-known, broadly used approaches and methods. The frequency distribution of the current CVI along the island's coastline suggests a rather worrying high to very high vulnerability of 40%. In addition, a CVI projection to the end of the 21st century (based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predictive scenarios) indicates an enhancement of the total vulnerability by 48%, mainly focused on the majority of the western coastline. Hence, a considerable number of popular coastal destinations in the island shall remain under unignorable threat and, therefore, coastal managers and decision-makers need to hatch an integrated plan to minimize economic and natural losses, private property damage and tourism infrastructure deterioration from flooding and erosion episodes, which will most likely be intensified in the future.

Evaluation of artificial intelligence models for flood and drought forecasting in arid and tropical regions	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Forecasting; Floods; Droughts; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Long-short term memory network	INDEX; PROVINCE	With the advancement of computer science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being incorporated into many fields to increase prediction performance. Disaster management is one of the main fields embracing the techniques of AI. It is essential to forecast the occurrence of disasters in advance to take the necessary mitigation steps and reduce damage to life and property. Therefore, many types of research are conducted to predict such events due to climate change in advance using hydrological, mathematical, and AI-based approaches. This paper presents a comparison of three major accepted AI-based approaches in flood and drought forecasting. In this study, fluvial floods are measured by the runoff change in rivers whereas meteorological droughts are measured using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM), and Wavelet decomposition functions combined with the Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) are compared in flood and drought forecasting, with five statistical performance criteria and accepted flood and drought indicators used for comparison, extending to two climatic regions: arid and tropical. The results suggest that the CNN performs best in flood forecasting with WANFIS for meteorological drought forecasting, regardless of the climate of the region under study. Besides, the results demonstrate the increased accuracy of the CNN in applications with multiple features in the input.

Therefore, this study has been carried out with three aims: (i) to evaluate the predictive capabilities of nonstationary (NS) and stationary (ST) models with varying flood record lengths; (ii) to examine the impacts of flood record lengths on the NS and ST design floods and associated uncertainties; and (iii) to recommend the probable requirements of flood record length in NFFA. To achieve these objectives, 20 stations with record length longer than 100 years in Norway were selected and investigated by using both GEV (generalized extreme value)-ST and GEV-NS models with linearly varying location parameter (denoted by GEV-NS0). The results indicate that the fitting quality and predictive capabilities of GEV-NS0 outperform those of GEV-ST models when record length is approximately larger than 60 years for most stations, and the stability of the GEV-ST and GEV-NS0 is improved as record lengths increase. Therefore, a minimum of 60 years of flood observations is recommended for NFFA for the selected basins in Norway.

LIEBL.; QUERCUS-ROBUR; RIPARIAN FORESTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHANGE IMPACTS; TREE BIOMASS; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; RESPONSES	Hardwood floodplain (HF) forests can store a considerable amount of carbon (C), and floodplains may be good candidates for reforestation to provide natural C sinks. In this study, we use nondestructive inventory methods to estimate the C stocks of different tree species and C pools within HF forests of varying age and structure and located at sites differing in hydrological conditions (low and high active floodplain, seepage water zone, tributaries). The study was carried out along the Elbe river (Germany). Average C stocks for young plantations in the active floodplain were significantly lower (50.2 +/- 10.8 SE Mg ha(-1)) than those of old dense (140.6 +/- 11.6 SE Mg ha(-1)) and old sparse forests (180.4 +/- 26.6 SE Mg ha(-1)) with comparable hydrological conditions. C stocks of old dense forests did not significantly vary from old sparse forests. Additionally, C stocks of old forests did not significantly vary according to hydrological conditions. The highest amount of C was stored in Quercus robur for all hydrological conditions. Ulmus laevis stored the second-highest amount of C on the active floodplain. We conclude that sparse and dense forests as well as forests under different hydrological conditions provide the same C storage function.

Soil flooding, in which root-zone is filled with excess water, restricts oxygen diffusion into the soil. Global climate change is increasing the risk of crop yield loss caused by flooding, and the development of flooding tolerant crops is urgently needed. Root anatomical traits are essential for plants to adapt to drought and flooding, as they determine the balance between the rates of water and oxygen transport. The stele contains xylem and the cortex contains aerenchyma (gas spaces), which respectively contribute to water uptake from the soil and oxygen supply to the roots; this implies that there is a trade-off between the ratio of cortex and stele sizes with respect to adaptation to drought or flooding. In this review, we analyze recent advances in the understanding of root anatomical traits that confer drought and/or flooding tolerance to plants and illustrate the trade-off between cortex and stele sizes. Moreover, we introduce the progress that has been made in modelling and fully automated analyses of root anatomical traits and discuss how key root anatomical traits can be used to improve crop tolerance to soil flooding.

These large-scale features can be 500-800 km in width but produce markedly different flood responses in adjacent catchments. Here we combine meteorological and hydrological data to examine why two impermeable catchments on the west coast of Britain respond differently to landfalling ARs. This is important to help better understand flood generation associated with ARs and improve flood forecasting and climate-change impact assessment. Analysis of 32 years of a newly available ERA5 high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis and corresponding 15-min river flow data show that the most impactful ARs arise through a combination of the orientation and magnitude of their water vapour flux. At the Dyfi catchment, AR orientations of between 238-258 degrees result in the strongest hydrological responses, whereas at the Teifi the range is 224-243 degrees. We believe this differential flood response is the result of catchment orientation and topography enhancing or suppressing orographic rainfall totals, even in relatively low-relief coastal catchments. Further to the AR orientation, ARs must have an average water vapour flux of 400-450 kg m(-1)s(-1)across their lifetime. Understanding the preferential properties of impactful ARs at catchments allows for the linking of large-scale synoptic features, such as ARs, directly to winter flood impacts. These results using two test catchments suggest a novel approach to flood forecasts through the inclusion of AR activity.

To address this problem, the sponge city strategy has been proposed in China. This study focuses on the issue of urban flood inundation, which is a main problem that the construction of sponge cities seeks to address. The design mode of sponge city flood control and drainage systems (SCFCDSs) is examined, including source control systems (SCSs), stormwater pipe network systems (SPNSs), and over-standard stormwater storage and drainage systems (OSSSDSs). A quantitative method to evaluate flood control and drainage capacity (stormwater equivalent) of SCFCDSs is proposed and applied to quantitatively analyze the matching relationship between investment structure and inundation control function. Based on 18 pilot cities, the stormwater equivalents of the SCSs, SPNSs, and OSSSDSs account for 13.8, 57.7, and 28.6% of the stormwater equivalent of SCFCDSs on average, respectively. On the other hand, the investments in SCSs, SPNSs, and OSSSDSs account for 66.1, 15.0, and 18.9% of the total investment in SCFCDSs on average, respectively. The results show that an unbalanced investment structure and corresponding design standards along with insufficient investment in OSSSDSs are the key factors hindering the effective implementation of urban flood inundation control in sponge cities.

This effort involved the provision of special kits that reduce the potential damage to homes as a consequence of rainfall and floods associated with an El Nino-Southern Oscillation event. Information was collected in 2016 when this Forecast-based Financing early action was activated by an El Nino forecast, and after a coastal El Nino actually struck in 2017. This dual database permits us to estimate the impact of the intervention on the damage level of homes by comparing those homes supported by the program with those homes not receiving pilot-program support. This comparison is achieved by using propensity score matching techniques, which identify the most comparable homes to the ones that were supported by the intervention. The main findings of the study suggest a positive impact of the program in terms of its effectiveness in mitigating the damage caused by the 2017 El Nino. These results suggest a drop in the scale of house damage (less damage) by around 63% for a home that received the modular kit treatment. When considering other specifications of the model, the decrease in the scale of house damage improves up to approximately 66%.

Efficient and validated regional-scale coastal flood mapping approaches that include storm surges and waves are hence required to better prepare for the increased hazard. This paper compares and validates two different flood mapping methods: numerical flood simulations using XBeach and bathtub mapping based on total water levels, forced with multihazard scenarios of compound wave and water level events. XBeach is validated with hydrodynamic measurements. Simulations of a historical storm event are performed and validated against observed flood data over a similar to 25 km long coastline using multiple fit metrics. XBeach and the bathtub method correctly predict flooded areas (66 and 78%, respectively), but the latter overpredicts the flood extent by 36%. XBeach is a slightly more robust flood mapping approach with a fit of 51% against 48% for the bathtub maps. Deeper floodwater by similar to 0.5 m is expected with the bathtub approach, and more buildings are vulnerable to a 100-year flood level. For coastal management at regional-scale, despite similar flood extents with both flood mapping approaches, results suggest that numerical simulation on with XBeach outperforms bathtub flood mapping.

Assessing the effects of using high-quality data and high-resolution models in valuing flood protection services of mangroves	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CLIMATE	The rate of change on coastlines is accelerating from climate change and coastal development. Coastal flooding is a particularly pressing and increasing problem, which affects hundreds of millions of people and damages trillions of US$ in property. Scientists, practitioners and managers must be able to quickly assess flood risk and identify appropriate adaptation and risk reduction measures often with limited data and tools, particularly in developing countries. To inform these decision-making processes, we identify how sensitive flood risk and adaptation analyses are to changes in the resolution of data and models. We further do these comparisons in the context of assess the benefits of an ecosystem-based approach for risk reduction. There is growing interest in these ecosystem-based approaches as cost effective measures for adaptation and risk reduction. We assess flood risks from tropical cyclones and the flood risk reduction benefits provided by mangroves in Pagbilao (the Philippines). Then, we also compare risks and risk reduction (benefits) using different quality data and models, to identify where to invest in in new modeling and data acquisition to improve decision-making. We find that coastal flood risk valuation improves by using high resolution topography and long time series of data on tropical cyclones, while flood reduction benefits of mangroves are better valued by using consistent databases and models along the whole process rather than investing in single measures.

In such environments the water stocks depend heavily on the vegetation cover and the ecosystem services derived from it, as part of the interaction soil-plant-topography. Wildfires are disturbances capable of breaking the foundations of these delicate systems. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the effects of vegetation fires on drainage basins, on the water supply of one of the largest Brazilian urban agglomerations. The model was fed and calibrated with historical hydroclimatic series (calibration January 2001-December 2008, validation January 2009-December 2015). The adjusted model allows to predict the impacts of fire extension on infiltration and runoff, a valuable information for land management, aiming at protecting aquifer recharge. The model predicts a scenario of large range fluctuations characterized by pulsed floods in the rainy season and drought in the dry season. The loss of protective vegetation cover due to fire reduces infiltration and increases runoff. This compromises groundwater recharge, leading to high deficits in groundwater storage and reducing the baseline flow of headsprings. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) based approach has been used extensively around the world for mapping snow, and they displayed high accuracy in open areas. However, capturing snow cover in forests remains problematic due to the obstruction effects of the forest canopy, which causes the snow cover area to be seriously underestimated. In this paper, we present a new algorithm based on machine learning (ML) technology to improve the accuracy of binary snow cover (BSC) mapping in forests, using the remotely sensed surface reflectance and ground truth data. A time-lapse photography network with a two-hour resolution was established in the eastern Qilian Mountains in northwestern China to obtain the ground truth data both in forests and open areas. We trained Random Forests (RF) with the 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from bands 1-7 to generate BSC results (RF-BSC). Then we evaluated RF-BSC and the NDSI-derived BSC maps with three different NDSI thresholds (i.e., 0.10, 0.29, and 0.40) against ground truth data. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a high performance in forest BSC mapping in this area, compared to the NDSI-threshold approach. The RF-BSC can retrieve 67% of all real forest snow pixels, while the NDSI-based BSC can only detect 8-14%. We also find that the performance of the algorithm seems to be sensitive to changes in solar illumination conditions and forest coverage. This study suggests that machine learning with the fusion of optical remote sensing and ground-based observations is an effective approach for improving the accuracy of forest snow cover mapping at regional scales.

J	Matsuki, A; Hatayama, M				Matsuki, Akira; Hatayama, Michinori			Risk analysis of mutual influence relationships among residents under rescue operations in long-term flooded areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster response; Multi-agent system; GIS; Rescue simulation; Flood inundation		Recent climate change is expected to cause severe flood damage, and new flood countermeasures are urgently required. However, there is concern that the current capacity of rescue operations is limited in response to the increasing scale of flood damage. In future flood countermeasures, it will be necessary for the government not only to carry out rescue activities but also to demand a balance between self-help and public assistance, for example, by requesting residents to evacuate voluntarily. However, to expect a change in the attitude of the residents themselves, it is important to communicate the risk by presenting evidence for such a change. Therefore, in this study, problems related to the rescue of isolated residents in water rescue operations in long-term inundated areas and the effects on residents waiting for rescue were identified. Specifically, we conducted a rescue simulation using a multiagent system in an actual urban area that was expected to be flooded for a long period. We confirmed that boat rescue operations are subject to more restrictions than ground rescue operations and pose a significant risk to residents waiting for rescue operations. We observed a strong interrelationship between residents who shared limited rescue resources, and that the decisions of individual residents influenced each other's rescue time. These relationships have given rise to an ethical problem called rescue triage owing to the nature of boat rescue operations. This study does not aim to find a rescue policy or an efficient rescue operation but discusses risk management in rescue operations in a long-flooded area.

River bank erosion is a natural geomorphic process that occurs in all channels. As modifications of sizes and channel shapes are made to transport the discharge, sediment abounds from the stream catchment, and floods are triggered dramatically. The aim of this study is to analyze the flood-sensitive regions along the Pahang River Basin and determine how climate and river changes would have an impact on flooding based on hydrometeorological data and information on river characteristics. The study is divided into three stages, namely the upstream, middle stream, and downstream of the Pahang River. The main primary hydrometeorological data and river characteristics, such as Sinuosity Index, Dominant Slope Range and Entrenchment Ratio collected as important inputs in the statistical analysis process. The statistical analyses, namely HACA, PCA, and Linear Regression applied in river classification. The result showed that the middle stream and downstream areas demonstrated the worst flooding affected by anthropogenic and hydrological factors. Rainfall distribution is one of the factors that contributed to the flood disaster. There are strong correlations between the Sinuosity Index (SI) and water level, which indicates that changes occurred at both planform and stream classification. The best management practices towards sustainability are based on the application of the outcomes that have been obtained after the analysis of Pahang River planform changes, Pahang River geometry, and the local rainfall pattern in the Pahang River Basin.

This study aims to quantify the exposure to cyclones in Taltali, a southern coastal upazila of Bangladesh. To quantify the exposure, the study used 6 criteria, including elevation, slope, proximity to major water bodies, population density, proximity to cyclone tracks and land use and land cover, and produced maps focusing on each criterion. The overall exposure map was also created to observe the whole scenario of the upazila. All the analysis was done in a GIS environment using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The individual criterion map represents the status of the study area in different classes. And the overall exposure map revealed that about 60 % of the study area was quantified as very highly exposed to cyclones, including 4 unions- Barabagi, Chhota Bagi, Karaibaria, Pancha Koralia and 6 Rakhain parasTaltali, Monukhe, Momeshi, Agathakur, Saton, and Sawdagar. In numerical terms, about 8032 ha and 178 ha of land are counted as highly and moderately exposed to cyclones, respectively. Among the seven unions, the maximum area of the Barabagi and Chhota Bagi was found to be very highly exposed, followed by Panchakoralia and Karaibaria. Data from our previous study also validated the results of this study. Despite having some limitations, the study can be used to develop the capacity of the community to respond to cyclones. And the national and international communities can use the results to formulate policies regarding disaster risk reduction and risk mitigation.

However, historical biodiversity data may contain neglected sources of error that can have a significant impact on the results and their interpretation. In our study, we focus on historical sampling error, a source of potential bias in long-term biodiversity assessments that has not been systematically addressed. We resampled two historical datasets of a different origin in the floodplain forests of the Czech Republic, with 534 vegetation plots originally sampled in the 1950s and 1960s. We compared temporal trends in alpha diversity and Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) between the two parallel surveys. To assess compositional differences, we compared temporal changes in species frequencies. Alpha diversity increased by 9.3 % in one resurvey, but decreased by an average of 30.8 % in the second resurvey. The distribution of EIVs for plots also differed, indicating that each resurvey covered a different part of the environmental gradient. We conclude that preferential historical sampling of the vegetation-environment continuum and species omission may have contributed to the differences in biodiversity and environmental change between the datasets. Our study shows that historical sampling error can have a significant impact on assessments of long-term biodiversity trends. We recommend that historical reference datasets should be critically assessed for potential sources of error in assessments of environmental change and management objectives.

Projections of Large-Scale Atmospheric Circulation Patterns and Associated Temperature and Precipitation over the Pacific Northwest Using CMIP6 Models	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						North America; Atmospheric circulation; Climate change; Climate classification/regimes; General circulation models	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; SYNOPTIC WEATHER PATTERNS; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; UNITED-STATES; ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION; HEAT WAVES; CLIMATE; EVENTS; VARIABILITY; FLOOD	Climate model projections of atmospheric circulation patterns, their frequency, and associated temperature and precipitation anomalies under a high-end global warming scenario are assessed over the Pacific Northwest of North America for the final three decades of the twenty-first century. Model simulations are from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and circulation patterns are identified using the self-organizing maps (SOMs) approach, applied to 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) anomalies. Overall, the range of projected circulation patterns is similar to that in the current climate, especially in winter, whereas in summer the models project a general reduction in the magni-tude of Z500 anomalies. Significant changes in pattern frequencies are also projected in summer, with an overall decrease in the frequency of patterns with large Z500 anomalies. In winter, patterns historically associated with anomalously cold weather in northern latitudes are projected to warm the most, and in summer the largest temperature increases are pro-jected over inland areas. Precipitation is found to increase across all seasons and most SOM patterns. However, some summer patterns that are associated with above-average precipitation in the current climate are projected to become signif-icantly drier by the end of the century. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This paper uses a novel method to analyze projections of large-scale atmospheric circulation over the Pacific Northwest of North America, reducing the uncertainty of changes to the circulation patterns over the region under a high-emissions scenario of global warming.

Ecosystems can mitigate the effects of climate-related hazards including drought. For this reason, nature-based solutions (NbS) are becoming more prominent to manage climate-related impacts in developing countries; however, there is still limited empirical evidence, which would inform NbS policy and practices. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize droughts in Eastern Ethiopia (the case of Erer Sub-basin) and assess the effectiveness of various NbS for drought. The temporal changes in soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) (agricultural drought) and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) (meteorological drought) at various timescales (1, 3, and 6 months) between 1981 and 2020 were analyzed. Qualitative analysis was used to categorize and evaluate the effectiveness of NbS to mitigate drought risk by adopting a Living Labs approach. Overall, the study revealed that droughts showed an increasing trend with more frequency, longevity, and severity. The drought analysis results showed that SPEI's variants were less reliable than SMDI0-5 and SMDI5-100. With an increase in rainfall, SPEI showed stronger relationships with SMDI0-5 at one and two-month delays between May and July. SPEI and SMDI5-100 performed better in terms of capturing actual drought occurrences than SMDI0-5. The results of focus group discussions (FGD) suggested NbS such as habitat restoration, structural restoration, reforestation, rehabilitation, revegetation, land enclosures, conservancies, and locally managed areas have been practiced as a strategy to manage drought risks. Overall, the study indicated that a new, comprehensive approach through nature-based solutions to reduce the risk of drought is urgently needed.	[Sintayehu, Dejene W.

Insufficient rain reduces pasture availability, limiting the ability to support livestock and dependent livelihoods. We assessed the implication of increased rainfall variability on pasture production and pastoral livelihoods in Simanjiro district, Tanzania. Household socioeconomic data were collected through a cross-sectional survey between March and June 2014. Simple random sampling was used to select 297 households. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on remote sensing as a proxy for pasture availability to assess vegetation changes in the period 1982 to 2019 (using coarse resolution NDVI data available from 1982 to 2016 and higher spatial resolution data covering 2000-2019). Observed trends were related to data on household perceptions about changing rainfall patterns, pasture availability, and the livelihood implications of these changes. We performed multivariate regressions to predict pasture availability, livestock mortality, food security, and income by climatic shocks and herd management. We found a significant positive association between livestock mortality and extreme climatic events, including drought and flooding. We also found a positive association between household food insecurity and pasture scarcity, and livestock mortality. Our study shows that a higher spatial resolution of imagery combined with household surveys can offer a detailed understanding of the chain of relationships from climate to pasture availability, livestock mortality, and associated livelihoods. We recommend policy interventions that promote pastoralists' capacity to better manage their activities in the context of climate change.

We used hydrological indices to investigate the short intermediate-and long-term effects of high-and low-flow patterns on the population abundances of 17 fish species in headwater streams in Germany. Generalized linear models, on average, explained 54 % of the variability in fish abundance, whereas long-term hydrological indices performed better than indices based on shorter periods. Three clusters of species were differentiated in their response patterns to low-flow conditions. Cold stenotherm and demersal species were susceptible to high frequency and long duration but tolerant to the magnitude of low-flow events. In con-trast, species with a more benthopelagic habitat preference and tolerance to warmer water were susceptible to magni-tude but tolerated larger frequencies of low-flow events. The euryoecious chub (Squalius cephalus), tolerating both long durations and large magnitudes of low-flow events, formed its own cluster. Species responses to high flows were more complex and five clusters of species were differentiated. Species with an equilibrium life history strategy were posi-tively affected by longer durations of high-flow conditions, which may allow them to take advantage of the extended floodplain, whereas opportunistic and periodic species significantly differed by thriving in events characterized by high magnitude and frequency. These response patterns of fish species to high and low flows help understand species-specific risks when hydrological conditions are altered by climate change or direct human intervention.

In coastal environments, vegetation moderates physical and hydrodynamic processes that conversely affect vegetation dynamics. Coastal management and the implementation of nature-based solutions in the coastal environment requires models that can predict vegetation dynamics that are driven by ecological processes as well as physical processes (e.g., storms, sea level rise). To determine models that are capable of simulating biomass dynamics and assess their ability to make predictions within the context of climate change and environmental management, we reviewed coastal dynamic vegetation simulation models across the following coastal zone habitats: tidal wetlands (salt marsh, mangroves, and freshwater wetlands), seagrass beds, coastal forests (maritime and floodplain forests), and dune habitats. Fifty-four models met the review criteria and were examined to assess their ability to simulate relevant ecological processes and the spatiotemporal scales at which they are applied. These models included a variety of exogenous and endogenous processes and integrate complex ecogeomorphological feedbacks affecting plant and soil community, hydrodynamic, and sediment transport dynamics. Most models reviewed utilized implicit approaches to predicting vegetation biomass and simulated a limited number of processes based on the principal drivers of habitat of interest. Key gaps identified were the exclusion of below-ground biomass dynamics, limited inclusion of processes such as competition, facilitation, and succession, and the inability to simulate management actions. Future models should seek to move towards process-based approaches where appropriate to enable their application to different systems and facilitate their use under novel environmental conditions.

It is predicted that the risk of flooding will be much higher in the future, especially with the increase in extreme precipitation due to global climate change. To minimize the flood risks, first of all, regional flood risk maps should be created, and hydraulic modeling studies should be carried out for the identified hazardous regions. In this study, the flood risk potential of the Kucuk Aksu Basin, which is the sub-basin of the Antalya Basin, and one of the rainiest basins in Turkey, was determined. In this study, slope, rainfall, flow accumulation, distance from drainage, land use, soil, and aquifer type parameters were used to define flood risk of the study area. These parameters are the most important parameters in determining the flood risk. Geographical information system-based analytical hierarchy process was used to determine the priority importance of these parameters. It was determined that a large part of the Kucuk Aksu River basin is in the high-risk group in terms of flood risk potential. In particular, 3.66 ha of settlement area and 28.09 ha of the agricultural area were included in the very high-risk group in the basin, while 21.82 ha of settlement area and 249.66 ha of the agricultural area were found to be in the high-risk group. Hence, potential flood risks should be reduced by making current and future land-use plans more adequate.

Hydrometeorological averages and extremes have been used before as drivers in the statistical prediction of disease. However, their importance and predictive capacity are still little known. In this study, the use of a random forest classifier was explored to analyze the relative importance of hydrometeorological indices in developing the leptospirosis model and to evaluate the performance of models based on the type of indices used, using case data from three districts in Kelantan, Malaysia, that experience annual monsoonal rainfall and flooding. First, hydrometeorological data including rainfall, streamflow, water level, relative humidity, and temperature were transformed into 164 weekly average and extreme indices in accordance with the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Then, weekly case occurrences were classified into binary classes "high" and "low" based on an average threshold. Seventeen models based on "average," "extreme," and "mixed" indices were trained by optimizing the feature subsets based on the model computed mean decrease Gini (MDG) scores. The variable importance was assessed through cross-correlation analysis and the MDG score. The average and extreme models showed similar prediction accuracy ranges (61.5-76.1% and 72.3-77.0%) while the mixed models showed an improvement (71.7-82.6% prediction accuracy). An extreme model was the most sensitive while an average model was the most specific. The time lag associated with the driving indices agreed with the seasonality of the monsoon. The rainfall variable (extreme) was the most important in classifying the leptospirosis occurrence while streamflow was the least important despite showing higher correlations with leptospirosis.

We computed 11 extreme precipitation indices. The selected indices allow the analysis of extreme events (such as flood/inundation) related to heavy precipitation and evaluate the linkage with indications of agricultural production and drought (such as consecutive dry and wet days). Using a simple daily intensity index (SDII) and the number of days with daily precipitation >= 10 mm (R10), along with the total amount of annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), we summarized the distribution of the wet periods of the year at different locations. We divided the study period into two halves (T1: 1976-1995 and T2: 1996-2015) to examine the temporal mean, trends, and their shift. We emphasized the changes in those indices between these two periods across the country. Our results show that although the amount of precipitation (in terms of PRCPTOT and SDII) did not change significantly between the two periods (i.e., T1 and T2), there exists a clearly increasing trend of extreme precipitation indices in T2 compared to T1. In addition, the consecutive dry days show the rising tendency of elongated dry spells that can adversely affect plant/crop growth in the future. Our study recommends the need for effective management of both precipitation extremes (i.e., drier and wetter), for instance, by introducing irrigation facilities and flood mitigation measures.

Historic Spatial Patterns of Storm-Driven Compound Events in UK Estuaries	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Coast; Estuary; Combination hazard; Compound flooding; Flood risk	RIVER DISCHARGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA SURGE; DEPENDENCE; TIDE; PRECIPITATION; LINKING; RISK; FLOW	Compound estuarine flooding is driven by extreme sea-levels and river discharge occurring concurrently, or in close succession, and threatens low-lying coastal regions worldwide. We hypothesise that these drivers of flooding rarely occur independently and co-operate at sub-daily timescales. This research aimed to identify regions and individual estuaries within Britain susceptible to storm-driven compound events, using 27 tide gauges linked to 126 river gauges covering a 30-year record. Five methods were evaluated, based on daily mean, daily maximum, and instantaneous 15-min discharge data to identify extremes in the river records, with corresponding skew surges identified within a 'storm window' based on average hydrograph duration. The durations, relative timings, and overlap of these extreme events were also calculated. Dependence between extreme skew surge and river discharge in Britain displayed a clear east-west split, with gauges on the west coast showing stronger correlations up to 0.33. Interpreting dependence based on correlation alone can be misleading and should be considered alongside number of historic extreme events. The analyses identified 46 gauges, notably the Rivers Lune and Orchy, where there has been the greatest chance and most occurrences of river-sea extremes coinciding, and where these events readily overlapped one another. Our results were sensitive to the analysis method used. Most notably, daily mean discharge underestimated peaks in the record and did not accurately capture likelihood of compound events in 68% of estuaries. This has implications for future flood risk in Britain, whereby studies should capture sub-daily timescale and concurrent sea-fluvial climatology to support long-term flood management plans.

The oil and gas (O & G) industry is one of the biggest environmental polluters, accounting for 10% of all human-produced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and its products, including O & G, account for a further 33% of GHG emissions. Therefore, it is high time for the O & G sector to invest in decarbonisation to meet the global climate goal of zero emissions by 2050. This paper identifies 14 strategies to decarbonize the oil and gas supply chain (OGSC) from the extant literature. These 14 strategies pertain to the OGSC upstream, midstream, and downstream. Eight experts from the Iranian OGSC then rank these strategies. The Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method and intuitionistic fuzzy sets are applied to explore the cause-and-effect relationships between decarbonisation strategies. A prominence relationship map is created for each stream in the OGSC to illustrate the influence of each strategy over other strategies. Results reveal that CO2 flooding technology in upstream, renewable energy integration for transport in midstream, and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage systems downstream of OGSC are the most effective for OGSC decarbonisation. The main contribution of this study is to bring forward a supply chain wide examination of decarbonisation strategies as well as the prioritisation of these strategies so that researchers and practitioners can focus on the most promising ones. If appropriately implemented, identified decarbonisation strategies will help the OGSC supply chain become climate-friendly and facilitate the attainment of net-zero CO2 emissions.

Net carbon dioxide exchange in a hyperseasonal cattle pasture in the northern Pantanal wetland of Brazil	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Eddy-covariance; Hyperseasonal pasture; Co-2 fluxes; Tropical wetlands	ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE; EDDY COVARIANCE; ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION; TROPICAL SAVANNA; GREAT-PLAINS; FLUX; FOREST; INTENSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; ASSIMILATION	The Pantanal is the largest seasonal wetland in the world with a landscape that consists of a mosaic of permanent aquatic habitats, and floodable and non-floodable savannas, pastures and forests. Drought events are expected to occur more frequently in the Pantanal biome under future climate conditions, but the effects of land management and hydrological extremes on pastures have been poorly studied at spatial scales relevant to local livestock. In this study, we measured CO2-C fluxes using eddy covariance over a hydrological year on pastures within a cattle farm in the Brazilian Pantanal that experienced seasonal flooding. Our measurements show that seasonally flooded pastures were large emitters of CO2-C, contributing 337 g CO2-C m(-2) year(-1) to the atmosphere. During flooding, when the soils were anaerobic, and soil O-2 was close to zero, the flooded pasture was a net sink of -18 g CO2-C m(-2), while during the aerobic phase (soil O-2 > 15%) the pasture was a significant CO2 source to the atmosphere (301 g CO2-C m(-2)). Transitions to and from anaerobic conditions corresponded to 54 g CO2-C m(-2). Our results indicate that the seasonally flooded cattle pastures in the Brazilian Pantanal may be an important regional source of CO2-C for the atmosphere. Better management, and use of drought resistant grasses, may be a way to improve soil C stocks and limit emissions, especially as global climate change is anticipated to increase heating and drying for the Pantanal biome.

Contribution of National Rural Employment Guarantee Program on Rejuvenation and Restoration of Community Forests in India	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Review						public works programs; MGNREGS; poverty alleviation; reforestation; afforestation	IMPACT	Sustainable development is one of the ubiquitous paradigms of this century. Poverty, biodiversity loss and climate change are some of the obstacles to achieving sustainable development. To mitigate these encumbrances, countries have painstakingly adopted various policies and interventions. Public work programs, one of the initiatives targeting the construction of strong social safety nets through redistribution of wealth and generation of meaningful employment are increasingly being launched in developing countries. This paper is an attempt to examine the effects of phased implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) on the rejuvenation and restoration of community forests in India. Searches performed in multidisciplinary electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Emerald Insight, Google Scholar, Taylor and Francis Online, Wiley Online Library, and Springer Link) indicated that MGREGS is one of the largest labor guarantee schemes ever recorded in India and globally, and has holistically contributed to reforestation and afforestation through its land development themes to reduce vulnerability of rural communities to recurrent droughts, floods and improve soil moisture and fertility. It is evident that MGNREGS in synergy with the government forest development programs have the potential to promote social afforestation, reforestation and biodiversity conservation as witnessed in the Sundarbans. These have the potential to empower local people through creation of income generating activities and provision of local forest goods and services. However, the creation of forests as rural assets necessitates that emphasis should be laid on their maintenance so as to ensure that they are given their due importance for sustainable and long-term benefit of the poor rural households. This study highlights the need to perform a comprehensive assessment of forest assets that has been established through MNREGS across states in India.

For managers who grapple with how to manage ecosystems under novel conditions and heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of regime shifts is paramount. As part of an ecological resilience assessment, researchers and managers have collaborated to identify alternate regimes and build an understanding of the thresholds and factors that govern regime shifts in the Upper Mississippi River System. To describe the management implications of our assessment, we integrate our findings with the recently developed resist-accept-direct (RAD) framework that explicitly acknowledges ecosystem regime change and outlines management approaches of resisting change, accepting change, or directing change. More specifically, we developed guidance for using knowledge of desirability of current conditions, distance to thresholds, and general resilience (that is, an ecosystem's capacity to cope with uncertain disturbances) to navigate the RAD framework. We applied this guidance to outline strategies that resist, accept, or direct change in the context of management of aquatic vegetation, floodplain vegetation, and fish communities across nearly 2000 river kilometers. We provide a case study for how knowledge of ecological dynamics can aid in assessing which management approach(es) are likely to be most ecologically feasible in a changing world. Continued learning from management decisions will be critical to advance our understanding of how ecosystems respond and inform the management of ecosystems for desirable and resilient outcomes.

However, many uncertainties remain in connection with achieving, measuring, and reporting success from coastal wetland restoration. We measured levels of carbon (C) abatement and nitrogen (N) removal potential of restored coastal wetlands in subtropical Queensland, Australia. The site was originally a supratidal forest composed of Melaleuca spp. that was cleared and drained in the 1990s for sugarcane production. In 2010, tidal inundation was reinstated, and a mosaic of coastal vegetation (saltmarshes, mangroves, and supratidal forests) emerged. We measured soil GHG fluxes (CH4, N2O, CO2) and sequestration of organic C in the trees and soil to estimate the net C abatement associated with the reference, converted, and restored sites. To assess the influence of restoration on water quality improvement, we measured denitrification and soil N accumulation. We calculated C abatement of 18.5 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) when sugarcane land transitioned to supratidal forests, 11.0 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) when the land transitioned to mangroves, and 6.2 Mg CO2-eq ha(-1) year(-1) when the land transitioned to saltmarshes. The C abatement was due to tree growth, soil accumulation, and reduced N2O emissions due to the cessation of fertilization. Carbon abatement was still positive, even accounting for CH4 emissions, which increased in the wetlands due to flooding and N2O production due to enhanced levels of denitrification. Coastal wetland restoration in this subtropical setting effectively reduces CO2 emissions while providing additional cobenefits, notably water quality improvement.

Therefore, this study was undertaken to develop a flood vulnerability map and to assess the exposure of buildings to flood risk in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. This goal was pursued in four research phases. The thirteen flood predictors were evaluated using information gain ratio (IGR), and finally reduced to eight of the most causative ones and used for flood vulnerability mapping with three machine learning algorithms, Artificial Neural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN/MLP), Deep Learning Neural Network based approach-DL4j (DLNN-DL4j) and Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR). These algorithms show a good predictive performance with the receiver operating curve (ROC) value of 0.851, 0.877 and 0.697, respectively. The buildings' exposure to flood was assessed in line with criteria established in European and national legal regulations. The introduced new buildings' flood hazard index (BFH) revealed a significant similarity of potential flood risk for both models, highlighting the greatest risk in zones with high vulnerability to flooding. Depending on the method used, the BFH value was 0.54 (ANN), 0.52 (DLNNs) or 0.64 (BLR). The holistic approach proposed in this study could assist local authorities in improving flood management.

Unfortunately, little is known about resilience at the household level. This study presents the results of a survey into individual and household level preparedness to disaster events in Yangon, Myanmar, which is prone to natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, flooding, and earthquakes. The study aimed to understand societal resilience and to provide information that could be used to develop a holistic framework. In four different Yangon townships, 440 households were interviewed. The results of the survey indicate how risk preparedness could be improved by specific measures related to the following five factors: (1) increasing the general public's knowledge of first aid and its role in preparedness; (2) improving mobile phone infrastructure and capacity building in its usage so that it can be used for communication during disasters, along with building up a redundant communication structure; (3) better use and organisation of volunteer potential; (4) more specific involvement of religious and public buildings for disaster response; and (5) developing specific measures for improving preparedness in urban areas, where the population often has reduced capacities for coping with food supply insufficiencies due to the high and immediate availability of food, shops and goods in regular times. The findings of this survey have led to specific recommendations for Yangon. The identified measures represent a first step in developing a more general framework. Future research could investigate the transferability of these measures to other areas and thus their suitability as a basis for a framework.

Recent studies suggest that an alternation between dry and re-flooded sediments may increase organic matter (OM) mineralization, boosting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. However, the impact of drying and re-flooding on GHG emissions is poorly understood, especially in reservoirs located in semiarid regions that experience torrential refilling occasionally. Here, we experimentally evaluated the influence of sediment re-flooding on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from drawdown sediments of Brazilian semiarid reservoirs submitted to a prolonged drought period. The observed average CO2 and CH4 emissions ranged from 3 to 78 mg C m(-2) day(-1) and from 0.4 to 13.5 mg C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Compared with other drawdown emission values reported in the literature, our CO2 emissions may be considered low, but CH4 emissions are in line with values reported for drying-rewetting cycle experiments. The long period of sediment desiccation may be the key to our low CO2 emission rates, whereas dissolved oxygen concentration in the overlying water appears to be controlling CH4 emissions. Long periods of drought keep the exposed sediment in contact with atmospheric oxygen, promoting higher OM decomposition, lasting mainly highly refractory OM for decomposition after re-flooding. Although previous studies indicate that GHG emissions from rewetted sediments may be substantial, our findings suggest that drawdown sediments of Brazilian semiarid reservoirs submitted to long atmospheric exposure are low sources of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere after reservoirs re-flooding.

However, the lack of continuous and stable long-term series and high-resolution soil moisture records impedes such research. To overcome the inconsistency of different microwave sensors (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS, AMSR-E; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, SMOS; and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, AMSR2) in measuring soil moisture over time and depth, we built a time series reconstruction model to correct SM, and then used a Spatially Weighted Downscaling Model to downscale the SM data from three different sensors to a 1 km spatial resolution. The verification of the reconstructed data shows that the product has high accuracy, and can be used for application and analysis. The spatiotemporal trends of SM in Africa were examined for 2003-2017. The analysis indicated that soil moisture is declining in Africa as a whole, and it is notably higher in central Africa than in other subregions. The most significant decrease in SM was observed in the savanna zone (slope < -0.08 m(3) m(-3) and P < 0.001), followed by South Africa and Namibia (slope < -0.07 m(3) m(-3) and P < 0.01). Seasonally, the most significant downward trends in SM were observed during the spring, mainly over eastern and central Africa (slope < -0.07 m(3) m(-3), R < -0.58 and P < 0.001). The analysis of spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture can help improve the understanding of hydrological cycles, and provide benchmark information for drought management in Africa.

Reference-Guided De Novo Genome Assembly to Dissect a QTL Region for Submergence Tolerance Derived from Ciherang-Sub1	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						submergence; Ciherang-Sub1; genome assembly; genome; rice	RICE VARIETIES; READ ALIGNMENT; DROUGHT; GENE; CULTIVARS; RESPONSES; CLUSTER; SUB1A	Global climate change has increased the number of severe flooding events that affect agriculture, including rice production in the U.S. and internationally. Heavy rainfall can cause rice plants to be completely submerged, which can significantly affect grain yield or completely destroy the plants. Recently, a major effect submergence tolerance QTL during the vegetative stage, qSub8.1, which originated from Ciherang-Sub1, was identified in a mapping population derived from a cross between Ciherang-Sub1 and IR10F365. Ciherang-Sub1 was, in turn, derived from a cross between Ciherang and IR64-Sub1. Here, we characterize the qSub8.1 region by analyzing the sequence information of Ciherang-Sub1 and its two parents (Ciherang and IR64-Sub1) and compare the whole genome profile of these varieties with the Nipponbare and Minghui 63 (MH63) reference genomes. The three rice varieties were sequenced with 150 bp pair-end whole-genome shotgun sequencing (Illumina HiSeq4000), followed by performing the Trimmomatic-SOAPdenovo2-MUMmer3 pipeline for genome assembly, resulting in approximate genome sizes of 354.4, 343.7, and 344.7 Mb, with N50 values of 25.1, 25.4, and 26.1 kb, respectively. The results showed that the Ciherang-Sub1 genome is composed of 59-63% Ciherang, 22-24% of IR64-Sub1, and 15-17% of unknown sources. The genome profile revealed a more detailed genomic composition than previous marker-assisted breeding and showed that the qSub8.1 region is mostly from Ciherang, with some introgressed segments from IR64-Sub1 and currently unknown source(s).

While affecting marine and estuarine population dynamics, these scenarios may also favour the invasion and proliferation of opportunistic and potentially harmful species in new geographical areas-such as blooming jellyfish. These organisms are one of the less studied taxa, particularly the proliferative asexual benthic phase, to which effects of in situ and experimental global change scenarios are poorly addressed. Acclimation and plasticity to global change scenarios were individually assessed through life history and physiological responses (survival, settlement time, time until maturity, feeding activity, asexual reproduction and behaviour) of laboratory-reared ciliated buds and polyps (= scyphostomae) of the invasive Phyllorhiza punctata (Cnidaria: Rhizostomeae). The present study evaluated the effects of two temperature levels (21 degrees C-current thermal scenario, or 25 degrees C-warming scenario) and six salinity regimes resembling estuarine and marine conditions (15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40) during 21 days. Under warming, P. punctata scyphostomae showed faster development and budding rates upon estuarine-like salinities, but higher mortality and reduced development under marine-like conditions-an ecological niche trade-off since at 21 degrees C such pattern was not found. Overall, our results suggest that global changes might prompt P. punctata proliferation through polyp colonisation mainly in estuarine areas and potentially increase blooming events with further implications at local and regional scales.

While these TCs provide much-needed precipitation for the country's hydrological cycle, extreme precipitation from TCs may also cause damaging hazards such as floods and landslides. This study examines the relationship between TC extreme precipitation and TC characteristics, including movement speed, intensity and season, for westward-moving TCs crossing Luzon, northern Philippines. We measure extreme precipitation by the weighted precipitation exceedance (WPE), calculated against a 95th percentile threshold, which considers both the magnitude and spatial extent of TC-related extreme precipitation. WPE has a significant, moderate positive relationship with TC intensity with a non-significant, weak negative relationship with movement speed. When TCs are classified by intensity 1 day before landfall (or pre-landfall), Typhoons (1-min maximum sustained wind speed >= 64 knots) tend to yield higher WPE than non-Typhoons (<64 knots). On the other hand, when TCs are classified by pre-landfall speed, slow TCs (movement speed <11.38 knots) tend to yield higher WPE than fast TCs (movement speed >= 11.38 knots). However, the relationship between pre-landfall TC intensity and WPE is more pronounced during June-September while there is no significant difference between the WPE of the southwest monsoon (June-September) and northeast monsoon (October-December) seasons. These results suggest that it is important to consider the pre-landfall cyclone movement speed, intensity and season to anticipate extreme precipitation of incoming TCs. A decision table considering these factors is devised to aid in TC extreme precipitation forecasting.

J	Gao, Y; Na, XD; Li, WL				Gao, Yu; Na, Xiaodong; Li, Wenliang			The impact of water supplement on habitat suitability for breeding red-crowned cranes	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Water management; Water supply; Red-crowned crane; Habitat suitability; Hydrodynamic model; Niche model	PREDICTION; DYNAMICS	With the increasing influence of climate change and human activities, water shortage in wetlands is becoming an urgent problem. In order to maintain waterfowl habitat and prevent wetland degradation, water management strategies have been implemented for many wetland reserves. However, there is often uncertainty concerning optimal water supply amount, especially during the breeding periods of endangered waterfowls. In this study, the MIKE 21 hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the impact of different water supply amounts on water depths in the Zhalong wetlands, China. The simulated water depths were utilized to evaluate the area of suitable habitat for breeding red-crowned cranes (Grus japonensis) based on the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) niche model. The optimal water supply amount was determined by maximizing the extent of suitable breeding red-crowned cranes habitat. Results suggest that for the Zhalong wetlands, water depth is the key habitat feature which determines the variability of suitable habitat extent. The optimal water supply amount for the Zhalong wetlands in 2014 was 1.13 x 108 m3, producing a suitable breeding habitat area of 237.25 km2 at the end of the water supply period, 50% greater than the suitable habitat extent with the existing water supplement scenario. The proposed method, combining a hydrodynamic model with the MaxEnt niche model, has the potential to determine optimal water supply amount to any semi-closed floodplain. The results of the current study can not only provide an evidence base for wetland water management, but also provide a scientific basis for the study of wetland ecohydrological processes and their impact on wetland biological diversity conservation.

Widespread loss of mammalian lineage and dietary diversity in the early Oligocene of Afro-Arabia	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							GLOBAL CLIMATE; R PACKAGE; EOCENE; EVOLUTION; PRIMATES; ETHIOPIA; MIOCENE; AFRICAN; DIVERGENCE; INFERENCE	Using time-scaled phylogenies of several endemic clades of small Afro-Arabian mammals, Dorien de Vries et al. infer a steep drop in species numbers around the Eocene-Oligocene transition. This dramatic decline coincides with a global cooling trend as well as the onset of widespread flood basalt volcanism in East Africa, and is found to be correlated with a major loss in dietary diversity. Diverse lines of geological and geochemical evidence indicate that the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) marked the onset of a global cooling phase, rapid growth of the Antarctic ice sheet, and a worldwide drop in sea level. Paleontologists have established that shifts in mammalian community structure in Europe and Asia were broadly coincident with these events, but the potential impact of early Oligocene climate change on the mammalian communities of Afro-Arabia has long been unclear. Here we employ dated phylogenies of multiple endemic Afro-Arabian mammal clades (anomaluroid and hystricognath rodents, anthropoid and strepsirrhine primates, and carnivorous hyaenodonts) to investigate lineage diversification and loss since the early Eocene. These analyses provide evidence for widespread mammalian extinction in the early Oligocene of Afro-Arabia, with almost two-thirds of peak late Eocene diversity lost in these clades by similar to 30 Ma. Using homology-free dental topographic metrics, we further demonstrate that the loss of Afro-Arabian rodent and primate lineages was associated with a major reduction in molar occlusal topographic disparity, suggesting a correlated loss of dietary diversity. These results raise new questions about the relative importance of global versus local influences in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of Afro-Arabia's endemic mammals during the Oligocene.

One of the main implementation challenges in these countries is the lack of reliable weather data for index development and implementation. The increasing availability of satellite data could ease the constraints of data access. Meanwhile, the suitability of various satellite products for yield estimation across world regions has to undergo a thorough assessment. This study contributes to the literature by systematically analyzing the accuracy of some globally available satellite data, namely the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) compared to ground-level weather information for 14 different indicators for the case of Uzbekistan. Our analysis indicates that those sources may provide the necessary data for an accessible and adequate climate service. However, a considerable risk of overestimation and underestimation depending on the source of satellite data may exist, especially for precipitation data in the conditions of Central Asia. Among the tested datasets, GSMaP showed a relatively better performance than CHIRPS in precipitation estimation for drought and flood detection. In order to reduce detection inaccuracy, the application of satellite weather products for index insurance is possible when temporal aggregation (e.g., monthly, seasonal) is considered. Globally available climate data could serve as a good source to establish index insurance products in Central Asia; however, a careful selection of source and index is required.

Surviving Invasion: Regaining Native Fish Resilience Following Fish Invasions in a Modified Floodplain Landscape	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; flood management; floodplain resilience; invasive alien fish; native fisheries	CARP CYPRINUS-CARPIO; LOWER WAIKATO RIVER; FRESH-WATER FISH; EEL ANGUILLA-AUSTRALIS; COMMON CARP; NEW-ZEALAND; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; UPSTREAM MIGRATION; ILLINOIS RIVER; BLACK MUDFISH	Floodplain ecosystems are focal points for human settlement, and consequently are often subjected to extensive modification and infrastructure development. Establishment of non-native species in floodscapes presents a range of challenges when they become problematic and drive changes in native aquatic communities and ecosystems. These non-native species are often tolerant of reduced water and habitat quality, conferring a competitive advantage over native species. The coupled effects of invasive alien species, landscape modification and floodscape hydrological control collectively reduce ecological resilience, creating feedback loops that reinforce negative effects on native fish. The regulated lower Waikato River floodplain is a New Zealand hotspot for fish introductions, with their proliferation exacerbating the effects of agricultural development, urban expansion, and flood control infrastructure. We argue that the resilience of native fish assemblages to these pressures can be improved through utilizing a series of complementary measures, including enhanced catchment management, strategic alterations to the location, design, and operation of floodplain infrastructure (e.g., gates, pumpstations, and stopbanks), habitat restoration for native fish, and targeted management of invasive species. These measures will need to consider the likely persistence of invasive alien fish, however, to limit their expansion in the face of a changing climate. Although knowledge and implementation gaps exist, tying these strands together presents an opportunity to enhance the resilience of native fisheries into the future. Key to success will be re-thinking floodplain management to include ecosystem services, and this will require ongoing commitment and cooperation amongst all stakeholders to address knowledge gaps and enable effective implementation.

J	Mosquera, B; Mancini, M				Mosquera, Bruno; Mancini, Maria, V			Paleoenvironmental analysis of wet meadow in the Deseado Massif: Implications for the Holocene occupation of Argentinian Patagonia	HOLOCENE			English	Article						extra-Andean Patagonia; hiatus; human occupations; mid-Holocene; pollen; wet meadows	SANTA-CRUZ PROVINCE; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; LAGO-CARDIEL; LATE PLEISTOCENE; CLIMATE CHANGES; STEPPE ECOTONE; MIDHOLOCENE; RADIOCARBON; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS	Paleoenvironmental data from wet-meadow environments in the arid-semiarid region of Patagonia are still incipient and the paleoenvironmental records came from pollen sequences of caves and rockshelters. The main reasons to study wetland records are their undisturbed (by humans) sedimentologic continuity, in contrast to deposits in rock shelters and caves; and their regional presentation of environmental changes that can be compared to archeological data. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the past hydrological dynamic of a wet-meadow from Deseado Massif and its relationship with the human occupation. For this purpose, we present the results of the sediment and pollen analysis of Mallin La Primavera wet-meadow that provide a sequence starting in the mid-Holocene. The results indicate a lower water table in the mallin prior to 6900 cal yr BP. Sediment analysis indicates low energy sedimentation environment with flood events and very low energy streams. Human occupational data show chronological discontinuities in mid-Holocene in several regions of Patagonia and the southern cone. In the studied region, two chronological hiatuses (7828-6434 cal yr BP and 3005-2710 cal yr BP) where recognized that appear to correlate with shrub steppes, indicating dry conditions. These conditions may explain the lack of archeological radiocarbon dates in the area during this period. The integration of sediment and pollen results from the Deseado Massif indicates dry and windy conditions for the middle Holocene. The lack of archeological radiocarbon dates would have been influenced by the loss of moisture in water sources such as springs and their associated wet meadows (mallines).

The hardest hit from these climate extremes are women farmers with low adaptive capacity. This study explored women farmers' perceived indices of occurrence and severity of observed climate extremes in rural Ghana. Employing the qualitative method approach, eight focus group discussions and 15 interviews were conducted with women farmers under Centre for Alleviation of Poverty, Environment and Child Support GROW Project. The study adopted the thematic analytical approach for the data analysis. The results of the study revealed that the occurrence of drought, flood and bush fires has been an annual phenomenon over the past decade. In terms of severity, women farmers also reported that climate extremes, when they occurred, were very intense, especially drought and bush fires. The results further indicated that rainfall and temperature variations were markedly observed with the prediction of rainfall in particular becoming extremely difficult. Evidently, women farmers observed that climate extremes were caused by deforestation, bush fires and neglect of veneration of ancestral spirits. Importantly, the study found that women have devised their own means of responding to climate extremes to include support networks, savings and spiritual assistance from ancestors for rain when there was prolonged drought. The study recommends the need for the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and the Ministry of Environment Science and Technology to forecast and display information on the yearly occurrence and severity of drought, flood and bush fires to complement women's local knowledge in decision making.

Identifying Hotspots of Overgrazing in Pastoral Areas: Livestock Mobility and Fodder Supply-Demand Balances in Nyangatom, Lower Omo Valley, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						agro-pastoralism; livestock herding; fodder supply&#8211; demand; livestock mobility model; dry matter; agricultural expansion	DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; REGION; COMMUNITIES; BORANA; FORAGE; SYSTEM	The Nyangatom, in South Omo, Ethiopia, are a group of agro-pastoralists whose access to land is affected by large-scale sugarcane development projects. An informed selection of appropriate livestock management measures by local communities requires a spatially explicit representation of prevailing and changing supply-demand relationships for livestock herds among the Nyangatom. This study addresses this caveat and identifies seasonal and location-specific 'hotspots' in Nyangatom, where fodder demand exceeds supply. Assessments of fodder production are based on primary data collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. Overall, annual fodder availability is estimated at 508,967 tonnes against the requirement of 584,205 tons, resulting in a deficit of 12.9% annually after out-migration. Under the implementation of the Omo-V sugarcane project and climate change, the fodder supply deficit will worsen to 219,977 tonnes annually. The most critical dry matter hotspots are found in the western and central parts of Nyangatom near the Kibish River, which shows the highest livestock density. In contrast, better fodder supply is estimated around the southwestern and northeastern parts. Change in policy, the frequency of droughts, conflict, and the large-scale irrigation schemes-induced reduction of the Omo River floods are accounted for the changes. Thus, there are strong signals to the local community and government to collaborate to reduce the potential constraints that affect sustainable rangeland management and food security and ensure sufficient attention to the interest of the agro-pastoralists.

Sweetpotato is tolerant to environmental stresses such as drought, high temperature, and high salt, and therefore, is well adapted to marginal lands; however, it is relatively vulnerable to flooding stress, which severely reduces its yield and commercial value. To understand the flooding stress response of sweetpotato, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of the leaves of two sweetpotato cultivars with contrasting flooding stress tolerance levels: Yeonjami (YJM; flooding tolerant) and Jeonmi (JM; flooding sensitive). Both cultivars were partially submerged in water for 0, 0.5, and 3 days. RNA-seq data of both cultivars revealed 14,229 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were categorized into seven clusters and six groups, based on the expression pattern of co-expressed DEGs and expression duration of DEGs, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that DEGs of distinguishing functions between the two cultivars were involved in plant hormone signaling, carbohydrate transport, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Based on these results, we predict that YJM promotes adventitious growth, whereas JM exhibits shoot elongation under flooding stress. The expression levels of several key candidate genes involved in flooding tolerance correlated well with the comparative transcriptomics data. Overall, this study provides further insights into the molecular mechanism of flooding stress response in sweetpotato, and reveals candidate genes that could be used for developing new flooding tolerant sweetpotato cultivars.

In particular, Firenze-Prato-Pistoia basin has a long experience of ground deformation related to groundwater withdrawal. European remote-sensing satellite (ERS) data collected since 1992 have revealed the presence of several subsiding areas in the basin such as the south-eastern portion of the city of Pistoia. Sentinel-1 persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) measurements for 2015-2018 confirmed the long-term subsidence of this area, associated with intense horticulture (plant nurseries). At the same time, Sentinel-1 data revealed the unexpected movement of Pistoia historic center, which has always been considered stable in the past. To identify the complex relationship between aquifer conditions and ground displacement, a hydrogeologic model of the Pistoia aquifers was developed, applying an integrated modelling procedure. Hydrodynamic-parameter distributions, calibrated and validated by means of Sentinel-1 PSI measurements, suggest that subsidence in Pistoia area is probably related with the combined impacts of groundwater extraction and highly compressible aquitards. To evaluate the potential evolution of ground displacement, numerical simulations were extended until 2050, using regional and global climate model data, analyzing three different pumping-rate scenarios. This led to the development of several subsidence hazard maps of the city of Pistoia that display the influence of groundwater extraction in controlling land subsidence in the area. This study emphasizes the importance of developing proper groundwater management policies, especially in alluvial aquifers made of fine compressible sediments, in order to sustainably utilize underground freshwater resources and to avoid related side effects.

In the recent study, data measured at a frequency of one hour were collected from the Szigetkoz, an inland delta of the Danube. These were then used to determine the presence, or not, and magnitude of any hidden environmental background factors that may be causing groundwater level fluctuations. Through the application of dynamic factor analysis, it was revealed that changes in groundwater level are mainly determined by (i) the water level of neighboring rivers and (ii) evapotranspiration. The intensity of these factors may also be estimated spatially. If the background factors determined by dynamic factor analysis do indeed figure in the linear model as variables, then the time series of groundwater levels can be said to have been accurately estimated with the use of linear regression. The accuracy of the estimate is indicated by the fact that adjusted coefficient of determination exceeds 0.9 in 80% of the wells. The results, via an enhanced understanding of the reasons for changes in the fluctuation of groundwater, could assist in the development of sustainable water management and irrigation strategies and the preparation for varying potential climate change scenarios.

There is a need for more research, understanding, and planning for the management of this threat to transportation services. Using data on tidal flooding, transportation networks, land use, and population characteristics, the vulnerability of transportation systems to tidal flooding is assessed for Honolulu, Hawaii. Accessibility measures coupled with population characteristics provide quantitative estimates of travelers' underlying exposures and vulnerabilities to disruptions. Using GIS and overlay mapping techniques, at-risk roadway segments are identified and Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) are ranked in relation to accessibility changes. Trips to work and school, grocery shopping, recreational activities, and emergency services are analyzed. In addition to identifying critical, at-risk facilities, the analysis includes the consideration of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, young people, those on low incomes, and those with limited transportation options. Using a nonparametric, mean-shift clustering method, TAZs are ranked and prioritized for potential mitigation actions. While 90% of TAZs suffered minimal effects, several experienced up to 100% accessibility reduction. High priority areas are located in Laie, Punalua, Kailua, Waimanalo, Hawaii Kai, and near Honolulu Harbor. The analysis is useful, not just for transportation system planners but also for first responders, emergency managers, and others working to increase transportation system resilience. Designed as a flexible planning and decision-support tool, the approach could be adapted to plan for other types of hazards such as tsunamis or storm surges as well.

Status, Potential, Prospects, and Issues of Floodplain Wetland Fisheries in India: Synthesis and Review for Sustainable Management	REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE			English	Review						Floodplain wetland; status; ecology; fisheries; management	TRADITIONAL FISHING GEARS; SOIL ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; FRESH-WATER; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; WEST-BENGAL; GANGA BASIN; MYRIOPHYLLUM-SPICATUM; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; ANNOTATED CHECKLIST; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE	India is blessed with vast floodplain wetland resources of 0.5 million ha that are distributed in the Eastern and North Eastern States. They possess varying morphometry, ecological profile, trophic status and biota, and harbor around 96 fish species, however the fish diversity is declining in recent years due to anthropogenic and other stressors including climate change. The wetlands are serving the need for fish from sustenance level to high intensity with varying management regimes. The average fish yield realized from these wetlands was very low as 50 kg ha(-1)yr(-1)against the annual potential of 2000 kg ha(-1)yr(-1). The fish yield from these resources has enhanced through adoption of culture based fisheries and the average yield has increased to 400 kg ha(-1)yr(-1). The increase in fish yield is about 20% of the production potential and there exists wide scope for developing integrated management strategies for optimizing the fish yield. Insufficient access to scientific knowledge and technologies, loss of biodiversity, habitat degradation, poor fisheries infrastructure, weak financial capacity, lack of co-operative approach, poor linkages and unorganized institutional arrangements pose challenges in achieving the potential. The present review synthesizes the updated information available on floodplain wetlands and the changes and developments during the last few decades with reference to ecology, fisheries, biodiversity, production potential, threats, institutional arrangements, governance and recommends strategies for conservation and sustainable fisheries development.

Impacts and management strategies for crop production in waterlogged or flooded soils: A review	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Review							CORN YIELD RESPONSE; NITROGEN-FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT; UREASE INHIBITOR NBPT; PERMANENT RAISED BED; WINTER-WHEAT; CLAYPAN-SOIL; WATER-TABLE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SOYBEAN RESPONSE; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE	Globally, flooding is one of the most damaging abiotic stresses, besides drought, that affects 17 million km(2) of land surface annually. Recent research indicates that climate change is resulting in more extreme weather events, such as flooding or soil waterlogging, that negatively affect crop production. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how flooding stress affects crops and to develop improved production practices that make cropping systems more resilient and able to cope with extreme weather events. This review paper summarizes the current state of knowledge on the impacts of flooding or soil waterlogging on crop production losses, nitrogen (N) losses, and provides potential management strategies to reduce these losses. The factors affecting the extent of flooding injury in plants as well as plant adaptations under waterlogging stress are also discussed briefly. For the purpose of this review, "flooding" refers to the situation when all or part of the plant is submerged under water, whereas "soil waterlogging" refers to the situation where soil pores are saturated with water. Soil waterlogging also promotes soil N losses through runoff, leaching, and denitrification. Potential management practices that can be used to mitigate soil waterlogging stress include the use of flood-tolerant varieties, adjusting management practices, improving drainage, and practicing adaptive nutrient management strategies. However, these might be site- or crop-specific management practices and they should be validated for their economic viability before developing future management plans that promote sustainable crop yields from waterlogged soils.

Integrating such problems with health, environmental, political, socioeconomic, and sustainability issues has greatly increased demand for managing the problems. This research investigates the Iranians abilities in managing, developing, and maintaining their water resources throughout different traditional, transitional, and modern time periods. The study shows until the mid-transitional period, owning to the low population and large per capita water availability, Iranians did not feel a great need to make upgrades and alterations in managing water. In the late transitional period, after sending students to the West and founding advanced universities, gradually modern hydrological technologies started appearing in the major cities. In the modern era, population explosion, industry's development, consumerism culture, and unprecedented urbanization coupled with drought and global warming, have brought many difficulties for water sectors. Hence, the desire for supply-based policies has prevailed, and some strategies, such as deep-pumped well drilling, dam building, and inter-basin water transferring, have been undertaken to fix the problems. However, the water resource sustainability not only has not improved, but has worsened through imprudent policies such as food self-sufficiency and subsidizing water. Groundwater over-abstraction, soil-water degradation, shrinking and drying up of water bodies, intensifying flood hazards, dust storming, agricultural and ecological losses, and depopulation of rural areas are among direct and indirect evidence that confirm this claim. In conclusion, if these problems persist, the country will be at risk from water insecurity and water access conflicts.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of temperature and rainfall on rice production during the rice growth phases over the Punjab province, Pakistan, for the period of 1981-2017. The impact of climate on rice production is analyzed using the statistical techniques. Results show that maximum temperature negatively affects rice plant resulting in decrease in the number of plants at replantation stage. The positive impact of minimum temperature on rice production is also observed that may cause growth of plant, which affects the rice crop at replantation stage during vegetative phase. Results revealed that number of tillers and rice plant diet increase with the positive impact of rainfall at tillering stage. Maximum temperature has negative impact on rice crop at tillering and stem elongation stages. It is observed that rainfall has negative impact on rice plant at heading and flowering stages. Substantial reduction in rice production is observed due to damage of reproductive cells at heading and flowering stages during the reproductive phase. The negative effect of rainfall on rice production is also observed at milking stage during the ripening phase. The negative significant impact of rainfall is observed on gross domestic product per capita during the reproductive phase. This study also predicts that temperatures in the Punjab will rise in the near future; therefore, it is recommended that breeders should introduce rice varieties that consume less water and are more productive in high temperature.

To describe the epidemiology of human leptospirosis cases in Saint Lucia from 2010 to 2017 and determine whether there was a relationship between cases and rainfall and temperature. Methods. A retrospective analytical study was undertaken to describe the seasonal patterns of human leptospirosis cases reported to the Ministry of Health of Saint Lucia between 2010 and 2017. Confirmed cases of leptospirosis were analyzed according to age, sex, seasonality, and geographical distribution. Disease incidence was calculated and the association of cases with geographical distribution, rainfall, and temperature was investigated. Results. A total of 353 leptospirosis cases were reported between 2010 and 2017 and of these, 145 (40.6%) were laboratory confirmed. Cases were aged 7 to 73 years (mean 34 years; median 30 years) with a male to female ratio of 4.2:1. Six deaths were reported during the period, with an overall case fatality rate of 4.1%. There was no relationship between location (district) and incidence of leptospirosis in Saint Lucia. There was a weak correlation between rainfall and leptospirosis cases during the 8-year period (r(s) = 0.25, p = 0.015) but the correlation between cases and seasons was not statistically significant (dry season r(s) = 0.13, p = 0.42; wet season r(s) = 0.23, p = 0.08). There was no correlation between leptospirosis cases and temperature (r(s) = 0.07, p = 0.49). Conclusions. Leptospirosis has a seasonal distribution in Saint Lucia, with outbreaks during periods following increased rainfall and flooding, such as in the aftermath of tropical storms and hurricanes. Saint Lucia and other Caribbean countries should enhance surveillance for leptospirosis given the likelihood of increased flooding following frequent and intense rainfall due to climate change.

Early Warning Systems (EWS) have been proposed as a strategy for reducing the vulnerability of populations living in at-risk areas. A current challenge in knowledge of risk and disaster preparedness is the inclusion of sociodemographic characteristics of the population in EWS. In order to contribute for an initial comprehension of the dimensions of vulnerability in Brazil, the aim of this paper is to understand the conditions of at-risk populations at an intra-urban scale and the potential application in the Brazilian EWS (BEWS). Through an integration of demographic data and landslide and flood risk mappings of 825 municipalities historically affected by disasters in Brazilian territory, an estimation of 8,266,566 people and 2,470,506 households was achieved. This result indicates that for every 100 inhabitants, 9 lived in disaster risk areas in Brazil. A novel database containing sociodemographic and infrastructure basic services data is available for specific analysis of those who are exposed to disasters. These data, associated with hazard forecast, are essential for effective early warnings, which allow actions focusing the reduction of human losses. The knowledge of at risk population in Brazil may contribute to the identification of the more critical areas that require priority response actions, such as the ones with more presence of elderly, children and a higher concentration of residents in households without sanitation, which are indicators of vulnerability.

The Hayle, Gannel, and Camel estuaries and their adjacent open-coast shorelines were subject of various studies in the past principally in terms of mining impacts on estuarine sediments and sedimentation, but no regional synthesis of the contemporary behaviour has yet been attempted. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for the north coast of Cornwall are analysed for planform morphological changes of the systems. At the annual scale, intertidal bars and sandwaves migrate across the foreshore and into the inlet region, where flood-oriented and wave-forced movement is evident. This is evidenced at all the estuarine systems considered here. However, the steep upstream slope of the Hayle is almost devoid of bedforms, while the shallower upstream slope of the Gannel comprises similar scaled bedforms to the whole flood delta, and the megaripples of Camel flood delta are smaller on the backslope. Over the short-term covered by the LiDAR data considered here, there was no significant storm surges, and a relatively consistent wave climate. The occurrence of strong onshore wave conditions are possibly the drivers of contemporary behaviour, and with the inner estuary intertidal currents, for the movements of sediments within the estuarine environment, thereby causing the re-organisation of sediments and the shifting of channel position.

However, the interaction between floods and transportation was not investigated closely in the past. As transportation is the lifeline of any economy, it is essential to analyse potential dangers and threads that can lead to network capacity restraints. Considering the potential of flooding to affect large areas for long durations, disruptions to transportation can result in extensive knock-on effects. To examine how flooding can impact road transportation a novel methodology was developed into a software tool which integrates flood and traffic models. The flood is simulated with Info Works flood model and the traffic is represented by a detailed microscopic model (SUMO), which simulates individual vehicles and their interactions. Comparing normal (dry) traffic scenario with a flooded one yields the impacts of flooding on traffic (travelled distance and time, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, maps of speed changes on the roads). The results indicated that delays persist long after the perturbations of flooding have subsided and that durations of trip delays are extremely long in some cases whereas distance impacts are typically negligible. Major knock-on effects on the system indicated that even not flooded critical infrastructure should be considered in flood analysis, as their services may be indirectly impacted by the flood conditions. Although substantial, the impacts proved challenging to monetise as time delays are spread around many drivers and some trips (such as delay to a doctor's trip to the hospital) can have significant, but intangible consequences.

In this context, the present study examined how various disaster management institutions and policies in Manitoba have changed over the years, drawing insights from the existing literature. Framing devices employed included Birkland's policy change and learning framework, Peter May's categorization of policy learning, and other social learning literature. A total of 21 key informant interviews (KIIs), comprising 3 senior provincial political leaders, 10 senior bureaucrats, and 8 municipal emergency coordinators, were conducted to collect primary data. Our findings reveal that significant policy changes were made in response to events such as the droughts of the 1930s; the floods of 1950, 1966, 1997, and 2011; and the wildfires of 1989. However, these were largely "reactive" initiatives driven by "top-down" decision-making processes. While natural as well as technological disasters [such as the 1979 Mississauga (Ontario) train derailment and 1984 Bhopal (India) chemical plant disaster] led to the successful implementation of institutional learning provisions within Manitoba DEM policy, the achievement of similar provisions for responding to climate change and other emerging threats has been impeded by numerous barriers such as a lack of political will and/or financial constraints.

Process-based flood frequency analysis in an agricultural watershed exhibiting nonstationary flood seasonality	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							EXTREME-VALUE ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RUNOFF-MODEL; EXCEEDANCE PROBABILITIES; RAINFALL MODEL; TALL TALES; CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; SIMULATION; RIVER	Floods are the product of complex interactions among processes including precipitation, soil moisture, and watershed morphology. Conventional flood frequency analysis (FFA) methods such as design storms and discharge-based statistical methods offer few insights into these process interactions and how they "shape" the probability distributions of floods. Understanding and projecting flood frequency in conditions of nonstationary hydroclimate and land use require deeper understanding of these processes, some or all of which may be changing in ways that will be undersampled in observational records. This study presents an alternative "process-based" FFA approach that uses stochastic storm transposition to generate large numbers of realistic rainstorm "scenarios" based on relatively short rainfall remote sensing records. Long-term continuous hydrologic model simulations are used to derive seasonally varying distributions of watershed antecedent conditions. We couple rainstorm scenarios with seasonally appropriate antecedent conditions to simulate flood frequency. The methodology is applied to the 4002 km(2) Turkey River watershed in the Midwestern United States, which is undergoing significant climatic and hydrologic change. We show that, using only 15 years of rainfall records, our methodology can produce accurate estimates of "present-day" flood frequency. We found that shifts in the seasonality of soil moisture, snow, and extreme rainfall in the Turkey River exert important controls on flood frequency. We also demonstrate that process-based techniques may be prone to errors due to inadequate representation of specific seasonal processes within hydrologic models. If such mistakes are avoided, however, process-based approaches can provide a useful pathway toward understanding current and future flood frequency in nonstationary conditions and thus be valuable for supplementing existing FFA practices.

To quantify this response, this study scales extreme precipitation according to temperature using the statistical quantile regression and binning methods for 231 rain gauges during the period of 1985-2014. The positive 3%-7% scaling rates were found at most stations. The nonstationary return levels of extreme precipitation are investigated using monthly blocks of the maximum daily precipitation, considering the dependency of precipitation on the dewpoint, atmospheric air temperatures, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Consideration of Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land-cover types upwind of the stations in different directions classifies stations as urban and nonurban. The return levels for the maximum daily precipitation are greater over urban stations than those over nonurban stations especially after the spring months. This discrepancy was found by 5%-7% larger values in August for all of the classified station types. Analysis of the intensity-duration-frequency curves for urban and nonurban precipitation in August reveals that the assumption of stationarity leads to the underestimation of precipitation extremes due to the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to the nonstationary condition. The study concludes that nonstationary models should be used to estimate the return levels of extreme precipitation by considering the probable covariates such as the dewpoint and atmospheric air temperatures. In addition to the external forces, such as large-scale weather modes, circulation types, and temperature changes that drive extreme precipitation, urbanization could impact extreme precipitation in the Netherlands, particularly for short-duration events.

The study was carried out in the Vistula River valley near Magnuszew (middle Vistula course, central Poland). 24 geological boreholes were drilled to a depth of 2.0-8.5 m and groundwater table observations were conducted in a monitoring network consisting of 22 wells, 5 piezometers (screened within the Holocene alluvial aquifer) and 2 temporary water gauges. Identification of the diversity of the geological structure of the floodplain was supported by airborne laser scanning imaging, as well as high resolution satellite images and aerial photos. This remote sensing study allowed the creation of a conceptual model of hydrogeological conditions. Study takes into account the effects of the land forming activity of flood waters resulting from the evolution of the fluvial environment in the Holocene. Created conceptual model subsequently fed into the construction and calibration of a mathematical groundwater flow model using MODFLOW software. The study allowed the identification and characterisation of intensified groundwater flow zones. Concentrated flow in the substrate of flood protection levees constitutes a threat to their stability. Documented in many publications climate change will induce in future climate scenarios an increase in rainfall and prolongation of dry periods. The implementation of the methodology of identifying the geological forms with the use of presented techniques allows the identification of sections of flood embankments potentially at risk of failure.

Indicators were selected from the list of the World Meteorological Organization-Commission for Climatology (WMO-CCL) and the Research Programme on Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR). The indicators included the number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 10 mm/day (R10), maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD; days with precipitation lower that 1 mm), maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5D), and simple daily intensity index (SDII) which is the annual precipitation total divided by number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 1 mm, and the fraction of annual total precipitation due to events exceeding the 95th percentile (R95T) based on the period 1961-1990. Positive trends in the results were found for a majority of stations for R10, R5D, SDII, and R95T. Consecutive dry days was the only index that had a negative trend at a majority of stations. Spatial pattern analysis indicates greater changes in frequencies and magnitudes for eastern Kansas. Results from this study highlight observed climate shifts in precipitation patterns with a tendency towards greater and more frequent extreme precipitation in eastern Kansas and a tendency towards drier conditions in western Kansas. These hydroclimatic adjustments can produce costly impacts in areas that include flood management, hydraulic structures, water availability throughout the year, agricultural production, ecosystems, and human health.

Dysfunctional urban services that favor informal settlements are at the forefront of elements that increase vulnerability. Cases of cities that suffer from geo-hydrological hazards are increasingly reported in many regions, especially in tropical countries in the Global South. Yet, studies on such examples are rare and commonly overlook the human and societal components of hazard risks. Here, we focus on Bujumbura, a city in Africa that has experienced rapid unplanned growth and sprawl into unserviced areas because of the non-application or a lack of a valid urban planning law. After filling in the gap in data collected using high-resolution field surveys and focus group discussions, this study highlights various factors of vulnerability to geo-hydrological hazards in the urban area. Indeed, 108 events of flood and flash floods and 81 gullies were inventoried in Bujumbura between 1997 and 2021. These geo-hydrological hazards have had a significant impact, particularly on housing, and have caused increasing displacement of the population. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the inefficiency of the rainwater drainage system in the urban space. Our result demonstrates how the failure of the institutions responsible for urban management is at the top of all the causes of the vulnerability of the sprawling city. We anticipate that our empirical approach is an effective way to obtain concrete information to develop practical strategies to prevent and mitigate vulnerability to geo-hydrological hazards in urban sprawling contexts.

It is crucial to advance the understanding of long-term trends of hydro-climatic extremes for effective water resource planning and management. We analyzed 25 climatic extremes-related indices and 33 hydrologic extremes-related indices in a medium-range river basin in western Nepal, the Babai River Basin. We used RClimDex and Indicators for Hydrologic Alterations to analyze extreme climatic and hydrologic parameters. We computed monotonic trends to evaluate temporal changes in extreme events. The results show a positive trend of total precipitation at Kusum (+ 2.2 mm/year) and Bargadaha (+ 17.7 mm/year) stations and a negative trend at Gulariya (- 5.7 mm/year), Nayabasti (- 7.0 mm/year), Luwamjula (- 5.9 mm/year), and Ghorai (- 18.5 mm/year) stations. Similarly, we observe that almost all temperature extreme indices have a rising trend except the percentage of the days when the maximum temperature is less than the 10th percentile index at Rani Jaruwa station, located at a low elevation. Notably, the cold day temperature index falls at 0.13 days per year. Overall, the hydrologic alteration value shows moderate variability and reduction in the median flow for the second half. The findings of this study indicate that the study area is subjected to a reduced flow regime with a medium degree of variability.

Although a large number of methods for setting an EFlow regime have been developed, E-Flows science is still an emerging discipline in nonperennial rivers because of the lack of specific guidelines at the European and national level and the limited data availability (i.e., hydrological/biological). The aim of the present work was to define a methodology for setting an E-Flow regime in a region with limited data availability. The proposed approach was tested in the Locone basin (S Italy). A long time series (1971 to 2020) of daily streamflow in un-impacted conditions were simulated by using the SWAT + model, a new release of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The flow regime was characterized in un-impacted conditions by means of the Indicators of Hydrological Alterations (IHAs) based on modeled daily streamflow. The E-Flow regime was defined by adopting the Range of Variability Approach and assuming the interquartile range (25 th - 75 th percentile) as an acceptable range of variation of each IHA.

In 2019, the Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) that diverts Mississippi River water into the estuary opened twice in the same year for the first time in history to prevent flooding in New Orleans. Short-term water quality monitoring was conducted in shoreline areas with high public use for the presence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins to assess the public health risks. Field sampling methods and satellite imagery were used to determine water quality and quantify bloom intensity and toxicity across time and space. Long-term BCS opening created a fresh (salinity < 0.2) and nutrient-rich estuary that supported several cyanoHABs in warmer months during and after the second BCS closure. Cyanobacterial biomass ranged from 35 to 4972 & mu;g PC L-1, while toxin microcystin ranged from undetected to 8.41 & mu;g MC L-1. The highest biomass and toxin were detected on June 25 at the north shore, station LP8, Mandeville Beach, dominated by Microcystis and Dolichospermum species. CyanoHABs occurred mostly in the northern part of the estuary, where tributary discharge is also a strong influence. Some of these blooms exited the estuary and were transported to the Gulf of Mexico following passage through Lake Borgne and then Mississippi Sound. Modifications in the timing and duration of river diversion operations can create prolonged cyanobacterial blooms that can cause environmental and public health risks, especially in warmer months, and this may intensify due to a changing climate.

However, these coupled processes are rarely documented through high-resolution measurements focused on water-carbon interactions. We collated a state-of-the-art high-frequency data set throughout a snowmelt and early post snowmelt period, alongside regular samples of stream water, precipitation, and snowmelt isotopes (d(18)O). Our study was conducted during the 2019 snowmelt and initial post snowmelt season in a subarctic, peatland influenced headwater catchment in Pallas, Northern Finland. We measured high-frequency dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in-stream carbon dioxide (pCO(2)). We identified a change in hydrological processes as the snowmelt season progressed and the post snowmelt season began. We found (a) Overland flow dominated stream DOC dynamics in early snowmelt, while increased catchment connectivity opened new distal pathways in the later snowmelt period; (b) CO2 processes were initially driven by rapid bursts of CO2 from the meltwaters in snowmelt, followed by dilution and source limitation emerging post snowmelt as deep soil pathways replaced the snowpack as the main source of CO2; (c) stream carbon concentration shifted from being relatively balanced between CO2 and DOC during the early snowmelt period to being increasingly DOC dominated as snowmelt progressed due to changes in DOC and CO2 source supply. The study highlights the importance of using high-frequency measurements combined with high-frequency data analyses to identify changes in the processes driving water-carbon interactions. The degree to which water-carbon interactions respond to the continuation of Arctic water cycle amplification is central to delineating the evolving complexity of the future Arctic.

Flood prediction tools are critical for flood hazard and risk management. However, numerous reviews on flood modelling have focused on individual models. This study presents a state-of-the-art review of flood prediction tools with a focus on analyzing the chronological growth of the research in the field of flood prediction, the evolutionary trends in flood prediction, analysing the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, and finally identifying the significant gaps for future studies. The article conducted a review and meta-analysis of 1101 research articles indexed by the Scopus database in the last five years (2017-2022) using Biblioshiny in r. The study drew an up-to-date picture of the recent developments, emerging topical trends, and gaps for future studies. The finding shows that machine learning models are widely used in flood prediction, while Probabilistic models like Copula and Bayesian Network (B.N.) play significant roles in the uncertainty assessment of flood risk, and should be explored since these events are uncertain. It was also found that the advancement of the remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and cloud computing provides the best platform to integrate data and tools for flood prediction. However, more research should be conducted in Africa, South Africa and Australia, where less work is done and the potential of the probabilistic models in flood prediction should be explored.

In this context, the health sector and especially surgery are relevant emitters of greenhouse gases, thus contributing to the magnitude of the climate crisis. Many reviews regarding the impacts on human health are available; however, a view from the surgical perspective has so far been underrepresented.Material and methods This narrative review summarizes the relevance of climate-related changes for the surgical disciplines based on a literature search.Results Immediate impacts are expected by the increasing number of extreme weather events, e.g., floods, droughts and wildfires. In these settings, surgery is a part of the disaster medicine chain but simultaneously the functionality of surgical departments can be impaired or even break down when they are themselves affected by extreme weather events. Heat waves cause an increase in surgical site infections, which may lead to postponement of elective surgery for patients at high risk. Collateral impacts are mirrored by an increase in the incidence of lung and skin cancers, which often need surgical treatment within a multidisciplinary setting. Additionally, there are indirect impacts that are of a very different nature, e.g., inadequate diet which leads to further deterioration of the greenhouse gas footprint of the health sector due to the necessity of bariatric surgical capacities.Conclusion The climate crisis represents a major challenge in surgery and all other medical disciplines. At the same time is it indispensable that the health sector and therefore surgery, take steps towards a zero emission pathway.

However, there has been little work that uses distributed hydrological modeling to consider their optimum location and design in order to reduce the flood risk in a river catchment. This work considers two existing and two potential ponds in the 22.8 km(2) Braid Burn catchment, Edinburgh, Scotland. Using the Shetran physically based distributed hydrological model, the effect of these ponds on the river discharges for eight measured rainfall events and two design rainfall events is considered. The results show the larger Blackford pond is best at reducing the peak discharge at the catchment outlet. The other three ponds are designed to be almost the same. The potential pond in the upper part of the catchment reduces the peak discharge at the outlet; the pond in the middle at Oxgangs makes little difference to the peak discharge, while the potential pond in the lower part of the catchment increases the peak discharge at the outlet. These results show that when considering flood risk, the location of a retention pond within a river catchment is important, and it can make the flooding worse at the outlet if it is located in the wrong location. This work suggests the pond should be located in the upper part of the catchment, although the ideal location will depend on the catchment's shape and lag time.

Increasing rainfall intensity significantly escalates soil erosion and soil erosion related hazards. Forecasting accurate rainfall helps early detection of soil erosion vulnerability and can minimise the damages by taking appropriate measures caused by severe storms, droughts and floods. This study aims to predict soil erosion probability using the deep learning approach: long short-term memory neural network model (LSTM) and revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model. Daily rainfall data were gathered from five agro-meteorological stations in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka from 1990 to 2021 and fed into the LSTM model simulation. The LSTM model was forecasted with the time-series monthly rainfall data for a long lead time period, rainfall values for next 36 months in each station. Geo-informatics tools were used to create the rainfall erosivity map layer for the year 2024. The RUSLE model prediction indicates the average annual soil erosion over the Highlands will be 11.92 t/ha/yr. Soil erosion susceptibility map suggests around 30 % of the land area will be categorised as moderate to very-high soil erosion susceptible classes. The resulted map layer was validated using past soil erosion map layers developed for 2000, 2010 and 2019. The soil erosion susceptibility map indicates an accuracy of 0.93 with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), showing a satisfactory prediction performance. These findings will be helpful in policy-level decision making and researchers can further tested different deep learning models with the RUSLE model to enhance the prediction capability of soil erosion probability.

Sulfur Biogeochemical Cycling and Redox Dynamics in a Shale-Dominated Mountainous Watershed	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							X-RAY-ABSORPTION; XANES SPECTROSCOPY; SULFATE REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EAST RIVER; HUMIC-ACID; SPECIATION; CHEMISTRY; SOIL; OXIDATION	Sulfur (S) is an essential macronutrient and important component of the earth's crust, and its cycling has critical impacts on trace metal mobility, water quality, and human health. Pyrite weathering is the primary pathway by which sulfur enters surface waters. However, biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in soils and the river corridor mediates sulfate exports. In this study, we identified the major forms of sulfur across multiple compartments and scales in a pristine mountainous watershed, including shale bedrock weathering profiles, hillslope soils, and alluvial floodplain sediments, in order to provide insight into biogeochemical sulfur cycling in a hydrologically variable alpine system. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis of shale weathering profiles showed clear evidence of pyrite oxidation to sulfate, with large accumulations of intermediate S(0) (20%-53%). Micro-scale XANES showed evidence of reprecipitation of pyrite at fracture surfaces within the permanently saturated zone. Organic sulfur dominated S speciation in shallow hillslope soil and floodplain sediment, with little evidence of reduced inorganic S. However, mackinawite formation, representing active sulfate reduction, was observed in saturated oxbow sediments and saturated weathered shale underlying floodplain sediments. Further evidence of sulfate reduction from aqueous sulfur isotopic analysis was observed in shallow groundwater transects across an Fe-reducing meander, whereas increases in pore water sulfate concentrations implied sulfur oxidation at other locations. The data present an integrated picture of sulfur cycling in a shale-dominated watershed, where riverine sulfate exports are mediated by biological cycling, particularly in redox-stratified and temporally dynamic hyporheic zone sediments.

Experiences, beliefs, and attitudes of lifeguards from Australia and the United Kingdom toward lifeguard involvement in flood mitigation and response	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Education; Training; Drowning; Emergency; First responder; Interoperability		Introduction: Flooding causes significant mortality and morbidity, with impacts expected to increase with climate change. Ensuring adequate country-level flood mitigation and response capacity is key. Lifeguards, traditionally used for drowning prevention, may represent an additional workforce for flood emergency response. Methods: Through an anonymous, online survey, we explored experiences, beliefs, and attitudes of a convenience sample of surf lifeguards from Australia and England towards lifeguards' involvement in flood response. Respondents were recruited via Surf Life Saving Australia and Great Britain and had prior training in flood rescue. Analysis comprised descriptive statistics and thematic coding of free-text responses. Results: Forty-four responses were received (93.2% male, 34.1% aged 50-59 years; 61.4% from Australia; 61.4% with >= 16 years lifesaving experience). Twenty-nine respondents (65.9%) self-reported having previously responded to flooding, 15 of which responded prior to receiving flood training. Lifeguards commonly reported being involved in the flood response phase (n = 28). Respondents identified rescue skills (n = 43; 97.7%), awareness of water conditions (n = 40; 90.9%), and radio communication protocols (n = 40; 90.9%) as relevant in a flood scenario. Respondents broadly agreed lifeguards were an asset in flood response due to transferrable skills, including to bolster existing capacity. However, respondents noted need for greater recognition, for involvement earlier in flood response and for flood-specific training and equipment prior to deployment. Discussion & Conclusions: Lifeguards represent a willing and able workforce to support flood mitigation and response, some of whom are already being tasked with such work. Provision of flood-specific training and equipment are vital, as is addressing intemperability tensions.

Some of these lakes abruptly released pulses of water and sediment with disastrous downstream consequences. Yet it remains unclear whether the reported rise of these glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) has been fueled by a warming atmosphere and enhanced meltwater production, or simply a growing research effort. Here we estimate trends and biases in GLOF reporting based on the largest global catalog of 1,997 dated glacier-related floods in six major mountain ranges from 1901 to 2017. We find that the positive trend in the number of reported GLOFs has decayed distinctly after a break in the 1970s, coinciding with independently detected trend changes in annual air temperatures and in the annual number of field-based glacier surveys (a proxy of scientific reporting). We observe that GLOF reports and glacier surveys decelerated, while temperature rise accelerated in the past five decades. Enhanced warming alone can thus hardly explain the annual number of reported GLOFs, suggesting that temperature-driven glacier lake formation, growth, and failure are weakly coupled, or that outbursts have been overlooked. Indeed, our analysis emphasizes a distinct geographic and temporal bias in GLOF reporting, and we project that between two to four out of five GLOFs on average might have gone unnoticed in the early to mid-20th century. We recommend that such biases should be considered, or better corrected for, when attributing the frequency of reported GLOFs to atmospheric warming.

We divided our study area into four zones based on elevation and precipitation. For each zone, our simulations were conducted using three plant-ing methods: dry direct-seeded rice (DDSR), wet direct-seeded rice (WDSR), and transplanted-flooded rice (TFR), with three rice cultivars of different growth duration: Yangliangyou6 (long-duration), Huanghuazhan (mid-duration), and Lvhan1 (short-duration). Additionally, the optimal irrigation strategy for WDSR was determined with the CERES-Rice model. Our results indicated that the yields of WDSR with the optimal irrigation strategy were comparable with those of TFR in low-elevation regions but were less than the TFR yields in high-elevation areas. Furthermore, the rice yields increased at first and then decreased with increasing elevation, which was affected by growing period length and pho-tosynthesis rate. Compared with the other two cultivars, the short-duration cultivar may be more suitable for growing in high-elevation regions. In addition, high precipitation could facilitate the cultivation of the long-duration cultivar in low-elevation regions, as it gives DDSR a yield potential comparable to that of WDSR for the short-duration cultivar in high-elevation regions. This study could help farmers choose optimal field management practices based on elevation and precipitation, ensuring sustainable and improved rice production.

Anomalous accumulation of terrigenous mud in marginal shelf environments and concentration of sand in terrestrial deposits during the PETM have both been inferred to represent an increase in fluvial sediment flux. A corresponding increase in water discharge or river slope would have been required to transport this additional sediment. However, in many locations, evidence for changes in fluvial slope is weak, and geochemical proxies and climate models indicate that while runoff variability may have increased, mean annual precipitation was unaffected or potentially decreased. Here, we explored whether changes in river morphodynamics under variable-discharge conditions could have contributed to increased fluvial sand concentration during the PETM. Using field observations, we reconstructed channel paleohydraulics, mobility, and avulsion behavior for the Wasatch Formation (Piceance Basin, Colorado, USA). Our data provide no evidence for changes in fluvial slope during the PETM, and thus no evidence for enhanced sediment discharge. However, our data do show evidence of increased fluvial bar reworking and advection of sediment to floodplains during channel avulsion, consistent with experimental studies of alluvial systems subjected to variable discharge. High discharge variability increases channel mobility and floodplain reworking, which retains coarse sediment while remobilizing and exporting fine sediment through the alluvial system. This mechanism can explain anomalous fine sediment accumulation on continental shelves without invoking sustained increases in fluvial sediment and water discharge.

Trading Fast and Slow: Fish Marketing Networks Provide Flexible Livelihood Opportunities on an East African Floodplain	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						inland small-scale fisheries; informal fish trade; food and nutrition security; women in fisheries; Rufiji River	SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES; FOOD SECURITY; NUTRITION SECURITY; CAPTURE FISHERIES; LAKE VICTORIA; LOWER RUFIJI; FOR-SEX; GENDER; CONSERVATION; AQUACULTURE	Domestic marketing networks in inland small-scale fisheries (SSF) provide food and income to millions of the rural poor globally. Yet these contributions remain undervalued, as most trade is informal and unmonitored, and inland fisheries overlooked in research and policy. Taking a commodity chain approach, we provide a case study of access arrangements governing how people come to enter and benefit from the freshwater fish trade on Tanzania's Rufiji River floodplain. We conducted a repeat market survey, interviews, and participant observation with actors at all levels of the district trade over 15 months. Gender, age, and social capital structured participation patterns, with younger men dominating the more lucrative but riskier fresh trade, older men prioritizing steady income from smoked fish, and women culturally constrained to selling a "cooked" product (i.e., fried fish). Nearly all participants were local, with traders drawing on a complex web of relationships to secure supplies. The majority of market vendors cited the trade as their household's most important income source, with women's earnings and consumption of unsold fish likely to have substantial benefits for children's well-being. Our findings reveal a resilient and pro-poor trade system where, starting with small initial investments, people overcame considerable environmental, financial, regulatory, and infrastructural challenges to reliably deliver fish to rural and urban consumers. Preserving the ecological integrity of Rufiji wetlands in the face of hydro-power development and climate change should be a priority to safeguard the livelihoods and well-being of local inhabitants.

Communities exposed to such vagaries of nature continuously strive to adapt to such events. These adaptive practices can be traced spatially through transformations in Land Use Land Cover (LULC). This study hypothesizes that these spatial transformations are a function of the spatial manifestation due to changes in livelihood practices resulting from exposure to natural hazards. Moreover, the spatial dimensions of changes observed are dichotomous in nature and express themselves differently based on local stimuli. LULC transformations between the period 2002-2014, along with socio-economic data and semi-structured interviews were used to identify the drivers of LULC changes in coastal districts of West Bengal, India. In this study, evidence of transformations triggered by natural hazards are differently expressed for zone in proximity to coastal areas and zone in proximity to a primate metropolitan area. Results from the analyses show three predominant changes - increasing trends from agriculture to aquaculture practices in coastal tidal influence Blocks (270.39%), trends of rapid urbanization, and increases of the built-up (rural) area in Blocks adjoining the metropolitan area (58.18%). Statistical analyses revealed that the changes in the area under aquaculture can be attributed to change in area under agriculture practice and accessibility to a station of suburban railway network. Similarly, for Blocks in the rural areas, it was observed that the change in the built-up area can be explained by existing built-up area/fallow land and its distance from the district headquarter.

However, the accurate identification of water bodies is a long-term challenge due to human activities and climate change. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been drawn, increasing attention to water extraction due to the availability of weather conditions, water sensitivity and high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study investigated the abilities of random forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and support vector machine (SVM) methods to identify water bodies using Sentinel-1 imageries in the upper stream of the Yangtze River, China. Three sets of hyper-parameters including default values, optimized by grid searches and genetic algorithms, were examined for each model. Model performances were evaluated using a Sentinel-1 image of the developed site and the transfer site. The results showed that SVM outperformed RF and XGB under the three scenarios on both the validated and transfer sites. Among them, SVM optimized by genetic algorithm obtained the best accuracy with precisions of 0.9917 and 0.985, kappa statistics of 0.9833 and 0.97, F1-scores of 0.9919 and 0.9848 on validated and transfer sites, respectively. The best model was then used to identify the dynamic changes in water surfaces during the 2020 flood season in the study area. Overall, the study further demonstrated that SVM optimized using a genetic algorithm was a suitable method for monitoring water surface changes with a Sentinel-1 dataset.

The use of location-allocation models (LAMs) for evacuation in regard to flood victims is essential to minimize disaster risk. In the first step, flood susceptibility maps were developed using machine learning models (MLMs), including: Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation (LM-BP) neural network and decision trees (DT) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. Performance of the MLMs and MCDM techniques were assessed considering the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Mathematical approaches in a geographic information system(GIS) for four well-known LAM problems affecting emergency rescue time are proposed: maximal covering location problem (MCLP), the maximize attendance (MA), p-median problem (PMP), and the location set covering problem(LSCP). The results showed that existing EECs were not optimally distributed, and that some areas were not adequately served by EECs (i.e., not all demand points could be reached within a 60-min travel time). We concluded that the proposed models can be used to improve planning of the distribution of EECs, and that application of the models could contribute to reducing human casualties, property losses, and improve emergency operation.

This study presents the actual flash flood quantification in Al-Lith Watershed, Saudi Arabia. The study is divided into two steps: first is actual flood mapping using remote sensing data, and the second is the flood volume calculation. Two Sentinel-1 images are processed to map the actual flood, i.e., image from 25 May 2018 (dry condition), and 24 November 2018 (peak flood condition). SNAP software is used for the flood mapping step. During SNAP processing, selecting the backscatter data representing the actual flood in an arid region is challenging. The dB range value from 7.23-14.22 is believed to represent the flood. In GIS software, the flood map result is converted into polygon to define the flood boundary. The flood boundary that is overlaid with Digital Elevation Map (DEM) is filled with the same elevation value. The Focal Statistics neighborhood method with three iterations is used to generate the flood surface elevation inside the flood boundary. The raster contains depth information is derived by subtraction of the flood surface elevation with DEM. Several steps are carried out to minimize the overcalculation outside the flood boundary. The flood volume can be derived by the multiplication of flood depth points with each cell size area. The flash flood volume in Al-Lith Watershed on 24 November 2018 is 155,507,439 m(3). Validity checks are performed by comparing it with other studies, and the result shows that the number is reliable.

In this paper, Annual and monthly maxima of daily temperature and rainfall data dating from 1901-2016 and 1950-2018 are characterized for nine countries within the greater horn of Africa. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is fitted to the data sets from each of the nine countries using the method of maximum likelihood. Both the location and scale parameters of the GEV is formulated as a function of time to account for variability and trends in the extremes of temperature and rainfall so that their future behavior can be predicted. Based on our results, We provide return levels for the years 2, 10, 50 100, and 200 which could be used as measures of flood protection. To understand the spatial cross-correlation patterns on different time scales in each country and how rainfall and temperature are related to agricultural variables, we utilize the detrended cross-correlation coefficient (rho(DCCA)) and its generalization, (DMCx2) to account for that, respectively. Given the results of the (DMCx2) and the fact that climate extremes pose a huge threat to agriculture and food security, we employed copula based models to describe the structure of dependence between climatic variables and the crop related variables such as yield and production quantity. The results from the copula analysis show that irrespective of the country, climatic factors and the agricultural products(production/yield) the strongest dependence is demonstrated by the pairs involving cereal crops, while the weakest dependence is characterized by the pairs involving regular potato.

The annual sediment load (ASL, t.yr(-1)) in the main stream of the Yellow River in the past 100 years (1919-2018) shows that the ASL was consistently high for the first 60 years and then decreased gradually until 1999, when the Green for Grain Project (GGP) launched on the Loess Plateau caused ASL to drop sharply. The annual runoff did not decrease as much as ASL from1919 to 2018, while it decreased significantly in themiddle reaches. With the construction of sediment storage dams, terraces, and reservoirs, especially after the GGP launched, the ASL of the Yellow River has been reduced to historic lows. For example, the annual average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the Yellow River Basin increased significantly from 1982 to 2016, and the ASL decreased exponentially with increasing NDVI. Although the annual precipitation has a stationary behavior in the Yellow River, the daily precipitation extremes affecting erosion showed an increase of 7% per degree ofwarming but did not change the trend of ASL reduction. Therefore, the effectivemanagement on the Loess Plateau can control the trend of the sediment load of the Yellow River. Erosion, sediment load, and runoff in changing environments are affected by flood control and drought resistance, so more attention should be paid to these hydrologic processes.

Vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) exhibit superior insulation performance than conventional insulating panels, but it is necessary to reduce the heat loss at the edge through the envelope material of VIPs and improve their weak constructability. In this study, infrared-dried core materials and metal-less films were developed and applied to improve the thermal performance of VIPs, and a VIP composite board was proposed to improve the constructability. The manufactured VIPs and VIP composite boards were experimentally and numerically analyzed to evaluate the effective thermal performance, considering heat loss at the edges and connections. The dry core improved the thermal conductivity of the center of the VIP by 25% compared to the wet core, and the metal-less film resulted in the greatest reduction in heat loss with respect to the edges and connections. The effective thermal conductivity of a 0.6m x 0.6m metal-less VIP with two connected metal-less VIPs is 3.4 mW/m K, including thermal bridges at edges and connections. The variation in the effective thermal conductivity of the VIP composite board according to its thickness and the effective thermal conductivity of the VIP provides a reference for manufacturing VIP composite boards that can suitable meet thermal performance requirements if also future aging studies would give good enough results.

J	Mielby, S; Henriksen, HJ				Mielby, Susie; Henriksen, Hans Jorgen			Hydrogeological Studies Integrating the Climate, Freshwater Cycle, and Catchment Geography for the Benefit of Urban Resilience and Sustainability	WATER			English	Article						urban; resilience; sustainability; hazards; subsurface; water cycle; land-use; infrastructure; planning; catchment; hydrogeology	GOVERNANCE; DENMARK; INDICATORS; RESOURCES; DROUGHT; UPDATE	Today, there is an increasing need to understand how to link the management of the surface and subsurface to avoid disasters in many urban areas and/or reduce the likelihood of future risks. There is a need for thorough investigation of subsurface processes. This investigation should entail an analysis of water security, flood risks, and drought hazards in urban areas that may affect long-term sustainability and the ability to recover from disturbance, e.g., a capacity for resilience. In this context, as part of this analysis, potential biophysical and hydro-meteorological hazards need to be studied and subdivided according to geological, hydrogeological, man-made, and climatic origin, and by their characteristic temporal scales and site specific characteristics. The introduction of adaptive design and resilience in urban and suburban planning and management requires a shift towards more organic, adaptive, and flexible design and management strategies. This leads to the use of a complex cross-disciplinary methodology. We consider data collation, modelling, and monitoring designed to fit typical urban situations and complexity. Furthermore, implementation of strategic planning, decision-making to manage the consequences of future infrastructure and constructions are considered. The case studies presented are experiences from different hydrogeological studies performed in Odense, Denmark. Rising population and densification is affecting Odense, and there is risk of raised seawater level, groundwater, and surface-water flooding. The anthropogenic modification of subsurface structures and increased climate changes enhance the risk of hazards and the risk of coinciding impacts.

Runoff assessment and modeling in arid regions by integration of watershed and hydrologic models with GIS techniques	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Flash floods; HEC-HMS; Hydrograph; Rainfall; Runoff; Watershed		Assessment of the flash flood hazard in arid regions is a serious challenge, especially as the climate changes. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia lies in one of the most arid regions of the world and is known for recurring flash floods in many basins, particularly in the southwest. Many dams have been constructed in some basins; however, flash floods sometimes cause catastrophic damage for mankind and infrastructure when the floods' intensity and capacity are higher than those the dams and reservoirs were intended to contain. This study aims to assess runoff and reservoir capacity of the Jazan Basin in different return periods of rainfall events based on integrations between two models deals with morphometric parameters and hydrologic characteristics. These models are, Watershed Modeling System (WMS) and the Hydrological Modeling System (HEC HMS) in addition to Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Our results show that the dam peak storage in the condition of zero and full reservoir storage ranges from 55 x 10(6) to 98 x 10(6) m(3) and from 84 x 10(6) to 124 x 10(6) m(3), respectively. The corresponding area of the dam reservoir (lake) in all scenarios ranges from 9 to 11.3 km(2), respectively, for 5 and 100 year return periods. Sub-basins 2 and 3 contribute about 56% of the total runoff volume of Jazan Basin, while Sub-basins 1, 4, and 5 contribute about 44%. These results highlight the value of using an integrated modeling approach to assess and mitigate flash flood hazards in arid environments worldwide.

Such fluctuations significantly affect the growth and reproduction of submerged macrophytes, but the role of WLF on plant physiological mechanisms is far from clear. Our aims are to examine the effects of WLF on the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria spinulosa by testing changes in (1) chloroplast pigments, (2) the response of antioxidant enzymes, (3) the concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and (4) plant stoichiometry (ratios of C/N, C/P and N/P). In outdoor mesocosms, plants were subjected to two amplitudes and two frequencies of WLF, with stable water level as a control. Generally, compared with the control, the fluctuation treatments showed higher chlorophyll a and b concentrations. Increased amplitude and frequency promoted peroxidase (POD) activity in V. spinulosa, indicating a response to oxidative stress, but superoxide dismutase (SOD) remained unchanged. Moreover, compared with the control, WLF generally increased leaf P and reversely affected the leaf C/P and N/P ratios of plants. The C and N contents in the plants were relatively stable following WLF, but with increasing WLF amplitude, P absorption (i.e. leaf P content) by V. spinulosa was promoted. Our results indicate that the ability of V. spinulosa to successfully grow in floodplains may be related to the physiological adaptive strategies according to the alterations in WLF. Combined effects of several hydrological factors on shallow lake should be further studied in order to maintain the health and sustainability of shallow lake systems.

The complex regional geological history gave rise to a mosaic of impressive landforms located within a relatively small area. The extraordinary relief with many unique geo-sites was generated by dynamic processes associated with the late Cainozoic orogenesis in conjunction with the past climatic variations. The cyclicity of bedrock weathering and mass sediment transfer are manifested by Mesozoic fossiliferous formations, large sand dune fields, and loess-palaeosol-cryogenic series providing archives of the Quaternary evolution. Pleistocene glaciations followed by cataclysmic floods from the released ice-dammed lakes during the recessional glacier stages have produced an exceptional imprint in the mountain areas. Many archaeological localities and historic monuments, some being a part of the UNESCO World Natural and Cultural Heritage, are associated with the most prominent topographic places. Geo-tourism focusing on the most exquisite landscapes and spectacular geological settings is the new trend in the country with still minor activities that take advantage of the region's supreme geoheritage potential. The great geo-diversity accentuates the touristic value of this still marginally explored geographic area. Reconnaissance, documentation, and publicity of the most unique geo-sites and geo-parks provide an impetus for their registration in the national and international nature heritage protection programs under proper geo-environmental conservation policies.

The procedure was implemented in a Geographic Information System framework named "Resilience and Disaster Risk Management" that manages spatial and non-spatial data through the implementation of workflows aimed at streamlining and standardizing all the steps. Indices and indicators are used to semi-quantitatively assess the environmental driver that, along with economic, social and institutional component, governs the direction of the urban system. The indicators/indices were here investigated and mapped at the census district scale. The procedure was tested at Ischia Island (Southern Italy) exposed to volcanic, seismic, landslide, flood and coastal erosion hazards. The spatial variability of environmental resilience is shown into 13 maps that discretize the island into high, medium and low resilience classes. They resulted valid tools to prepare the urban system to possible future hazardous events during the mitigation phase of disaster-risk management (long term) but also to illustrate the capacity of a system to respond/withstand and react in the response and recovery phases (short term). The mapping procedure can be applied to larger areas at risk keeping the censual districts as the minimum territorial reference units or using municipal, regional or national administrative units. The expected integration of resilience assessment in territorial planning (e.g. Regional Territorial Plan, Provincial Territorial Plan, and Municipality Territorial Plan) could greatly benefit from the outcomes of the present research for overcoming sectoral approaches in territorial management.

Future Changes in the Hydrologic Cycle Associated with Flood-Producing Storms in California	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Flood events; Climate change; Hydrometeorology		California receives much of its precipitation from cool-season atmospheric rivers, which contribute to water resources and flooding. In winter 2017, a large number of atmospheric rivers caused anomalous winter precipitation, near-saturated soils, and a partial melting of snowpack, which led to excessive runoff that damaged the emergency spillway of the Oroville Dam. Given the positive and negative impacts ARs have in California, it is necessary to understand how they will change in a future climate. While prior studies have examined future changes in the frequency of atmospheric rivers impacting the West Coast of the United States, these studies primarily use coarse global climate models that are unable to resolve the complex terrain of this region. Such a limitation is overcome by using a high-resolution convection-permitting regional climate model, which resolves complex topography and orographic rainfall processes that are the main drivers of heavy precipitation in landfalling atmospheric rivers. This high-resolution model is used to examine changes to precipitation and runoff in California's cool season from 2002 to 2013, particularly in flood-producing storms associated with atmospheric rivers, in a future, warmer climate using a pseudo-global warming approach. In 45 flood-producing storms, precipitation and runoff increase by 21%-26% and 15%-34%, respectively, while SWE decreases by 32%-90%, with the greatest changes at mid-elevations. These trends are consistent with future precipitation changes during the entire cool season. Results suggest more intense floods and less snowpack available for water resources in the future, which should be carefully considered in California's future water management plans.

J	Zhou, YL				Zhou, Yanlai			Exploring multidecadal changes in climate and reservoir storage for assessing nonstationarity in flood peaks and risks worldwide by an integrated frequency analysis approach	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Reservoir regulation; Nonstationarity; Flood risk; Water management	TRENDS; PATTERNS; STATIONARITY; STREAMFLOW; SHIFTS; SCALE; DEAD	The changing climate and reservoir storage have a far-reaching influence on the nonstationarity in flood peaks worldwide, but the quantification of the relative contribution of each covariate (i.e., climate and reservoir storage) is fundamentally challenging especially under the time-varying mechanisms in statistical properties. This study proposed an integrated flood frequency analysis for assessing the impacts of changing climate and reservoir storage on the nonstationarity in flood peaks and flood risks worldwide. The 32 major river catchments covering more than 60% of hydro-meteorological observation stations and 70% of reservoir storage worldwide constituted the case study. The proposed three-faceted approach was explored systematically through: modeling the nonstationarity in global flood peaks, identifying the contribution of changing climate and reservoir storage to the nonstationarity of flood peaks, and quantifying the change in flood risks under the nonstationary condition. The findings pointed out that global flood trends varied from increasing + 19.3%/decade to decreasing -31.6%/decade. Taking the stationary flood frequency analysis as the benchmark, the comparative results revealed that the flood risk in 5 rivers under the nonstationary condition in response to warming climate significantly increased (1% -> 5%) over the historical period whereas the flood risk in 7 rivers in response to increasing reservoir storage largely reduced (1% > 0.5%). Despite the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of observations, the changes in flood peaks evaluated here were explicitly in lined with the changing climate and reservoir storage, supporting the demand for considering the nonstationarity of flood peaks and risks in social infrastructure planning and designing as well as water management.

Among the environmental stressors, tropical cyclones frequently impact the coastal people of Bangladesh. This paper details a study on the vulnerability and adaptation strategies of older people in the face of cyclones in a coastal location in Bangladesh using qualitative strategy of enquiry. Field data have been collected through 32 semi-structured interviews, three focus group discussions, and three oral history in three selected villages (Lebubunia, Gabura and Dumuria) in the study area. In this research, we argue that the aged are more affected compared to an adult in a cyclone. Findings show that due to their fewer assets and dependency on young adult family members, older people experience high vulnerability in cyclone landfall. Moreover, their lesser physical strength and weakening mental capacity make them vulnerable. In the absence of appropriate essential initiatives-lack of social awareness, training, limited access to health facilities-vulnerability borders on the extreme. Often the elderly are deprived of proper sanitation and hygiene facilities, food security, and family care and support. Many also lack access to government income support. To increase older persons' adaptability to cyclone disasters, all levels of society need to pay them special attention.

J	Mera, AP; Balijepalli, C				Mera, Allan Penafiel; Balijepalli, Chandra			Towards improving resilience of cities: an optimisation approach to minimising vulnerability to disruption due to natural disasters under budgetary constraints	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Resilience; Vulnerability; Bi-level optimisation; Simulated Annealing; Traffic assignment	ROAD NETWORK; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMS; ROBUSTNESS INDEX; LINKS	In recent years, climate change emerged as a dominant concern to many parts of the world bringing in huge economic losses disturbing normal business/life. In particular cities are suffering from floods affecting land based transportation systems in a significant manner more frequently than ever. Many local authorities facing funding cuts are suffering from limited budgets and they are put under even higher pressure when looking for resources to recover the damaged networks. The agencies involved with post-disaster reconstruction too struggle to prioritise the network links to recover. This paper addresses the problem of road maintenance/development with the aim of improving resilience of the network by formulating the problem as a mathematical model that minimises the vulnerability to disruption due to natural incidents under budgetary constraints. This paper extends the critical link analysis from a single link being disrupted to the case of multiple links, and for the first time proposes an objective function involving a measure of vulnerability to minimise. Metaheuristic Simulated Annealing method is used to reach near global optimal solution for a real-life network with large demand. A segment of the City of York in England has been used to illustrate the principles involved. Numerical experiments indicate that Simulated Annealing based optimisation method outperforms the 'volume-priority' heuristic approach, returning higher value for money spent. The proposed approach spreads the benefits across wider population by including more number of links in the priority list while reducing the vulnerability to disruption.

Dali is an ethnic minority autonomous prefecture in southwest China, and is severely vulnerable to seismic hazards. This paper aims to understand household-level seismic risk-coping behavior, namely willingness to pay for HEI and structural retrofit, in rural ethnic minority communities (EMC) in Dali, and then to identify factors that could significantly affect their behavior to increase their possibility of successful disaster response. The seismic risk-coping behavior among rural households of EMC in Dali is surveyed and the relationship between their behavior and the affecting factors are measured by the Binary Logit Model. The results indicate that both HEI and structural retrofit are not widely adopted by households; contrarily, most prefer relying on fiscal subsidies to cope with seismic risk instead of taking precautionary action. Their behavior has been found to be positively influenced by risk perception, and negatively affected by fiscal subsidies. Moreover, HEI uptake shows a positive relationship with insurance experience and household income, but a negative correlation with migrant-worker ratios. In addition, households with buildings having higher anti-seismic capacity are more reluctant toward structural retrofit. However, ethnicity, religious belief, age, education and gender have no significant impact on behavior. Results of this work may add to further acquisition of household-level seismic risk-coping behavior adoption among these communities in need, along with providing implications for implementing seismic risk reduction in rural EMC.

Berg) Miers is characteristic of oligotrophic Amazonian black-water floodplain forests (igapo), seasonally inundated up to 10 months per year, often forming monodominant stands. We investigatedE. tenuifolia' growth and mortality patterns in undisturbed (Jau National Park - JNP) and disturbedigapos(Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve - USDR, downstream of the Balbina hydroelectric dam). We analysed age-diameter relationships, basal area increment (BAI) through 5-cm diameter classes, growth changes and growth ratios preceding death, BAI clustering, BAI ratio, and dated the individual year of death (C-14). Growth and mortality patterns were then related to climatic or anthropogenic disturbances. Results were similar for both populations for estimated maximum ages (JNP, 466 yr; USDR, 498 yr, except for one USDR tree with an estimated age of 820 yr) and slightly different for mean diameter increment (JNP: 2.04 mm; USDR: 2.28 mm). Living trees from JNP showed altered growth post-1975 and sparse tree mortality occurred at various times, possibly induced by extreme hydroclimatic events. In contrast with the JNP, abrupt growth changes and massive mortality occurred in the USDR after the dam construction began (1983). Even more than 30 yr after dam construction, flood-pulse alteration continues to affect both growth and mortality ofE. tenuifolia. Besides its vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances, this species is also susceptible to long-lasting dry and wet periods induced by climatic events, the combination of both processes may cause its local and regional extinction.

To deal with the urban flooding and water quality issues, China has introduced the sponge city initiative to optimize urban water ecosystem. As a large-scale public project addressing environmental issues, the sponge city initiative is subject to public financial support and perception. Willingness to pay (WTP) is an effective tool to explore public behavioral intention and evaluate integrated benefits of project. This study aims to investigate the pathway to improve WTP from a 'perceived value' perspective based on Theory of Planned Behavior. Guyuan city, one of the pilot sponge cities in China, is chosen as a case study, and a questionnaire survey was administered in the affected communities with 656 respondents. Under the framework of planned behavior, the results showed that: (1) Perceived behavioral control had the strongest effect on WTP, especially the obstacle from perceived economic capacity was highlighted; (2) The consistency of attitude-intention relationship was identified, while subjective norm was not critical to WTP; (3) Perceived value was highlighted as the antecedent to predict WTP indirectly via the dual frameworks from value to behavior; (4) A 8.3% surcharge of domestic water tariff was accepted as reasonable for the sponge city development. These findings provide practical implications for government and developers to optimize financing and operation of sponge city developments. As a result, the sustainable performance of sponge city could be improved. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Estimation of Direct and Indirect Economic Losses Caused by a Flood With Long-Lasting Inundation: Application to the 2011 Thailand Flood	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Flood; Thailand; direct; indirect economic losses; computable general equilibrium model; global river and inundation model	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER FLOOD; RISK; DATABASE; DELTA	River floods are common natural disasters that cause serious economic damage worldwide. In addition to direct economic damage, such as the destruction of physical assets, floods with long-lasting inundation cause direct and indirect economic losses within and outside the affected area. Direct economic losses include loss of opportunity, due to interruption of business activities, and the costs associated with emergency measures such as cleaning, while indirect economic losses affect sectors within the trade and supply network. Few studies have explicitly estimated direct and indirect economic losses in several sectors, due to the difficulty of modeling inundation depth and period at finer scales. Here we developed a global modeling framework to estimate the direct and indirect economic losses associated with floods using a computable general equilibrium model and a global river and inundation model, which can simulate the flood extent, depth, and period. Application of the method to the 2011 Thailand flood demonstrated that the estimated economic losses due to business interruption in the industry and service sectors totaled $14.7 billion, which was about two thirds of the estimated direct economic damage caused by the flood ($22.0 billion). The estimated indirect economic losses reduced the gross domestic product of Thailand by 4.81% in 2011, without considering transboundary effects, and will cause more than 0.5% reduction in gross domestic product even in 2030, resulting in $55.3 billion of total losses from 2011 to 2030. Comprehensive estimation of direct and indirect economic losses facilitates understanding of various types of flood-related economic risks during and after a flood.

A new stratigraphic framework and constraints for the position of the Paleocene-Eocene boundary in the rapidly subsiding Hanna Basin, Wyoming	GEOSPHERE			English	Article							GREEN RIVER FORMATION; THERMAL MAXIMUM; PALEOGEOGRAPHIC RECORD; PALUSTRINE CARBONATES; UNITED-STATES; NORTH-AMERICA; CLIMATE; GULF; GEOCHEMISTRY; PALEOCLIMATE	The Paleocene-Eocene strata of the rapidly subsiding Hanna Basin give insights in sedimentation patterns and regional paleogeography during the Laramide orogeny and across the climatic event at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Abundant coalbeds and carbonaceous shales of the fluvial, paludal, and lacustrine strata of the Hanna Formation offer a different depositional setting than PETM sections described in the nearby Piceance and Bighorn Basins, and the uniquely high sediment accumulation rates give an expanded and near-complete record across this interval. Stratigraphic sections were measured for an similar to 1250 m interval spanning the Paleocene-Eocene boundary across the northeastern syncline of the basin, documenting depositional changes between axial fluvial sandstones, basin margin, paludal, floodplain, and lacustrine deposits. Leaf macrofossils, palynology, mollusks, delta C-13 isotopes of bulk organic matter, and zircon sample locations were integrated within the stratigraphic framework and refined the position of the PETM. As observed in other basins of the same age, an interval of coarse, amalgamated sandstones occurs as a response to the PETM. Although this pulse of relatively coarser sediment appears related to climate change at the PETM, it must be noted that several very similar sandstone bodies occur with the Hanna Formation. These sandstones occur in regular intervals and have an apparent cyclic pattern; however, age control is not sufficient yet to address the origin of the cyclicity. Signs of increased ponding and lake expansion upward in the section appear to be a response to basin isolation by emerging Laramide uplifts.

Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22 degrees 20'S-68 degrees 35'W, 2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility, hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations; anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified. Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert of the world.

Environmental factors such as river discharge and temperature have being proposed as triggers of reproductive cycle in fish. In temperate climates, fish reproduction is affected mainly by temperature, while is influenced by flood pulses in large tropical rivers. We evaluated the influence of temperature and river discharge as triggers of Iheringichthys labrosus' reproduction. We studied the following reproductive variables: gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI) and condition factor (K). Females of I. labrosus were examined in a time series of ten years along three sites located in Lower Uruguay River at the beginning (last week of November-first week of December, spring) and by the end of the reproductive period (middle-end of April, autumn). Generalised linear models detected a positive effect of mean winter temperature and site on the spring mature female GSI. Site was significant in addition to the interaction between temperature and site. Moreover, the effect of winter temperature was stronger than water discharge in triggering reproductive timing of I. labrosus, contrary to the model proposed for other species in tropical systems. Additionally, a literature review suggested a latitudinal gradient on reproduction, occurring earlier and prolonged with decreasing latitude (and increasing temperature). In this study, we stated the effect of temperature on the life history in a Neotropical fish using a multifaceted approach, particularly important in the current context of global climate warming.

J	Ribas, A; Olcina, J; Sauri, D				Ribas, Anna; Olcina, Jorge; Sauri, David			More exposed but also more vulnerable? Climate change, high intensity precipitation events and flooding in Mediterranean Spain	DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptation; Floods; Precipitation; Exposure; Intensity; Mediterranean Spain	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; SCENARIOS; LOSSES; BASIN; RISK	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of high intensity precipitation events in increasing the vulnerability to floods in Mediterranean Spain. Precipitation intensity in this area appears to have augmented in the last two decades in association with warming trends of the Mediterranean Sea. At the same time, intense urbanization processes, occupying and transforming flood prone land, have produced an important increase in exposure. The main objective is to assess whether higher intensity precipitation and changing patterns in exposure aggravate vulnerability to floods. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, vulnerability is understood as the result of the interrelationships between exposure, sensitivity, impacts and adaptive capacity. Consequently, methods used involved the compilation and analysis of published and unpublished precipitation data, population and land use data, data on insurance claims, and media sources related to those variables. Findings Changes toward episodes of more intense precipitation in the expanding urban areas of Mediterranean Spain increase exposure but not necessarily vulnerability, at least in terms of human deaths. However, adaptative capacity needs to be formulated. Actions that attempt to absorb and eventually reuse flood flows (as the flood park in Alicante) appear to be more effective than traditional hydraulic solutions (as in Majorca). Originality/value The paper provides a systematic and coherent approach to vulnerability analysis taking into account the changing dynamics of its components. Especially, it signals the limits of current adaptive approaches to flooding and advocates for changes toward a more circular and less linear approach to urban drainage.

The primary cause of urban flooding is rapid urbanization, which is outpacing infrastructure development and drainage system improvements. This paper utilizes a verified flood model that couples hydrological and hydrodynamic processes to investigate the flood response under rainfall events with different patterns. A sponge city pilot area in China is taken as a case study. Drainage system performance, surface inundation patterns, and relation between them are investigated by carrying out statistical analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, respectively. Results show that with increases in the rainfall recurrence interval (RRI) and peak position ratio (PPR), drainage system performance indicators (DSPIs) generally become worse, and the total inundation area (TIA) and surface inundation areas of larger depths become larger. The response time exhibits varied patterns but generally decreases with increasing recurrence intervals and peak ratios. For surface inundation, the recurrence interval presents an increasingly significant role compared with the peak ratio as rainfall becomes heavier. Compared with other DSPIs, the volume of overflowed manholes (VOMs) shows a delayed response to rainfall and has a stronger relationship with the inundation areas with greater water depths, which indicates a possible solution of utilizing manhole storage for water management and flood control. Analyzing the response of drainage systems and flood patterns to different rainfall events using a model coupling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes comprehensively reveals the specific problems of the study area and possible innovative solutions. The analytical method and knowledge gained can help support urban flood management in China and around the world.

Synergistic Interaction of Climate and Land-Use Drivers Alter the Function of North American, Prairie-Pothole Wetlands	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						prairie pothole wetlands; climate change; land-use change; wetland drainage; PHyLiSS model	CHANGE IMPACTS; WATER LEVELS; DAKOTA; REGION; CONSERVATION; LANDSCAPE; DROUGHT; VULNERABILITY; CONNECTIVITY; COMMUNITIES	Prairie-pothole wetlands provide the critical habitat necessary for supporting North American migratory waterfowl populations. However, climate and land-use change threaten the sustainability of these wetland ecosystems. Very few experiments and analyses have been designed to investigate the relative impacts of climate and land-use change drivers, as well as the antagonistic or synergistic interactions among these drivers on ecosystem processes. Prairie-pothole wetland water budgets are highly dependent on atmospheric inputs and especially surface runoff, which makes them especially susceptible to changes in climate and land use. Here, we present the history of prairie-pothole climate and land-use change research and address the following research questions: 1) What are the relative effects of climate and land-use change on the sustainability of prairie-pothole wetlands? and 2) Do the effects of climate and land-use change interact differently under different climatic conditions? To address these research questions, we modeled 25 wetland basins (1949-2018) and measured the response of the lowest wetland in the watershed to wetland drainage and climate variability. We found that during an extremely wet period (1993-2000) wetland drainage decreased the time at which the lowest wetland reached its spill point by four years, resulting in 10 times the amount of water spilling out of the watershed towards local stream networks. By quantifying the relative effects of both climate and land-use drivers on wetland ecosystems our findings can help managers cope with uncertainties about flooding risks and provide insight into how to manage wetlands to restore functionality.

Convergent human and climate forcing of late-Holocene flooding in Northwest England	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article						Flood hazard; Human activity; Lake sediments; North Atlantic Oscillation; Paleofloods; Solar forcing	LAKE-SEDIMENTS; ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; PARTICLE-SIZE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; FRENCH ALPS; RECORD; FREQUENCY; MAGNITUDE; CUMBRIA; BRITAIN	Concern is growing that climate change may amplify global flood risk but short hydrological data series hamper hazard assessment. Lake sediment reconstructions are capturing a fuller picture of rare, high-magnitude events but the UK has produced few lake palaeoflood records. We report the longest lake-derived flood reconstruction for the UK to date, a 1500-year record from Brotherswater, northwest England. Its catchment is well-suited physiographically to palaeoflood research, but its homogeneous, dark brown sediment matrix precludes visual identification of flood layers. Instead, an outlier detection routine applied to high-resolution particle size measurements showed a > 90% match, in stratigraphic sequence, to measured high river flows. Our lateHolocene palaeoflood reconstruction reveals nine multi-decadal periods of more frequent flooding (510-630 CE, 890-960, 990-1080, 1470-1560, 1590-1620, 1650-1710, 1740-1770, 1830-1890 and 1920-2012), and these show a significant association with negative winter North Atlantic Oscillation (wNAO) phasing and some synchrony with solar minima. These flood-rich episodes also overlap with local and regional land-use intensification, which we propose has amplified the flood signal by creating a more efficient catchment sediment conveyor and more rapid hillslope-channel hydrological connectivity. Disentangling anthropogenic and climatic drivers is a challenge but anthropogenic landscape transformation should evidently not be underestimated in palaeoflood reconstructions. Our paper also demonstrates that flood histories can be extracted from the numerous lakes worldwide containing organic-rich, visually homogeneous sediments. This transformative evidence base should lead to more reliable assessments of flood frequency and risks to ecosystems and infrastructure.	[Schillereff, D.

Such changes are likely to influence habitat quality for migratory songbirds occupying mangrove wetlands during the tropical dry season. Overwintering habitat quality is known to be associated with fitness in migratory songbirds, yet studies have focused primarily on territorial species. Little is known about the ecology of nonterritorial species that may display more complex movement patterns within and among habitats of differing quality. In this study, we assess within-season survival and movement at two spatio-temporal scales of a nonterritorial overwintering bird, the prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea), that depends on mangroves and tropical lowland forests. Specifically, we (a) estimated within-patch survival and persistence over a six-week period using radio-tagged birds in central Panama and (b) modeled abundance and occupancy dynamics at survey points throughout eastern Panama and northern Colombia as the dry season progressed. We found that site persistence was highest in mangroves; however, the probability of survival did not differ among habitats. The probability of warbler occupancy increased with canopy cover, and wet habitats were least likely to experience local extinction as the dry season progressed. We also found that warbler abundance is highest in forests with the tallest canopies. This study is one of the first to demonstrate habitat-dependent occupancy and movement in a nonterritorial overwintering migrant songbird, and our findings highlight the need to conserve intact, mature mangrove, and lowland forests.

Integrating human behavior dynamics into drought risk assessment-A sociohydrologic, agent-based approach	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						adaptation; agent-based modeling; behavior; drought; risk; sociohydrology	HUMAN DECISION-MAKING; LAND-USE MODELS; SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; WATER-RESOURCES; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; COUPLED HUMAN	Droughts are a persistent and costly hazard impacting human and environmental systems. As climate variability continues to increase and socioeconomic development influences the distribution of wealth and people, drought risk is expected to increase in many parts of the world. The unique characteristics of droughts-namely their slow onset, large spatiotemporal extent, human-influenced propagation, delayed impacts and teleconnection potential-make it difficult to correctly assess drought impact and calculate risk. Further complicating this calculation is the capacity for humans to make adaptive decisions before, during, and after a drought event, which in turn alters expected impacts. In this sense, droughts are equally a social and hydroclimatic issue. Risk perception is one of the main factors driving adaptation decisions, yet most models neglect how humans view and respond to risk, and in particular how experiences influence decisions through time. In this overview, we describe a framework that extends the traditional risk modeling approach to include the two-way feedback between the transient adaptation decisions and drought exposure, vulnerability and hazard. We discuss how a sociohydrologic, agent-based modeling setup, focused on individual and collective actions, can simulate the adaptive behaviors of different stakeholders to examine how emergent actions might influence projected drought risk. We suggest such an approach can provide a test-bed for understanding adaptive behaviors in an increasingly drought-prone world and could allow for better prioritization of drought adaptation strategies; refined understanding of future scenarios; and a vehicle to drive planning and resilience building.

Monarch Butterfly Distribution and Breeding Ecology in Idaho and Washington	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						monarch butterfly; Danaus plexippus; milkweed; Asclepias; Idaho; Washington; monarch breeding habitat; milkweed and monarch threats	DANAUS-PLEXIPPUS L.; RUSSIAN OLIVE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEPIDOPTERA; INVASION; EASTERN; RIVER; NYMPHALIDAE; PATTERNS; DECLINES	Studies of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) and their milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in North America have focused primarily on monarch populations ranging east of the Rocky Mountains. We report the first systematic assessment of monarch butterfly and milkweed populations in the western states of Idaho and Washington, states at the northern tier of western monarch breeding range. Results of our 2-year study (2016-2017) offer new insights into monarch breeding habitat distribution, characteristics, and threat factors in our 2 states. We documented milkweeds and breeding monarchs in all 16 climate divisions in our study area. Milkweed and breeding monarch phenologies were examined with evidence supporting 2, and possibly 3 monarch generations produced in Idaho and Washington. Key monarch breeding habitats were moist-soil sites within matrices of grasslands, wetlands, deciduous forest, and shrub-steppe supporting large, contiguous, and high-density milkweed stands. Co-occurrence of showy milkweed (A. speciosa) and swamp milkweed (A. incarnata) was an important indicator of productive monarch breeding habitat in Idaho. Nectar plants were generally limited in quantity and richness across the study area, particularly in late summer, and included frequently-used non-native, invasive species. Primary threats at milkweed sites were invasive plant species, herbicide application, and mowing, followed by secondary threats of recreational disturbance, livestock grazing, insecticide application, loss of floodplain function, and wildfire. We provide management recommendations and research needs to address ongoing stressors and knowledge gaps in Idaho and Washington with the goal of conserving monarchs and their habitats in the West.

Iran has six major basins, all with different climates, from very humid to very arid. This work is a review of the available studies and data about channel adjustments in Iranian rivers, and aims to reconstruct a first outline, at a national scale, of types, magnitude, and causes of adjustments. The results show that most of the rivers have undergone incision (1 to 2 m and, in some cases, up to 6 to 7 m) and narrowing (from 19% to 73%), although widening (from 22% to 349%) has occurred in some rivers. Narrowing is due to dams and sediment mining; widening is due to climate change and sediment mining. Incision is due to gravel and sand mining, dams, channelization, with in-channel mining being the main cause of incision. Channel adjustments have occurred in basins with different climates, but it seems that widening has been more intense in arid and semi-arid climates. Such adjustments have several negative effects (e.g., damage to bridges, degradation of river ecosystems, and instability of banks). The comparison between Iran and other countries shows that narrowing and incision have been the dominant processes in most of the rivers, while damming and in-channel mining have been used as the main controlling factors. Data about adjustments in Iranian rivers are neither homogeneous nor complete for all the rivers. This lack of completeness implies that our understanding of channel changes, and their causes, should be improved by further investigation.

The present study represents a unique effort to understand perceptions of flood hazards in light of the geographic background. Situated in Alabama, the United States, the cities of Mobile and Huntsville display two different physical geographic contexts. Despite one being a coastal city (Mobile) and the other being an inland city, both are similarly vulnerable to flooding. We first present results of historical analyses of heavy precipitation in both cities and analysis of storm surge history in the city of Mobile. We then report results of both descriptive statistical and inferential statistical analyses based on a two-city residents' survey that was conducted in the spring of 2016. We find that residents in both cities are able to connect the particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments. Residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of precipitation when making assessments of flooding. Despite the fact that Huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as Mobile in recent history, residents of Huntsville tend to link heavy rainfall - the most frequent cause of flooding in that city, with flooding. In contrast, residents of Mobile tend to link hurricanes, more particularly hurricane number, with flooding. These results show that people are attuned to their physical environments and take into consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of natural hazards. More studies need to be conducted to further investigate the dynamics of physical exposure to hazards and risk perceptions in other geographic areas.

Objectives: This project empirically generated items for a novel survey instrument of household hazard vulnerability with initial construct validation while addressing racial bias in the data collection process. Methods: Cognitive interviews facilitated understanding regarding the performance of drafted survey questions with transdisciplinary expert panelists from diverse US regions on unique hazard/disaster/event items. To prevent representation bias in data collection, those with Black and/or African American racial, biracial, or multiracial identities were over-sampled. Interview video recordings were qualitatively analyzed using thematic and pattern coding. Results: A cognitive process mapped to themes of disaster characteristics, resources, individual life facets, and felt effects was revealed. We identified 379 unique instances of linked terms as synonyms, co-occurring, compounding, or cascading events. Potential for racial bias in data collection was elucidated. Analysis of radiation exposure, trauma, and criminal acts of intent items revealed participants may not interpret survey items with these terms as intended. Conclusion: Potential for racial bias exists relative to water dam failure, evacuation, external flood, suspicious packages/substances, and transportation failure. Hazard terms that were not interpreted as intended require further revision in the validation process of individual or household disaster vulnerability assessments. Several commonalities in the cognitive process and mapping of disaster terms may be utilized in disaster and climate change research aimed at the individual and household unit of analysis.

The HighResMIP suite provides high spatial resolution (i.e., 25- and 50-km) forcings that have been shown to improve the representation of climate processes. However, little is known about their suitability for hydrologic applications. We use outputs from the HighResMIP suite to simulate annual maximum discharge with the Hillslope-Link Model (HLM) at similar to 1,000 river communities across Iowa. First, we assess whether the runoff from the climate models can be directly routed through the river network model in HLM to estimate annual maximum discharge. Runoff-based simulations can capture the empirical distribution of flood peaks in five of the 10 models/members assessed. Next, we force the HLM with precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration from HighResMIP models to simulate flood peaks, finding all models/members produce empirical distributions similar to our reference. However, significant biases exist in the model/member forcings as correct flood response is being generated for the wrong reason. To improve their suitability for community-level assessment, we use nine statistical approaches to bias-correct and downscale HighResMIP precipitation to a 4-km resolution. The bias-correction and downscaling of climate model precipitation performs well for all models/members. Furthermore, we do not find significant changes in the magnitude flood peak projections for Iowa based on the HLM forced with HighResMIP outputs, or based on routed runoff, while there are indications that the variability in flood peaks is projected to increase across the state.

Sporadic river inflow influences the sources and composition of estuarine particulate organic matter (POM). Shifting proportions of "high quality" POM, consisting of fresh, reactive, labile material, relative to "low quality," recalcitrant, less available fraction, may lead to ecosystem-wide changes. Between 2012 and 2020, the Mission-Aransas Estuary (MAE) experienced several significant climatic events: severe drought, flooding, and category 4 Hurricane Harvey, ultimately transitioning from a dry to wet climate regime. To assess changes in POM quantity and quality in response to these events, we quantified particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PN), natural stable isotope abundance (& delta;C-13, & delta;N-15), chlorophyll a, pheophytin, and pheophorbide, and total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAAs) from an 8-year (2012 to 2020) timeseries. Using a multivariate statistical approach, we constructed a degradation index to demonstrate that POM was more degraded during drought and less degraded during the wet period. Average POC, PN, and THAA concentrations increased 66%, 88%, and 88% during the wet period summers and with the degradation index demonstrate elevated proportions of high-quality, bioavailable POM seasonally, and over a climate regime shift. Low-inflow estuaries are useful examples of climate change impacts on systems increasingly stressed by freshwater inflow reduction. The quality shift of POM may play an important role in determining processing rate by bacteria or higher trophic levels, thus affecting ecosystem interactions and functions.

This site separated from the river by a narrow bank is composed of a network of channels and shallow lakes, a morphology shared by the floodplains of the lower Amazon. A multiparameter probe was used in situ to measure electrical conductivity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, turbidity, depth and a Secchi disk to estimate transparency. Water grab samples were analysed for suspended material, alkalinity, humic acid, phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon and chlorophyll. Sampling stations were distributed over the seven larger lakes in the floodplain and sampled at different periods of the hydrological cycle. The number of samples varied with the floodplain water level, with a minimum of 25 samples for each field visit. This data set is a collection of water quality data to assist in the limnological or biogeochemical studies of surface waters in Amazonian floodplain lakes, and the product of successive French-Brazilian projects: (1) the Clim-FABIAM 'Climate changes and Floodplain lake biodiversity in the Amazon Basin: how to cope and help the ecological and economic sustainability' funded by the French Foundation for biodiversity research (FRB), (2) the project Bloom-ALERT -'Environmental sensitivity and population health vulnerability to cyanobacteria in the Amazon: towards shared indicators' funded by the French-Brazilian research program GUYAMAZON 2014, and the project (3) 'Ecossistemas das varzeas e biodiversidade: Impactos das mudancas ambientais e climaticas considerando cenarios de desenvolvimento sustentaveis' (Project number 490634/2013-3) funded by the Brazilian National scientific Research Council CNPq.

Current land reclamation practices, however, lack a systematic approach to anticipate sea-level rise and do not account for local flood risk differences to inform location and design choices. To address these limitations, this paper applies two decision-support tools: a hazard threshold analysis, and a cost-benefit analysis. Both tools produce site-specific estimates of land elevations or flood defence heights but do so for different goals. The hazard threshold analysis identifies hazard-based solutions that meet an acceptable flood probability for an intended lifespan without follow-up actions by reliability optimisation. The cost-benefit analysis identifies risk-based solutions using dynamic programming. We apply both tools to two land reclamation sites, a newly reclaimed airport island and a land extension of an inhabited island, in the Maldives. We find that total hazard-based heights for long-term planning horizons are highly uncertain, with local height differences of up to 1.9 m across sea-level rise scenarios by 2100. Risk-based Island elevations, in contrast, differ much less across scenarios, offering a practical advantage for decision-making. However, land reclamation choices on location, land elevation and investment in flood protection are not only driven by hazard-related aspects, such as reef characteristics, swell exposure, and sea-level rise, but also by esti-mates of exposed assets, reclamation, and flood protection costs. Taken together, the two decision-support tools are helpful for improving adaptation decisions and are also applicable in other small island regions.

The implementation of these measures, however, strongly depends on the actors' perceptions of the specific problems occurring in such forests. For understanding the constraints of specific interest groups toward different adaptation activities, information in this field is essential. By conducting a questionnaire survey we explore how different types of forest managers, i.e., forestry professionals, forest owners, and conservation managers, perceive the effects of environmental change on forest management in the recently established Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Danube. We show that these forest managers are highly aware of ongoing environmental changes and appraise deteriorating forest conditions, especially after observing changes themselves. Abiotic damage is expected to increase the most, followed by biotic damage, the spread of non-native species, and tree dieback. Nearly 80% of the survey respondents expect further changes and almost all of them intend to adapt their management of forests to mitigate or prepare for these changes. Nevertheless, we show differences in sensitivity to change and willingness to initiate adaptation actions by assessing adaptation thresholds: conservation managers appear generally more tolerant to changes, which results in higher thresholds to initiate management adaptation than forestry professionals and forest owners. Respondents' selection of target tree species depends on management goals and therefore, we found further differences between forestry professionals and conservation managers. These aspects need to be carefully considered to foster cooperation or develop sustainable management frameworks and adaptation strategies.

They account for around 50% of bridge failures in the database constructed by the present authors. Hydraulic failures generally occur without early warning, with significantly destructive results. These kinds of failures are expected to continue in the future due to the increasing climate change all over the world. This paper is intended to have a comprehensive review of up-to-date work on hydraulic bridge failures due to three factors: scour, flood, and floe ices. First, we conduct a historical statistic analysis for bridge failures, especially focusing on the causes and features, based on around 1,700 cases collected over the past 200 years. Then, we review the failure modes and prediction methods for the hydraulic bridge failures due to scour, flood, and floe ices, respectively, and discuss some relevant examples and applications adopted in the current practices. The aim of this paper is to provide a concise but comprehensive summary of information needed by researchers and engineers to understand the mechanisms of the hydraulic failures of bridges and how current practices deal with these issues. Much work has been dedicated to determining what future research is required to furtherly understand the subject and find improved solutions to these existing problems. We hope that this review will provide a concise but comprehensive summary of information needed by researchers and engineers to understand the mechanisms of hydraulic failures of bridges and how the current practices deal with these issues.

Water sensitive urban design (WSUD) provides a variety of benefits in stormwater quantity management, ranging from stormwater harvesting to flood mitigation. Currently, however, developed areas lack any system that can improve the management of existing stormwater harvesting facilities to increase stormwater storage capacity without enlarging the stormwater drainage system. This study modelled a new method, Site Real-Time Adaptive Control (SRAC), that combined existing stormwater harvesting infrastructure at both regional and site levels with the existing stormwater drainage system (SWDS) through a cloud computing platform to increase stormwater storage capacity and reduce runoff water to the surface. The research found that: (1) the SRAC can manage runoff water dynamically and reduce flood inundation. The proposed impact factor Mt could help designers to measure the recovery capacity between two continuous rainfall events; (2) the SRAC model could postpone the peak flow in the trunk drainage system by 8-10 min; (3) the SRAC model could remove most of the excess water during very frequent rainfall events, decreasing over 98 % excess flow in design events 1h1EY (14,650 m3) and 2h1EY (11,272 m3); (4) the SRAC model showed a 36-50 % reduction in total outfall volume in the 1 h rainfall events, a 42-50 % reduction in the 2 h rainfall events; (5) the SRAC model could increase the capacity of downstream water treatment plants and save 43 % of the stormwater trunk drainage demand.

Therefore, it is imperative to physically replicate such conditions in the actual stress state to understand the performance of these geotechnical structures. Hence, the objective of this paper is to present the performance of an in-flight simulator developed to simulate flooding and drawdown (ISFD) events at enhanced gravities. The working principle, design details, various components of the developed simulator, and calibration at normal (1g) and high gravities are discussed. In the present study, the calibration and performance of the ISFD setup were demonstrated on a model levee section in a 4.5 m radius large beam geotechnical centrifuge facility available at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India. The rate of flooding and drawdown varied from 2.2 m/day to 7 m/day and 1.65 m/day to 4.4 m/day (in prototype dimensions), respectively, obtained with the help of pore-water pressure transducers placed on the upstream and downstream sides of the levee section. A total of three centrifuge model tests were conducted on a scaled-down levee section (with and without internal drainage layers) constructed with silty sand type material to validate the ISFD capabilities. In addition, seepage and slope stability analysis for the centrifuge models was carried out using Plaxis-2D geotechnical software which compared favourably with physically observed tests results.

Classification Analysis of Southwest Pacific Tropical Cyclone Intensity Changes Prior to Landfall	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						tropical cyclone forecasting; landfalling intensity; machine learning classification; random forest classifier; Southwest Pacific Ocean	PART I; CROSS-VALIDATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; OCEAN; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; SIMULATIONS; TERRAIN; LAYER	This study evaluates the ability of a random forest classifier to identify tropical cyclone (TC) intensification or weakening prior to landfall over the western region of the Southwest Pacific Ocean (SWPO) basin. For both Australia mainland and SWPO island cases, when a TC first crosses land after spending >= 24 h over the ocean, the closest hour prior to the intersection is considered as the landfall hour. If the maximum wind speed (V-max) at the landfall hour increased or remained the same from the 24-h mark prior to landfall, the TC is labeled as intensifying and if the V-max at the landfall hour decreases, the TC is labeled as weakening. Geophysical and aerosol variables closest to the 24 h before landfall hour were collected for each sample. The random forest model with leave-one-out cross validation and the random oversampling example technique was identified as the best-performing classifier for both mainland and island cases. The model identified longitude, initial intensity, and sea skin temperature as the most important variables for the mainland and island landfall classification decisions. Incorrectly classified cases from the test data were analyzed by sorting the cases by their initial intensity hour, landfall hour, monthly distribution, and 24-h intensity changes. TC intensity changes near land strongly impact coastal preparations such as wind damage and flood damage mitigations; hence, this study will contribute to improve identifying and prioritizing prediction of important variables contributing to TC intensity change before landfall.

Because of the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of environmental flows, it is more appropriate to study the economic value produced by environmental flows using a temporal-spatial scale rather than static calculations. In the present study, we combine the major influencing factors to establish the temporal-spatial calculation methods of the economic value produced by environmental flows using the assessment techniques of resources and environmental economics. The results obtained for the Wei River show that the annual variation range of the total economic value is CNY 0.30-0.42 billion, and the unit economic value is 0.86-6.40 CNY/m(3) during the non-flood season ranging from the years 1980 to 2017. In general, the monthly variation in the total economic value ranges from CNY 0.04 to 0.08 billion, and the unit economic value is 0.94-14.34 CNY/m(3). Based on this result, the variation tendency of the total economic value is consistent with the changing trend of the environmental flows occurring in the river; however, the unit economic value presents a reverse pattern. Furthermore, the deficiency of environmental flows can lead to a significant increase in its unit economic value. This method presents a dynamic, small temporal-spatial scale assessment of the economic value produced by environmental flows. It can also provide theoretical support for the ecological compensation of environmental flow protection in rivers present in water shortage areas.

Distribution and breeding numbers of a recently split species, the West African Crested Tern <i>Thalasseus albididorsalis</i>	OSTRICH			English	Article						breeding habitat; conservation threats; population estimate; seabird monitoring; Thalasseus maximus albididorsalis		This study investigated the distribution, numbers and conservation threats of the West African Crested Tern, which was recently elevated to full species after it was split from the Royal Tern with an American and African subspecies. In the period 1998-2019, a total of 13 West African coastal islands were identified as breeding localities, stretching from Mauritania to Guinea. All the islands are isolated, usually sandy and subject to erosion. There was great yearly variation in the numbers of breeding pairs within and between sites. A complete census of all breeding locations in 2015 and 2019 resulted in estimates of 79 000 and 77 000 pairs, respectively. The threats identified are predation, human disturbance, nest flooding and loss of breeding habitat as a result of coastal erosion. Predation of eggs and chicks by Sacred Ibises and especially Great White Pelicans may heavily impact on the species' breeding output. Human disturbance is slight because most of the breeding islands are within protected areas. Flooding of nests has increasingly been observed in recent years, occurring at nine of 11 islands occupied by the terns in 2015. Most islands are subject to erosion, which has resulted in substantial loss of suitable breeding habitat over the 22-year study period. Two important islands have become completely unsuitable. We conclude that West African Crested Terns have an uncertain future. Food shortage resulting from industrial fishing is suspected, and the effects of climate change might negatively impact on habitat suitability and food availability. Monitoring of the total population at three-year intervals is recommended.

Studies on the spatiotemporal distribution of EP variability and its teleconnection with meteoro-logical factors are extremely important but lacking in the Taihu Lake basin (TLB). Based on the daily precipi-tation data from 50 hydrological stations in the TLB from 1965 to 2018, we introduced a new circular distribution method to statistically delineate the different flood seasons and assess the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and future persistence of extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) at different time scales. In addition, geodetector was used to quantify the effects of interactions between meteorological factors on the EPIs changes. The results showed that the EP in the TLB tended to increase significantly (P < 0.05) over the past 54 years, with faster growth in the urban cluster in the northeastern part of the basin. The increase in intensity and maximum precipitation amount was dominant during the plum rain period (PRP), whereas the increase in the number of days of precipitation was dominant during the typhoon period (TP). The scaling exponents reveal that the increasing of EP had long-range correlation at different time scales. Furthermore, the influence of climate factors on EP was nonlinear, and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) intensity were the climate factor that played a major role in the variability of the EPIs. The results of this study provide a reference for TLB and other monsoon coastal areas worldwide to cope with extreme climate and develop corresponding strategies.

It was developed in response to a recognised need by the EA's National Environmental Assessment and Sustainability (NEAS) team for a broad-based survey undertaken in the field to get to know the site and prior to more specialist surveys. The key aim of the survey is to capture in a systematic and consistent way the character and condition of a place where river-related projects such as flood risk management and river restoration schemes are proposed to inform discussions around the design and planning of a project and provide the baseline for future place-based monitoring. The tool comprises: a Study Area Survey and one or more River Surveys, which provide measurements to generate metrics and information to support assessments of Habitat and Biodiversity, Landscape, Amenity, and Heritage. Data are stored, analysed, retrieved, shared, and displayed through a web-based information system. It is intended that a PlaceMarker Survey will be conducted on at least three occasions in the lifetime of a project or asset: pre-inception of a project to understand the broad environmental baseline and assist in the design of a scheme; immediately post-project to confirm the "as-built condition"; and post-recovery from the works to monitor the environmental response to interventions at the site. Tracking the assessments over time informs evaluations of environmental enhancements and supports decision-making around adaptive management.

The economic valuation of potential changes in coastal wetland areas, while challenging, allows for a comparison with other types of economic impacts from climate change and enhances our understanding of the potential benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. In this study, we estimate an ensemble of future changes in coastal wetland areas considering both sea level rise, future greenhouse gas emissions, and accretion rate uncertainty, using outputs from the National Ocean and Atmospheric (NOAA) marsh migration model. By the end of the century, total wetland losses range from 2.0 to 10.7 million acres across sea level rise scenarios. For Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, cummulative net wetland area loss is 1.8 and 2.4 million acres by 2050 and 3.5 and 5.2 million acres by 2100. We then estimate economic impacts with two distinct approaches: restoration cost and ecosystem services. The ecosystem services considered are limited by what can be reliably quantified-namely, coastal property protection from coastal flooding and carbon sequestration, the latter using a social cost of carbon approach. By the end of the century, annual restoration costs reach $1.5 and $3.1 billion for RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The lost ecosystem services, together, reach annual economic impacts that are much higher, reaching $2.5 billion for RCP4.5 and $6.1 billion for RCP8.5.

Whether vegetation exhibits threshold responses to gradual changes in hydrology is an important but unresolved question. Here, we examined this question by providing the first remote sensing-based investigation of decadal-scale vegetation changes along hydrological gradients over early-period wetland development. We focused on wetlands on three estuarine fluvial islands, where sedimentation was driving wetlands to transition from an initially mudflat state to a vegetated marsh state (dominated by Suaeda salsa). Our results showed that Suaeda marshes decreased in a nonlinear, threshold manner with increasing flooding frequency, a pattern consistently observed in periods when plants were still acquiring their hydrological niches. Further, although the breadth of Suaeda's hydrological niche (i.e., the range of flooding frequencies with Suaeda presence) expanded linearly or nonlinearly on all three islands, changes in niche position (i.e., lower and upper limits) differed. Both lower and upper limits of their hydrological niche expanded on sheltered islands in the inner part of the estuary, while their upper limits expanded and lower limits retreated on more exposed, outer islands. Our findings provide unique evidence that nonlinear, threshold hydrological controls of vegetation may be pervasive even in early stages of wetland development, although the underlying mechanisms may be specific and depend on other factors (e.g., wave exposure). Incorporating these threshold behaviors are key to predicting and managing transitions between vegetated and unvegetated states of ecosystems in an anthropogenic hydrosphere.

The performance of land drainage systems is thus critical for achieving sustainable agricultural production Recently, many types of software have been developed in this field for modeling and simulating the performance of these systems. SISDRENA is a simulation model of the performance of underground drainage systems. The main objectives of this paper are to simulate different combination of depths and spaces between drains and to analyze their impact on potential sugarcane productivity in the western plains of Venezuela using a land drainage system model. Therefore, three climatic scenarios were defined by annual precipitation: dry years (25% below average), normal (mean) and humid (75% above average). The scenarios were implemented in three different soil types: sandy loam, loam and silt loam, with a hydraulic conductivity of 0.19, 0.26 and 0.04 m day(-1), respectively. The simulation of the yield related to soil deficit (YRD) and water stress (YRW) indicated that the highest yields were reached for the larger spacing between drains and the high conductivity hydraulic of soils. In relation to the average relative productivity (YT), it was shown that in soils with a greater water retention capacity there is an inversely proportional relationship between the spacing between drains and the productivity. We concluded that in order to reach the maximum sugarcane yield, the effect of hydraulic conductivity is more important than the changes in the precipitation pattern.

Factors threatening freshwater biodiversity are much wider and more complex, including climate change and severe weather events such as drought, unexpected floods, heavy storms, etc. Drought is an important factor contributing to this crisis. In this study, we evaluated changes in the immune function, antioxidant function, histopathology, and metabolites of crayfish in response to drought. The results indicate that drought suppresses immune function, the balance between oxidative and antioxidative systems, and induces tissue damage and metabolic disorder. Our work provides more information on how crayfish respond to drought. Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened ecosystems on Earth. The freshwater biodiversity crisis has caused widespread global concern. Drought as one of the factors causing freshwater biodiversity is still poorly understood. Crayfish is often used in academic research as a biological indicator. In this study, flow cytometry, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and untargeted metabolomics were used to analyze the immune function, histopathology, and metabolism of crayfish under drought conditions. After drought exposure, the total hemocytes count (THC) was significantly decreased (from 8.9 x 10(5) mL(-1) in the control group to 2.2 x 10(5) mL(-1) at day 5). Phagocytosis decreased by 66% after 5 days of drought. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hepatopancreas was upregulated. Moreover, histological disorder and metabolism changes in the hepatopancreas were obvious. These results indicate that drought suppresses immune function, disrupts the balance of oxidative and antioxidative systems, and induces tissue damage and metabolic changes in crayfish.

We performed a systematic survey of glacial lakes in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin using the Google Earth Engine platform. This allowed us to map the distribution and monitor the evolution of glacial lakes over seven time periods from 1990 to 2020, using more than 140 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager images at a 30-m resolution. The results show that there were 2088 glacial lakes in 2020, with a total area of 245.87 km(2), mainly distributed at elevations of 3,800-5,800 m above sea level. From 1990 to 2020, the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin glacial lakes expanded by approximately 1.81 km(2)center dot a(-1). A total of 153 glacial lakes in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin were assessed. The assessment shows that 153 glacial lakes were divided into very high, high, medium, low, and very low level. The number of glacial lakes in each level is 23, 22, 32, 32, and 44, respectively. The very high and high level glacial lakes were mainly found in the Yi'ong Zangbo River Basin, Parlung Zangbo River Basin, the western of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin and Nianchu River Basin. These glacial lakes deserve further attention and monitoring.

Coastal planners need relatively accurate projections of the rate of sea-level rise and its possible consequences, such as extreme sea-level changes, flooding, and coastal erosion. The east coast of Peninsular Malaysia is vulnerable to sea-level change. The purpose of this study is to present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to analyse sea-level change based on observed data of tide gauge, rainfall, sea level pressure, sea surface temperature, and wind. A Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) approach was used on observed data from 1991 to 2012 to simulate and predict the sea level change until 2020 from five tide gauge stations in Kuala Terengganu along the East Coast of Malaysia. From 1991 to 2020, predictions estimate that sea level would increase at a pace of roughly 4.60 mm/year on average, with a rate of 2.05 +/- 7.16 mm on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. This study shows that Peninsular Malaysia's East Coast is vulnerable to sea-level rise, particularly at Kula Terengganu, Terengganu state, with a rate of 1.38 +/- 7.59 mm/year, and Tanjung Gelang, Pahang state, with a rate of 1.87 +/- 7.33 mm/year. As a result, strategies and planning for long-term adaptation are needed to control potential consequences. Our research provides crucial information for decision-makers seeking to protect coastal cities from the risks of rising sea levels.

Nevertheless, such models are computationally expensive (requiring many hours), which prevents their use for forecasting and warning. In addition, there is a gap between the model outputs and information actually needed by decision makers. The present work aims to develop and test a method capable of forecasting coastal flood information adapted to users' needs. The method must be robust and fast and must integrate the complexity of coastal flood processes. The explored solution relies on metamodels, i.e., mathematical functions that precisely and efficiently (within minutes) estimate the results that would provide the numerical model. While the principle of relying on metamodel solutions is not new, the originality of the present work is to tackle and validate the entire process from the identification of user needs to the establishment and validation of the rapid forecast and early warning system (FEWS) while relying on numerical modelling, metamodelling, the development of indicators, and information technologies. The development and validation are performed at the study site of Gavres (France). This site is subject to wave overtopping, so the numerical phase-resolving SWASH model is used to build the learning dataset required for the metamodel setup. Gaussian process- and random forest classifier-based metamodels are used and post-processed to estimate 14 indicators of interest for FEWS users. These metamodelling and post-processing schemes are implemented in an FEWS prototype, which is employed by local users and exhibits good warning skills during the validation period. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for the improvement and/or application of this methodology and individual steps to other sites.

Simultaneously, cities face severe exposure to environmental hazards such as floods and heatwaves posing threats to millions of urban households. Consequently, fostering urban households' resilience is imperative, yet often impeded by the lack of its accurate assessment. We developed a structural equation model to quantify households' resilience, considering their assets, housing, and health properties. Based on a household survey (n = 1872), we calculate the resilience of households in Pune, India with and without migration biography and compare different sub-groups. We further analyze how households are exposed to and affected by floods and heatwaves. Our results show that not migration as such but the type of migration, particularly, the residence zone at the migration destination (formal urban or slum) and migration origin (urban or rural) provide insights into households' resilience and affectedness by extreme weather events. While on average, migrants in our study have higher resilience than non-migrants, the sub-group of rural migrants living in slums score significantly lower than the respective non-migrant cohort. Further characteristics of the migration biography such as migration distance, time since arrival at the destination, and the reasons for migration contribute to households' resilience. Consequently, the opposing generalized notions in literature of migrants either as the least resilient group or as high performers, need to be overcome as our study shows that within one city, migrants are found both at the top and the bottom of the resilience range. Thus, we recommend that policymakers include migrants' biographies when assessing their resilience and when designing resilience improvement interventions to help the least resilient migrant groups more effectively.

In this paper, we demonstrate that grazing started at our study site, Kom El-Khilgan in the NE Nile Delta, ca. 7000 years ago, which was several hundred years prior to crop farming. We examined pollen-spores and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) in a 1-m-deep sediment profile (KH-1) in the study site, defined archaeologically as the Pre-Dynastic (>5.9 ka) in age. Our results show that before ca. 7.0 ka, major floods prevailed in the Nile Delta, as highly-concentrated Podocarpus and Polypodiaceae were transported from the East African highlands and Cyperaceae of higher Nile flow indication. This humid phase was succeeded by a brief period of drying climate ca. 7.0-6.6 ka, allowing the entry of the first settlers who commenced grazing their animals on previously inundated wetlands. This change is indicated by the remarkable increase in fungal spores (Cercophora, Sordaria, Coniochaeta cf. Ligniaria) from accumulations of animal dung. At ca. 6.6 ka, the abrupt appearance of domesticated cereal pollen (Poaceae >35 mu m) and cereal grass pathogens (Pericornia and Sorosporium) suggests an amelioration of the climate that allowed the introduction of cereal crops and related water management activities. Grazing and cropping co-existed for the remainder of the record during the time when there occurred a mega-tendency of climate drying towards recent time. A drought event recognized ca. 4.2 ka led to the collapse of the Old Kingdom.

J	Espinoza, MI				Espinoza, Maria I.			Conflicting diagnostic and prognostic framing of epidemics? Newspaper representations of dengue as a public health problem in Peru	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Dengue; Disease; Outbreak; Epidemic; Discourse; Frame; Medicalization; Media	MEDIA COVERAGE; AEDES-AEGYPTI; CLIMATE; DISEASE; SARS	The way newspapers frame infectious disease outbreaks and their connection to the environmental determinants of disease transmission matter because they shape how we understand and respond to these major events. In 2017, following an unexpected climatic event named "El Nino Costero," a dengue epidemic in Peru affected over seventy-five thousand people. This paper examines how the Peruvian news media presented dengue, a climate-sensitive disease, as a public health problem by analyzing a sample of 265 news stories on dengue from two major newspapers published between January 1st and December 31st of 2017. In analyzing the construction of responsibility for the epidemic, I find frames that blamed El Nino Costero's flooding and Peru's poorly prepared cities and public health infrastructure as the causes of the dengue outbreak. However, when analyzing frames that offer solutions to the epidemic, I find that news articles call for government-led, short-term interventions (e. g., fogging) that fail to address the decaying public health infrastructure and lack of climate-resilient health systems. Overall, news media tended to over-emphasize dengue as requiring technical solutions that ignore the root causes of health inequality and environmental injustice that allow dengue to spread in the first place. This case speaks to the medicalization of public health and to a long history of disease-control programs in the Global South that prioritized top-down technical approaches, turning attention away from the social and environmental determinants of health, which are particularly important in an era of climate change.

Only 8% of the stations showed a significant increase in annual rainfall, and there was no significant negative trend at any weather stations at a confidence level of 90%. Monthly rainfall showed the most significant decreasing and increasing trends in April and November, respectively. During the entire flooding season from April to September, the monthly rainfall at the weather stations in the coastal areas showed almost no significant change. The annual rainfall gradually decreased toward the inland area with the central and coastal areas of Guangdong Province as the high-value rainfall center. By using the empirical orthogonal function decomposition method, it was found that the two main monthly rainfall modes had strong annual signals. The first modal spatial distribution was basically consistent with the average annual rainfall distribution. Based on the environmental background analysis, it was found that during the flooding season the main water vapor to SC was transported by the East Asian summer monsoon and the Indian summer monsoon. In late autumn and winter, the prevailing wind from northeastern China could not bring much water vapor to SC and led to little precipitation in these two seasons. The spatial distribution of precipitation in SC during summer was more consistent with the moisture flux divergence distribution of the bottom layer from 925 to 1000 hPa rather than that of the layer from 700 to 1000 hPa.

This study applied a multiple linear regression (MLR) modelling framework to investigate spatial variations and relative importance of hydroclimatic drivers of annual maximum flows (AMF) and mean spring flows (MAMJflow) in 25 river basins across western Canada. The results show that basin average maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax), April 1st SWE and spring precipitation (MAMJprc) are the most important predictors of both AMF and MAMJflow, with the proportion of explained variance averaging 51.7%, 44.0% and 33.5%, respectively. The MLR models' abilities to project future changes in AMF and MAMJflow in response to changes to the hydroclimatic controls are also examined using the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) output for RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The results show considerable spatial variations depending on individual watershed characteristics with projected changes in AMF ranging from -69% to +126% and those of MAMJflow ranging from -48% to +81% by the end of this century. In general, the study demonstrates that the MLR framework is a useful approach for assessing the spatial variation in hydroclimatic controls of annual maximum and mean spring flows in the western Canadian river basins. However, there is a need to exercise caution in applying MLR models for projecting changes in future flows, especially for regulated basins.

To investigate the effects of expected warmer climate under climate change, and also to fill the data gaps in the south margin of the Eurasian permafrost, the seasonal runoff and the associated dissolved carbon fluxes in a pair of catchments in the Great Khingan Mountains of northeast China were investigated in 2018-2019. Two similar small catchments, a south-facing (SF) and a north-facing (NF), were used to check the effects of warmer climate on the dynamics of runoff and dissolved carbon yields. The SF catchment, with a warmer condition compared to the NF catchment, presented much larger snowmelt runoff during spring and more gentle rainfall flood peaks in the summer-autumn period, but similar concentrations of dissolved carbons during both the periods. As a result, the dissolved carbon fluxes were greatly elevated during the snowmelt period. However, the runoff and carbon yield in the two catchments showed no significant difference during the summer rainfall periods, in spite of a much deeper active layer of permafrost in the SF. As indicated by two fluorescence indices, the humification (HIX) and biological index (BIX), the chemical characteristics of dissolved carbon were similar in both the snowmelt and rainfall runoff periods in the two catchments. These results emphasize that warmer climate would largely alter the seasonal runoff patterns and promote dissolved carbon export in the snowmelt period, which would lead to more unexpected ecological impacts on the aquatic systems in the south Eurasian permafrost.

In this study, the aim was to identify the areas susceptible to floods using and comparing two different approaches, namely the multi-criteria decision analysis-analytical hierarchy process (MCDA-AHP) and the machine learning-boosted classification (BCT) and boosted regression (BRT) tree. The study area was represented by the Topa river basin, Slovakia. Altogether, seven relevant flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, river network density, distance from river, flow accumulation, curve numbers and lithology as well as flood inventory database consisting of 107 flood locations were used. Based on the results, almost 40% of the study area is characterized by high to very high flood susceptibility using the MCDA-AHP. In case of the BCT and BRT models, the share of high and very high flood susceptibility class on the basin area is 45% and 38%, respectively. Validation of the performed flood susceptibility models confirmed generally higher accuracy of the machine learning models. The accuracy of the MCDA-AHP model was 81.33% while the accuracy of the boosted tree models was 87.70% and 91.42%, respectively, for classification and regression. The results of this study can enhance more effective preliminary flood risk assessment according to the EU Floods Directive.

This study used the Yangtze River Delta as the research object, established the flood disaster risk analysis model, calculated the indicator weights using the entropy weight method, and used three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods to compare and analyze the flood disaster risk in four administrative units of Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai City, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, and Anhui Province). Based on the weight estimation results, vegetation coverage was the priority in all evaluation criteria, followed by the proportion of the illiterate population aged 15 and over, drainage density, proportion of crop sown area, and building density. The ranking results show that the flood disaster risk is highest in Jiangsu, followed by Anhui. Shanghai and Zhejiang ranked third and fourth, respectively. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the indicator weights was conducted considering that the ranking results mainly depend on the criteria weight. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the main factors influencing the flood disaster risk level in the Yangtze River Delta are agricultural factors, followed by population density, drainage density, and the number of medical and health institutions. Also, in terms of meteorological and geographical conditions, exposure, vulnerability, and disaster loss, Jiangsu has the highest flood disaster risk, while Anhui has the highest flood disaster risk in terms of emergency and recovery capabilities. The findings can provide useful information on disaster prevention and mitigation managers.

In this study, a flood risk map was produced for Kermanshah city (Iran) by combining flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. Based on effective factors of urban flooding, flood hazard maps were generated using two machine learning models: Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP). These models were developed on 117 flood sites which were identified on the reports and field surveys for Kermanshah city, and 163 non-flooded points. Economic, social, and infrastructure criteria were considered to analyze flood vulnerability. The sub-criteria were defined based on social and cultural structure in developing countries and urban infrastructure facilities involved in the floods. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process method (FAHP) was applied to determine the overall weight vector. The results demonstrated that the MaxEnt model had a better performance than the GARP model based on two common indices which are the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC = 96.76-98.32%) and kappa statistic (Kappa = 0.82-0.86). These findings showed that machine learning models provide reliable results for areas where data access is challenging, especially in developing countries. The results also indicated that infrastructure criterion has the highest impact weight on the vulnerability. In general, population, urban texture, and distance to the major drainage channels are the most important factors in increasing flood risk. Also, the vulnerability of an urban neighborhood greatly increases the risk of flooding.

J	Shrestha, BB; Kawasaki, A				Shrestha, Badri Bhakta; Kawasaki, Akiyuki			Quantitative assessment of flood risk with evaluation of the effectiveness of dam operation for flood control: A case of the Bago River Basin of Myanmar	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Quantitative risk assessment; Household damage; Rice-crop damage; Flood control measures; Myanmar	INUNDATION RRI MODEL; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ESTABLISHMENT; AGRICULTURE; IMPACTS	Because property damage and loss of life owing to floods have increased in many countries in recent years, accurate assessment of flood risk is urgently needed for effective flood management. Improving the assessment of flood risk requires considering the impact of dam operation for flood control because dams and reservoirs play important roles in the assessment of flood hazards and associated damage. However, the impact of dam operation on flood hazards and associated damage was not considered well in previous assessments of flood risk. This paper focused on the quantitative assessment of flood hazard and risk, including the effectiveness of dam operation for flood prevention. The grid-based approach integrating the following was applied for analysis: (i) a hydrological-hydraulic model, (ii) a method considering the dam operation for flood control, and (iii) an assessment of flood damage. To assess the risk, flood characteristics were computed using the rainfall-runoff-inundation hydrological-hydraulic model, and flood damage was estimated by integrating the flood characteristics, flood damage curves, exposure characteristics, and property values. The risk was assessed by focusing on flood damage to residential buildings and assets and agricultural sectors for the largest recent floods and flood events with different return periods. This study considered the Bago River Basin of Myanmar. Results show that the dam operation for flood control in the study area reduces the flood inundation area by approximately 10% and flood damage to buildings, assets, and agriculture by approximately 40%, 60%, and 10%, respectively.

Blue-green roofs are constructed as a means to reduce the runoff of stormwater from roofs and reduce the risk of urban flooding. However, compared to conventional roofs, blue-green roofs represent different construction and operation conditions, which may affect the long-term integrity of the roof. The purpose of this research is to understand the variety of perspectives on how different actors perceive and manage quality risks related to blue-green roofs-that is, the probabilities and consequences of defects. The quality risks of blue-green roofs have been investigated through document studies and interviews with actors in the Norwegian building sector. Data have been collected from actors across the building sector to map differences in how risk is managed from several perspectives. The findings show that actors view quality risk in very different ways. While building owners are primarily concerned with the quality of the finished product, the primary concern of other involved actors may be to ensure that eventual defects cannot be attributed to their own activities. The efforts of the various actors to reduce the risks in their own activities may not necessarily reduce the risk of defects in roofs. To ensure a more comprehensive management of quality risk in blue-green roofs, it is necessary to consider the perspectives and incentives of all involved actors. This way, a framework could be developed as a feasible tool in blue-green roof projects.

The Municipality of Obrenovac suffered severe consequences due to a number of reasons, mainly the poor conditions of flood protection infrastructure and outdated land use management. These problems have been triggered and/or affected by the post-socialist transition of Serbia, initiated during the 1990s. The ongoing period of socio-economic turbulences, also detected in other countries with a similar development background, caused a shift in both the planning paradigm and the economy (from a planned/centralized model to a market-oriented model), creating numerous problems related to the synchronization of legislation, governance, implementation and management. Considering the specificities of local context, as well as its similarities to other post-socialist countries, the main aims of the article are to establish a relationship between planning, legislation and flood resilience, identify its (un)sustainable elements and provide an insight into the dynamic of their causal links whose effectiveness could be improved in given conditions. The main findings indicate an absence of a sustainable policy which would guarantee efficient implementation (regarding both planning documents and laws). Simultaneously, there were other challenges-from the lack of risk assessment to outdated regulations and general unpreparedness which led to severe damage of urban systems and local economy, while many lives were lost. Consequently, the article provides guidelines for new planning documents, suggesting measures that would increase the resilience of flood protection (applicable in both local and regional context), as well as the overall sustainability of the analyzed area and its ecosystem.

Increases in soil and woody biomass carbon stocks as a result of rangeland riparian restoration	CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						California; Carbon storage; Floodplain; Grazing; Mediterranean; Riparian buffer; Restoration; Soil organic matter; Salix; Sequestration	ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; ORGANIC-MATTER; VEGETATION; BUFFER; AFFORESTATION; AUSTRALIA; PATTERNS; PASTURES; NITROGEN; REMOVAL	Background Globally, vegetation in riparian zones is frequently the target of restoration efforts because of its importance in reducing the input of eroded sediment and agricultural nutrient runoff to surface waters. Here we examine the potential of riparian zone restoration to enhance carbon sequestration. We measured soil and woody biomass carbon stocks, as well as soil carbon properties, in a long-term chronosequence of 42 streambank revegetation projects in northern California rangelands, varying in restoration age from 1 to 45 years old. Results Where revegetation was successful, we found that soil carbon measured to 50 cm depth increased at a rate of 0.87 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)on the floodplain and 1.12 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)on the upper bank landform. Restored sites also exhibited trends toward increased soil carbon permanence, including an increased C:N ratio and lower fulvic acid: humic acid ratio. Tree and shrub carbon in restored sites was modeled to achieve a 50-year maximum of 187.5 Mg C ha(-1)in the channel, 279.3 Mg ha(-1)in the floodplain, and 238.66 Mg ha(-1)on the upper bank. After 20 years of restoration, the value of this carbon at current per-ton C prices would amount to $US 15,000 per km of restored stream. Conclusion We conclude that revegetating rangeland streambanks for erosion control has a substantial additional benefit of mitigating global climate change, and should be considered in carbon accounting and any associated financial compensation mechanisms.

For future urban planning, there is a particular knowledge gap regarding the factors that affect surface runoff to improve urban resilience to local flooding. This study explored the impacts of different urban dynamics on surface water runoff considering the surface cover characteristics of different residential types (i.e., low- and high-density settlements) in the city of Munich, Germany. The surface cover characteristics were quantified using the 'i-Tree Canopy' method based on high-resolution aerial images. The surface runoff was simulated by the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. Meanwhile, the impacts of different urban dynamics on surface runoff were compared by incorporating a scenario-based urban dynamic modeling approach. The results suggest that, compared with low-density settlements, high-density settlement areas tend to generate more surface runoff within the neighborhood because they have considerably less vegetative surfaces and more built ones. As the development of low-density settlements leads to a greater loss of green and open spaces in the surrounding peri-urban areas, however, the compact growth scenarios characterized by high-density settlements have advantages over low-density scenarios in terms of overall surface runoff reduction at the city scale. Thus, the trade-off between the neighborhood and city scale should be considered when promoting nature-based solutions for surface runoff mitigation. Moreover, the approach presented here can be used as an effective planning tool supporting various urban contexts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two studies have estimated the fatality toll of this disaster using a traditional surveillance approach. However, traditional surveillance can miss disaster-related deaths, including a substantial number of deaths from natural causes triggered by disaster exposure. Here, we investigated community-wide mortality risk during this flood compared with rates in unexposed reference periods. Methods: We compared community-wide mortality rates on the peak flood day and the four following days to seasonally matched nonflood days in previous years (2008-2011), controlling for potential confounders, to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of daily mortality among Beijing residents associated with this flood. Results: On 21 July 2012, the flood-associated RRs were 1.34 (95% confidence interval = 1.11, 1.61) for all-cause, 1.37 (1.01, 1.85) for circulatory, and 4.40 (2.98, 6.51) for accidental mortality, compared with unexposed periods. We observed no evidence of increased risk of respiratory mortality. For the flood period of 21-22 July 2012, we estimated a total of 79 excess deaths among Beijing residents; by contrast, only 34 deaths were reported among Beijing residents in a study using a traditional surveillance approach. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing community-wide changes in mortality rates during the 2012 flood in Beijing and one of the first to do so for any major flood worldwide. This study offers critical evidence on flood-related health impacts, as urban flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe in China.

We applied the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate and examine the meteorological dynamics, which resulted in the extreme rainfall and floods that caused 14 deaths, 34076 people being displaced with damaged properties, and economic loss estimated at $168,289 for the two cities according to the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO). The slow-moving thunderstorms lasted for about 8 hours due to the weak African Easterly Wave (AEW) and Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ). Results from the analysis showed that surface pressures were low with significant amount of moisture influx aiding the thunderstorms intensification, which produced 90.1 mm and 114.6 mm of rainfall over Accra and Kumasi, respectively. We compared the rainfall amount from this event to the historical rainfall data to investigate possible changes in rainfall intensities over time. A time series of annual daily maximum rainfall (ADMR) showed an increasing trend with a slope of 0.45 over Accra and a decreasing trend and a slope of -0.07 over Kumasi. The 95th percentile frequencies of extreme rainfall with thresholds of 45.10 mm and 42.16 mm were analyzed for Accra and Kumasi, respectively, based on the normal distribution of rainfall. Accra showed fewer days with more heavy rainfall, while Kumasi showed more days with less heavy rainfalls.	[Ansah, S. O.; Ahiataku, M. A.; Yorke, C.

The design of adequate adaptation and mitigation measures requires specific data at different scales of the water management hierarchy, up to basin level. In this work, the irrigation and drainage system of San Pedro de Castelflorite Irrigation Community (Huesca province, NE Spain), first set up as a flood irrigation system around 1970 and then modernized to sprinkler irrigation around 2008, was studied over two irrigation seasons. The land in this basin, with a surface of 11,450 ha, is affected by severe sodicity problems, which impedes cultivation in large areas. Most of the drainage water discharges into Clamor Vieja ravine, in which the quantity and quality of drainage, using water, salt, and nitrogen balances, were monitored. The water regime was found to be essentially regulated by irrigation. From the water balance, the consumed and the recoverable fractions were estimated at 76% and 23%, respectively, and the depleted beneficial fraction for the irrigated area at 73%. A predominance of salt dissolution processes over precipitation processes was found, with salt exports of approximately 2000 kg ha(-1)Syear(-1). The nitrogen exported by the drainage water was 7 kg Nha(-1)year(-1). This value, remarkably lower than those reported for nearby basins in the central Ebro valley, can be attributed to the flooding of rice fields and to the low permeability of the soils present in this basin, which would hamper nitrate washing through the soil profile.

Flood control for small and medium-scale rivers in highly urbanized areas is particularly important. The purpose of this study is to explore the most effective flood control strategy for small and medium-scale rivers in highly urbanized areas. MIKE 11 and MIKE 21 were coupled with MIKE FLOOD model to simulate flooding with the flood control standard, after which the best flooding control scheme was determined from a whole region perspective (both the mainstream and tributary conditions were considered). The SheGong River basin located near the Guangzhou Baiyun international airport in Guangzhou city over south China was selected for the case study. The results showed that the flooding area in the basin of interest accounts for 42% of the total, with maximum inundation depth up to 0.93 m under the 20-year return period of the designed flood. The flood-prone areas are the midstream and downstream where urbanization is high; however the downstream of the adjacent TieShan River is still able to bear more flooding. Therefore, the probable cost-effective flood control scheme is to construct two new tributaries transferring floodwater in the mid- and downstream of the SheGong River into the downstream of the TieShan River. This infers that flood control for small and medium-scale rivers in highly urbanized areas should not simply consider tributary flood regimes but, rather, involve both tributary and mainstream flood characters from a whole region perspective.

Knowledge of how differences in post-thaw hydrological conditions affect carbon (C) release is critical for predicting permafrost feedback, but this knowledge remains limited. In this study, permafrost and active layer soils from the southern margin of the Eurasian boreal permafrost region in Northeast China were collected and incubated under experimentally modified moisture to monitor their CO2 and CH4 productions under simulated natural, drier and flooded conditions. We also characterized soil properties related to soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and microbial activities to determine their relations with measured C productions. We found that permafrost had higher C release per gram of SOC basis (C vulnerability) than the active layer, which suggested that there would be a high risk for C emissions in the permafrost region when permafrost thaws in the warming future. However, hydrological conditions following the permafrost thaw control these emissions. Permafrost C decomposed in relatively aerobic upland systems had higher C emissions than that decomposed in anaerobic wetland environments. Our results suggest a greater climate forcing of C release in aerobic than anaerobic conditions, but there are some uncertainties resulting from the unknown long-term CH4 production rates. Moreover, we found that the aerobic C production in permafrost after thawing could be constrained by water stress, suggesting that previous predictions based on soil incubations at natural soil moisture might overestimate the aerobic permafrost C release.

This article shows how the riverscapes of the Rh?ne in France have changed under the influence of different power relations. We use newspapers to highlight the potential of news outlets as a data source with which to apply Foucault?s critical and genealogical methods and to develop a political ecology of socioecological fixes. Media coverage is proxied by a content analysis and textual data analysis of 1,079 articles published in Le Monde from 1945 to 2013. We study variations of newspaper discourse to create five chronological narratives: (1) the reconstruction of France and the creation of new landscapes, (2) the promotion of national development through navigation, (3) the quest for energy independence through dams and nuclear power plants, (4) the abandonment of major projects, and (5) the definition of pollution and flooding as national problems at the same time as the rediscovery of landscapes as local amenities. River landscapes are related to national political objectives, even though schemes for the Rh?ne seem to be ever less geared to national ambitions. In specific contexts, bottom-up advocacy coalitions occasionally prove powerful enough to influence socioecological trajectories: Their power seems to be on the rise as the national project wanes. They are often opposed to new socioecological fixes. Although political drivers are instrumental in shaping the Rh?ne, economic dynamics are crucial. Energy production seems to be a good indicator for monitoring socioecological fixes along major rivers because it involves fixed capital. Key Words: construction of riverscape, discourse, political ecology, socioecological fix, temporal patterns.

Our study uses a repeat sales model to estimate the effect of floodplain location on single-family residential sale prices for a highly urbanized part of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. The most common approach used in the existing literature uses tax lot boundary to determine if a property is in a floodplain. However, flood insurance is only required in the United States if a homeowner has a federally-backed mortgage and if the residence, or a structure attached to the residence, is inside or intersects a 100-year floodplain. Using this "building footprint" approach we estimate that properties sell for, on average, 21.5% less than properties in the rest of the study area while the "tax lot" approach leads to an average estimated decline of 8.6%. A second model estimates separate effects for properties with a building footprint in or intersecting a floodplain and properties where only the tax lot is in the floodplain. Estimated effects for "tax lot only" properties in the 100-year floodplain are positive, which may be due to the amenities of stream proximity and no requirement to purchase flood insurance, while estimated coefficients for building footprint properties are negative. Using building footprint as the basis for determining if a property is in a 100-year floodplain is a much clearer signal of risk and capitalization than approaches used in the existing literature.

This study investigated the implications of monsoon fluctuation and regional topography on precipitation variation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, and it examined the potential link between monsoons and river flow. The results indicated that the fluctuations of the western North Pacific summer monsoon (WNPSM) and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) played different roles in precipitation variation. The areas in which precipitation variation was found synchronous with the WNPSM were much larger than those associated with the ISM. Significant positive correlation was found between precipitation during June-September (JJAS) and the WNPSM index (WNPMI) and the ISM index (IMI) over 29.3% and 12.8% of the basin, respectively, and that these areas were distributed mainly on the left and right bank downstream, respectively. A strong (weak) WNPSM was found to increase (decrease) moist westerlies that caused excess (deficient) orographic precipitation through the interaction with the Annamite Mountains. During strong (weak) WNPSM years, observed river flow during JJAS at the Mukdahan, Pakse, and Stung Treng stations in the downstream area were 8.0% (5.0%), 8.2% (12.6%), and 12.1% (19.5%) higher (lower) than the mean, respectively, showing that downstream river flow is modulated by the WNPSM intensity. These findings could support long-term hydrological predictions, and be beneficial for optimal flood control and water resource utilization in the basin.

J	Ternes, ME				Ternes, Mary Ellen			Legal liability, good engineering judgment and adaptation	PROCESS SAFETY PROGRESS			English	Article						adaptation; good engineering judgment; hazard risk assessment; legal liability; negligence; process safety management; RAGAGEP; risk management		Hurricane Harvey's devastation resulted in flooding and fire, as well as criminal indictments and civil litigation arising from the fire at the Arkema facility. This current litigation is just part of a recent trend in civil litigation, from citizen suits to common law actions, that is redefining causes of action and defenses in the context of climate change. This trend is creating greater concern among engineering and management professionals regarding litigation risk and potential liability arising from individual or managerial actions undertaken on behalf of an employer or client. These concerns are exacerbated by greater ability to forecast anticipated impacts from storm events in hurricane prone areas, which lends support to allegations that such events are foreseeable, and that engineers have a duty to prevent harm resulting from such events. In this context, chemical engineers should read the Chemical Safety Board's Arkema Final Report, especially focusing on the CSB's recommendations for further action by AIChE's Center for Chemical Process Safety, and brush up on the basics of professional liability. This article, developed specifically for AIChE members and presentation at the 15th Annual Global Congress on Process Safety, by an AIChE Fellow, senior environmental attorney and Fellow of the American College of Environmental Lawyers, does not constitute legal advice but provides a brief overview of legal process and concepts regarding professional liability, including classes of defendants such as plant managers, employees, licensed and unlicensed professionals, and independent contractors, types of civil and criminal claims, standing and other threshold issues, general defenses and immunities, and evidentiary issues at trial.

J	Chen, YZ				Chen, Yunzhen			Flood dynamics of the lower Yellow River over the last 3000 years: Characteristics and implications for geoarchaeology	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Yellow River; Flood dynamics; Irrigated agriculture; River control; Coevolution; Prehistoric cultures	SEDIMENT LOAD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHINA; COMPLEXITY; DISCHARGE; COLLAPSE; IMPACTS; HISTORY	The succession of prehistoric cultures and the formation and development of Chinese civilization in the Central Plains are interlocked with the geomorphic evolution of the Yellow River. Historically, the dynamics of this human-river relationship were manifested in the flood dynamics of the Yellow River. Based on the fluvial geomorphologic and channel morphodynamic principles and complex system theories, the Yellow River flood dynamics over the last 3000 years are analyzed, and three characteristics of the Yellow River are identified: high susceptibility to perturbations, which is mainly attributed to the dominant loess lithology; coevolution of the river and human systems driven by human-induced positive feedbacks; and an uncommon ability to avoid collapse. Future research on the human-river relationship during prehistoric times can be explored at three scales: continental landscape evolution and the succession of cultures, catchment landscape evolution and the rise and fall of a culture, and site formation processes from the geomorphic perspective. A synthesis of archeological findings, theories on alluvial channel evolution, the three characteristics of the Yellow River, and the pattern and drivers of the flood dynamics in historical times led to two speculations. One speculation is about the origin of two regional discontinuities in the archeological record from 5500-5100 yr BP and from 3900-3600 yr BP in the lower Yellow River basin; the other is about the rise and fall of the Erlitou Culture and the origin of a state. Quantitative studies adopting a multidisciplinary approach, such as 4D-GIS data mining and computer modeling, are helpful in answering intricate questions in the field.

How changing patterns of hazards interplay with local landscapes is an important focus of risk management, both in understanding how place-based risk is perceived and in identifying how local populations would like these risks to be managed. In this study we focus on the object of hazard and examine how different meanings associated with water and waterbodies relate to flood risk perception and preferences for flood management strategies. We present analysis of a mixed methods study with survey data (n=707) of residents in four coastal towns in France, South Africa and UK presented alongside an in-depth study of the two French towns (semi-structured interviews n=15 and document analysis). Our analysis unpacks the significance of relationships between the meaning of water in general, and the meaning of specific water bodies, to flood risk perceptions. Our findings indicate that general water meaning is more reliably related to flood risk perception than specific waterbody meaning, where waterbody meanings are significant for flood risk perception, positive identification with rivers relates to reduced flood risk perception. We also find that the meanings associated with water and waterbodies relate to specific preferences for different types of flood management, including insurance and local taxation. The implications for landscapes undergoing rapid change, for example as a result of changing climate and hydrological regimes, are discussed. In particular, we highlight how infrastructure interacts with sense of place in communities undergoing rapid social-ecological change and how understanding this interplay can help in the design of more fully supported adaptation strategies.

These changes offer opportunities and threats. Lowering groundwater without irrigation causes drought and successive crop and yield damage. Rising groundwater may alleviate drought as capillary rise supports root water uptake and crop growth, thus narrowing the difference between potential and actual yields. However, rising groundwater may also limit soil water storage, cause flooding in metropolitan areas and have a negative impact on crop yields. Changing land use from continuous soy bean into crop rotations or natural vegetation may decrease groundwater recharge and thus decrease groundwater levels. In case of crop rotation however, leaching of nutrients like nitrate may increase. We quantified these impacts using integrated dynamic crop growth and soil hydrology modelling. The models were tested at field scale using a local dataset from Argentina. We applied distributed modelling at regional scale to evaluate the impacts on groundwater recharge and crop yields using long term weather data. The experiments showed that threats arise from continuous monotone land use. Opportunities are created when a proper balance is found between supply and demand of soil water using a larger differentiation of land use. Increasing the areas of land use types with higher evapotranspiration, like permanent grassland and trees, will contribute to a more stable hydrologic system with more water storage capacities in the soil system and lower groundwater levels. Modelling tools clearly support the evaluation of the impact of land use and climate change on groundwater levels and crop yields.

J	Faruk, MO; Maharjan, KL				Faruk, Md Omar; Maharjan, Keshav Lall			The Determinants of Farmers' Perceived Flood Risk and Their Flood Adaptation Assessments: A Study in a Char-Land Area of Bangladesh	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						farmers; flood; char-land; perceived risk; adaptation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MEKONG DELTA; PERCEPTION; DISASTER; PREPAREDNESS; RESIDENTS; PEOPLE; HOUSEHOLDS; AWARENESS; BEHAVIOR	Floods are the most frequent and devastating disasters in Bangladesh. The riverine islands, known as char-lands, are particularly vulnerable to flooding. As flooding poses a significant threat to the lives and livelihoods of residents, especially farmers, it is crucial to understand how they perceive flood risk and assess their adaptation strategies in this geographically susceptible context. However, the existing literature has not adequately addressed these issues. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the factors influencing farmers' perceptions of flood risk and their assessments of flood adaptation. In a survey of 359 farmers in Bangladesh's char-land region, located in the Chauhali sub-district (Upazila) of Sirajganj district, we used the protection motivation theory (PMT) to measure farmers' perceived flood risk and adaptation assessments. Multiple regression analysis was employed to identify factors influencing them. Farmers prioritized the risk to livelihoods (production and income) over psychological aspects (health and diseases). Larger farms, more flood experience, and greater risk awareness are associated with higher overall flood risk perception and better flood adaptation, indicating higher self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response cost among farmers. Farmers perceived lower flood risk in exchange for greater house distance from the river and more trust in government actions. Hence, strengthening campaigns and programs is crucial to understanding flood risk in char-lands for improved adaptation to floods. The study highlights the application of PMT to assess farmers' perceptions of flood risk and their attitudes towards adaptation, suggesting further research opportunities.
