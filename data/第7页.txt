Cities nowadays face significant challenges in stormwater management from frequent heavy rainfalls. Traditional urban drainage systems can no longer cope with large amounts of surface runoff; cities are searching for new ways to deal with urban stormwater. Green roofs and other nature-based solutions have been widely used for stormwater management by combining water purification and retention functions but have not yet fully solved the flood problems. This article aims to (1) explore the different aspects of urban water management, particularly the urban stormwater topic, and (2) identify the existing solutions and discuss the potential and barriers to integrated solutions implementation. By introducing the concept of four domains and finding the overlapping area to investigate, we analyzed different solutions to reduce rainwater runoff from the roof and ground level, aiming at building and district scales. This paper proves that further research direction could constitute an integrated system to work together for urban stormwater management.

Filling observational gaps with crowdsourced citizen science rainfall data from the Met Office Weather Observation Website	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						citizen science; pluvial flooding; rainfall; urban flooding	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RADAR; GAUGE; RESOLUTION; STATIONS; QUALITY	This paper demonstrates the potential for crowdsourced rainfall data to infill gaps in the official rain gauge network and to provide new datasets for use in research. We use data from the Met Office Weather Observation Website (WOW) over 10 years (2011-2020) to generate two open-source datasets for Britain; multi-parameter raw data in an easy-to-use format; and an hourly rainfall dataset. We have compiled and prepared the data and detail here station selection, rain depth calculation, and data resampling to hourly intervals to create a consistent dataset for further processing (including statistical quality control) and application. Mapping the new rainfall dataset establishes that WOW observations fill spatial gaps in the official ground-based rain gauge network over Britain, particularly in urban areas. This could be particularly useful for post-event analysis of rainfall that results in pluvial flash flooding. Here, we focus on Britain but due to agreements with meteorological services in Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and the Republic of Ireland, plus many citizen scientists globally opting to share data via WOW, there is potential for the development of similar datasets using these methods around the world.

However, the story of how Addicks and Barker flooded upstream residential areas from a hydrologic standpoint is a harsh lesson in flood infrastructure policy and funding. This failure to protect both downstream properties in Buffalo Bayou and upstream areas behind the dams ended up with tens of thousands of flooded homes and properties, with many having flood waters for over 10 days. This paper explores the main causes for the flooding and addresses the hydrologic issues upstream in both reservoirs. The main causes of flooding were not just related to a massive rainfall event, but also explosive urban expansion of land use upstream of reservoirs, altered and updated reservoir design issues, and lack of governmental action in the years leading up to the disaster. Potential long-term solutions to the flooding and design problems are addressed in this article as well.

Therefore, forecasting and preparing for floods while considering extreme climate conditions are essential for decision-makers to prevent and manage disasters. Although recent studies have demonstrated the potential of long short-term memory (LSTM) models for forecasting rainfall-related runoff, there remains room for improvement due to the lack of observational data. In this study, we developed a flood forecasting model based on a hybrid modeling approach that combined a rainfall-runoff model and a deep learning model. Furthermore, we proposed a method for forecasting flooding time using several representative rainfall variables. The study focused on urban river basins, combined rainfall amounts, duration, and time distribution to create virtual rainfall scenarios. Additionally, the simulated results of the rainfall-runoff model were used as input data to forecast flooding time under extreme and other rainfall conditions. The prediction results achieved high accuracy with a correlation coefficient of > 0.9 and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of > 0.8. These results indicated that the proposed method would enable reasonable forecasting of flood occurrences and their timing using only forecasted rainfall information.

The Resourcesat 2 LISS IV (8 February 2021) and CNES Airbus satellite imagery (9 February 2021) clearly show the location of displaced materials. The solar radiation observed was higher than normal by 10% and 25% on 6 and 7 February 2021, respectively, however, the temperature shows up to 34% changes. These conditions are responsible for the sudden change in instability in glacier blocks causing deadly rock-ice slides that led to the collapse of the hanging glacier as a wedge failure. The displaced materials mixed with ice, snow, and debris caused catastrophic floods downstream within no time that destroyed critical infrastructure and killed human lives. The hydrodynamic modelling (HEC-RAS software) shows mean flow velocity up to 22.4 +/- 8.6 m/s with an average depth of 16.3 +/- 6.5 m that caused deadly devastation in the source region and along the rivers due to the flow of water in the valley.

This paper reviewed the initial mechanism and characteristics of existing debris flow in Malaysia. Almost all debris flows occurrence were initiated on natural terrains as opposed to other forms of landslides. Most of the events were induced by the rainfall. This is due to the geographic locations of Malaysia that lies on the equator with tropical climates and received abundant rainfall of 2400 mm annually. Intense and heavy rainfall increases the water content and pore water pressures within the residual soil that could trigger landslides. Thus, an intense and prolonged rainfall has become the major trig-gering factor for debris flow. This review article focus on clarifies the characterization of historical debris flow events that had an impact the infrastructure in Malaysia. In summary, this review attempts to systematically summarize the existing research on the mechanism of debris flow in Malaysia to provide further reference on debris flow prevention. Comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and the behaviour of the debris flow will assist to the fundamental hazard and provide proper planning for structural measures.

In addition, mapping of strandlines around the margins of proglacial Lake Humber has suggested a parallel evo-lution for the Vales of York and Pickering with synchronous flooding in both regions during the Late Devensian. This mapping also confirms a lack of recognisable glacioisostatic rebound post-MIS 2, while a review of the literature indicates the spacing regularity of the strandlines, recorded during the drainage of Lake Humber, can be attributed to cyclical climate changes. In contrast, the penultimate glaciation that is represented by a North Sea glacial incursion into the Vale if Pickering as far as the Wykeham Moraine, records post-glacial rebound of up to 30m. It is also probable that a proglacial lake, which has been given a tentative late MIS 7 date, impounded in the Vale of York could be indicative of an MIS 8 or early Saalian glacial blockage of the Humber.

The factors that influence flooding are vegetation, geology, degree of soil saturation, drainage characteristics of the watershed, and the shape of the topographic relief. Of the above factors, the topographic relief, which is the subject of the study, has been partially modified in some areas by infrastructure works (from 20.2 m to 17.6 m), and the population of the urban area has grown by 51.8% in 17 years (2004-2021); therefore, the objective is to evaluate the potential flood risk due to changes in this factor and the growth of the urban area. When using this method, the potential flood risk was determined considering four extreme events, 1982, 1990, 1998, and 2019. It was found that the potential risk increases for the whole city, being more intense in sector III, which, before the modification of the topographic relief, was the area with the lowest risk of flooding. In an extreme event such as Hurricane Paul in 1982, practically the entire city would be flooded.

Based on China's surface-based meteorological monthly precipitation data from 1961 to 2016 in the TGR area, the spatial, inter-annual and inter-decadal, and multi-time-scale changes of precipitation in the TGR area are analyzed by using Collaborative Kriging (Co-Kriging, CK) Interpolation, linear regression analysis, Morlet wavelet analysis and 5 a sliding average processing, which provide reference basis for further discussion on the impact of climate change, flood control and drought relief work in the reservoir area. Research shows that in the past 56 years, the average annual precipitation in most areas of the TGR is ranged from 1,000 to 1,200 mm; the variation of precipitation in the TGR area shows a weak decreasing trend, with great fluctuation between year and generation, and the precipitation in each decade has a 'less-more-less' changing trend; the annual precipitation in the TGR area has periodic changes on multi-time scales, mainly including 25, 16 and 8 years. The smaller the scale is, the shorter the average period of precipitation change is.

Flood risk perception and responses among urban residents in the northeastern United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flooding; Risk perception; Protective action; Risk salience; Flood insurance; United States of America	CLIMATE-CHANGE; POSTDISASTER CITY; EXPERIENCE; INSURANCE; DISASTER; AWARENESS; DECISION; PEOPLE; RIVER	Growing flood risks raise difficult questions regarding risk perception, protective actions, and government response. Drawing on behavioral decision theory, protection motivation theory, and the protective action decision model, we examine the roles risk salience and immediacy, response efficacy, and trust in government authorities play in perceptions of flood risk and adoption of protective actions, with a focus on flood insurance. Data come from focus group discussions conducted in 2 flood-affected neighborhoods in Troy, New York, United States of America. Troy has a history of flooding, including major floods linked to Hurricane Irene in 2011. While several participants had vivid memories of past floods, overall salience of flood risk was low. While they recognized responsiveness of local government at the time of hazard events, they expressed concern about inadequate preparation for future disasters. Participants expressed concern about flood insurance, citing costs, inadequate coverage, and arduous procedures needed to file claims. They expressed distrust in the institutions surrounding flood insurance. We argue that emergency managers will need to be responsive to people's multiple concerns in order to build the awareness and trust on which effective natural hazard preparedness depends.

Incidences of extreme weather conditions are becoming more and more frequent, posing plants to stressful conditions, such as flooding, drought, heat, or frost etc. Especially for arid lands, there is a tug-of-war between keeping high crop yields and increasing water use efficiency of limited water resources. This difficult task can be achieved through the selection of tolerant water stress species or by increasing the tolerance of sensitive species. In this scenario, it is important to understand the response of plants to water stress. So far, the response of staple foods and vegetable crops to deficit irrigation is well studied. However, there is lack of literature regarding the responses of ornamental plants to water stress conditions. Considering the importance of this ever-growing sector for the agricultural sector, this review aims to reveal the defense mechanisms and the involved morpho-physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes in ornamental plant's responses to deficit irrigation.

A green paradox in climate adaptation for coastal housing markets	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Green paradox; Land use; North Carolina; Perverse incentives; Policy signals; Sea-level rise	LEVEL RISE; BUILDING CODES; STORM-SURGE; PROPERTY; CONSEQUENCES; MITIGATION; PRICES; IMPACT; VALUES; FLOOD	Efficient adaptation to climate change in coastal areas is likely to require public policy inter-ventions. New policies or expectations of policy changes that impact private assets, such as housing, may generate economic incentives that result in unintended consequences. We examine the effect on new housing development resulting from a scientific report by a regulatory agency mandating coastal communities in North Carolina (NC) consider sea-level rise when developing new land-use policies. Estimates from our preferred triple-differences model suggest the policy announcement increased building permits by 32% in coastal NC counties until permitting returned to pre-policy levels after a moratorium on new regulations was passed by the state legislature. Our results are supported by numerous robustness checks, including alternative controls, placebo tests and a parcel-level model in Dare County, NC. This green paradox in coastal climate adaptation implies that hundreds of millions of dollars in additional unregulated housing was constructed in NC locations vulnerable to sea-level rise likely due to perverse incentives generated by a policy signal.

A Temperature-Scaling Approach for Projecting Changes in Short Duration Rainfall Extremes from GCM Data	WATER			English	Article						precipitation; dew-point; temperature; extremes; climate change	REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL; HOURLY PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; FUTURE CHANGES; FREQUENCY; HYDROLOGY; INCREASE; IMPACTS; TRENDS; SCALES	Current and future urban flooding is influenced by changes in short-duration rainfall intensities. Conventional approaches to projecting rainfall extremes are based on precipitation projections taken from General Circulation Models (GCM) or Regional Climate Models (RCM). However, these and more complex and reliable climate simulations are not yet available for many locations around the world. In this work, we test an approach that projects future rainfall extremes by scaling the empirical relation between dew-point temperature and hourly rainfall and projected changes in dew-point temperature from the EC-Earth GCM. These projections are developed for the RCP 8.5 scenario and are applied to a case study in the Netherlands. The shift in intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves shows that a 100-year (hourly) rainfall event today could become a 73-year event (GCM), but could become as frequent as a 30-year (temperature-scaling) in the period 2071-2100. While more advanced methods can help to further constrain future changes in rainfall extremes, the temperature-scaling approach can be of use in practical applications in urban flood risk and design studies for locations where no high-resolution precipitation projections are available.

Precipitation in the northern and the southern parts of the eastern monsoon region of China exhibits a centennial scale inverse relationship over the past 2000 years; however, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the temporal range of this dipolar pattern. In order to better understand this north-south pattern of precipitation variation and its driving mechanism, we analyzed isoGDGTs biomarker compounds in a sediment core from alpine Daye Lake, in the Qinling Mountains, in the north-south climatic transition zone of eastern China. Measurements of %Cren were used to reconstruct changes in lake level over the past 2000 years. The results show that, from 240 to 1300 CE, prior to the Little Ice Age, the lake level changes were consistent with the precipitation record for the northern part of eastern China, with the lake reaching its highest level of 25 +/- 7.17 mat 555 CE; subsequently, the lake fell to its lowest level of 12 +/- 7.17 m at 1030 CE. During the Little Ice Age, the water level maintained an increasing trend, especially during the last three centuries, when it remained above 20 +/- 7.17 m, which is consistent with the precipitation record from southern China. The results indicate that the climatically transitional Qinling region has a complex history of climate change. During the early part of the record (240-130 0 CE), the level of Daye Lake and the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation were in phase, controlled mainly by the strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. In contrast, since the Little Ice Age (1300 CE to the present), under the influence of ENSO, the westward extension and southward retreat of the West Pacific Subtropical High caused the rain belt to shift southward, decreasing the water vapor supply to the Qinling Mountains. The ascent of moisture-bearing air over the Qinling Mountains resulted in orographic rainfall, while the weakening of evaporation during the Little Ice Age reduced the evaporation of water vapor and also contributed to the continued rise of the level of Daye Lake. The abundant precipitation in the Qinling region during the Little Ice Age provided water resources to sustain human activities in the downstream Weihe Plain, but was also a major cause of flooding.

This paper suggests a framework for a healthiness assessment of the water cycle to provide a guideline for systematic watershed management considering the previous and current states. The suggested framework aims to prioritize restoration and enhancement plans based on the graded healthiness of the water cycle elements by the watersheds. The framework is composed of two assessment procedures: a problem-focused assessment to identify problems such as flood, drought, and river depletion in the watershed and the highest priority assessment to select the watershed for enhancement and restoration plans. The healthiness assessment method for each metric is suggested based on the Korean Framework Act on Water Management. The framework was applied to four different watersheds in South Korea. The framework is proven to be an effective method to identify practical emerging problems for the water cycle in each watershed. The framework can contribute to providing technical information to detect the water problem of the watershed by objectively diagnosing the watersheds with various potential water problems via the healthiness assessment.

The new method integrated the grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (Grey-DEMATEL) into analytical hierarchical process (AHP) (simplified as G-DEMATEL-AHP). The risk distribution was mapped using geographic information system (GIS). A nine-score questionnaire was adopted in Grey-DEMATEL to analyse the inundation risk. Zhengzhou was selected as a case study with different rainfall scenarios, including flooding disaster induced by heavy storm on July 20, 2021 (i.e., "7.20 Storm") and average rainfall of five years (i.e., "5-Yr Average"). The results showed that the proposed method can assess the flood risk distribution effectively in Zhengzhou. Comparison between the results from different scenarios showed that the impact of the "7.20 Storm" was much stronger than that of the "5-Yr Average" scenario. Moreover, an existing method, fuzzy AHP (FAHP), was also used to assess the same scenario. The results indicated that the G-DEMATEL-AHP method could more effectively identify the most critical risk areas when compared to the FAHP.

J	Owuor, MO; Mwiturubani, DA				Owuor, Martin Ochieng; Mwiturubani, Donald Anthony			Correlation between flooding and settlement planning in Nairobi	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						flooding; precipitation; settlements; settlement planning	CITY	Globally, climate change triggers flooding through unpredictable, intermittent and incessant precipitation. Flooding in Nairobi is multi-factorial in causation. This has raised the question of necessary interventions in the design of urban settlements in order to reduce the impacts of extreme rainfall events that result in floods. This paper seeks to analyse the reciprocal correlation between settlement planning and pluvial flooding in Nairobi. Census data were obtained from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and daily rainfall records from the Kenya Meteorological Department spanning from 1961 to 2018. Other key parameters were drawn from extensive thematic content analyses of the existing literature. The data were subjected to trend and correlation analyses using the Stata software to determine patterns and possible causal relationships. The results showed that there was an insignificant but positive relationship between the two variables with Pearson and Spearman coefficients of correlation of 0.211 and 0.111, respectively. The results of this study repudiate the perceived notion that occurrences of pluvial flooding in Nairobi have increased due to erratic precipitation patterns and improper planning of settlements. The null hypothesis is therefore upheld at 95% confidence level.

The literature lacks a unified understanding of the essentials of stakeholder engagement, and the fragmented use of the stakeholder engagement construct challenges its development and legitimacy. The purpose of this article is to clarify the construct of stakeholder engagement to unfold the full potential of stakeholder engagement research. We conduct a literature review on 90 articles in leading academic journals focusing on stakeholder engagement in the business and society, management and strategy, and environmental management and environmental policy literatures. We present a descriptive analysis of stakeholder engagement research for a 15-year period, and we identify the moral, strategic, and pragmatic components of stakeholder engagement as well as its aims, activities, and impacts. Moreover, we offer an inclusive stakeholder engagement definition and provide a guide to organizing the research. Finally, we complement the current understanding with a largely overlooked dark side of stakeholder engagement. We conclude with future research avenues for stakeholder engagement research.

The limitation of the expansion of conventional drainage systems to manage excess stormwater leads to the application of nature-based solutions (NBS) to control flooding. This study explores potential of green roof NBS for rainfall-fed flood reduction, which can utilize existing roof space for deployment. A detailed literature survey using systematic literature-search procedures was conducted to investigate the performance of extensive/intensive green roofs in runoff reduction using monitoring/modeling approaches. Since limited studies have explored the use of semi-intensive green roofs for flood management, a new simulation study has been developed to compare the effectiveness of semi-intensive green roofs. The performance of different types of vegetation used on green roofs in runoff reduction was investigated using a simulation study, which was validated using a real-world green roof deployed in Dublin.

Both natural and human-induced disasters present major risks to sustainable development trajectories and require strategic management within regional and local plans. Climate change and its impacts, including intensified storms, flash floods, and other water-based disasters (WD), also pose a serious and increasing threat. Small, remote communities prone to weather extremes are particularly vulnerable as they often lack effective early warning systems and experience energy insufficiency. Humanitarian engineering provides a transdisciplinary approach to these issues, supporting practical development resources such as renewable energy, which can also be adapted for disaster response. This study details an exploratory investigation of community vulnerability and capability mapping (VCM) that identifies communities with high WD risk and limited response capability which may benefit from risk reduction engagement and program co-development. By presenting criteria appropriate for VCM, we highlight the anthropocentric characteristics that could potentially be incorporated within community-led action as part of a comprehensive scheme that promotes sustainable development.

In this paper, we examine how recurrent flooding interacts with gendered vulnerability, social differentiation, and place-related historical and structural processes to produce unequal physical and mental health outcomes. We situated the study in Old Fadama, Ghana, using a Photovoice approach (n = 20) and theoretical concepts from political ecologies of health and feminist political ecology. Overall, the study revealed several adverse physical and mental health impacts of flooding, with vulnerability differentiated based particularly on gender and age, but also housing, class, and income. Our findings suggest the need for greater attentiveness to social differentiation in scholarship involving political ecologies of health. The paper builds on the health and place literature by linking the social and contextual to the medical.

During northeast monsoons, the river frequently floods the adjoining city areas. In this study, the impact of dredging and disappearance of tanks on flooding in CMA is analyzed under historical, urbanization, and extreme rainfall scenarios utilizing an urbanization-hydrologic-hydraulic modelling framework. The simulated scenarios highlight the importance of the tanks as a flood control measure for CMA. The major conclusions are (a) dredging the tanks uniformly by 2 m can compensate the increase in flooding due to urbanization by 2050 for 1 in 50-year rainfalls and, (b) for disappearance of tanks, 1 in 50-year rainfall can inundate the city akin to 1 in 100-year rainfalls. The study can be useful for making informed decisions on dredging the tanks, land use planning, and flood control measures for the CMA.	[Nithila Devi, N.; Sridharan, B.; Bindhu, V.

Quantitative assessment on basin-scale hydrological services of wetlands	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Wetlands modules; Hydrological processes simulation; Baseflow support; Quickflow mitigation; Hydrological function	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; WATERSHED HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GIS DATA; MODEL; IMPACTS; SWAT; EQUIVALENT; TRENDS; FLOWS	Despite recognizing the importance of hydrological function of wetlands, basin-scale wetlands services have rarely been investigated. The PHYSITEL/HYDROTEL modelling platform was used to quantitatively assess the impact of wetlands on quickflow and baseflow with paired simulation scenarios in Duobukuli River Basin, namely with wetlands and without wetlands. Simulation results showed that wetlands exert significant impact on basin hydrological processes by decreasing streamflow and altering streamflow regime (magnitude, frequency, duration and time of flow events). The intensity (significant or not) of wetlands influences on quickflow had daily, monthly and annual variation. Wetlands significantly attenuated quickflow during flood season while slightly support daily, monthly and annual baseflow. The average quickflow attenuation and baseflow support of wetlands were 5.89% and 0.83%, respectively. Although the intensity and effect (mitigation or augment) of wetlands on streamflow temporally varied at daily, monthly, seasonal and annual scales, wetland overall mitigated quickflow and augment baseflow in Duobukuli River Basin. Our results could provide insights for future decision-making for rehabilitation and conservation of wetlands as well as integrated basin water resources management.

However, changes in the behaviour of climate systems can lead to nonstationarity in flood series. Here, we develop flood hazard maps for Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, under nonstationary conditions using extreme value analysis, a coupled 1D-2D model and high-resolution topographical data derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Our findings indicate that ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) influence the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall, while global sea-level rise causes nonstationarity in local sea levels, having an impact on flood risk. The detailed flood hazard maps show that areas of high flood potential are located along river banks, with 0.60 km(2) of the study area being unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings (H5 zone) under a 100-year return period scenario.

The forests provide quality and continuous water yield as well as protective services such as flood control, soil protection, landslide protection, avalanche protection, and prevention against rock falls, which are related to water. However, the quality and quantity of all the forest functions are influenced by forest ecosystem structure and composition such as forest type, tree species, age class distribution, biomass, leaf area, basal area, crown closure, and stand development stages. This study provides an assessment of hydrological services of forest ecosystems through the systematic review of relevant literature till 2018. It mainly focuses on water-forest relations and explains how forest ecosystem structure and composition affect water production, quality, and sustainability. Then, a general framework relating to the integration of hydrological services into forest management is concluded in the context of sustainable management of natural resources.

River dikes, earth dams, and the foundation of structures built in water are eroded by internal infiltration into the soil (seepage/piping) or flow (scouring/overtopping). Climate change and the spread of urbanization increase the fragility of areas prone to flooding. Current methodologies for early detection of ongoing damage caused by water to these structures are inadequate for preventing structural collapse. Traditional hydrogeological monitoring is based on visual inspection of the infrastructure. In this research, a novel distributed fiber-optic pressure sensor (DPS) was developed to measure variations in the pore water pressure with a spatial resolution of decimeters and over lengths in the order of kilometers. Extensive controlled pressure and temperature variation tests were carried out for calibrating the water pressure and temperature sensitivity of the DPS. The resulting design of the sensor achieved a high sensitivity of 0.1 kPa (1 cmH(2)O). Additionally, the DPS functionality was validated in a reduced-scale test embankment.

Reducing the impacts of flood and erosion in these areas by adopting coping strategies that fortify the resilience of individuals and their localities is desirable. This study used summative content analysis to explore the coping mechanisms of coastal communities before, during, and after various dangers relating to flooding and erosion. The findings from the study show that effective surveillance systems, disaster preparedness, risk mapping, early warning systems, availability of databases and functional command systems, as well as reliable funding are essential to efficiently cope with hazards of coastal flooding and erosion. As flooding and erosion have been predicted to be more severe due to climate change in the coming years, the adoption of effective natural and artificial mechanisms with modern technologies could help coastal regions to be more resilient in coping with the dangers associated with flooding and erosion. Pragmatic policies and programs to this end by actors are critical to averting crises induced by flooding and erosion in coastal areas.

In the current climate conditions, flood events are becoming more frequent due to human impact on the environment; water spills are also more frequent, which means more and more energy is lost. How much water is spilled and, consequently, how much energy is lost is shown in the present article on the chain of power plants on the Sava River in the five years from 2015 to 2019. An analytical assessment of the current situation in the lock was carried out, which showed that the available water through the locks could be used efficiently. The paper presents a case study of one overflow event lasting 48 h. The calculated theoretical losses of energy (of spilled water) and possible technical implementation for capturing losses are given. The proposed technical implementation is based on established technology, so we could expect that the approach is feasible. The results show that the estimated spilled water energy potential reaches about 40% of the actual spilled water or energy lost.

Application of Different Structures of HBV Model to Studying Runoff Formation Processes: Case Study of Experimental Catchments	WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						experimental catchments; HBV; model structure; runoff formation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACT; RIVER	The article presents the experience in the application of a hydrological conceptual model HBV, including its standard version and modifications, to studying runoff-formation processes on small experimental catchments in the upper reaches of the Ussuri R. based on field observation data in the warm seasons from 2012 to 2019. It was shown, that, in many cases, whatever the structure of the model, the quality of calculations was satisfactory, and the flood events were simulated with a high quality. All versions of the HBV model used in the study have been found to have drawbacks, either common or individual. The difference between the structures of the model and their effect on the estimated runoff in the outlet section has been demonstrated. Against to the standard version of HBV with two storages, the three storages version has not improved the efficency of runoff modeling. The standard structure of HBV was found to be optimal in terms of agreement with the natural processes of runoff formation and the quality of runoff simulation in small mountain rivers.	[Lupakov, S.

Disaster risk reduction (DRR) has benefited by moving away from purely 'grey' infrastructure measures towards NbS. However, this shift also furthers an increasing trend of reliance on public acceptance to plan, implement and manage DRR measures. In this review, we examine how unique NbS characteristics relate to public acceptance through a comparison with grey measures, and we identify influential acceptance factors related to individuals, society, and DRR measures. Based on the review, we introduce the PA-NbS model that highlights the role of risk perception, trust, competing societal interests, and ecosystem services. Efforts to increase acceptance should focus on providing and promoting awareness of benefits combined with effective communication and collaboration. Further research is required to understand interconnections among identified factors and how they can be leveraged for the success and further uptake of NbS.

Merr.] is one of the most important legume crops abundant in edible protein and oil in the world. In recent years there has been increasingly more drastic weather caused by climate change, with flooding, drought, and unevenly distributed rainfall gradually increasing in terms of the frequency and intensity worldwide. Severe flooding has caused extensive losses to soybean production and there is an urgent need to breed strong soybean seeds with high flooding tolerance. The present study demonstrates bioinformatics big data mining and integration, meta-analysis, gene mapping, gene prioritization, and systems biology for identifying prioritized genes of flooding tolerance in soybean. A total of 83 flooding tolerance genes (FTgenes), according to the appropriate cut-off point, were prioritized from 36,705 test genes collected from multidimensional genomic features linking to soybean flooding tolerance. Several validation results using independent samples from SoyNet, genome-wide association study, SoyBase, GO database, and transcriptome databases all exhibited excellent agreement, suggesting these 83 FTgenes were significantly superior to others. These results provide valuable information and contribution to research on the varieties selection of soybean.

Cities face risks from different types of floods, depending on various geographical, environmental, and hydrometeorological conditions. In response to the growing threat of urban flooding, a better understanding of urban flood vulnerability is needed. In this study, a comprehensive method was developed to evaluate the vulnerability of different types of urban floods. First, a coupled urban flood model was built to obtain the extent of influence of various flood scenarios caused by rainfall and river levee overtopping. Second, an assessment framework for urban flood vulnerability based on an indicator method was used to evaluate the vulnerability in different flood hazard scenarios. Finally, the method was applied to Lishui City, China, and the distribution and pattern of urban flood vulnerability were studied. The results highlight the spatial variability of flooding and the vulnerability distributions of different types of urban floods. Compound floods were identified to cause more severe effects in the urban areas.

It focuses on the selection and characteristics of each proposed indicator and the integration procedure based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) on a large scale. The majority of data used for the calculation of the indicators comes from open public data sources, which allows the replicability of the method in any area where the same data are available. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, a study case is presented. The flood social vulnerability assessment focuses on the municipality of Ponferrada (Spain), a medium-sized town that has high exposure to floods due to potential breakage of the dam located upstream. A detailed mapping of the social vulnerability index is generated at the urban parcel scale, which shows an affected population of 34,941 inhabitants. The capability of working with such detailed units of analysis for an entire medium-sized town provides a valuable tool to support flood risk planning and management.

Provenance of detrital sediments in Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA: Changes in source contributions between the Last Glacial Maximum and Holocene	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							WESTERN TRANSVERSE RANGES; EARTH-ELEMENT PATTERNS; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; CRUSTAL EVOLUTION; VENTURA BASIN; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; GABRIEL MOUNTAINS; CHANNEL-ISLANDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Detrital terrestrial sediments preserved in near-shore marine basins bear distinctive geochemical identifiers that can be used to identify the on-shore sediment sources and sediment routing through time. Santa Barbara Basin (SBB), offshore of southern California, USA, contains a well-known, continuous, high-resolution Holocene flood record that can provide insights into the frequency and changes in on-shore sources across time for such events. Here SBB-adjacent stream bed sediments are characterized using mineralogical, elemental, and radiogenic strontium and neodymium isotopic compositions. Modern and Holocene SBB flood deposits and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) sediments were similarly analyzed. The Southern Slopes of the Santa Ynez Mountains and Topatopa Mountains account for similar to 85% of SBB Holocene flood deposit sediments, as calculated from Sr-Nd isotope mixing models. During the LGM sea level low stand, the Southern Slopes contribution increased (to >= 90%), while relative sediment contribution from Santa Clara River diminished. This loss was likely compensated, however, by increased sediment flux from the Southern Slopes and the Channel Islands.

The study also examines the individual-level adaptative strategies adopted by the local residents to coexist with the flooding. The findings revealed several challenges encountered by the flooded households. In addition, most of the respondents expressed a preference to live out the floods in their residences rather than relocating to a makeshift shelter. The ability to live through the floods was largely attributable to the architecture of their residences whereby the houses are raised a few meters above the ground with the living quarter on the upper level, which is the most prominent adaptative strategy. Other adaptative strategies included, e.g., the ownership of a flat-bottom boat and pre-flood stocking-up on basic necessities. Furthermore, in light of the residents' preference to live out the repetitive flooding, this research also proposes a simple means to enhance the effectiveness of the localized flood relief efforts.

The study area consisted of Orunski Stream in the northern Polish city of Gdansk. The study period (review of cartographic materials) covered the years 1908 to 2000, while field research covered the period from May 2009 to April 2010. In addition, measurements were performed to study the dynamics of changes occurring in the creek during rainfall events. Examination of the water chemistry changes made two days before heavy rainfall showed a significant increase in sulphates and nitrogen compounds. Additionally, pollutants washed from the basin contributed to a significant deterioration in the water colour. A rainfall of 1.3 mm caused an eleven-fold increase in stream flow, a twofold increase in the water level, and a fourfold increase in the velocity of water molecules. It might appear seem that such a small amount of rainfall would have no major effect on the hydrologic and hydrochemical parameters of a small creek. However, it is the maximum flow rate that is an important variable when assessing potential flood risk levels.

Numerous scholars and countries have successively proposed innovative concepts for stormwater management. To grasp the current research focus and status quo and determine the development trend and dynamic direction, this work used CiteSpace, a scientific bibliometric analysis software, to analyze and identify 3080 articles based on the core database of Web of Science from 1980 to 2019. Results show a comprehensive overview of the stormwater management field, including the changes of annual articles with time; the most influential countries, institutions, authors, and articles; and the periodical keywords, highly cited papers, and burst time in the field. A knowledge table in the stormwater management field was obtained, the development context of the field and the research focus of each stage were understood, and the future development trend of the field is inferred. This study aims to provide reference for researchers and practitioners in the stormwater management field.

Recent studies have shown that global warming potentially affects the risk of flooding and that the decisive factor for flood events is not temperature, but precipitation characteristics and hydrological conditions. Flood events have numerous impacts on social, economic and environmental aspects depending on how humans have altered lands, natural rivers and lake dynamics. Flood protection measures can cause conflicts with conservation measures and with ecosystem services because natural capital is not considered able to control floods and to contribute control floods and that it can contribute to human health and safety. In this paper we analysed the flood events in Lake Maggiore for return time periods of 3 - 5 - 10 - 25 - 50 - 100 - 250 - 500 years, considering the flood frequency in the last ten years using 1868-2021 as a reference period. We discussed the probability distribution of flood peaks, the correlation and linear regression between the lake level fluctuations and macroinvertebrates occurrence. We also presented lake coasts flood hazard mapping. The probability distribution that better describes the annual peak level distribution, is the Gumbel function, while for spring and autumn flood events the better distribution is the Log-Pearson type III. One of the historical flood events in terms of magnitude was in 2000, characterized by a return time of about 50 years. The last flood event in 2020, was characterized by a return period of about 10 years. Considering the seasonal frequency of flood, the autumn magnitude was higher than the spring one, and the differences between seasonal flood events progressively increased. For a return time period of 3 years, a difference of a few cm is expected, while for a return time of 500, years a difference of 1.5 m is feasible. The results suggested a high probability of a flood event every three years and also a forecast of a flood of about 197 m asl (3.14 m above the average lake level) every 10 years. Raising the lake level will affect the reed bed area from 193 m asl, and it will be more effective at 194.5 m (up to a 10% reduction). During flood events, the whole reed bed area is submerged. As regard macroinvertebrates composition and abundance, the first results show significant negative relationships between all sampling stations altogether vs the abundance of Cladotanytarsus sp. (Chironominae) and nearly significant positive relationships between water levels at Magadino vs Pscectrocladius sordidellus (Orthocladiinae) abundances. These few results are perhaps due to the current limited data availability.

Declining river flows in western North America, including the upper Columbia River, have reduced the area of open water wetlands in the floodplain and raised concern that the Columbia Wetlands will not remain viable under increasing climate change. In this study we use water isotopes (& delta;O-18 and & delta;H-2) and electrical conductivity to quantify the proportion of groundwater, river water and precipitation contributing to wetland water balance, as well as the role of evaporation, in the Columbia Wetlands through the spring, summer and fall of 2019. We found strong seasonality of water input sources. Groundwater and precipitation were important in spring and fall, while river water was dominant during the summer. An individual wetlands' location in the floodplain as well as relative connectivity to the river channels influenced its seasonal pattern of input sources. Quantifying the relative contributions of the main input water sources to wetlands provides important new understanding of hydrologic connectivity in the Columbia Wetlands.

Of particular importance are rainfall (liquid precipitation) extremes owing to their instantaneous triggering of runoff and association with floods6, landslides7-9 and soil erosion10,11. However, so far, the body of literature on intensification of precipitation extremes has not examined the extremes of precipitation phase separately, namely liquid versus solid precipitation. Here we show that the increase in rainfall extremes in high-elevation regions of the Northern Hemisphere is amplified, averaging 15 per cent per degree Celsius of warming-double the rate expected from increases in atmospheric water vapour. We utilize both a climate reanalysis dataset and future model projections to show that the amplified increase is due to a warming-induced shift from snow to rain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intermodel uncertainty in projections of rainfall extremes can be appreciably explained by changes in snow-rain partitioning (coefficient of determination 0.47). Our findings pinpoint high-altitude regions as 'hotspots' that are vulnerable to future risk of extreme-rainfall-related hazards, thereby requiring robust climate adaptation plans to alleviate potential risk. Moreover, our results offer a pathway towards reducing model uncertainty in projections of rainfall extremes.

However, how this CFH hazard will change under future anthropogenic warming in China and their potential population and economic exposures remains unexamined. Here, we systematically quantify the projected changes in bivariate CHF hazards for 187 catchments in China during the 2071-2100 period relative to the 1985-2014 period and investigate the potential population and gross domestic product (GDP) exposure, by developing a climatic-hydrological-socioeconomic modelling chain. We find that there is a nationwide increase in CFH hazards and the historical 30-year CFH episodes are projected to increase by 10 times in southern catchments. Under the synergistic impacts of changing CFH episodes and population (GDP), a mass of people in southern (0.79-2.13 thousand/km(2)) and eastern (1.68 thousand/km(2)) catchments and an enormous sum of GDP in eastern catchments (400-912 million/km(2)) will be exposed to increasing CFH hazards.

The quantity, duration and intensity of events, such as flash rains and heat waves, will increase the vulnerability of urban regions while exposing citizens to potentially dangerous conditions. According to the current literature, mainstreaming resilience in urban planning means designing rules that strengthen urban systems' adaptive and self-regulating functions by reducing their vulnerability. In this work, we aimed to build knowledge for the application of the sponge district concept to Izmir (Turkiye), one of Europe's most vulnerable areas to pluvial flooding. To do this, we first analyzed the runoff in each urban sub-watershed, then employed a composite index to determine potential areas of intervention for nature-based solutions. Results show that 10% of Izmir's urban areas are extremely vulnerable to cloudbursts, which means that 40% of the urban population is exposed to this phenomenon. Moreover, the runoff calculation in the sub-watershed demonstrated that the potential flood volume is underestimated, especially in the upslope areas. The results can be used as a template to suggest a stepwise approach to mainstream the resilience of densely-inhabited coastal urban catchments.

As in many other insular settings, the low-lying coastal stretches in the E and NE sectors of Lipari are locally exposed to coastal erosion and flooding, enhanced by subsidence effects leading to local sea level rise. Most of these coastal sectors appear critical, being narrow and increasingly threatened by the risk of permanent inundation and beach disappearance. In this study, this setting is placed in the wider context of the decadal evolution of the main beaches, analysed through a multidisciplinary approach, which includes remote sensing techniques (aero-photogrammetry, unmanned aerial vehicle survey, and satellite data), offshore geophysical surveys (high-resolution multibeam bathymetry), and field observations. The results show a variable interaction in space and time between natural and anthropogenic factors in the long- and mid-term evolution of the studied coastal areas. Considering that part of the local economy at Lipari depends on beach tourism, proper future management is required in the view of natural risk reduction and in the light of future climate changes and related impacts.

Continued sea-level rise (SLR) will exacerbate the issue where present, and many more locations will begin to experience recurrent high-tide flooding (HTF) in the coming decades. Here we use established SLR scenarios and flooding thresholds to demonstrate how the combined effects of SLR and nodal cycle modulations of tidal amplitude lead to acute inflections in projections of future HTF. The mid-2030s, in particular, may see the onset of rapid increases in the frequency of HTF in multiple US coastal regions. We also show how annual cycles and sea-level anomalies lead to extreme seasons or months during which many days of HTF cluster together. Clustering can lead to critical frequencies of HTF occurring during monthly or seasonal periods one to two decades prior to being expected on an annual basis. High-tide flooding (HTF) is more likely with sea-level rise. Projections along the United States coastline, considering likely sea-level rise and tidal amplitude cycles, suggest increased HTF event clustering in time and rapid increases in annual HTF frequency as early as the mid-2030s.

J	Octavianti, T				Octavianti, Thanti			Rethinking water security: How does flooding fit into the concept?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Water security; Securitisation theory; Flooding; Jakarta; Sinking; Seawall plan	LAND SUBSIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; INSECURITY; INFRASTRUCTURE; POLITICIZATION; SECURITIZATION; CITIZENSHIP; RESILIENCE; COPENHAGEN	Since first introduced in 2000, 'water security' has grown into a vibrant research area, with the majority of studies examining water supply security. Although protection to water-related hazards is recognised as a dimension in water security, only a few scholars have explicitly put flood-related research under the banner of water security. This paper seeks to theorise the position of flooding in the water security conception using the securitisation lens, which also influenced early works in the water security field. Securitisation is a process of perceiving an issue as a threat, enabling the pursuit of extraordinary measures outside normal politics. I find that water supply security and flood security have the same theoretical root: fear of an unknown future. They are based on the notion that threats to the shortage of water and surplus of water, respectively, create the need for robust policies, which often translate into climate-proofing infrastructures. Here I propose a conceptual tool to assess the likelihood of a threat to undergo a securitisation process and to help answer why a threat was securitised while others not. This tool is deployed to examine the case of flooding and sinking in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The dimensions of lacustrine and glaciolacustrine levels of this basin are higher than the current levels of the lakes. The organic matter of lake levels recorded on stratigraphic profiles was described, sampled and dated using AMS, while other paleobathymetric indicators were also identified (height of the fan-delta apex and paleo-coast levels). Deriving out of the reconstruction of flooded areas it was established that the lake system was formed before 28 ka ago and would have reached its maximum expansion around 12 ka ago. The first hunter-gatherer occupation of the basin (11 ka) corresponds to the period of initial contraction of the lake system and the composition of the current configuration of the coastlines. This scenario would have allowed the exploration of western areas and the gradual incorporation of the forest to the action range of hunter-gatherer populations. Similarly, the levels of lakes Tar and San Martin would not have hindered the movement of human populations through the steppe throughout the Holocene.

Imminent climate change is predicted to intensify these consequences, forcing cities to rethink common infrastructure practices. One popular method of adaptation is green infrastructure implementation, which has been found to reduce local temperatures and alleviate excess runoff when installed effectively. As cities continue to change and adapt, land use/landcover modeling becomes an important tool for city officials in planning future land usage. This study uses a combination of cellular automata, machine learning, and Markov chain analysis to predict high resolution land use/landcover changes in Philadelphia, PA, USA for the year 2036. The 2036 landcover model assumes full implementation of Philadelphia's green infrastructure program and past temporal trends of urbanization. The methodology used to create the 2036 model was validated by creating an intermediate prediction of a 2015 landcover that was then compared to an existing 2015 landcover. The accuracy of the validation was determined using Kappa statistics and disagreement scores. The 2036 model successfully met Philadelphia's green infrastructure goals. A variety of landscape metrics demonstrated an overall decrease in fragmentation throughout the landscape due to increases in urban landcover.

In this study, a method combining Bayesian network (BN) model and geographic information system (GIS), which can capture the potential relationships between factors impacting flood disaster and has capacity of quantifying uncertainty and utilizing both data and knowledge-based sources, was proposed to assess flood disaster risk. The proposed methodology was applied in a case study to assess flood disaster risk and to diagnose the reason for flood disaster in Zhengzhou City, and the results were validated by comparing with actual situation. The results show that that the relative error of very-low, low, moderate, high and very-high risk predicted by the proposed model is 12.57%, 13.21%, 2.23%, 19.63% and 21.65%, respectively, which demonstrates the discriminative power of the established model. Based on the spatial distribution of different risk levels, it can be recognized that the flood disaster risk in Zhengzhou City is decreasing from the middle to the surroundings. The results provide some basis for the field control and management of urban flood disaster.

We analyzed the effects of a range of land-use and climate-change disturbances on fine-scale canopy structure using a large database of profiling canopy lidar collected from disturbed and mature Amazon forest plots. At most of the disturbed sites, surveys were conducted 10-30 years after disturbance, with many exhibiting signs of recovery. Structural impacts differed in magnitude more than in character among disturbance types, producing a gradient of impacts. Structural changes were highly coordinated in a manner consistent across disturbance types, indicating commonalities in regeneration pathways. At the most severely affected site - burned igapo (seasonally flooded forest) - no signs of canopy regeneration were observed, indicating a sustained alteration of microclimates and consequently greater vulnerability to transitioning to a more open-canopy, savanna-like state. Notably, disturbances rarely shifted forests beyond the natural background of structural variation within mature plots, highlighting the similarities between anthropogenic and natural disturbance regimes, and indicating a degree of resilience among Amazon forests. Studying diverse disturbance types within an integrated analytical framework builds capacity to predict the risk of degradation-driven forest transitions.

There is little information about their distribution pattern and carbon stocks in the Andean-Amazonian piedmonts. We studied four palm peat swamp forests of different types in two localities with different management, in the piedmont of the Alto Mayo Valley in San Martin Region, Peru. M. flexuosa showed an aggregated distribution (standardised Morisita index) and statistically significant differences in abundance and density between the four forests. The average above-ground carbon stocks of these palm forests were estimated at 61.5 Mg ha-1 (41.4-85.0 Mg ha-1), with M. flexuosa contributing 45.4 %. In the locality that was managed for conservation (Tingana), the above-ground carbon stocks were 77.9-85.0 Mg ha-1, and thus approximately double those in the locality (Posic) with strong anthropic pressure (41.3-42.3 Mg ha-1).

A multitude of technologies have been employed with varying methodologies in order to accomplish the task of flood risk prediction. From the class of all such technologies, Machine Learning is established as the most robust and effective. In this paper, four optimized Support Vector Classifier models were developed with four different kernels to find the best performing Support Vector Classifier variant in predicting the flood risk in one of the Himalayan Rivers, Jhelum. Furthermore, other three Machine Learning models, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Process Classifier and Logistic Regression were developed and assessed in comparison with the optimal Support Vector Classifier variant. The Support Variant Classifier with the Radial Basis Function kernel achieved ROC/AUC score of 0.855, Recall 0.945, Precision 0.73, and F1 score of 0.79. These scores establish that this variant outperformed its other three variants and the above-mentioned three Machine Learning models.	[Mirza, I; Khader, P.

The purpose of this paper is to present a methodology for deriving a Design Flood hydrograph considering the epistemic uncertainty. Several appropriately identified statistical distributions allow for the acceptable approximation of the frequent values of maximum discharges or flood volumes, and display a significant spread for their medium/low Probabilities of Exceedance (PE). The referred scattering, as a consequence of epistemic uncertainty, defines an area of uncertainty for both recorded data and extrapolated values. In considering the upper and lower values of the uncertainty intervals as limits for maximum discharges and flood volumes, and by further combining them compatibly, a set of DFs as completely defined hydrographs with different shapes result for each PE. The herein proposed procedure defines both uni-modal and multi-modal DFs. Subsequently, such DFs help water managers in examining and establishing tailored approaches for a variety of input hydrographs, which might be typically generated in river basins.

J	Wehner, M; Sampson, C				Wehner, Michael; Sampson, Christopher			Attributable human-induced changes in the magnitude of flooding in the Houston, Texas region during Hurricane Harvey	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Hurricane Harvey; Flooding; Global warming; Economic cost of climate change	CLIMATE	The human influence on precipitation during tropical cyclones due to the global warming is now well documented in the literature. Several studies have found increases in Hurricane Harvey's total precipitation over the Greater Houston area ranging from the Clausius-Clapeyron limit of 7% to as much as 38% locally. Here we use a hydraulic model to translate these attribution statements about precipitation to statements about the resultant flooding and associated damages. We find that while the attributable increase in the total volume of flood waters is the same as the attributable increase in precipitation, the attributable increase in the total area of the flood is less. However, we also find that in the most heavily flooded parts of Houston, the local attributable increases in flood area and volume are substantially larger than the increase in total precipitation. The results of this storyline attribution analysis of the Houston flood area are used to make an intuitive best estimate of the cost of Hurricane Harvey attributable to anthropogenic global warming as thirteen billion US dollars.

In order to deal with natural hazards effectively, it is important to build a cooperative network between government organizations and social organizations. The social network analysis method is adopted, the April 2013 Ya'an China earthquake is taken as a case study, the institutionalized emergency organization network before the disaster and the actual response organization network after the disaster are analyzed, and centrality, between centrality, closeness centrality and core-periphery are calculated. Through qualitative and quantitative research, the functions of social organization in the process of natural hazards emergency relief are revealed, the role orientation of social organization in the emergency management network is analyzed, and the influence factors of the social organization participation in the natural hazards relief is pointed out. Research results will help to promote the cooperation between social organization and government, and improve the efficiency of natural hazards emergency relief.

Overrun by averages: An empirical analysis into the consistency of social vulnerability components across multiple scales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Social vulnerability; Vulnerability indicators; Ecological fallacy; Disaster risk reduction; Nepal earthquake	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVELIHOODS; COMMUNITIES; INDICATORS; HAZARDS; COUNTY; FLOODS; INDEX; NEPAL	Social vulnerability indices have become widely accepted as key elements of disaster risk reduction (DRR) frameworks despite significant conceptual and technical concerns over their creation. Despite increasingly complex theorization, it remains commonplace to determine vulnerability dimensions by applying principal component or factor analysis on aggregated, sub-national level statistical data. The primary focus of this paper is in showing that social vulnerability dimensions derived from aggregate statistics may not be consistent with those derived at the household level. I first provide empirical support for this problem using household level micro-data from Nepal, then illustrate how differences in determined dimensions impact composite index creation at both household and regional levels. I show that qualitative differences in index components are not required to produce large magnitude changes or sign reversals in index scores. These findings raise questions over whether regional vulnerability components can be sufficiently represented with household characteristics. These results reiterate the necessity of addressing issues of scale in the development of empirical social vulnerability indicators.

Here, we propose an automated method for recognizing atmospheric rivers (ARs) in climate data using topological data analysis and machine learning. The method provides useful information about topological features (shape characteristics) and statistics of ARs. We illustrate this method by applying it to outputs of version 5.1 of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5.1) and the reanalysis product of the second Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2). An advantage of the proposed method is that it is threshold-free - there is no need to determine any threshold criteria for the detection method - when the spatial resolution of the climate model changes. Hence, this method may be useful in evaluating model biases in calculating AR statistics. Further, the method can be applied to different climate scenarios without tuning since it does not rely on threshold conditions. We show that the method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model and reanalysis output data.

Evaluating Flood Risk Reduction by Urban Blue-Green Infrastructure Using Insurance Data	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Extreme precipitation; Pluvial flooding; Best management practices (BMP); Green infrastructure (GI); Low impact development (LID); Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)	RUNOFF; STORMWATER; DAMAGE; ROOF; DRAINAGE; IMPACTS; SWEDEN; MALMO	One of many important features of blue-green infrastructure is the ability to lower flood risks by detention of stormwater. This ability of flood risk reduction has for the first time been evaluated with empirical data in this study. In 2014, Malmo, Sweden, was hit with extreme precipitation corresponding to a return period of 50-200years that led to severe pluvial flooding. This and other large events presented the opportunity to evaluate the efficiency of the 15-year-old stormwater system retrofit in the Augustenborg area (30ha). Blue-green infrastructure is widely promoted for climate change adaptation, making this unique case important in the discussion of the capabilities of the related technical solutions. The long-term trends showed less flood damage in Augustenborg than in similar neighborhoods that have conventional sewer systems (combined or separate), indicating a direct effect of the retrofit with stormwater control measures. Even though a few properties were flooded in Augustenborg, it was shown that the retrofitted stormwater system performed successfully during the extreme event in 2014.

Scenario analysis is often used to investigate potential SLR consequences, which can help stakeholders make informed decisions on climate change mitigation policies or guidelines. However, SLR scenario analysis requires considerable geospatial data analytics and repetitive execution of SLR models for alternative scenarios. Having to run SLR models many times for scenario analysis studies leads to heavy computational needs as well as a large investment of time and effort. This study explores the benefits of incorporating cyberinfrastructure technologies, represented by scientific workflows and high-performance computing, into spatially explicit SLR modeling. We propose a scientific workflow-driven approach to modeling the potential loss of marshland in response to different SLR scenarios. Our study area is the central South Carolina coastal region, USA. The scientific workflow approach allows for automating the geospatial data processing for SLR modeling, while repetitive modeling and data analytics are accelerated by leveraging high-performance and parallel computing. With support from automation and acceleration, this scientific workflow-driven approach allows us to conduct computationally intensive scenario analysis experiments to evaluate the impact of SLR on alternative land cover types including marshes and tidal flats as well as their spatial characteristics.

Reliable information is crucial to support decision-makers develop appropriate strategies to reduce flood risk. This article aims to develop a framework for assessing flood risk and adaptive capacity, based on a bottom-up approach, in Vietnam's Gianh River watershed. Flood risk was computed by combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability using hydrodynamic modeling and the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. The adaptive capacity of the population was assessed via interviews with 298 inhabitants. The results show that flood risk is high in areas with high population and construction density. Both the ability to access resources and communities' flood-risk perceptions are important factors in improving the capacity to adapt. This study can provide an important theoretical framework complementing the existing literature and supporting studies related to flood-risk management in the context of climate change and urbanization in other regions. The study also fills a gap in the knowledge of the negative effects of flooding. From a methodological standpoint, this study underlines the importance of using hydraulic models and socio-economic surveys in flood-risk management.

We evaluated the effect of climate/flood and biotic factors on the phenology of 80 Attalea phalerata palms over 1-year period. Bract emission and young leaves percentage were negatively correlated to accumulated rainfall. Inflorescence and leaf production occurred mainly in the dry season. Immature fruit was positively correlated with rainfall, showing that fruit development occurs during the rainy season. The production of flowers, unripe fruit, and young leaves were positively correlated to flooding. The production of infructescence, per palm, varied from 0 to 4 and 18% of the variance was explained by variables of stem diameter, number of new leaves, altitude, and flood amplitude. The number of infructescence increased for large palms and decreased for individuals subjected to high amplitudes of flooding. These findings reveal that phenological patterns of A. phalerata are driven by seasonal variation in rainfall and flooding. Furthermore, infructescence production can be predicted by plant size and this production is sensitive to variations in flood amplitude. Alteration in rainfall and flooding due to climate change may have a negative impact on fruit production if extreme events increase in frequency.

As flood vulnerability assessment is a valuable tool for enhancing the resilience of bridges to climate change, it is of interest to push the development of such methods. To this end, a computationally efficient methodology to assess the flood vulnerability of a bridge was developed and implemented in a case study. A particular focus was devoted to modelling wood debris loads on the bridge pier, for which two different approaches were implemented. The first is a standards-based approach, whereas the second is based on up-to-date research data. The results indicate that the second approach is less conservative as it leads up to a 40% higher exceedance probability for the considered limit states. The interaction between wood debris loads and local scour was also examined and proved to have a relevant impact on the vulnerability of the bridge. These results highlight the shortcomings of the existing standards in providing accurate results. It is perceived that not only will the new quantitative tool be valuable in ensuring optimal bridge design, but it will also be beneficial for assessing bridge risk mitigation measures.

Many studies have noted that decreasing the urban flood vulnerability (UFV) is an indispensable strategy for reducing flood risks; however, some studies have several pertinent assessment limitations. The objective of this study is to assess the UFV of the Xuanwu-Qinhuai-Jianye-Gulou-Yuhua (XQJGY) region from 2012 to 2018 by integrating various indicators into a composite index. This study uses the environment for visualizing images (ENVI) and the geographic information system (GIS) to extract indicators that have geographic attributes for the assessment of UFV and the process analysis method is then used to explore the relationship between these indicators. The results indicated that: (1) The UFV of Xuanwu, Qinhuai, and Gulou decreased from 2012 to 2018 and the UFV of Jianye and Gulou increased from 2012 to 2015 and decreased from 2015 to 2018. (2) The vegetation coverage, precipitation during the flood season, population density, and highway density significantly contributed to the UFV. (3) There also exist transformation pathways between the indicators that led to vulnerability in five districts. This study provides a theoretical basis for the government to manage floods.

The model operates through a conceptual model that includes environmental parameters such as Photosynthesis Index (NDVI), Soil Depth Index (TWI) and Canopy Height Model (CHM). The model is verified by the IPPC Tier-2 method, which can effectively construct the distribution of watershed-scale forest carbon stock. The spatial distribution of carbon fluxes can be obtained from the carbon stock information of the two periods. The carbon flux index can be used to describe the distribution of carbon stocks and carbon emissions in the watershed, and then the location of negative carbon flux (vegetation degradation) can be extracted as a value-added application of vegetation restoration hotspots. The accuracy of the model estimation in forest land verification is high, reaching a significant level of 0.1%, which can faithfully reflect the carbon stock of forest land. However, in non -forest lands, carbon stock estimates tend to exhibit carbon storage potential due to land-use disturbances. A combination of conceptual models and environmental indicators is of great help in assessing watershed carbon stocks and fluxes.

However, most crops are not tolerant to extreme climatic environments. The aim in the near future, in a world with hunger and an increasing population, is to breed and/or engineer crops to tolerate abiotic stress with a higher yield. Some crop varieties display a certain degree of tolerance, which has been exploited by plant breeders to develop varieties that thrive under stress conditions. Moreover, a long list of genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance have been identified and characterized by molecular techniques and overexpressed individually in plant transformation experiments. Nevertheless, stress tolerance phenotypes are polygenetic traits, which current genomic tools are dissecting to exploit their use by accelerating genetic introgression using molecular markers or site-directed mutagenesis such as CRISPR-Cas9. In this review, we describe plant mechanisms to sense and tolerate adverse climate conditions and examine and discuss classic and new molecular tools to select and improve abiotic stress tolerance in major crops.

Yet the surge in global demand for plastics of the growing world population has triggered a tidal wave of plastic debris in the environment. Moving from a linear to a zero-waste and carbon-neutral circular plastic economy is vital for the future of the planet. Taming the plastic waste flood requires closing the carbon loop through plastic reuse, mechanical and molecular recycling, carbon capture, and use of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. In the quest for eco-friendly products, plastics do not need to be reinvented but tuned for reuse and recycling. Their full potential must be exploited regarding energy, resource, and eco-efficiency, waste prevention, circular economy, climate change mitigation, and lowering environmental pollution. Biodegradation holds promise for composting and bio-feedstock recovery, but it is neither the Holy Grail of circular plastics economy nor a panacea for plastic littering. As an alternative to mechanical downcycling, molecular recycling enables both closed-loop recovery of virgin plastics and open-loop valorization, producing hydrogen, fuels, refinery feeds, lubricants, chemicals, and carbonaceous materials. Closing the carbon loop does not create a Perpetuum Mobile and requires renewable energy to achieve sustainability.

One approach increasingly used in crisis management is preventive mass evacuation. However, to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of such strategy can be complex, especially in large urban areas. Modeling approaches, and in particular agent-based models, are used to support implementation and to explore a large range of evacuation strategies, which is impossible through drills. One major limitation with simulation of traffic based on individual mobility models is their capacity to reproduce a context of mixed traffic. In this paper, we propose an agent-based model with the capacity to overcome this limitation. We simulated and compared different spatio-temporal evacuation strategies in the flood-prone landlocked area of the Phuc Xa district in Hanoi. We demonstrate that the interaction between distribution of transport modalities and evacuation strategies greatly impact evacuation outcomes. More precisely, we identified staged strategies based on the proximity to exit points that make it possible to reduce time spent on road and overall evacuation time. In addition, we simulated improved evacuation outcomes through selected modification of the road network.

This includes policies aiming at making space for rivers, which, in practice, lead to an increasing demand for land. Although research has been conducted on the variety of policies, the resulting land use conflicts in flood-prone areas have not been paid much attention to. This paper therefore analyses the current land use and its changes in Alpine flood-prone areas in Austria. The results show that space for rivers has been decreasing due to human activities (e.g., river straightening and channel narrowing) since the middle of the 19th century, and settlements have been expanding into flood-prone areas. Furthermore, the share of valuable agricultural land (which is important for food production) located in flood hazard zones is higher in more mountainous areas. Given the limited space for permanent settlement in Alpine regions, these land use changes exert pressure on the availability of land suitable for flood risk management. Therefore, making space for rivers as part of flood risk management policies faces considerable restrictions in Alpine areas.

These events show the vulnerabilities of our cities to extreme conditions, mainly displayed as flash wadi flooding as a result of a short duration of intensive and eroded its shoreline along the coast, resulting in huge impacts, including human losses and urban and infrastructural damages. This study used the urban flood risk mitigation model through an open-source tool-Integrated Evaluation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-off (InVEST)-to estimate the amount of runoff due to two extreme rainfall events for each watershed considered. We used a digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) to quantify the Al Khaboura shoreline erosion as a result of Shaheen's storm surge. With the DSAS, the model showed that, during the short period of the event, the Al Khaboura coastal line was eroded by 16.33 m/y, representing 7.82% of its coastal line, up to a maximum erosion distance of 1428.5 m. The weighted linear regression showed the average mean rate of shoreline change of 6.79 m/y. These models could provide a clear picture of the city vulnerability to allow us to propose a corrective measure for interventions at local and regional scales.

In this paper we identify the short-run impacts of storms and floods on firm growth in labor, capital, and sales, using Enterprise Census data (2000-2014) for Vietnam. We define storms and floods with three different disaster measures: physical intensities, number of deaths, and economic damage. The performance of these disaster measures is compared by estimating dynamic growth models using the Blundell-Bond system generalized method of moments. We find evidence that flooding increases labor growth and capital growth but reduces sales growth significantly up to 3 years after flooding. We also find some evidence of positive impacts on labor growth and capital growth but mostly negative impacts on sales growth for storms within 3 years after storms strike. The impacts of floods and storms on firm growth are more pronounced and persistent for small and medium sized firms. Finally, unlike at the macro level, the direction and scale of disaster impacts found at the firm level are fairly consistent across the three disaster measures.

This study investigated the intraseasonal evolution and climatic characteristics of precipitation during the rainy season in the Poyang Lake Basin under the background of climate change. On the basis of the precipitation pattern, the rainy season was divided into three stages: the spring rainy season, Meiyu season, and summer rainy season. Generally, total precipitation and precipitation hours showed no significant trends of change, whereas precipitation intensity had an obvious trend of increase. In the spring rainy season, the trend of total precipitation was downward but not significant; however, owing to substantial reduction in precipitation duration, precipitation intensity was enhanced significantly. In the Meiyu season (summer rainy season), total precipitation increased significantly because of increased precipitation duration (precipitation intensity). The spatial distributions of total precipitation in the spring rainy season and Meiyu season were similar, i.e., precipitation occurred mostly in the east and less in the west; however, the spatial distributions of the change trends were opposite. In the summer rainy season, precipitation was concentrated primarily in the surrounding mountainous areas.

By using formal instruments, spatial planning can (i) legally secure areas for flood retention or other flood protection measures (hazard reduction) as well as (ii) regulate settlement development in hazard areas and ensure flood-adapted land uses (damage prevention). The interrelations between upstream and downstream riparian areas in flood risk management, however, require regional or catchment-oriented approaches in strategic land use planning to better coordinate land development options along rivers. This paper examines two strategic planning instruments in Austrian flood risk management. The two instruments - Blauzone Rheintal in Vorarlberg and Schutzwasserwirtschaftlicher Raumentwicklungsplan (SREP) in Carinthia - were developed by water authorities and spatial planning departments to prevent settlement growth in flood-prone areas and to secure land for flood protection schemes. Despite having similar problems in their backgrounds and objectives, the implementation processes of these instruments differ significantly: while the Blauzone Rheintal was formalized as a legally binding regional land use plan, the SREP was not developed beyond the pilot stage. This paper identifies important contextual conditions and lessons learned to facilitate the scaling-up and replication of catchment-oriented spatial planning instruments in other flood-prone regions.

J	Maurel, C; Nacry, P				Maurel, Christophe; Nacry, Philippe			Root architecture and hydraulics converge for acclimation to changing water availability	NATURE PLANTS			English	Article							ABSCISIC-ACID; INTEGRATED APPROACH; LATERAL ROOTS; MAIZE; SYSTEM; ARABIDOPSIS; RESPONSES; STRESS; GROWTH; CONDUCTANCE	One consequence of climate change is an increased frequency of flood and drought episodes. This Perspective explores how water availability regulates root architecture and water transport capacity (hydraulics), from sensing mechanisms to novel responses. Because of intense transpiration and growth, the needs of plants for water can be immense. Yet water in the soil is most often heterogeneous if not scarce due to more and more frequent and intense drought episodes. The converse context, flooding, is often associated with marked oxygen deficiency and can also challenge the plant water status. Under our feet, roots achieve an incredible challenge to meet the water demand of the plant's aerial parts under such dramatically different environmental conditions. For this, they continuously explore the soil, building a highly complex, branched architecture. On shorter time scales, roots keep adjusting their water transport capacity (their so-called hydraulics) locally or globally. While the mechanisms that directly underlie root growth and development as well as tissue hydraulics are being uncovered, the signalling mechanisms that govern their local and systemic adjustments as a function of water availability remain largely unknown. A comprehensive understanding of root architecture and hydraulics as a whole (in other terms, root hydraulic architecture) is needed to apprehend the strategies used by plants to optimize water uptake and possibly improve crops regarding this crucial trait.

The study has incorporated eight criteria, namely, flow accumulation, draining capability, elevation, groundwater depth, land use, runoff coefficient, slope, and geology for preparing hazard index. The weights of the criteria were obtained through the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method based on their relative importance for occurring floods. Finally, a flood hazard index (FHI) was prepared by combining the parameter ratings and corresponding weights. The credibility of the present methodology was tested through validation with the satellite-based inundation map of August 20, 2016. A normalized difference water index (NDWI) was prepared from Landsat-8 OLI data and the inundated area was delineated by a binary classification of NDWI based on a threshold calculated following Otsu's method. The analysis found 81% of inundation is associated with high to very high flood hazard zones. Agricultural land is more prone to flood than other land use types. The results showed that the GIS-based multi-criteria analysis framework could be effectively applied for flood hazard analysis to support decision making in disaster management.

Up-to-date monitoring on the distribution of flood hazards in cities is necessary and valuable for urban planning. This research combines two common urban flooding approaches, namely hydraulic and GIS models, in a case study of London, Ontario, Canada. The hydraulic-GIS combined model employs the hydraulic concept in a simplified GIS frame, hence avoiding heavy computation in the hydraulic model and arbitrary coefficients in a GIS model. We used a binary logistic regression model to integrate the hydraulic concept in a GIS model. The multi-criteria GIS model built by binary logistic regression was able to simulate the results from the hydraulic model with good consistency. Such a strategy serves as a promising prototype for addressing similar geographical modelling issues, where the time-consuming physical model can be potentially replaced by a simplified GIS model. Furthermore, the impervious surface percentage is an important input in the hydraulic model. This research experimented different impervious surface percentages as input to the hydraulic model and found that a spatially variable impervious surface percentage achieves better agreement with hydraulic modelling than that of uniform (25% and 42%) impervious surface percentages.

In this study, a type of stepped spillway dropshaft suitable for drainage by deep tunnels in Chengdu was proposed and the hydraulic characteristics were investigated experimentally. The results showed that the nappe flow and strong turbulent deflected jet flow in the stepped spillway allowed the dropshaft to greatly dissipate energy. According to the distribution of the time-averaged pressure on the steps, the flow on the steps could be divided into a recirculating region, a wall-impinging region and a mixing region. The time-averaged pressure on the outside of the step was higher than that on the inside due to the centrifugal force effect of the water. The fluctuating pressure distribution of the step approximated the normal distribution. It was acceptable to calculate the minimum pressure with 3 times the root mean square (RMS). The vibration of the flow on the stepped spillway did not resonate with the step. When the outflow tunnel was under submerged outflow conditions, the aeration in the stepped spillway was exhausted through air holes and only a small amount of air entered the outflow tunnel, thereby avoiding an air explosion.

Adaptation strategies to environmental and policy change in semi-arid pastoral landscapes: Evidence from Ngamiland, Botswana	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Socio-ecological system; Land fragmentations; Climate variability; Vulnerability; Adaptive capacity; Coping strategies	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; INSTITUTIONS; LIVELIHOODS; COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; MARGINS	Semi-arid rangeland pastoral areas have been affected by diverse pressures; livestock diseases, human-wildlife conflicts, droughts and resource scarcity as a result of fragmented landscapes that constrain pastoral livelihoods. In Botswana, pastoralists' adaptations remain insufficiently documented. Adaptation strategies are responses to livelihood constraints and if mainstreamed into development programmes can counter negative impacts arising from ecosystem deterioration. Using iterative participatory rural appraisal methods, this study examines adaptation strategies that pastoral societies in Ngamiland, Botswana have used to cope with pressures in their pastoral socio-ecological system. Findings show a move towards mixed and spatially varied livelihood strategies. Mixed agro-pastoral farming, intensification of flood recession farming, fishing and a network of self-help groups have developed over the last few decades of significant policy and environmental change. Pastoralists have become more sedentary with increases in petty trade and higher dependency on social welfare programmes. As the ability to adapt has positive attributes for livelihood sustainability and resilience, there is a need for practical initiatives that improve pastoralists' adaptive capacity, such as reforming pastoralists' institutions and expanding infrastructural development in pastoral areas so as to enable access to markets. These also include the need to share insights more widely across the district, nationally and regionally.

The following variables were analyzed: precipitation and evaporation, both annual and daily maximum, as well as average and maximum temperatures. Likewise, the incidence of extreme hydrometeorological events associated to these climatological variables, such as floods and droughts, was analyzed. The floods are associated with greater rainfall the years, as well as the magnitude of the maximum daily rainfall events. The droughts are associated to the years with lower rainfall as well as extreme temperatures and extreme daily evaporation rates. The dry and rainy years are related to the presence of the global climatic phenomena of El Nino and La Nina. Annual precipitation and evaporation as well as the annual average temperature show an increasing trend. The extreme events of daily precipitation were presented from 2005 to 2013; the evaporation from 2001 to 2008; and of temperature from 1997 to 2006, corresponding to years with drought. The year with the maximum extreme rainfall event was recorded in 2006. The highest rate of daily evaporation occurred in 1970 and the highest maximum temperature occurred in the years 1997 to 1998. Thus, since 1997, droughts and floods have occurred more frequently and intensively in the region.

J	Jha, RK; Gundimeda, H				Jha, Rupak Kumar; Gundimeda, Haripriya			An integrated assessment of vulnerability to floods using composite index - A district level analysis for Bihar, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood; Vulnerability index; Bihar; Moran's I; Spatial mapping	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; NATURAL HAZARDS; UTTAR-PRADESH; FRAMEWORK; HOTSPOTS; ODISHA	Vulnerability assessment using composite indices provides critical information for the policymakers on why certain regions are impacted more than the others. Several researchers have assessed the vulnerability to hazard in diverse spatial and environmental settings, however, not many studies have assessed the vulnerability to flood hazards in Bihar, where flooding is a perennial event. The objective of this paper is to assess the vulnerability of the flood affected districts by integrating various indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity into a composite index using principal component analysis. This study normalizes and aggregates across the sub-indices and combines this information with Geographic Information Systems to illustrate the social vulnerability to floods. The vulnerability index estimated in this study indicates that: 1) Bihar is highly vulnerable to floods, with north Bihar especially being more vulnerable due to recurrent flooding; and 2) there is a strong spatial pattern among the vulnerable districts. The comparison across the districts reflects that strong biophysical as well as social factors dominate and determine the varying degrees of vulnerability among the districts of Bihar. The study highlights the need to address the disaster prevention, risk reduction, and mitigation measures, as well as the endpoints to enhance the capability of adaptation to floods by the affected community.

Yet, societies experience a wide range of outcomes when facing such challenges: some suffer from social unrest, civil violence or complete collapse; others prove more resilient and maintain key social functions. We currently lack a clear, generally agreed-upon conceptual framework and evidentiary base to explore what causes these divergent outcomes. Here, we discuss efforts to develop such a framework through the Crisis Database (CrisisDB) programme. We illustrate that the impact of environmental stressors is mediated through extant cultural, political and economic structures that evolve over extended timescales (decades to centuries). These structures can generate high resilience to major shocks, facilitate positive adaptation, or, alternatively, undermine collective action and lead to unrest, violence and even societal collapse. By exposing the ways that different societies have reacted to crises over their lifetime, this framework can help identify the factors and complex social-ecological interactions that either bolster or undermine resilience to contemporary climate shocks.This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change adaptation needs a science of culture'.

J	Takeuchi, M				Takeuchi, Masahiko			Current status of apples damaged by natural disasters and problems with utilization of damaged fruits	JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE SOCIETY FOR FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-NIPPON SHOKUHIN KAGAKU KOGAKU KAISHI			Chinese	Article						Apple; Natural Disasters; Damaged Fruits; Utilization		Concerns about damage to agricultural products due to global warming are increasing year by year. In apple cultivation, high temperatures cause defects in color and other characteristics, and warm weather in winter causes a decrease in cold resistance, which is associated with damage due to low temperatures and frost. In addition, damage due to storms and floods occurs frequently. In Nagano Prefecture, various fruit varieties are cultivated using a relay system. Therefore, harvesting is intermittent from July to December. Since the 'rate of maturation varies among cultivars, the degree of maturity and degree of damage also differ depending on the timing of the occurrence of natural disasters. Most harvested fruits are immature, and there are many problems with food safety and taste. On the other hand, immature fruits contain a lot of polyphenols, which are used as functional materials. Regarding climate change countermeasures, advances have been made in terms of forecasting, prevention, items, varieties, and cultivation techniques. However, no progress has been made in examining ways to use damaged agricultural products. In the future, it will be necessary for national and local governments, production areas, and processors to work together to examine the safety and utilization of damaged agricultural products.

The occurrence of flood risk is due to a combination of natural and man-made variables, necessitating a better knowledge of its spatial scope. The goal of this study is to locate and map flood-prone regions in the Cheliff-Ghrib watershed. Within the ArcGIS interface, this study is based on the integration of multi-criteria data such as slope, drainage density, type of soil, rainfall, population density, land use and sewer system density. For flood risk assessment and mapping, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was employed as a multi-criteria analysis, allowing the integration of numerous factors under two criteria namely, hazards and vulnerability. The AHP flood risk map reveals that areas at high and extremely high risk of flooding cover 22.5% of the study area. According to the findings, the Cheliff-Ghrib watershed is extremely vulnerable to flooding. Eight of the Chelliff-Ghrib watershed's 15 municipalities (8/15) are at high risk of flooding, necessitating the development of efficient flood mitigation solutions for future flood events.

Multi-Level Monte Carlo Models for Flood Inundation Uncertainty Quantification	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						flood hazard; uncertainty quantification; multi-level Monte Carlo; climate change	RISK; CLIMATE; OPTIONS	Flood events are the most commonly occurring natural disaster, with over 5 million properties at risk in the UK alone. Changes in the global climate are expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of flood events. Flood hazard assessments, using climate projections as input, guide policy decisions and engineering projects to reduce the impact of large return period events. Probabilistic flood modeling is required to take into account uncertainties in climate model projections. However, the dichotomous relationship between probabilistic modeling, computational cost and model resolution limits the applicability of such techniques. This paper examines improvements to traditional Monte Carlo methods using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) to quantify the uncertainty in flood extent resulting from input hydrograph uncertainty. The results demonstrate that MLMC is a more efficient modeling strategy than current methods (i.e., traditional Monte Carlo) with high resolution outputs produced in less time than previously possible. The novel application of MLMC technique to three Scottish case studies, demonstrating a variety of river characteristics, domain sizes and computational costs, using a high resolution 5 m grid resulted in a 99.2% reduction in computational cost compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods and up to 2.3 times speedup over Latin Hypercube Sampling.

Sporobolus cynosuroides (L.) P.M. Peterson & Saarela = Spartina cynosuroides (L.) Roth is a temperate zone rhizomatous grass that often is a dominant species in coastal brackish marshes on the Gulf coast and Atlantic coasts of the United States where salinity ranges from 0 to 10 psu. Sporobolus cynosuroides (L.) P.M. Peterson & Saarela = Spartina cynosuroides (L.) Roth is usually absent where salinity values are .12 psu. Sporobolus cynosuroides occurs in coastal habitats characterized by infrequent tidal flooding and moderate nutrient levels. Also known as big cordgrass, it may account for net productivity in high marshes that rivals productivity of Sporobolus alterniflorus = Spartina alterniflora the dominant species in saline low marsh environments. Sporobolus cynosuroides and a limited number of cohorts are threatened by climate change and rising sea levels. This species provides important ecological services. In addition, S. cynosurodes provides cover and nutrition for wildlife, and has fair forage potential for livestock.

Urban Pluvial Flood Management Part 2: Global Perceptions and Priorities in Urban Stormwater Adaptation Management and Policy Alternatives	WATER			English	Article						rainfall management; stormwater; urban adaptation; multi-criteria decision analysis; green infrastructure	GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; CLIMATE ADAPTATION; RANK REVERSAL; RISK; CRITERIA; JUSTICE; SYSTEMS; CITIES; CITY	Urban stormwater infrastructure is at an increased risk of being overwhelmed by pluvial flood events due to climate change. Currently, there are no global standards or frameworks for approaching urban rainfall adaptation policy. Such standards or frameworks would allow cities that have limited time, finances or research capacities to make more confident adaptation policy decisions based on a globally agreed theoretical basis. Additionally, while adaptation via blue-green infrastructure is often weighed against traditional grey infrastructure approaches, its choice must be considered within the context of additional policy alternatives involved in stormwater management. Using six global and developed cities, we explore to what extent a standardized hierarchy of urban rainfall adaptation techniques can be established through a combined Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. While regional and stakeholder differences emerge, our study demonstrates that green infrastructure undertaken by public bodies are the top policy alternative across the cities and stakeholder groups, and that there exists some consensus on best management practice techniques for urban stormwater adaptation.

Exploratory research was applied to gain knowledge of flood risk management to embed the disaster risk reduction, mitigation, and adaptation strategies at the local government and community level. Around 200 questionnaires were collected from the four devastated areas/union councils. Primary data from the field uncovered flood risk management practices by organizations, local government, and the community. It highlights resilience-building practices undertaken by the community through rehabilitation, community participation, and local indigenous practices. The role of the District Layyah's local government and organizations to mitigate the 2010 flood and their contribution towards flood resilience in affected communities was investigated, as no comparable studies were carried out in the riverine belt of District Layyah previously. Moreover, the tangible and non-tangible measures to lessen the vulnerability to floods and improve flood risk governance at a local level were identified. This study makes a valuable contribution in strengthening the resilience building of vulnerable communities by recommending few changes in existing practices concerning flood risk at a local level.

An earlier onset of seasonal snowmelt as a consequence of a warming climate is often expected to shift snowmelt contribution to river runoff and potential flooding to an earlier date. Against this background, we assess the impact of rising temperatures on seasonal snowpacks and quantify changes in timing, magnitude and elevation of snowmelt. We analyse in situ snow measurements, conduct snow simulations and examine changes in river runoff at key gauging stations. With regard to snowmelt, we detect a threefold effect of rising temperatures: snowmelt becomes weaker, occurs earlier and forms at higher elevations. Due to the wide range of elevations in the catchment, snowmelt does not occur simultaneously at all elevations. Results indicate that elevation bands melt together in blocks. We hypothesise that in a warmer world with similar sequences of weather conditions, snowmelt is moved upward to higher elevation. The movement upward the elevation range makes snowmelt in individual elevation bands occur earlier, although the timing of the snowmelt-induced runoff stays the same. Meltwater from higher elevations, at least partly, replaces meltwater from elevations below.

Moreover, food availability is affected by economic challenges especially a weakening of foreign exchange and fiscal revenues, which has reduced the rate of food importation and increased local prices. Furthermore, the geometric increase in population especially in the last five decades has placed enormous pressure on the limited food resources, making it more challenging for agricultural and food systems to sustainably meet local food needs. Put together, these indices are contributing significantly to undernourishment. The huge local legume resources if properly harnessed can contribute toward addressing food insecurity. However, most of the legumes are included in the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization list of underutilized crops. Also, there is an over-reliance on food high in calorie in Nigeria, which is discouraged by nutritionists worldwide. Plant-based protein from legumes is necessary for effective metabolism and human wellbeing. This work highlights the benefits of the sustainable utilization of neglected and underutilized legume resources in Nigeria. The work discusses potential solutions for food insecurity as well as avenues for improving human nutrition and wellbeing.

Numerical analysis of dam-break waves propagating over dry and wet beds by the mesh-free method	OCEAN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Mesh-free method; Dam-break wave; Free surface; Wavefront movement		Climate change increases the probability of dam-break flooding, making the prediction of flooding zone and dam-break wave crucial for the evacuation of people in hazardous areas. However, the propagation of dam-break waves can be affected by different downstream bed conditions such as obstacles, dry and wet beds. In this study, a mesh-free method is employed to simulate dam-break wave spreading in different bed configurations. The mesh-free method is good at capturing the free surface in the dam-break flow. In the numerical method, an explicit calculation for the pressure field is used and the spatial operators are based on the Moving Particle Semi-implicit method (MPS). The mesh-free method is validated to simulate the dam-break flow by comparing to available experimental measurements. The validated method is then used to simulate the dam-break wave propagating over the downstream wet beds with different depths. The effect from the combination of dry and wet bed for the dam-break wave is also investigated by the mesh-free method. In the simulations, the flow characteristics including free surface, flow pattern, and wavefront movement, and bed shear stress are presented and discussed.

We conceptualise factors involved in the governance of insurance value provision, drawing on the notions of protection and insurance, exogeneity and endogeneity, and allocation of rights and responsibilities. Using riverine floods and forest pest outbreaks as examples, we explore the challenges of governing ecosystem-based risk management. We suggest that such governance should build on existing institutions, because insurance value is jointly produced with provisioning ecosystem services and the governance arrangements for them importantly shape insurance value provision. However, existing institutional arrangements do not acknowledge involved actors' rights and responsibilities and they do not facilitate landscape level management of risks. While PES schemes and other market-like solutions may govern the provision of insurance value when transaction costs and trade-offs between the provision of insurance value and private goods are low, regulation or public provision is needed when transaction costs and trade-offs are high. The complexity of challenges in governing the provision of insurance value highlights the need for polycentric governance involving collaboration, knowledge creation and dissemination and the funding of activities needed for them.

Because it is likely that Cahokia's decline was precipitated by multiple factors, some environmental and some societal, a robust understanding of this phenomenon will require multiple lines of evidence along with a refined chronology. Here, we use fecal stanol data from Horseshoe Lake, Illinois, as a population proxy for Cahokia and the broader Horseshoe Lake watershed. We directly compare the fecal stanol data with oxygen stable-isotope and paleoenvironmental data from the same sediment cores to evaluate the role of flooding, drought, and environmental degradation in Cahokia's demographic decline and sociopolitical reorganization. We find that Mississippi River flooding and warm season droughts detrimental to agriculture occurred circa (ca.) 1150 CE and possibly generated significant stress for Cahokia's inhabitants. Our findings implicate climate change during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly to Little Ice Age transition as an important component of population and sociopolitical transformations at Cahokia, and demonstrate how climate transitions can simultaneously influence multiple environmental processes to produce significant challenges to society.

The study firstly identifies the variables expressing insurance data and those explaining them, together with their interrelationships. Damage variables may be expressed as either monetary-based or number of claims-based. Explaining variables may be subdivided into four categories: meteorological, geographic, demographic and property/building-based. Most of the common and under-researched combinations of these variables and their expression are discussed. Secondly, a comparative analysis is presented of current models, highlighting their differences and similarities. The study demonstrates that the scope and approach of the models varies in relation to scale, the coverage and period of incorporated insurance claims, and the methods used for model development and validation. Thirdly, the study proposes a generic and adaptable framework, constructed from an aggregation of information contained in relevant literature, to define a work-flow for model development and future deployment. The study concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing model development and opportunities for deployment.

This advantage makes of the insight extracted from text-based documents (e.g., reports and news) on water-related events an invaluable source of information that complements traditional approaches. By leveraging machine learning, we can not only characterize the event and determine its magnitude or phases of extreme weather event, but also identify its core elements. This is especially crucial in the current era of climate change, where extreme weather events such as floods or thunderstorms are becoming more frequent and unpredictable. By improving our ability to detect and analyse such events, we can enhance our alert systems and take more effective action to mitigate their impact. In this paper we discuss the role of worldwide media observation in extracting and estimating hydrological characteristics of floods, droughts, and heat waves, through the analysis of three case studies, complementing the information provided by traditional monitoring and measurement methods as an earlier but weaker signal. The results presented in this study indicate that the news media signal can be regarded as relatively good proxy of flood dynamics. It can capture the temporal dynamics of the event, and, in some cases, there could be a clear up to 1-day lag between the peak discharge values (i.e., the most extreme flood situation) and the peak in the number of published news. This lag can be attributed to the time needed by journalists to respond to the situation in publishing related news articles covering the event. Our result show that national and regional news can cover well local events. When compared to floods, drought conditions are less explicitly detected from the media. Our result show that European April 2022 drought did not produce much activity in the media while the combination of drought and extreme heat in July 2022 yielded a significant media coverage throughout the Europe. Hence, this can be attributed to the fact that hydrological drought such as low river flows do not attract much attention by the media unless there is a significant impact on the society. Therefore, media signal can be regarded as a relatively good proxy of the hydro-meteorological conditions in case there is a significant impact on the society such as extreme floods causing many casualties and large economic damage.

Although a long-term slowdown of TCs has recently been reported, changes in translation distance of TCs over the western North Pacific (WNP) and their driving mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using multiple TC datasets, here we find that the trends are opposite in overland translation distance of landfall WNP TCs over China and excluding China, with the number of landfalls in the two groups being almost the same. However, the increase in overland translation distance of landfall TCs over China is offset by a greater decrease in that excluding China, with the result that the overland translation distance of TCs over the WNP has declined (-4.0% decade(-1)). The oversea translation distance of TCs over the WNP also shows a decreasing trend (-2.4% decade(-1)), and thus the genesis-to-demise translation distance of TCs over the WNP has significantly decreased (by 17.7%) during 1961-2019. The shorter duration and reduced translation speed of TCs directly and jointly contribute (by 76.9% and 23.1%, respectively) to their shortened translation distance. The gradual increase in westerly and northerly winds and weaker moisture transport during the days following TC generation tend to inhibit long-distance travel after TC genesis. Declining TC translation distance is likely associated with the long-term increases in genesis potential index and an anomalous cyclonic steering flow over the WNP. Our findings suggest that these changes in TC translation distance may alter regional patterns of TC-related drying and wetting of the WNP. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The spatial extent affected by a tropical cyclone (TC) is largely determined by TC translation distance. For example, TCs passing through marine areas could cool sea surface temperature and modulate local air-sea heat fluxes exchange; TCs with longer translation distances over land are more likely to trigger widespread flooding or terminate droughts in inland areas. Over the western North Pacific (WNP), we find that observational evidence supports opposite trends in overland translation distance of landfall TCs over China and excluding China. Nevertheless, the genesis-to-demise translation distance of TCs shows a significant decline over the WNP during the past six decades. Understanding the impacts of changes in TC translation distance has particular importance given the extensive footprint of TC-related drying and wetting of the marine and terrestrial areas.

They are influenced by unpredictable coastal hazards accentuated by the effects of climate change, and they can quickly be altered if critical thresholds are crossed. Additional pressures come from coastal activities and development, both of which attracting stakeholders with different perspectives and interests. While coastal defence measures (CDMs) have been implemented to mitigate coastal hazards for centuries, a lack of knowledge and tools available to make informed decision has led to coastal managers favouring the choice of seawalls or rock armours with little consideration for socio-ecological systems features, and stakeholders' priorities. Though it is not currently widely applied in coastal zone management, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a tool that can be useful to facilitate decision making. PROMETHEE, an outranking method, was chosen to support the multicriteria decision analysis for the evaluation of CDMs in the context of four study sites characterized by distinct environmental features. The aim was to determine the relevance and benefits of a MCDA by integrating coastal zone stakeholders in a participatory decision-making process in order to select CDMs that are better adapted to the whole socio-ecological system. First, in a series of five workshops, stakeholders were asked to identify and weigh criteria that were relevant to their local conditions. Second and third, CDMs were evaluated in relation to each criterion within the local context, then, hierarchized. Initial results show that vegetation came first in three of the four sites, while rock armour ranked first in the fourth site. A post-evaluation of the participatory process indicated that the weighting phase is an effective way to integrate local knowledge into the decision-making process, but the identification of criteria could be streamlined by the presentation of a predefined list from which participants could make a selection. This would ensure criteria that are standardized, and in a format that is compatible with the MCDA. Coupled with a participatory process MCDA proved to be a flexible methodology that can synthetize multiple aspects of the problem, and contribute in a meaningful way to the coastal engineering and management decision-making process.

Investigating the basic characteristics and changing trends of the streamflow of the Ganjiang River is scientifically important to mitigate drought and flood disasters in the future. This study reconstructed drought and flood grade series of five regional stations of the Ganjiang River based on spatially explicit and well-dated local chronicle materials and used a linear regression model of modern drought/flood grades and precipitation to reconstruct historical precipitation for the past 515 years. The relationships between the modern precipitation of five regional stations and streamflow of Waizhou Station, which is the last hydrological station of the Ganjiang River were analyzed through principal component regression. The adjusted R2 is 0.909, with a low relative bias of 1.82%. The variation of streamflow from AD 1500 to AD 2014 was reconstructed using the proposed model. Result shows that high flows occur in nine periods and low flows occur in 11 periods. Extremely low stream flow in 515 years appears during the middle and late 17th century. Cumulative anomaly and Mann-Kendall mutation test results reveal that a transition point from predominantly low to high flows occur in AD 1720. Redfit power spectrum analysis result shows that the variation periods of streamflow are 2-5, 7-8 years, and approximately 32 years, where the most significant period is 2-3 years. Continuous wavelet transform indicates that the corresponding relation occurs between streamflow and El Nino/Southern Oscillation for eight years. Strearnflow is affected by temperature and East Asian monsoon that is controlled by solar activities. The flood may be related to strong solar activity, monsoon failure, and vice versa. Hydrological frequency curve analysis shows that the streamflow of the Ganjiang River once in a hundred years may reach up to 1031 x 108 m3 for flood or 485 x 108 m3 for drought and the standard of once in a millennium runoff may reach up to 1188 x 108 m3 for flood or 450 x 108 m3 for drought. These results may provide basic hydrological data for the sustainable development of society and serve as a reference for mitigating the impact of drought and flood disasters in the future.

The Effect of Papyrus Wetlands on Flow Regulation in a Tropical River Catchment	LAND			English	Article						papyrus wetlands; hydrological regulating services; Wetland-Specific Index; flood flows; low flows	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; SATELLITE RAINFALL PRODUCTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CYPERUS-PAPYRUS; LONG-TERM; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; TEMPERATURE DATASETS; AFRICAN RAINFALL; BURKINA-FASO; EAST-AFRICA	Africa has the largest area of wetlands of international importance, and papyrus constitutes the most dominant species for many of these wetlands. This hydrological modelling study assesses and quantifies the impacts of these papyrus wetlands on historical baseflow and quickflow, as well as future flood and low flows in the Mpologoma catchment in Uganda. Assessment over the historic period shows that wetlands strongly attenuate quickflow while moderately enhancing baseflow. They play a moderating role in most months, except for the first dry season (June and July), due to the reversal of flows between wetlands and rivers that often occur during this period. Annual estimates show that wetlands are four times better at regulating quickflow than baseflow. Examination of changes at 2 and 4 degrees C global warming levels (GWLs) indicate that wetlands will play critical roles in mitigating flood risks, with a lesser role in supporting low flows. Wetlands are predicted to lower future mean flood magnitude by 5.2 and 7.8% at GWL2 and GWL4, respectively, as well as halving the average number of flood events in a year, irrespective of the warming level. This work shows that papyrus-dominated wetlands strongly influence catchment hydrology, with significant roles on quickflow, including floods, and highlights the need for their conservation and protection.

In arid and semi-arid river systems, waterholes are often the only refugia for aquatic organisms during no-flow spells. Sediment accumulation in waterholes reduces their persistence. Aims. To assess this threat, we surveyed the depth of, and dated, waterhole sediments from the Moonie River, a northern tributary of Australia's largest river system, the Murray-Darling Basin. Methods. Fine-sediment depth was determined in three of the deepest waterholes in 2010 and 2011 before, and after, the largest flood in over a century. The rate of sediment build up in two waterholes was also determined. Key results. In the deepest sections (>75th percentile depth), there was between 0.7 and 2 m of fine sediment in 2010. Following flooding, sediment depth reduced by 24-54%, with the largest proportional reductions in sediment occurring in the shallowest waterhole. However, net sediment accumulation is still 1.4-2.0 cm year(-1) since the 1950s. Conclusions. Sedimentation has reduced the persistence of the deepest waterholes by over 200 days, representing an up to 30% reduction. During the longest droughts known in the Moonie River, this would dry many otherwise permanent waterholes. Implications. Sedimentation is a marked threat to waterhole persistence even following large floods.

'We are at the mercy of the floods!' : Extreme weather events, disrupted mobilities, and everyday navigation in urban Ghana	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						extreme weather; flooding; everyday mobility; Accra; Tamale; Ghana	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVELIHOODS; CITY; MIGRATION; LANDSLIDE; GENDER; YOUTH; LIVES; ACCRA; MEN	This paper examines how extreme weather events affect the mobility of low-income urban residents in Ghana. Bringing together scholarship on extreme weather and mobilities, it explores the differential impact of flooding on their everyday lives as they navigate the cities of Accra and Tamale. A range of qualitative methods were drawn on, including semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and follow-along-participant observations in selected communities of both cities. Three key themes emerged: disrupted road and transport infrastructure, everyday mobility challenges, and coping/adaptive strategies. In flooding conditions, residents experienced difficulties leaving/returning home, engaging in income-generating activities, and accessing transport services and other key urban infrastructure. Conceptually, the paper reveals how disruption to urban residents' daily movements and activities (re)produces new forms of mobilities and immobilities, which have three relational elements: postponed, improvised and assisted. Throughout the analysis, we show how these mobilities/immobilities vary by age and gender: all urban residents, (though women in particular), experience postponed mobility; young people especially engage in improvised mobility; and children and the elderly are in greatest need of assisted mobility. The paper thus contributes to scholarship on extreme weather events and mobility by providing a more spatially nuanced understanding of the multi-faceted domains in which flooding, socio-economic conditions and adaptive strategies intersect to influence urban mobility in resource poor settings.

The 3rd generation MIKE21 model was used to simulate flood hazard characteristics (depth and velocity) and the effectiveness of the mangrove forests along the shoreline as an ecosystem-based DRR measure through a reduction in depth and velocity for a 400-year storm return period event. The implementation of the ecosystem-based DRR reduced high damage (more than 64% damage) for residential buildings by 10%. Meanwhile, in the west part of the port, 25% of the population is at extreme risk to life, which can be reduced to 4% by implementing the ecosystem-based DRR. The ecosystembased DRR reduced the high level of damage (more than 65% damage) for infrastructures by 6% and 9% for the eastern and central parts of the Port of Sur, respectively. The outcomes demonstrate that BN can be used as a simulation tool to conceptualize the potential consequences of a storm in Decision Support System (DSS). For coastal managers to evaluate which options are the best for reducing potential damage to coastal systems.

In this study, we investigated how patterns of human and lightning ignitions can influence modelled fire simulations and demonstrate how these data can be used to assess post-fire flooding and sediment transport. We used historical ignition data (1992-2015) to characterize ignition patterns for thirteen mountain ranges in southern Arizona, United States, and developed FlamMap burn probability (BP) models for three scenarios: human ignition, lightning ignition, and random ignition. We then developed a watershed-scale case study assessing the impacts of ignition scenarios on post-fire hydrology using the KINEROS2 model that simulates runoff and erosion. BP models illustrated considerable differences in landscape fire risk between the three ignition scenarios. Results from the watershed model indicate the greatest impacts from the post-fire human ignition scenario, with a 10-fold increase in sediment discharge and four-fold increase in peak flow compared to pre-fire conditions. Our results show that consideration of ignition source and location is important for assessing fire risk, and our modelling approach provides a planning mechanism to identify locations most at risk to fire-induced flood hazards, where prevention and mitigation activities can be focused.

The challenge themes were related to limited risk awareness and apathy, the large scope of the impact, the difficulty with coordination and communication, the challenges in risk communication, the limited local-level capacity, and the perceived stigma and fear limiting the utilization of governmental assistance. The mitigation recommendations included the need to consider zoning and infrastructure updates, the implementation of efficient systems that leverage technology for coordination and communication, and guidance on how to address certain human factors. This study reinforces previous findings related to flood disasters and adds to our understanding of disaster response and food insecurity. The practical takeaways from this study can inform future flood-related disaster mitigation approaches in Nebraska and other rural areas.

Despite existing studies discussing coastal areas, there are limited studies investigating Asian coastal areas and their proposed solutions may not overcome extreme events. This study investigates the dynamics of the Pekalongan coastal area, Central Java, Indonesia. Despite efforts such as the development of dikes and groundwater pumping, people in Pekalongan have currently experienced more frequent floods and land subsidence that have led to larger inundated areas and people migration. Using the system archetypes, this study shows that the coastal area consists of renowned nexus elements (water, land, and food) and less recognized nexus elements (health and wellbeing). This means that changes in one nexus element may threaten other nexus elements, exacerbating problems in the observed system. For instance, unsustainable nexus actions such as overexploited groundwater tend to increase flooded areas, threatening people health, and inducing people migration. The system archetypes also show that the coastal area consists of Limits to Growth structures. As such, growth engines such as land-use change and groundwater pumping should be managed or restricted properly. Managing growth engines can prevent us from natural disasters such as floods and water scarcity. Likewise, as the system archetypes describe generic patterns and solutions, some findings of this study can be useful for the other coastal areas.

To quantify the wave power variation across living shorelines, the wave characteristics around the constructed oyster reefs (CORs) in upper Delaware Bay were investigated in this study. Wave parameters seaward and shoreward of CORs were recorded by wave gauges in early 2018. Four winter storms happened in this period and induced strong winds and coastal flooding at the study site. To estimate the wind wave characteristics across the CORs on a yearly basis, soft computing-based models combining fully connected neural networks and long short-term memory were developed to extend the two-month energetic wave measurements. The results show that when CORs were emergent or slightly submerged, the averaged wave height attenuation was about 39.8% from the offshore gauge to the nearshore gauge (behind CORs) during 2018-2020, owing to the combined effect of nearshore bathymetric changes and CORs. Furthermore, it was found that the annually averaged wave power reduction from offshore to nearshore at the study site was about 30.0% in 2018, 2019, and 2020. This study provides a novel framework to predict long-term wave characteristics based on short-term wave measurements using soft computing-based models.

Flooding increases moisture contents, which weakens most pavement materials. Although the effect of moisture on the mechanical properties of most pavement materials is reversible, the structural damage caused by trafficking applied on the weakened pavement structure is not. The critical time for structural damage is typically after the flood and before "life-line" pavements have dried back when trucks are bringing in relief supplies and hauling out demolition. This fact, together with the increased occurrence of extreme weather events and sea level rise resulting from climate change, emphasizes the need to better understand the impacts of flooding on identified life-line pavements. This paper evaluates the flooding resiliency of thin concrete overlay on asphalt (COA) pavements by studying the effects that water saturation produces on the pavement structure. The research is based on the structural response and distresses measured in five thin COA sections that were instrumented with sensors and tested with a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS) under flooded conditions. The research shows that the flooding did not produce a noticeable change in the structural capacity of the COA, based on the structural response measured under the loading of the HVS wheel and the falling weight deflectometer, but did result in some structural damage to the asphalt base in some of the sections.

We hypothesize that an analytic framework based on isochrone and SWMM models can be used to simulate and compare the rainfall-runoff process before and after sponge city construction and thus assess the performance of the sponge city infrastructure on controlling stormwater outflows. In this paper, the analytical framework driven by design storms (with return periods of 2, 5, 20, and 30-year) was developed and tested in the catchment in Fengxi New City, China. The modeling results were then analyzed with indicators like peak flow rate, outflow volume, rainfall-runoff ratio, and stormwater stored due to sponge city construction. Outflow hydrographs and volume curve analyses showed that the sponge city infrastructure significantly mitigates the risk of stormwater overflows in the catchment and dramatically relieves the pressure on the flood control system of its downstream areas by a firm limit of the peak flow rate. Also, the performance generally decreases as rainstorms become less frequent and more intense. We anticipate that the proposed framework provides a practical approach to quantifying the sponge city's response to rainfalls under complex models.

When tectonic and/or anthropogenic processes change the land surface elevation, the spatial patterns of floods might also change. Here, we employ the hydrological and hydraulic modeling to simulate floods in the Kujukuri Plain, Japan, in the years 2004 and 2013, when two severe floods occurred. In between the two floods, land surface elevations were changed by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The effects of land surface elevation changes on inundation areas were quantified by changing input topographies. Our results showed that, without taking into account land surface elevation changes, around 10% of inundation areas were underestimated at the time of flood events in the year 2013. The spatial distribution of inundation locations varied with local topographical features, for example, the areas with backmarsh and valley fill deposits were sensitive to the extent of inundation by land surface elevation changes. The sub-watershed near the coastal shoreline having below-zero meter elevation areas showed that the earthquake-induced land surface elevation changes exacerbated an additional 22% inundation area. This study suggests that the inundation areas will increase in catchments suffering severe settlements, which highlights the necessity of taking into account the spatio-temporal changes of land surface elevations on the assessment of flood hazards.

Therefore, developing a flood hazard model to recognize the basin's susceptible areas to flooding is important for decision makers for comprehensive flood risk management. The flood hazard map was prepared using geographical information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) along with the application of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method to identify the optimal selection of weights for the factors that contribute to flood risk. The flooding causative factors used in this study were rainfall, distance to the river, digital elevation model (DEM), slope, land use/land cover (LULC), drainage density, soils, and lithology. The derived flood hazard map consisted of four distinct categories (zones). These zones that depict high, intermediate, low, and very low flood hazard cover around 20%, 40%, 39%, and 2% of the basin area, respectively. The produced flood hazard map was further verified using a historical flood event in the study area. The results were found to be consistent with the historical data of flood events, revealing the model's effectiveness in the realistic representation of flood hazard mapping.

The literature on the success of focusing on expost responses to flood events shows poor outcomes in mitigating flood risks across the board. Here, we employ systems thinking to conceptualise the dynamics underlying interactions among endogenous characteristics of the flood-prone community, and apply this, as a case study example, to the regional township of Roma in inland Queensland, Australia-a location that has experienced significant flooding in recent decades. Our results show that current flood mitigation policies are likely to be maladaptive due to unintended consequences that ultimately undermine the effectiveness of the interventions in the longer term. Based on our analysis, we conclude that integrated flood risk management, effected through well-targeted proactive investments-such as investment in infrastructure; technology advances; capacity improvements; shifts in systems, management practices and behaviour-and risk transfer (insurance) options, provide opportunities for reducing future relief and recovery costs and increasing fiscal stability and the long term well-being of communities in the face of increasing climate variability and flood risk under climate change. Conceptualisation and visualisation of the flood risk system, as exemplified in this paper, provides insights which might help to guide more cost-effective and sustainable flood risk mitigation investment in flood-prone communities.				thanh.mai@usq.edu.au	An-Vo, Duc-Anh/JGD-1094-2023	An-Vo, Duc-Anh/0000-0001-7528-7139	Queensland State Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP) [DCAP 05]	Queensland State Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP)	This research was supported by the Queensland State Government's Drought and Climate Adaptation Program (DCAP) (grant number DCAP 05).		61	31	32	4	42	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	2212-4209			INT J DISAST RISK RE	Int.

Along the United States Mid-Atlantic coast, high marsh has already declined, and is particularly vulnerable to future loss due to greater regional rates of relative sea level rise and limited capacity for both vertical accretion and landward migration. To support climate adaptation efforts in the region, we conducted a spatial overlay analysis to (1) assess interior ponding in the high tidal marsh zone caused by waterlogging, and (2) identify restoration opportunities where poor drainage is limiting natural recovery. Surface inundation has increased across over 14,000 ha of high marsh in the region, mostly along the eastern Chesapeake Bay and New Jersey coast. Within this waterlogged area, we identified 239 potential restoration sites (275 ha). Validation data indicate our analysis had relatively high accuracy in identifying potential restoration sites, with a true positive rate of 76% and a true negative rate of 96%. Widespread waterlogging emphasizes the need for climate adaptation efforts to restore and protect high marsh in the face of future change. Our recommended restoration strategy of connecting waterlogged sites to tidal creeks aligns with best practices by enabling drainage of high marsh to halt or even reverse ponding, improve recovery from future flooding events, and ultimately facilitate marsh migration with sea level rise.

Generic adaptation pathways for coastal archetypes under uncertain sea-level rise	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						coastal zone management; climate adaptation; uncertainty; decision making; pathways	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; LESSONS; ESTUARY; DELTAS; SYSTEM	Adaptation to coastal flood risk is hampered by high uncertainty in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise. Subsequently, adaptation decisions carry strong risks of under- or over-investment, and could lead to costly retrofitting or unnecessary high margins. To better allocate resources timely and effectively, and achieve long-term sustainability, planners could utilise adaptation pathways, revealing the path-dependencies of adaptation options. This helps to identify low-regret short-term decisions that preserve options in an uncertain future, while monitoring to detect signals to adapt. A major barrier to the application of adaptation pathways is limited experience. To facilitate this, here we generalize this pathways approach for six common coastal archetypes, resulting in generic pathways suitable to be adjusted to local conditions. This provides a much richer analysis of coastal adaptation than provided by any previous analysis, by assessing the solution space and options over time for a variety of coastal regions. Based on this analysis, we find that the number of adaptation options declines while sea-level rises. For some archetypes, it becomes clear that long-term thinking is needed now, about if, how and when to move to transformative options, such as planned retreat, which may presently not be considered or acceptable. Our analysis further shows that coastal adaptation needs to start earlier than anticipated, especially given time required for local debate and choice and to implement measures.

In this regard, reservoir systems have an important role to manage water resources. Thus, it is essential to optimize the management of water resources. Optimizing reservoir systems involves complications such as nonlinear functions, large number of sizing variables and numerous constraints. To solve complicated optimization problems, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are reliable and powerful methods. Hence, the present paper applies gradient evolution (GE) algorithm to optimize reservoir operation systems. This algorithm is extracted from a gradient-based optimizer. In fact, the main novelty of this study is the application of GE algorithm to optimize single- and multi-reservoir systems. Accordingly, the GE is employed to optimize a four-reservoir system, the Khersan-1 reservoir and the Dez reservoir in Iran. The results confirm the high capacity of the GE to optimize the single and multi-reservoir systems as it can obtain solutions 99.99, 96 and 94% of global optimum for the four-reservoir, Khersan-1 reservoir and Dez reservoir operation problems respectively. The results of the GE are compared with those solutions calculated with linear programming (LP), non-linear programming (NLP) and genetic algorithm (GA), which corroborate the superior ability of GE to reach global optimum solution of reservoir operation systems.

However, there are no studies that have extensively investigated the effect of the rising lake water levels on urban flooding. This research responds to this by developing and applying a GIS-based spatial flood modelling approach to simulate the resulting flooding impacts in Entebbe City, Uganda, corresponding to the May 2021 observed maximum lake water level of 13.49 m. Using the validated GIS-based flood model, the simulated flooded area and average flood depth were determined as 9.1 km2 and 1.52 m, respectively. Furthermore, through application of GIS overlay analysis, the total number of affected buildings and length of urban roads were quantified. The proposed methodology provides a robust and computationally efficient approach for identification of at-risk buildings along the lake shoreline and for testing the effectiveness of potential adaptation strategies.

Storm-driven flooding contaminates environmental, rec-reational, and drinking water sources, but few studies have examined effects on specific infections over time. We used 23 years of exposure and case data to assess the effects of tropical cyclones on 6 waterborne diseases in a conditional quasi-Poisson model. We separately de-fined storm exposure for windspeed, rainfall, and proxim-ity to the storm track. Exposure to storm-related rainfall was associated with a 48% (95% CI 27%-69%) increase in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections 1 week after storms and a 42% (95% CI 22%-62%) in in-crease Legionnaires' disease 2 weeks after storms. Cryp-tosporidiosis cases increased 52% (95% CI 42%-62%) during storm weeks but declined over ensuing weeks. Cyclones are a risk to public health that will likely become more serious with climate change and aging water infra-structure systems.

An Observation-Based Dataset of Global Sub-Daily Precipitation Indices (GSDR-I)	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							QUALITY-CONTROL; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE	Precipitation indices based on daily gauge observations are well established, openly available and widely used to detect and understand climate change. However, in many areas of climate science and risk management, it has become increasingly important to understand precipitation characteristics, variability and extremes at shorter (sub-daily) durations. Yet, no unified dataset of sub-daily indices has previously been available, due in large part to the lesser availability of suitable observations. Following extensive efforts in data collection and quality control, this study presents a new global dataset of sub-daily precipitation indices calculated from a unique database of 18,591 gauge time series. Developed together with prospective users, the indices describe sub-daily precipitation variability and extremes in terms of intensity, duration and frequency properties. The indices are published for each gauge where possible, alongside a gridded data product based on all gauges. The dataset will be useful in many fields concerned with variability and extremes in the climate system, as well as in climate model evaluation and management of floods and other risks.

In this study, different rice production patterns were examined to quantify the effects on crop production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and synchronization index of water conservation and GHG mitigation. The results indicated that rice direct dryland seeding with biodegradable mulching showed the best performance in maintaining yield (7,802 kg ha-1), saving irrigation water (67%), increasing net profit (619 CNY ha-1), reducing CH4 emissions (73%), global warming potential (69%) and GHG intensity (69%), although it increased N2O emissions (59%), compared with continuous flooding. Rice direct dryland seeding without mulching showed similar water savings and GHG mitigation with mulching, but it caused yield and net profit reductions by 20% and 40%, and synchronization index increment by 127%. These findings can guide the implementation of dryland rice production in priority areas, contributing to high-efficiency, eco-friendly agricultural cultivation.

In this study, the Seyhan Basin has been determined as the study area. It is aimed to examine the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and extreme precipitation indices in the Seyhan Basin. For this purpose, the period 1970-2019 was divided into three periods with the change point detection methods (Pettitt, Buishand rank and standard normal homogeneity test). Trends were examined by applying modified Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho tests to precipitation and extreme indices for all periods and sub-periods. Then, temporal and spatial analyses of extreme indices were performed. According to the results obtained, there is no precipitation homogeneity throughout the basin. While the threat of drought comes to the fore with the decrease in rainy days and precipitation in the north, the risk of flooding is effective with the increase in precipitation intensity in the south.

In Australia, green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly popular in considering natural processes in sustainable water management practices. However, to date, there has been little examination of how the academic literature has addressed the use of GI in Australian landscape planning for water management. To investigate this, we applied a thematic framework and used the PRISMA approach to identify and analyse 98 peer-reviewed papers to better understand whether and how landscape planning perspectives are considered in current water management approaches in Australia. We found a recent increase in Australian-based literature related to GI for water management. However, there is limited literature discussing the significance of landscape connectivity and the multi-functionality of GI. This article concludes with recommendations for future research on the landscape planning principles of multi-functionality, landscape connectivity, and the integration of multiple scales of GI in Australian urban water management.

The implementation of resilience measures requires coordination across levels of government. This study aims to unravel the complexity of implementing spatial strategies to enhance urban flood resilience in the Metropolitan City of Naples. The research is informed by the politicized Institutional Analysis and Development framework, which relates contextual variables, discourses, and institutions (formal\informal rules-in-use) to policy outcomes. This framework is used to explain the outcomes of decision-making in multiple nested action arenas on urban flood risk management policies. It is shown that closed decision-making processes that do not involve lower levels of government, limited monitoring and enforcement, and illegal practices lead to poor coordination across levels of government. This lack of coordination explains why floodplain occupancy continues, thus hampering the shift towards a risk-based approach in flood risk management.

Archeological evidence suggests that the Liangzhu ancient city was abandoned, and the culture collapsed at similar to 4300 years ago. Here, we present speleothem records from southeastern China in conjunction with other paleoclimatic and archeological data to show that the Liangzhu culture collapsed within a short and anomalously wet period between 4345 +/- 32 and 4324 +/- 30 years ago, supporting the hypothesis that the city was abandoned after large-scale flooding and inundation. We further show that the demise of Neolithic cultures in the YRD occurred within an extended period of aridity that started at similar to 4000 +/- 45 years ago. We suggest that the major hydroclimatic changes between 4300 and 3000 years ago may have resulted from an increasing frequency of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the context of weakened Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.

Results indicated that (1) for every 1 degrees C increase in temperature, the average annual runoff decreased by 9.9 mm, and the average annual evaporation increased by 9.3 mm. However, for every 10% increase in rainfall, the average annual runoff and evapotranspiration increased by 96.3 mm and 11.53 mm, respectively. Obviously, runoff was more sensitive to the change in rainfall than temperature in the Longtan basin. Meanwhile, (2) forestland could conserve water resources, but its water consumption was larger. Although grassland played a relatively small role in water conservation, it consumed less water. At the same time, increasing the area of forestland and grassland could weaken peak floods, and the water retention function of vegetation could prevent runoff from increasing and decreasing steeply. Therefore, it is worth improving vegetation coverage.

Here we present a model for the formation of the North Sea Fan derived from detailed horizon and attribute interpretations of high-resolution processed 3D seismic reflection data. The interpretation shows that stacked channel-levee systems form up to 400m thick sedimentary sequences. The channels are elongated and can be traced from the shelf edge towards the deep basin for distances of >150 km, and document long-distance sediment transport in completely disintegrated water-rich turbidite flows. Downslope sediment transport was a continuous process during shelf-edge glaciations, reaching accumulation rates of 100 m/kyr. Our data highlight that exceptionally large volumes of meltwater may discharge to the slopes of trough mouth fans and trigger erosive turbidite flows. We conclude that freshwater supply is likely an underestimated factor for sedimentary processes during glacial cycles.

The data were processed for the period from 2000 to 2017 using vegetation and water surface indices. The results of flood mapping were verified with the ground reference data, indicating the overall accuracy of 88.7% and Kappa coefficient of 0.77, respectively. These findings were confirmed by close agreement between the flood-mapping area and ground reference data, with the correlation coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.94. The flood-prone areas were generally concentrated along the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake. The seasonal flooded areas observed for 2010, 2015 and 2016 were remarkably smaller than other years, mainly attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon exacerbated by impacts of climate change. Eventually, the probability of flood occurrence during this 18-year period with reference to percentage of population at the district level was calculated for flood management purposes.

While poaching and encroachment challenges in conservation parks are of immediate nature, climate-related risks exist in the long term. The park manager faces a utility function that includes as its arguments local community's incomes, benefits to the larger society from preserving threatened species and the financial costs of monitoring and land-use change efforts. Using the case of single-horned rhinos in the Kaziranga National Park, India, an optimal mix of monitoring and land-use changes is designed in presence of tradeoffs between short- and long-term management efforts. As monitoring only addresses immediate challenges associated with poaching and encroachment, long-term climatic risks remain ignored. Land-use management offers risk-protection as well as risk-insurance benefits with respect to climate change-induced flooding of the park.

The benefits to the plant gained through the rhizobial-legume symbiosis can be further enhanced by associations of the legume with arbuscular mycorrhiza. The progressive engagement of the legume host with the rhizobial bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi requires an extensive exchange of signalling molecules. These signals alter the transcriptional profiles of the partners, guiding and enabling extensive microbial and fungal proliferation in the roots. Such interactions and associations are greatly influenced by environmental stresses, which also severely limit the productivity of legume crops. Part II of the Special Issue on Legumes provides new insights into the mechanisms that underpin sustainable symbiotic partnerships, as well as the effects of abiotic stresses, such as drought, waterlogging, and salinity on legume biology. The requirement for germplasm and new breeding methods is discussed as well as the future of legume production in the face of climate change.

This research assessed long term (2001 to 2015) flood risk at South Asia level using eight-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and subsequently expanded this methodology to identify potential zones for piloting flood index insurance scheme in Bihar, India. Bihar was further assessed for sub-regional segmentation of its 37 districts into four flood risk zones based on k-means clustering and Getis-Ord Gi* analysis of multi-modal dataset consisting of demographics, meteorological, agricultural, flood characteristics and economic loss from floods. Satellite based risk assessment identified parts of Indus basin in Pakistan, Ganges basin in North India and majority of Bangladesh as flood hotspots. Site prioritization for flood index insurance in Bihar identified Madhubani, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi districts as very high flood risk districts by both methods signifying large impact of any potential interventions implemented in these districts.

It is a noteworthy example of implementation of an innovation in long-term strategic delta planning. The Dutch Delta Program was central herein. Pursuing its ambition to make the Netherlands climate-proof, the Delta Program invited a diverse set of actors to participate in developing a long-term adaptation plan, and also to propose innovative short-term measures to help realize that plan. The wide green dike was actively promoted by a local water board, with involvement of scientists and nature conservation organizations. A stepwise participatory process resulted in national-level recognition of the potential of the wide green dike, particularly due to its "green" and "adaptability" characteristics. Alignment of flood protection and climate adaptation goals with nature conservation objectives, as well as collaboration with new actors, were all crucial in the reintroduction of this innovation.

J	Akhtar, AS				Akhtar, Aasim Sajjad			Climate Breakdown in Pakistan: (Post) Colonial Capitalism on the Global Periphery	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						climate justice; expropriation; floods; post-colonial state; uneven development	STATE; LAW	Amongst the most devastating extreme weather events in recent years, the 2022 Pakistan floods ostensibly triggered a new-found urgency to reduce emissions and redress other underlying causes of human-induced global warming. Yet multinational corporations and Western governments remain non-committal about shifting away from non-renewable energy, offering meaningful climate and debt financing, or substantively reducing emissions. Meanwhile, the modalities of capital accumulation in postcolonial contexts such as Pakistan are destroying already vulnerable ecosystems, even as they reinforce logics of expropriation and uneven development inherited from colonial times. As Pakistan experiences a demographic explosion and mainstream politics becomes increasingly reactionary, the imperative of posing an alternative hegemonic conception to the dominant development paradigm is ever more acute. This Commentary interrogates the meaning of climate justice so as to bring the global political economy into conversation with the demographic, environmental, and economic trends in the post-colony, with a specific focus on the 2022 floods in Pakistan. It is contended that the Pakistan case can be broadly extrapolated to postcolonial South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, regions that are home to the fastest growing young populations in the world, and also amongst the most vulnerable to climate change.

Rural riverine communities in Bangladesh have long been identifled as some of the poorest populations, most vulnerable to riverine hazards. However, these communities have, for generations, also developed resilience strategies - considered as the combination of absorptive, adaptive, and transformative approaches - to manage signiflcant flooding and erosion. It is not clear whether such existing strategies are sufflcient to generate resilience in the face of increasing hazards and growing pressures for land. In this study, we quantify community resilience to flooding and erosion of 35 of the most poverty-stricken and exposed communities in riverine Bangladesh by applying the systematic resilience measurement framework provided by the Flood Resilience Measurement for Communities tool. The low levels of resilience observed in the riverine communities, as well as their continued focus on enhancing absorptive capacities are alarming, especially in the face of growing climate threats and continued population growth. Innovative transformative responses are urgently required in riverine Bangladesh, which align with and complement ongoing community-centred efforts to enhance rural resilience to riverine hazards.

J	Pappalardo, V; La Rosa, D				Pappalardo, Viviana; La Rosa, Daniele			Spatial Analysis of Flood Exposure and Vulnerability for Planning More Equal Mitigation Actions	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood risk; risk assessment; vulnerability/exposure; spatial equity	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; ADAPTATION; SIMULATION; STRATEGIES; ALLOCATION; EQUITY; SPACE	The issue of spatial equity of Nature-Based Solutions in cities generally concerns the spatial distribution of their benefits to local residents and other city users. In the context of flood risk management, planners are challenged to identify effective mitigation and adaptation measures that can generate benefits to the higher number of people and, more specifically, to people with highest levels of exposure and vulnerability. To address these issues, an essential step is to identify the geography of needs for mitigation, intended as prior areas in which to locate measures for flood risk mitigation. This study combines geospatial layers of multiple dimensions of exposure and vulnerability to flooding and identifies prior areas suitable for design scenarios for mitigation of flooding risk, for a regional case study located in Sicily. The results show patterns of exposure and vulnerability that vary according to locally relevant physical and social urban dimensions. Based on these results, proposals for mitigation actions are advanced with the overall objective of generating equal benefits to the most vulnerable exposed social subjects. Moreover, this study argues about the particular implications of implementing stormwater green infrastructure planning for equal beneficial distribution of the potentially achievable risk reduction.

Based on daily precipitation, socio-economic data and a comprehensive evaluation method, the characteristics and risks of rainstorm disaster in the GBA at county level are investigated in this paper. Considering the hazard, vulnerability and exposure, the risks of rainstorm disasters are high (Level 3) and very high (Level 4) in Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Dongguan, Jiangmen and Shenzhen. From 1990 to 2018, the frequency and intensity of rainstorms in the GBA have increased by 10 times and 2 mm per decade, respectively. Moreover, the population, gross domestic product, and built-up areas have increased significantly in the GBA, while the vegetation coverage has decreased. The combination of these changes results in an increase in the frequency of rainstorm disasters by two times from 2005 to 2018 compared with that from 1990 to 2004. The findings of this study can provide a positive reference for local governments to improve the pertinence of the strategies for rainstorm disaster prevention and mitigation.

Flooding and tropical cyclones have clear impacts on human health in the United States at present, and projections of their health impacts in the future will help inform climate policy, yet to date there have been few quantitative climate health impact projections. Recent Findings Despite a wealth of studies characterizing health impacts of floods and tropical cyclones, many are better suited for qualitative, rather than quantitative, projections of climate change health impacts. However, a growing number have features that will facilitate their use in quantitative projections, features we highlight here. Further, while it can be difficult to project how exposures to flood and tropical cyclone hazards will change in the future, climate science continues to advance in its capabilities to capture changes in these exposures, including capturing regional variation. Summary Developments in climate epidemiology and climate science are opening new possibilities in projecting the health impacts of floods and tropical cyclones under a changing climate.	[Anderson, G.

However, climate change projections in deltas often address climate-driven stressors in isolation and disregard parallel anthropogenic processes, leading to insufficient socio-political drive. Here, using a combination of process-based numerical models that integrate both climatic and anthropogenic environmental stressors, we project salt intrusion within the Mekong mega-Delta, in the next three decades. We assess the relative effects of various drivers and show that anthropogenic forces such as groundwater extraction-induced subsidence and riverbed level incisions due to sediment starvation can increase the salinity-affected areas by 10-27% compared to the present-day situation, while future sea level rise adds another 6-19% increase. These projections provide crucial input for adaptation policy development in the Mekong Delta and the methodology inspires future systemic studies of environmental changes in other deltas. Human activities, such as groundwater extraction and sediment starvation, are projected to add to climatic factors like sea level rise to exacerbate saline water intrusion into the Mekong Delta, Vietnam over the next 30 years, according to process-based model simulations.

In the past 50 years, the ecological environment around the Yongding River has deteriorated considerably, and the downstream has been completely cut off. Despite this, few have studied its morphology. In this study, we analyze the morphology of the Yongding River (Beijing, China) stretching for 92 km in four different periods between 1964 and 2018. A data treatment is carried out based on GIS, and the morphological evolution trajectory of the river channel at the overall and reach scales is reconstructed. The results show that the river morphology has undergone significant changes: the channel width has narrowed by 31%, and the temporal and spatial patterns show significant differences. By analyzing the impacts of human activities and climate change in various periods, we find human intervention to be the most important controlling factor. Based on our results, we proposed a set of river restoration strategies and protection measures for the Yongding River to guide watershed management and land planning.

For this reason, hazard, vulnerability, and risk indexes have been becoming more recurrent, especially to study and analyze low-lying coastal areas. This study presents an analysis on wave overtopping and coastal flooding, using an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) multicriteria methodology, in Costa da Caparica (Portugal). The definition of the different criteria, as well as their respective weighting for the overall problem and index calculation, was carried out with the help of experts in the subject. By following this methodology, and by using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), hazard, vulnerability, and risk indexes were obtained. The most hazardous areas are located closest to the sea, where the elevation is the lowest, whereas the most vulnerable areas are in neighborhoods with specific socioeconomic characteristics (high urban and economic density). Overall, around 30% of the study area displays moderate to very high risk regarding the occurrence of overtopping and flooding events. The results of this study will be helpful in decision-making processes in matters of coastal zone management and monitoring.

J	Salvucci, V; Santos, R				Salvucci, Vincenzo; Santos, Ricardo			Vulnerability to Natural Shocks: Assessing the Short-Term Impact on Consumption and Poverty of the 2015 Flood in Mozambique	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Welfare Impacts of Natural Shocks; Flood; Difference-in-Difference; Mozambique	CHANGING FOOD-PRICES; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RURAL WELFARE; DISASTERS; RISK; CHALLENGES; ADAPTATION; DYNAMICS; DROUGHT	Mozambique is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world. A bigger than usual, and mostly unexpected, flood occurred in the central-northern region of the country in the first few months of 2015, causing huge damage to infrastructures. In this paper, we use a nationally representative household budget survey that was being carried out in the field during those months to assess the short-term impact of the 2015 flooding on household consumption and poverty levels. Applying a difference-in-difference approach, we find that, for those exposed to the flood, consumption reduced significantly in the short term, in the range of 11-17%, depending on the specification, on the estimation procedure implemented or on the subsample of households selected. Poorer households, and especially households living in rural areas, seem to have been affected significantly more. Poverty levels also increased due to the flood, by about 6 percentage points. These results are relevant for policy planning and natural disaster management, as well as for ex-ante vulnerability assessment in Mozambique and other risk-prone developing countries with similar characteristics.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						social learning; urban water governance; climate adaptation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM; POLICY; LOOP; FRAMEWORK; BARRIERS; KEY; SUSTAINABILITY; IMPLEMENTATION	Social learning, especially triple-loop social learning involving institutional and governance changes, has great potential to address urban water issues such as flooding, drought, and pollution. It facilitates urban transition and the adoption of more systemic approaches and innovations. Social learning in water governance is a growing field, but the triple-loop learning concept remains vague and underexplored. Additionally, the focus is often on how social learning can contribute to progress with little attention being paid to barriers to learning. The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of triple-loop social learning to improve the "learning infrastructure". It investigates key learning barriers for realizing green (livable) and adaptive cities in Malmo and Gothenburg, Sweden. Integration of nature-based solutions in spatial planning and development of these cities has been slow. The results found three types of barriers contributing to this: systemic (disconnecting parts with the whole); opacity (reducing communication between error detection and correction); and process-related (reducing the adoption of innovations). The paper contributes to understanding the social learning barriers for implementing planning. These insights could help overcome "adaptation inertia" and speed up policy learning towards sustainability and resilience.

In North Horr Sub-County water quality is threatened by nitrate contamination due to fecal matter pollution. This research, hence, aims at assessing the vulnerability of open shallow water sources to nitrate contamination due to fecal intrusion following flooding events and nitrate percolation in groundwater. The present research, indeed, provides, on one hand, new insights into the analysis of the vulnerability in a scant data context; on the other hand, it assesses the adaptation measures contained in the local development plan. Applying the reference definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the results demonstrate that the open shallow water sources in the northern part of the sub-county are more vulnerable to nitrate contamination. Furthermore, the consistency of the results proves the suitability of the methodology selected. Understanding the vulnerability at the local scale is key to planning risk-reduction strategies as well to increasing the local population's knowledge about flood-related risks and water quality.

Hydrological changes during the Roman Climatic Optimum in northern Tuscany (Central Italy) as evidenced by speleothem records and archaeological data	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE			English	Article						climate changes; geoarchaeology; palaeoflooding; Roman Age; Tuscany	STABLE-ISOTOPE COMPOSITION; LAND SNAIL SHELLS; APUAN ALPS; MEDITERRANEAN PRECIPITATION; SOREQ CAVE; BRONZE-AGE; EVENTS; VARIABILITY; BASIN; MIDDLE	Study of the climate in the Mediterranean basin during different historical periods has taken on a particular importance, particularly regarding its role (together with other factors) in the evolution of human settlement patterns. Although the Roman age is traditionally considered a period with a favourable climate, recent studies have revealed considerable complexity in terms of regional climate variations. In this paper, we compare the hydrological change from speleothem proxy records with flood reconstructions from archaeological sites for Northern Tuscany (central Italy). We identify a period of oscillating climatic conditions culminating in a multidecadal dry event during the 1st centurybc, followed by a century of increased precipitation at the beginning of the Roman Empire and subsequently a return to drier conditions in the 2nd centuryad.The period of rainfall increase documented by the speleothems agrees with both the archaeological flood record as well as historical flood data available for the Tiber River, ca. 300 km to the south. These data also suggest a return to wetter conditions following the 3nd and 4rd centuriesad.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) injected into an underground reservoir will induce changes in its physical properties and the migration of CO2 will be affected by many factors. Accurately understanding these changes and migration characteristics of CO2 is crucial for selecting a CCUS project site, estimating storage capacity and ensuring storage security. In this paper, the basic principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies are briefly introduced in the context of laboratory experiments related to CCUS. The types of NMR apparatus, experimental samples and testing approaches applied worldwide are discussed and analyzed. Then two typical NMR core analysis systems used in CCUS field and a self-developed high-pressure, low-field NMR rock core flooding experimental system are compared. Finally, a summary of the current deficiencies related to NMR applied to CCUS field is given and future research plans are proposed.

Besides hydropower generation, LHPs could also contribute to water supply, irrigation, navigation, flood control, and other comprehensive benefits. Thus, it is essential to quantitatively analyze the overall and sub-functional benefits of LHPs in their operational phase. In this study, a multi-effect LHP equilibrium analysis model has been proposed and applied to the Wudongde Hydropower Station (WDD) to investigate its sector-level direct/indirect socio-economic and environmental (SEE) effects. The results indicate that WDD's operation greatly promotes the regional socio-economic growth and facilitates the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. The increased value of indirect gross domestic product (GDP) is equivalent to 0.027% of the total GDP of the Yangtze River Economic Belt in 2021, and the annual decreased amount of indirect GHG emissions is about 260.8 million tonnes. The results shed light on the contributions of different sub-functions of LHP to SEE indicators, which plays a pivotal role for decision-makers in formulating LHP-related operational planning and GHG emission reduction policies. Moreover, the modeling framework can be extended to assess the SEE effects of other LHPs around the world.

J	Lu, S; Huang, JY; Wu, J				Lu, Shuang; Huang, Jianyun; Wu, Jing			Multi-Dimensional Urban Flooding Impact Assessment Leveraging Social Media Data: A Case Study of the 2020 Guangzhou Rainstorm	WATER			English	Article						social media; disaster assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; sentiment analysis; urban flooding	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; SATELLITE; ANALYTICS; RISK	In the contexts of global climate change and the urbanization process, urban flooding poses significant challenges worldwide, necessitating effective rapid assessments to understand its impacts on various aspects of urban systems. This can be achieved through the collection and analysis of big data sources such as social media data. However, existing literature remains limited in terms of conducting a comprehensive disaster impact assessment leveraging social media data. This study employs mixed-methods research, a synergy of statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and geographical analysis to examine the impacts of urban flooding using the case of the 2020 Guangzhou rainstorm event. The result show that: (1) analyzing social media content enables monitoring of the development of disaster situations, with varied distributions of impact categories observed across different phases of the urban flood event; (2) a lexicon-based approach allows for tracking specific sentiment categories, revealing differential contributions to negative sentiments from various impact topics; (3) location information derived from social media texts can unveil the geographic distribution of impacted areas, and significant correlations are indicated between the waterlogging hotspots and four predisposing factors, namely precipitation, proportion of built-up surfaces, population density, and road density.

Temperature and stream water levels were during 346 rainfall events in the summer season (July-September) from 2020 to 2022. Rising stream water levels responded to falling stream water temperature between <= 100 and >100 ha forested catchments in two types of time of concentration. Stream water temperature decreased by 3.0 degree celsius when the stream water level increased by up to 0.9 m during rainfall events. Falling stream water temperature at two types of time of concentration was negatively correlated with total precipitation and rising stream water level. Based on the relatively high value of regression and cumulative frequency distribution, the estimated rising stream water level was appropriate in small catchments (<= 100 ha) when the stream water temperature decreased, and the stream water level increased during rainfall events. Rising stream water levels and falling stream water temperatures are responses to catchment-scale effects, which are influenced by the nature and rapidity of the hydrological responses. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that spatial and temporal differences in thermal responses of stream water temperature to water levels were controlled by catchment-scale effects under rapidly changing rainfall.

Climate policy must account for community-specific socio-economic, health, and biophysical conditions-evidence from coastal Alaska	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Buyouts; Coastal flooding; Cost assessment; Climate change; Indigenous communities; Relocation	VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; RELOCATION; BUYOUTS; SUICIDE	Climate warming, sea level rise, and extreme weather events are creating intensifying and more frequent hazards for human populations inhabiting the coast. In Alaska's remote coastal communities, flooding and erosion are rapidly increasing due to the combined effect of sea level rise, more frequent storm surges, and increasingly powerful wave action from lack of sea ice. This paper presents survey results documenting socio-economic and psychological livelihood impacts and relocation preferences as reported by residents of a remote coastal Indigenous community. We quantified direct costs of lost or damaged private property, affected community infrastructure, and interruption of public services and found that the resulting financial hardship adds to existing economic challenges and climate stressors. Findings underline a community-level preoccupation with coastal climate threats that manifests primarily in intrusive and distressing thoughts of consequences from storms and other destructive climatic events. We highlight the need to monitor more broadly livelihood impacts to inform the design of innovative risk management tools to moderate financial hardship and strengthen community-driven action. We conclude that new policy responding to the needs of remote Indigenous communities affected by repetitive environmental disasters needs to account for a complex array of community and culture-specific socio-economic, health, and biophysical factors that require frequent co-produced assessments to capture rapidly changing conditions at the local scale.

Effect of Mississippi River discharge plume on temporal and spatial variability of toxic cyanobacteria in an oligohaline estuary	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Harmful algal blooms; Estuary; Bonnet Carre Spillway; Cyanobacteria; Cyanotoxin	LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN ESTUARY; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; ANABAENA-FLOS-AQUAE; FRESH-WATER; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GLOBAL EXPANSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CELL-DEATH; MICROCYSTIS	Globally, estuaries are undergoing profound hydrological alterations due to changes in climate and flood management coincident with the increasing frequency of harmful algal blooms (HABs). In coastal Louisiana, the introduction of nutrient-rich Mississippi River water into Lake Pontchartrain Estuary supports the proliferation of toxic cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs). In 2019, over 28 km(3) of Mississippi River water was diverted into the estuary (volume of 6 km(3)) to prevent flooding of downstream communities. This study characterized the impact of this river input containing 38,000 + metric tons of bioavailable N and 2,300 + metric tons of bioavailable P on monthly biological measures of the water column including biomass of pelagic cyanobacteria and associated toxin production. The estuary was freshened for months due to the river pulses, which initially limited phytoplankton response due to high total suspended solids. There was a cyanobacterial bloom once the river pulse stopped, related to increased water residence time, clarity, and nutrient availability. Particulate toxin concentration correlated to cyanobacterial biomass but was non-linear. Once bioavailable N decreased, nitrogen-fixing Dolichospermum spp. became dominant. This research on CyanoHABs in Lake Pontchartrain Estuary can help provide a basis to predict the response of estuaries to large nutrient-loading events.

However, there is no commonly accepted definition of GI for water management in the literature.This research was undertaken in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia, which has experienced a long-term cycle of floods and droughts. The research employed the Q-sort methodology supplemented with semi-structured interviews to understand perceptions of GI amongst various stakeholders. Twenty-seven research participants included design, planning, and engineering practitioners, government officers, scientists and community mem-bers familiar with GI. Our findings indicate these participants regard GI as a broad concept containing both natural and engineered semi-natural assets offering multiple benefits and functions, yet rarely recognised its economic benefits. Participants were divided on GI's effectiveness for drought management.We propose a new, consolidated definition of GI for stormwater management: "GI is a strategically planned network of high-quality natural and semi-natural assets that mimics natural processes, with multiple benefits and multifunctionality, such as enhancing stormwater management and providing environmental quality, with social and economic benefits". We recommend that water management-related policies, strategies, plans, and design guidelines in SEQ and elsewhere, should include a consistent definition of GI for water management to assist professional and community understanding and inform decision-making about flood and drought.

Therefore, monitoring the seepage water level before the dam collapses is an important task for early warning of dam failure. Currently, there are hardly any monitoring methods that use wireless underground transmission to monitor the water content inside earth dams. Real-time monitoring of changes in the soil moisture content can more directly determine the water level of seepage. Wireless transmission of sensors buried underground requires signal transmission through the soil medium, which is more complex than traditional air transmission. Henceforth, this study establishes a wireless underground transmission sensor that overcomes the distance limitation of underground transmission through a hop network. A series of feasibility tests were conducted on the wireless underground transmission sensor, including peer-to-peer transmission tests, multi-hop underground transmission tests, power management tests, and soil moisture measurement tests. Finally, field seepage tests were conducted to apply wireless underground transmission sensors to monitor the internal seepage water level before an earth dam failure. The findings show that wireless underground transmission sensors can achieve the monitoring of seepage water levels inside earth dams. In addition, the results supersede those of a conventional water level gauge. This could be crucial in early warning systems during the era of climate change, which has caused unprecedented flooding events.

J	Xie, WW; Meng, QM				Xie, Weiwei; Meng, Qingmin			An Integrated PCA-AHP Method to Assess Urban Social Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise Risks in Tampa, Florida	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						sea level rise; PCA-AHP; social vulnerability; flooding risk; marginalized communities	COUNTY; GIS	Coastal flooding risks are increasing with the rise of sea level due to global climate change. Such risk presents different groups of residents with diverse vulnerability. Using a coastal city as the study area, this study quantitatively and qualitatively examines social vulnerability across different communities at risk of sea level rising. This study develops a novel social vulnerability assessment method that integrates principal component analysis (PCA) and analytical hierarchical process (AHP), inputting the advantages of each into factor analysis for social vulnerability quantification. Twenty-four socioeconomic factors are first grouped into four different themes. PCA is then performed to identify major components within each theme. We apply AHP to generate the weighting scheme for each theme. Therefore, the AHP-derived weights to those PCA components according to each theme are used to obtain an overall social vulnerability index. The thematic map of PCA-AHP SVI showed that minority communities with low income, mobile home, and unemployed populations aggregated in the East Tampa shore (over 69% of the total minority), compared with the West Tampa (31% of the total minority). Our findings provide insightful spatial information of the social vulnerability index (SVI) that allows decision makers to make optimal efforts to mitigate damages and unexpected impacts on different communities, especially those marginalized minorities due to sea level rising risks.

These disasters certainly affect the conditions of human life from economic, social, and environmental perspectives. Therefore, it is necessary to take preventive action and learn so that people understand the potential for disasters and how to deal with them. The geography education curriculum is one of the subjects that contains topics on disaster education, but this has not been carried out thoroughly in Malaysia. This study analysed the types of natural disasters and elements of priorities for action in reducing disaster risks, based on the Sendai framework. The data were collected from the Ministry of Education Malaysia, namely Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah (KSSM) of Geography form 4 and 5 Secondary School, geography textbook form 4, and geography textbook form 5. The data were analysed by a qualitative method with a content analysis approach. All documents were analysed with a focus on disaster risk reduction materials, based on the Sendai framework. As a result, the geography education curriculum for secondary schools in Malaysia has included these types of natural disasters: earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, landslides, droughts, hurricanes, and volcanoes. It also includes four elements of priority action for disaster risk reduction, albeit with an uneven composition. Overall, this study has shown that elements of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) were included in the geography education curriculum for secondary schools in Malaysia.

Study focus: High flow extreme events are becoming more common and less exceptional, leading to devastating losses with very high associated economical costs. This paper presents the development of a predictive Bayesian Causal Model (BCM) for high-flow extreme hydrological events assessment, accounting for: extreme events characterisation and sub-modelling; base-flow consideration; and previous soil moisture influence. It comprises three main phases that are: 1) Data preparation; 2) Extreme events characterisation and analysis; and 3) BCM predictive modelling. This study could be a decision-making tool for flood risk management in the Andarax River basin. New hydrological insights for the region: Results suggest a complex and dynamic non-linear rainfall-runoff relationship in the Upper Andarax watershed, whereas, there is a strong similarity in the temporal distributions of flow discharges, being, in general, symmetric, as a result of symmetric hyetographs. The statistical dependency showed that the basin response depends much more on the rainfall intensity rather than on the soil antecedent moisture conditions. The simulated BCMs demonstrated that all events' types may lead to river flooding, while the most hazardous are those of quartiles III and IV.

However, among various exposures of the TRSSF chain, it is still a great challenge to quickly assess the direct losses of houses, due to the complex mechanisms underlying building damage. The objective of this article is therefore to explore a simple method of quickly assessing the house losses caused by the TRSSF chain, based on a small amount of data. To achieve this goal, a method of multi factors regression and a spatial information network were proposed. The results in Haikou City show that the loss rate of house assets is significantly lower than that of indoor property. Spatially, the areas with higher loss rates are generally distributed along the Nandu River. The direct economic losses associated with houses in the return periods of 10, 20, 50, and 100 years range from 1.3 to 2 billion RMB. Our findings highlight the significance and possibility of quickly assessing the direct house losses caused by TRSSF chain using a small amount of data. It indicates that the house losses are not only determined by TRSSF intensity, but also closely related to socio-economic, topography and house location.

Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is among the most noxious invasive alien plant species, which can pose a threat to agro- and native-ecosystems. Despite potential parthenium infestation risks at the south-western regions of the Ganges-Brahmaputra floodplains of Bangladesh, no studies exist that document parthenium infestation. Using field surveys and a maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling approach, the present study tries to address the problem in the concerned region comprised of five Districts: Jashore, Jhenaidah, Chuadanga, Meherpur, and Khustia. The results revealed high infestation in the Jashore, Jhenaidah, and Chuadanga Districts, mainly along roadsides, in grasslands, and in fallow and cropped fields. The greatest abundance of the weed (ca. 30 plants m(-2)) occurred at the Indian border area, suggesting cross-border spreading, possibly through the linking road systems. Furthermore, we found that under both low and high emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5), parthenium weed suitability areas were likely to expand, suggesting an increased threat to the agro-ecosystems of Bangladesh. The present study is the first attempt to survey and model potential parthenium weed distribution affecting one of the major hubs of agricultural production in Bangladesh. The findings of this study can help land managers to make judicious decisions towards the future management of these agro-ecosystems.

Impact of warmer climate periods on flood hazard in the European Alps	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							VARVED SEDIMENTS; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; SOUTHERN ALPS; LONG RECORD; FREQUENCY; INTENSITY; PRECIPITATION; SOLAR; SIMULATIONS; ATLANTIC	Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard-costly in both human and economic terms-and climate change will probably exacerbate risks around the world. Mountainous areas, such as the densely populated European Alps, are of particular concern as topography and atmospheric conditions can result in large and sudden floods. In addition, the Alps are experiencing a high warming rate, which is probably leading to more heavy rainfall events. Here, we compile palaeoflood records to test the still uncertain impact these climatic trends might have on flood frequency and magnitude in the European Alps. We demonstrate that a warming of 0.5-1.2 degrees C, whether naturally or anthropogenically forced, led to a 25-50% decrease in the frequency of large (>= 10 yr return period) floods. This decreasing trend is not conclusive in records covering less than 200 years but persistent in those ranging from 200 to 9,000 years. By contrast, extreme (>100 yr) floods may increase with a similar degree of warming in certain small alpine catchments impacted by local intensification of extreme rainfall. Our results show how long, continuous palaeoflood records can be used to disentangle complex climate-flooding relationships and assist in improving risk assessment and management at a regional scale. Moderate flooding in the European Alps declined during past warmer periods, whereas extreme floods both increased and decreased, according to an analysis of palaeoflood records.

This paper aims to assess and explain institutional innovations in natural hazard risk management by analyzing examples of multi-functional protection schemes, which are distinctive to mainstream solutions. These multi-functional protection schemes combine several different functions (e.g. risk management strategy, sustainable land-use development, individual preparedness and well-being) that are concerned with mitigation systems in order to save space, time and possible arising costs. The paper uses a mixed method approach. The first step includes 14 qualitative standardized semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders connected to proposed transformative strategies in selected four study sites. As a second step, we conducted an explorative scenario analysis with key experts based on potential upscaling of bottom-up innovations to the mainstream natural hazard risk management in Austria. The results highlight that institutional innovations in risk management are dependent on bottom-up initiatives instead of top-down decisions. Consequently, these measures also need a larger risk acceptance among decision makers and the public. Innovations are based on individual interests and certain policy entrepreneurs at local level; however, national authorities act as 'gatekeepers' which allows innovation at local level. Based on these variables, three selected policy pathways were developed to show the tipping points necessary for policy transformation in Austria.

Regarding spatial variability, there was a clear difference between the south and north shores of the St. Lawrence River, south of 47 degrees N. DMEF were lower in the more agricultural watersheds on the south shore during transitional seasons compared to those on the north shore. A correlation analysis showed that this difference in flows was mainly due to more agricultural areas ((larger area (>20%) on the south than on the north shore (<5%)). An analysis of the long-term trend of these flows showed that the DMEF of south-shore rivers have increased significantly since the 1960s, during the fall (October to December), due to an increase in rainfall and a reduction in cultivated land, which increased the infiltration in the region. Although there was little difference between the two shores in the spring (April to June), we observed a decrease in minimum extreme flows in half (50%) of the south-shore rivers located north of 47 degrees N.

This is a guiding principle for the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), which outlines priorities for action to reduce disaster risk. However, some of these practical guidelines conceal oversimplified or unsubstantiated claims and assumptions, what we refer to as 'truisms', which, if not properly addressed, may jeopardize the long-term goal to reduce disaster risks. Thus far, much DRR research has focused on ways to bridge the gap between science and practice while devoting less attention to the premises that shape the understanding of DRR issues. In this article, written in the spirit of a perspective piece on the state of the DRR field, we utilize the SFDRR as an illustrative case to identify and interrogate ten selected truisms, from across the social and natural sciences, that have been prevalent in shaping DRR research and practice. The ten truisms concern forecasting, loss, conflict, migration, the local level, collaboration, social capital, prevention, policy change, and risk awareness. We discuss central claims associated with each truism, relate those claims to insights in recent DRR scholarship, and end with suggestions for developing the field through advances in conceptualization, measurement, and causal inference.

Equilibrium-based shoreline models have been shown to skillfully predict short-term wave-driven shoreline change on time scales of hours to decades. Both the Bruun Rule and equilibrium shoreline models rely on the equilibrium beach theory, which states that the beach profile shape equilibrates with its local wave and sea-level conditions. Integrating these two models into a unified framework can improve our understanding and predictive skill of future shoreline behavior. However, given that both models account for wave action, but over different time scales, a critical re-examination of the SLR-driven recession process is needed. We present a novel physical interpretation of the beach response to sea-level rise, identifying two main contributing processes: passive flooding and increased wave-driven erosion efficiency. Using this new concept, we analyze the integration of SLR-driven recession into equilibrium shoreline models and, with an idealized test case, show that the physical mechanisms underpinning the Bruun Rule are explicitly described within our integrated model. Finally, we discuss the possible advantages of integrating SLR-driven recession models within equilibrium-based models with dynamic feedbacks and the broader implications for coupling with hybrid shoreline models.

Hurricane storm surge: toward a normalized damage index for coastal regions	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Hurricane; Storm surge; Florida; NFIP; Economic impact; Spatial analysis	ECONOMIC-IMPACT; RISK; VULNERABILITY; URBANIZATION; RESILIENCE; KATRINA; MODEL; TEXAS; CITY	Hurricanes and tropical storms pose a significant threat to developed coastal regions around the world. In the United States, hurricanes cause billions of dollars in damage each year and many deaths. Climate change will continue to exacerbate damage, increasing the duration of hurricane season, creating stronger storms, and increasing coastal vulnerability to storms along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard. Most of the mortality and economic damage from hurricanes is caused specifically by storm surge flooding; the phenomenon wherein a hurricane's heavy winds push large amounts of sea water onto land. Predicting the damage that will result from a hurricane is a challenging problem. Hurricanes are difficult to forecast, with their projected track, strength, and size constantly changing. Even when the models are accurate and forecasters are confident in a given storm's track, predicting community impacts, including economic damage, remains difficult. The purpose of this paper is to present a geocomputational method to improve community damage estimates with a storm surge property damage index. Florida is used as a case study. The results suggest that large variations exist in community vulnerability throughout the state. The developed geocomputational framework presented in this paper is generalizable to any region vulnerable to tropical storms-helping urban planners, insurance companies, and policymakers improve efforts to reduce coastal vulnerabilities.

A generalized additive model (GAMLSS) with time as covariant was established to calculate and predict the design values of extreme rainstorm return period, and the nonstationary short-duration rainstorm intensity formula of three periods was fitted and compared with the stationary formula. The urban water simulation model and the Mike 21 two-dimensional surface flow model are coupled to simulate the urban flood under different formulas and different return periods. The results show that the nonstationary results are worse in the same period. In the 5-year return period rainfall-runoff simulation performance, the nonstationary inundation area is 18.5% more than the stationary, and inundation water is 23.5% more than the stationary. The nonstationary simulation results show higher inundation depth and slower flood recession process. These gaps will widen in the future, but they will become less significant as the return period increases. It can provide a reference for the study of flood control work and the design of existing drainage infrastructure in the region.

This study evaluates the potential contribution of a bioretention system to flood control, non-potable water demands (NPD) and resources co-management. Bioretention setups were tested experimentally under variable conditions to identify operational key-factors to multiple purposes. Additionally, the efficiencies obtained for laboratory scale were extrapolated for household and watershed scale, quantifying the indicators of water demand reduction (WDR), energy demand reduction (EDR) and carbon emission reduction (CER) for hybrid systems with LID. The laboratory results indicated that the use of a bioretention with a submerged zone can improve the quality of the water recovered for reuse, while maintaining the efficiency of runoff retention and peak flow attenuation. Comparing the bioretention effluent quality with the Brazilian standards for stormwater reuse, the parameters color, turbidity, E. coli and metals were above the limits, indicating the necessity of a better treatment to solids particles and disinfection. Expanding the analysis to watershed scale, the bioretention helped to reduce NPD demands up to 45%, leading to a reduction in energy demand and carbon emission from the centralized water supply system.

J	Lee, D; Ahmadul, H; Patz, J; Block, P				Lee, Donghoon; Ahmadul, Hassan; Patz, Jonathan; Block, Paul			Predicting social and health vulnerability to floods in Bangladesh	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIARRHEA; IMPACTS; INDEX	Floods are the most common and damaging natural disaster in Bangladesh, and the effects of floods on public health have increased significantly in recent decades, particularly among lower socioeconomic populations. Assessments of social vulnerability on flood-induced health outcomes typically focus on local to regional scales; a notable gap remains in comprehensive, large-scale assessments that may foster disaster management practices. In this study, socioeconomic, health, and coping capacity vulnerability and composite social-health vulnerability are assessed using both equal-weight and principal-component approaches using 26 indicators across Bangladesh. Results indicate that vulnerable zones exist in the northwest riverine areas, northeast floodplains, and southwest region, potentially affecting 42 million people (26 % of the total population). Subsequently, the vulnerability measures are linked to flood forecast and satellite inundation information to evaluate their potential for predicting actual flood impact indices (distress, damage, disruption, and health) based on the immense August 2017 flood event. Overall, the forecast-based equally weighted vulnerability measures perform best. Specifically, socioeconomic and coping capacity vulnerability measures strongly align with the distress, disruption, and health impact records observed. Additionally, the forecast-based composite social-health vulnerability index also correlates well with the impact indices, illustrating its utility in identifying predominantly vulnerable regions. These findings suggest the benefits and practicality of this approach to assess both thematic and comprehensive spatial vulnerabilities, with the potential to support targeted and coordinated public disaster management and health practices.

Simulation of Hurricane Harvey flood event through coupled hydrologic-hydraulic models: Challenges and next steps	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						digital elevation model (DEM); flood simulation; graphics processing unit (GPU); Hurricane Harvey; model parameterization; reservoir	LARGE-SCALE; TOPOGRAPHIC DATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; RESOLUTION; INUNDATION; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; ACCURACY; DELINEATION	Using the 2017 Hurricane Harvey flood event as a test case, this study set up a series of sensitivity analyses to highlight three challenges associated with large-scale flood inundation modeling, including (a) model parameterization, (b) errors in digital elevation models, and (c) effects of reservoir retention. Driven by radar-based hourly rainfall data, a series of hydrologic-hydraulic models including the VIC hydrologic model, RAPID routing model, and Flood2D-GPU hydrodynamic model are set up over Harris County, Texas, to simulate flood inundation and hazards. The results demonstrate the importance of hydrologic parameters in improving flood modeling. For a large flood event such as Hurricane Harvey, the effect of the initial water depths is insignificant. The Manning's n values may increase the peak water depth by similar to 1%, the flood extents by 65km(2), and the high danger zone by similar to 6%. On the contrary, the bathymetry correction factors may reduce the flood extent by similar to 1.4% and the high-danger zone by similar to 4%. Reducing the reservoir storage capacity to 1% may increase the flood extent by similar to 4% and the high-danger zone by similar to 17%. This study may provide supporting information to guide and prioritize the development of future high-performance computing hydrodynamic large-scale flood simulations.

Huge financial burden often follows major storm events to recover from structural damage. Well-designed drainage systems allow for effective discharge of stormwater, reducing property losses and expenditures on recovery. However, a lack of empirical studies on the topic has impeded the determination of which drainage method might be the most effective in preventing or minimizing property losses from flooding. This study assessed the economic impacts of three drainage systems - storage-, conveyance-, and infiltration-based facilities - on reducing flood damage recorded from 2009 to 2012 by Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Buffalo Bayou watershed in Houston, Texas, USA. Ordinary least squares and spatial autoregressive models were developed with a group of variables featuring drainage system, housing structure, geophysical environment, and storm characteristics. The results show that storage-based systems outperform conveyance-based mechanisms. Infiltration-based facilities are found to be less effective in reducing property damage because green spaces disconnected from sewer systems are rapidly inundated after being saturated while excessive overflow is not properly drained. This study confirms that the performance of a drainage system varies by facility type and environmental setting. The results encourage the recovery of wetlands and integration of retention/detention basins into community development in flood-prone areas to prevent potential future economic losses.

Therefore, the analysis of such events, such as providing information for their potential hazards assessment, is a key element in coastal management. In this study, a preliminary assessment of flood vulnerability due to storms was performed in Rhodes Island, Greece. Firstly, storm events were defined in terms of significant wave height, peak period, and duration, and they were grouped by means of cluster analysis into five classes (from weak to extreme) reflecting the intensity of each event. Subsequently, flood hazard was assessed by using an empirical formula for wave run-up calculations on cross-shore profiles and storm surge data at the region. Finally, a Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) was used for assessing vulnerability according to a scale from very low to very high. The most intense storms were found to occur in the eastern, southeastern, and southern part of the island. More than 60% of storms were classified as weak, while extreme events were found to occur with a frequency of less than 2.5%. Regarding flood hazard and vulnerability, the maximum values of wave run-up were calculated in the southeastern region, but the most vulnerable part was found to be the northwestern region, as the FVI was assessed as very high for weak and extreme events.

High Impact Weather Events in the Andes	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Review						Andes; extreme weather; storms; ENSO; floods; landslides; droughts; fires	MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS; SOUTHEASTERN SOUTH-AMERICA; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; MEASURING MISSION TRMM; EL-NINO; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; CENTRAL CHILE; AMAZON BASIN; SUMMERTIME PRECIPITATION	Owing to the extraordinary latitudinal extent, a strong orographic variability with very high mountain tops, and the presence of deep valleys and steep slopes, the Andes and the population of the region are highly prone and vulnerable to the impacts of a large suite of extreme weather events. Here we provide a review of the most salient events in terms of losses of human and animal lives, economic and monetary losses in costs and damages, and social disruption, namely: (1) extreme precipitation events and related processes (Mesoscale Convective Systems, lightning), (2) cold spells, frosts, and high winds, (3) the impacts of ENSO on extreme hydro-meteorological events, (4) floods, (5) landslides, mudslides, avalanches, and (6) droughts, heat waves and fires. For our purposes, we focus this review on three distinctive regions along the Andes: Northern tropical (north of 8 degrees S), Southern tropical (8 degrees S-27 degrees S) and Extratropical Andes (south of 27 degrees S). Research gaps are also identified and discussed at the end of this review. It is very likely that climate change will increase the vulnerability of the millions of inhabitants of the Andes, impacting their livelihoods and the sustainable development of the region into the twenty first century amidst urbanization, deforestation, air, soil and water pollution, and land use changes.

We selected a typical coarse sandy catchment on the Loess Plateau to investigate the changes of the runoff-sediment relationships with a data set of 62 years. A change point occurred in 1979, dividing the runoff and sediment load series into a baseline period (1954-1979) and a changing period (1980-2015). A total of 342 flood events were classified into three regimes using hierarchical clustering method. Regime A (162 events) was characterized by the shortest duration, lowest flood crest, and the least flow depth. Regime B (165 events) was characterized by a medium runoff depth, medium flow variability, and medium duration. Regime C merely include fifteen events with longest flood duration, the highest runoff depth, and the largest peak discharge. The sediment yield of flood regime A, B, and C accounted 14.2 % (1.09x10(8) t), 51.8 % (3.99x10(8) t), and 34.0 % (2.62x10(8) t) of the total sediment yield, respectively. The Support vector machines method was applied to established models to predict event sediment yield. It is demonstrated that the performance of models are good for different flood regimes.

An ecohydrological approach to the river contamination by PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs - concentrations, distribution and removal using phytoremediation techniques	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DIBENZO-P-DIOXINS; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS POPS; WATER TREATMENT-PLANT; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS; WASTE-WATER; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; BALTIC SEA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POINT SOURCES	The levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in the Pilica River and Sulejow Reservoir were found to be 46% higher during the flood season than during stable flow periods. In addition, PCDD/PCDF and dl-PCB mass loads increased by 5- to 12-fold and by 23- to 60-fold for toxic equivalency (TEQ) during flooding. The Sulejow Reservoir was found to play a positive role in reducing PCDD, PCDF and dl-PCB transport within the study period, with reductions ranging from 17 to 83% for total concentrations, and 33 to 79% for TEQ. Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) were not efficient at mass concentration removal, with small displaying the least efficiency. WTPs discharge pollutants into the aquatic environment, they also produce sludge that requires disposal, similar to reservoir sediments. Sludge- or sediment-born PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs may be removed using phytoremediation. The cultivation of cucumber and zucchini, two efficient phytoremediators of organic pollutants, on polluted substrate resulted in a mean decrease in PCDD PCDF dl-PCBTEQ concentrations: 64% for cucumber and 69% for zucchini in sludge-amended soil, and by 52% for cucumber and 51% for zucchini in sediment-amended soil.

The growing season has also become longer with higher temperatures, particularly in autumn. Previous studies have shown negative effects of high temperatures and, depending upon temperature conditions, contrasting effects of waterlogging on hardening capacity of timothy. We studied effects of waterlogging on seedlings of timothy (Phleum pratense, cv. Noreng) under three pre-acclimation temperatures: 3 degrees C, 7 degrees C, 12 degrees C, and in autumn natural light in a phytotron at Holt, Tromso (69 degrees N). After temperature treatments, all plants were cold acclimated at 2 degrees C for three weeks under continued waterlogging treatments. Freezing tolerance was determined by intact plants being frozen in pots at incremental temperature decreases in a programmable freezer. Waterlogging resulted in a higher probability of death after freezing, and a significantly reduced regrowth after three weeks at 18 degrees C, 24 hrs light in a greenhouse. Increasing pre-acclimation temperatures also had a clear negative effect on freezing tolerance, but there was no interaction between temperatures and waterlogging. The results indicate that waterlogging may have negative implications for hardening of timothy and may contribute to reduced winter survival under the projected increase in autumn temperatures and precipitation.

As the origin of flood events is usually associated with intense precipitation episodes, this study considers the general rainfall characteristics of tourist resorts in two islands of the Canary Archipelago (Spain). Days of intense rainfall were determined using the 99th percentile (99p) of 8 daily precipitation data series. In addition, the weather types that generated these episodes were identified, the best-fitting distribution functions were determined to allow calculation of probable maximum daily precipitation for different return periods, and the territorial and economic consequences of flood events were analysed. The results show highly irregular rainfall, with 99p values ranging 50-80 mm. The weather types associated with 49 days of flooding events were predominantly cyclonic and hybrid cyclonic. The Log Pearson III distribution function best fitted the data series, with a strong likelihood in a 100-year return period of rainfall exceeding 100 mm in a 24 h period. However, values below 30 mm have already resulted in significant flood damage, while intense rainfall events in the period 1998-2016 saw over 11.5 million euros paid out in damages for insured goods. Such flood-induced damages were found to be caused more by inadequate urban planning than by rainfall intensity.

This study proposes a depression-based index, the Topographic Control Index (TCI), to quantify the function of topography in urban pluvial flooding. The TCI of a depression is derived within its catchment, multiplying the catchment area with the slope, then dividing by the ponding volume of the depression. A case study is demonstrated in Guangzhou, China, using a 0.5 m-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) acquired using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology. The results show that the TCI map matches well with flooding records, while the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) cannot map the frequently flooded areas. The impact of DEM resolution on topographic representation and the stability of TCI values are further investigated. The original 0.5 m-resolution DEM is set as a baseline, and is resampled at resolutions 1, 2, 5, and 10 m. A 1 m resolution has the smallest TCI deviation from those of 0.5 m resolution, and gives the optimal results in terms of striking a balance between computational efficiency and precision of representation. Moreover, the uncertainty in TCI values is likely to increase for small depressions.

J	Molina, JL; Zazo, S; Martín, AM				Molina, Jose-Luis; Zazo, Santiago; Martin, Ana-Maria			Causal Reasoning: Towards Dynamic Predictive Models for Runoff Temporal Behavior of High Dependence Rivers	WATER			English	Article						Causality; causal reasoning; runoff fractions; hydrological time series; dynamic temporal dependence propagation; predictive models	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; STATISTICAL-MODEL; NEURO-FUZZY; TIME-SERIES; DISCHARGE; RAINFALL; FLOOD	Nowadays, a noteworthy temporal alteration of traditional hydrological patterns is being observed, producing a higher variability and more unpredictable extreme events worldwide. This is largely due to global warming, which is generating a growing uncertainty over water system behavior, especially river runoff. Understanding these modifications is a crucial and not trivial challenge that requires new analytical strategies like Causality, addressed by Causal Reasoning. Through Causality over runoff series, the hydrological memory and its logical time-dependency structure have been dynamically/stochastically discovered and characterized. This is done in terms of the runoff dependence strength over time. This has allowed determining and quantifying two opposite temporal-fractions within runoff: Temporally Conditioned/Non-conditioned Runoff (TCR/TNCR). Finally, a successful predictive model is proposed and applied to an unregulated stretch, Mijares river catchment (Jucar river basin, Spain), with a very high time-dependency behavior. This research may have important implications over the knowledge of historical rivers ' behavior and their adaptation. Furthermore, it lays the foundations for reaching an optimum reservoir dimensioning through the building of predictive models of runoff behavior. Regarding reservoir capacity, this research would imply substantial economic/environmental savings. Also, a more sustainable management of river basins through more reliable control reservoirs' operation is expected to be achieved.

Particularly, the effectiveness of flood risk management strategies is highly dependent on stakeholders' perception and attitudes, which play a critical role on how individuals and institutions act to mitigate risks. Furthermore, practitioners and policy-makers realized that grey infrastructures may not be the most suitable solution to reduce flood risk, and that a shift from grey solutions to Nature Based Solutions is required. Within this framework, the present work describes a methodology to enhance the Nature Based Solutions implementation by facilitating the generation, acquisition and diffusion of different stakeholders' risk perceptions. It is based on the combination of Problem Structuring Methods for the elicitation of stakeholders' risk perceptions through individual Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, and Ambiguity Analysis for the investigation of differences in risk perceptions and problem framing. The outputs of the Ambiguity Analysis, used during a participatory workshop, facilitated a dialogue aligning the divergences and promoting the social acceptance of Nature Based Solutions. These results of the implementation of this multi-step methodology in the Glinscica river basin (Slovenia) are discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite its high susceptibility to floods, the basin lacks detailed studies. Proper floodplain management is essential to reduce the impacts due to rising flood frequency, magnitude, and severity aggravated by climate change. This research applies three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to flood event data from the KRB. Ten flood conditioning factors; Aspect, curvature, distance to a river (DTR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope, rainfall, soil, stream power index (SPI), and topographical wetness index (TWI) were selected based on the multicollinearity test. The parameter performance was evaluated using the Cohen Kappa Score, with NDVI having the greatest influence, followed by elevation, DTR, curvature, and TWI. Based on the Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC), SVM outperformed RF, ANN, and ANN for FSM. The area of very high flood susceptible areas ranges from 0.8 to 2.5% of the basin area, most of them located in the south with low slopes and elevations. The results of this study suggest the use of SVM for FSM to help with proper floodplain management.

This study adopted the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model and soil conservation services curve number (SCS-CN) method to assess flood risks in Ethiope. We integrated seven factors under two criteria: hazards and vulnerability. Five risk scales were developed to represent flood risk likelihood. Results revealed that Ethiope LGAs are highly flood prone. Seven towns were at high risk of flooding (13.4%), while four towns were at very high risk of flooding (10.6%). The soil type was found to be largely homogenous though with higher degree of spatiotemporal variation in infiltration rate and moisture level. The volumetric analysis showed that surface runoff during the peak months of September in the subcatchments exceeded 2800 million cubic meters-which usually results in flooding. This novel approach to predicting flood risk proves highly effective and can be advanced further to study other deltas characterized by a stable hydrological flow regime. Analytical findings call on the authority to develop coping strategies for future flood occurrences and actively map out empirically established areas for intervention efforts.

Global warming and implications for epithelial barrier disruption and respiratory and dermatologic allergic diseases	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						Climate change; global warming; extreme temperature; pollution; epithelial barrier; allergic diseases; asthma; allergic rhinitis; atopic dermatitis	ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; MOUSE MODEL; HEAT-SHOCK-PROTEIN-70	Global warming has direct and indirect effects, as well as short -and long-term impacts on the respiratory and skin barriers. Extreme temperature directly affects the airway epithelial barrier by disrupting the structural proteins and by triggering airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. It enhances tidal volume and respiratory rate by affecting the thermoregulatory system, causing specific airway resistance and reflex bronchoconstriction via activation of bronchopulmonary vagal C fibers and upregulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 1 and TRPV4. Heat shock proteins are activated under heat stress and contribute to both epithelial barrier dysfunction and airway inflammation. Accordingly, the frequency and severity of allergic rhinitis and asthma have been increasing. Heat activates TRPV3 in keratinocytes, causing the secretion of inflammatory mediators and eventually pruritus. Exposure to air pollutants alters the expression of genes that control skin barrier integrity and triggers an immune response, increasing the incidence and prevalence of atopic dermatitis. There is evidence that extreme temperature, heavy rains and floods, air pollution, and wildfires increase atopic dermatitis flares. In this narrative review, focused on the last 3 years of literature, we explore the effects of global warming on respiratory and skin barrier and their clinical consequences.

In this review, we summarized the responses of morphological, physiological and anatomical traits in woody plants to abiotic stresses, including drought, flood, extreme temperature, salinity, heavy metal, microplastics and combined stresses, especially from the xylem perspective. Under most abiotic stress, xylem hydraulic conductivity decreases, which is associated with leaf stomatal regulation and the inhibition of aquaporin (AQP) activity. Meanwhile, woody plants regulate the size and morphology of their roots and leaves to balance water absorption and transpiration. The anatomical traits are also altered, such as denser leaf stomata, narrower conduits and thicker cell walls. In addition, different stresses have unique effects, such as flood-induced adventitious roots and aeration tissues, forest fire-induced irreversible xylem damage, low temperature-induced tissue freezing, salt stress-induced hinderance of ion absorption and heavy metal-induced biological toxicity. Under stresses of drought, flooding and heavy metals, woody plants' growth may occasionally be promoted. The effects of combined stress on the physiological, morphological and anatomical traits of woody plants are not simply additive, with the related mechanism to be further studied, especially in natural or near-natural conditions.

While there are numerous publications about flood risk management and the socio-economic consequences of floods, these have hardly been systematically dealt with in the scientific literature regarding low flows. This paper fills this gap by summarizing the current state of research in the form of a systematic literature review combining the criteria of the drivers-pressures-state-impacts-responses (DPSIR) framework with the propositional inventory method. In particular, the driving forces of low-flow events, their pressures, and the impacts on different economic sectors such as navigation, fisheries, industry, agriculture, forestry, energy, and tourism and recreation as well as resulting competitive usage claims for water and responses are presented and validated through expert interviews. In doing so, the study examines the causal chain of low-flow events and serves as a fundamental base for the future development of a damage cost database for low-flow events by preparing literature data on the socio-economic consequences of low-flow events for parameterization.

Due to the high risk of post-fire debris flows and flooding entering the city, we deployed a network of seismometers within the burn area and downstream drainages to examine the efficacy of seismic monitoring for post-fire flows. Seismic instruments were deployed during the 2019, 2020, and 2021 monsoon seasons following the fire and recorded several debris flow and flood events, as well as signals associated with rainfall, lightning and wind. Signal power, frequency content, and wave polarization were measured for multiple events and compared to rain gauge records and images recorded by cameras installed in the study area. We use these data to test the efficacy of seismic recordings to (a) detect and differentiate between different energy sources, (b) estimate the timing of lightning strikes, (c) calculate rainfall intensities, and (d) determine debris flow timing, size, velocity, and location. We then calculate forward models of seismic signals associated with debris flows and rainfall to better interpret our results and characterize these events. Our observations and modeling show that we can differentiate between these sources and that seismic data can provide insight into post-fire debris flow characteristics, including relative particle sizes and velocity.

Therefore, for drought and flood forecasting, it is mandatory to know the precipitation pattern and its trend. The objective of the research is to estimate the monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation trend employing statistical (Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's Slope (SS) estimator) and graphical (Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) method) for the Hanumangarh district of N-E Rajasthan. The mean monthly precipitation data were gathered from the India-WRIS for the period of 1901-2022 (122 years). Seasonal and annual precipitation trend variations were examined by the statistical method (MK test and SS estimator) and compared with graphical methods (ITA). The results of the study conclude that precipitation trends showed variability for the SW monsoon season from the graphical method to the statistical method. For the SW monsoon season, a decreas-ing trend was seen by using the statistical method, whereas the graphical method revealed an increasing trend. During the annual precipitation, an increasing trend was seen by using both statistical and graphical methods. It is found that the ITA method is more efficient in finding trend, because it does not assume any assumptions like that of the MK test.

Timely and effective emergency evacuation is important for reducing casualties and losses. This has become a bottleneck for emergency management. This study aimed to develop a commonly used Agent-Based Mode (ABM) for pluvial flood emergency evacuation at the city scale, exploring the cascading impacts of pluvial flooding on human behaviour and emergency evacuation. The July 2021 pluvial flood event in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, claiming 380 lives and 40.9 billion yuan in direct losses, was selected as this case study. A raster-based hydraulic model (ECNU Flood-Urban) was used to predict flood inundation (extent and depth) during an event in Zhengzhou's centre. Moreover, a comparative analysis of emergency evacuations was conducted before and after the pluvial flood event. The results showed that crowd behaviour plays an important role in an emergency evacuation, and extensive flooding leads to an 11-83% reduction in the number of evacuees. This study highlights the importance of risk education and contingency plans in emergency response. The ABM model developed in this study is proven to be effective and practical and will provide support for decision-making in urban flood emergency management.

Generally, rainwater absorption and the thermal environment in the residential areas with LID strategies are evaluated after the analysis for the former or latter, lacking simultaneous analysis tools. For filling this scarcity, this study proposes an analytical method which can be used to simultaneously evaluate rainwater absorption and the thermal environment at the scheme design stage. The volume capture ratio of typical daily rainfall and the heat island potential are used as the evaluation indexes to quantitatively analyze rainwater absorption and the thermal environment, respectively. The relationships between the two evaluation indexes and residential planning indicators are quantified using the simulation results. The comprehensive evaluation standards can be obtained from the analysis of main tasks at the scheme design stage. A case study is conducted to present how to obtain the estimation equations for the two evaluation indexes and the evaluation standards under consideration of LID strategies in the planned residential area. How to improve the residential design plan is also described in the case study.

We studied the habitat selection of these species in the subtropical salt marshes, characterizing the vegetation types where the species did and did not occur in the same habitats. The species occurred in a total of four very simplified vegetation types, characterized by the dominance of one or two plant species, including Schoenoplectus californicus, Crinum americanum, Cladium jamaicense, and Typha domingensis. We found that the habitats selected by the birds have very specific phytophysiognomic characteristics related to vegetation height and density. Moreover, the lower altitudes of certain areas of occurrence implies longer and higher flooding during periods of high tides; thus, the greater height of the vegetation maintains an above-water-level foraging and protective area for the birds. The fact that subtropical salt marshes are a transitional ecosystem suggests the possibility of rapid changes in plant succession or an intensification of the tropicalization process with mangrove expansion, which could eliminate habitat characteristics that are crucial to the survival of these two bird species in the subtropical salt marshes of Brazil.

The objective of this article is to investigate whether and how the local urban characteristics may influence the development of thunderstorms. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used with three distinct configurations of land use/cover to represent urbanization scenarios in 2017 and 1986 and the forest-only scenario. The WRF model simulated reasonably well the event. The results showed that the urban characteristics of the BMR may have an impact on storm systems in the urban areas close to the Northern Coast of South America. In particular, for the urban characteristics in the BMR in 2017, the intensification of the storm may be linked to a higher value of energy available for convection (over 1000 J kg(-1)) and favorable wind convergence and vertical shear in the urban area (where the wind speed at the surface was more than 3 m s(-1) slower than in the forest-only scenario). Meanwhile, the other land cover scenarios could not produce a similar storm due to lack of moisture, wind convergence/shear, or convective energy.

Green roofs have recently been identified as effective solutions for mitigating urban stormwater. However, discharge routes that involve receiving catchments of stormwater runoff from roofs to mitigate high flows have been limited. Thus, a hydrological model was constructed to investigate the effects of changing discharge routes on stormwater flow. Three hypothetical scenarios were assessed using various combinations of discharge routes and roof types. The reduction effects on outflow and overflow were identified and evaluated across six return periods of designed rainstorms in the Tai Hung Tulip House community in Beijing. The results showed that green roofs, together with the discharge routes connecting to pervious catchments, were effective in reducing peak flow (13.9-17.3%), outflow volume (16.3-27.3%), drainage overflow frequency, and flood duration. Although mitigation can be improved by considering discharge routes, it is limited compared to that achieved by the effects of green roofs. However, integrating green roofs and discharge routes can improve community resilience to rainstorms with longer return periods. These results provide useful information for effective design of future stormwater mitigation and management strategies in small-scale urban areas.

In this study, four widely used precipitation products, including the Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the water resources (APHRODITE), the High Asia Reanalysis (HAR), and the satellite-based precipitation estimates from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), were comprehensively evaluated by combining statistical analysis and hydrological simulation over the Upper Brahmaputra (UB) River Basin of TP during 2001-2013. In respect to the statistical assessment, the overall performances of GPM and HAR are comparable to each other, and both are superior to the other two datasets. For hydrological assessment, both daily and monthly GPM-based streamflow simulations perform the best not only at the UB outlet with very good results, but they also illustrate satisfactory results at Yangcun and Lhasa hydrological stations within the UB. Runoff simulation using HAR only performs well at the UB outlet, whereas it shows poor results at both Yangcun and Lhasa stations.

Generally, the GPM shows an encouraging potential for hydro-meteorological investigation over UB, although with some bias in flood simulation.

In 1990, a drainage and irrigation system was installed. The groundwater system is complex due to the proximity to the sea, the low slope, and the low performance of natural drainage. It is characterized by shallow groundwater and soil water logging. The flooded area is controlled by natural and artificial factors. The natural parameters are the flat slope and the soil texture. The man-made problems are caused by inappropriate irrigation and drainage deficiency. The numerical groundwater flow simulation model FEFLOW (Finite Element Subsurface Flow System) was used to simulate the groundwater depth variability. The calculated water table depth ranged from less than 0.5 m from the ground surface to more than 8 m. Based on the calibrated model, several management scenarios were investigated to study the possibilities to mitigate the problem of water logging in the perimeter. The model results showed that improving the drainage efficiency and reducing the irrigation amounts could solve the water logging problem, but not entirely. For the low flooded parts, a pumping option could be considered. The final management scheme might include the combination of all the tested management scenarios.

Public perception of flood hazards in the housing market: A revealed preference study of affect heuristics and availability heuristics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Availability heuristic; Affect heuristic; Revealed preference; Water view; Flooding risk	RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY; RISK; VALUES; INFORMATION; JUDGMENTS; IMPACT; BIAS	Are people neglecting natural hazards' risk? The two main mental accounts of how laypeople judge natural hazard risks are the availability heuristic and the affect heuristic. However, these two mental accounts have rarely been compared alongside each other. Using flood hazards, this study argues that the affect heuristic and the availability heuristic should be considered together in assessing the public perception of the risks of natural hazards. Based on preferences revealed by property transactions in the Auckland Region in New Zealand, difference-in-differences hedonic models show that the positive affect heuristic associated with coastal amenities is dominant and moderating the negative affect heuristic from flood risks. Availability-by-recall, a heuristic that exploits people direct experience of risk, conformed to public responses at best after severe flood events. The impact of the availability heuristic of severe flooding events on property prices is similarly negative in the first six months and then declining over time after controlling for coastal amenities. This study concludes with a discussion of its policy implications, including how to calibrate public perception of the risk of natural hazards due to global warming and to raise their awareness of taking action against climate change.

It is expected to persist with increasing magnitude and frequency as a result of climate change, resulting in both direct and indirect negative consequences. The flood impact assessment is considered as a key component of flood risk management strategies, such as benefit-cost analysis for mitigation planning. This research aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of socio-economic impacts of the 100 and 500-year riverine flood scenarios for major communities in the State of Iowa, United States of America. The analysis includes impact on essential facilities, businesses, vehicles, loss of life, amount of debris transported downstream, and displaced population, using Hazards-United States (HAZUS) and the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Flood Impact Analysis (HEC-FIA) functions along with GIS-based analysis. Also, we have investigated the floodplain vulnerability using the combination of flood depth and velocity. Due to the differences in the topography and the spatial distribution of buildings and infrastructure, and the absence of sufficient flood prevention measures within the study area, our findings illustrate that some communities will suffer significant damage and losses during flooding. This research could aid communities in making more effective decisions regarding damage reduction, prioritizing mitigation actions, and preparing for future flood events.

Estimation of Aufeis Resources in the Indigirka River Basin	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY			English	Article						aufeis; the Indigirka River; aufeis flow; hydrological regime; aufeis resources; permafrost zone of northeastern Russia		On the basis of corrected Landsat data for 2013-2017, a modern assessment of aufeis in the Indigirka River basin and its partial catchments with an area of 1830 to 305000 km(2) was conducted. The potential contribution of the aufeis flow to the formation of the water balance of rivers during various phases of hydrological regime was calculated. During the phase of the maximum development, the aufeis area of partial catchments ranges from 0.30 to 1.49%, reaching 0.54% of the total area of the Indigirka River basin. The aufeis resources (water content in aufeis) of the Indigirka River basin are 10.0 mm of the runoff level or in total 3.5 km(3). For individual rivers, the aufeis flow can reach 5-28 mm per year, which makes up 2.6 to 20.8% (an average is 8.1%) of river runoff. On average, water resources stored in aufeis make up 235% of the winter river flow (135% for the Indigirka River basin). The contribution of the aufeis flow during the spring flood can reach 39% and is 13.7% in the outlet of the Indigirka River basin. The ambiguous impact of climate change on aufeis (reducing their area and increasing their number) requires further detailed studies.	[Makarieva, O. M.; Nesterova, N., V; Zemlyanskova, A.

This review focuses on enhanced UV-B radiation and drought, and mitigation of their adverse effects through silicon addition. Studies on UV-B stress and addition of silicon or silicon nanoparticles have been reported for crop plants including rice, wheat, and soybean. These have shown that addition of silicon to plants under UV-B radiation stress increases the contents of chlorophyll, soluble sugars, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and UV-absorbing and antioxidant compounds. Silicon also affects photosynthesis rate, proline content, metal toxicity, and lipid peroxidation. Drought is a stress factor that affects normal plant growth and development. It has been frequently reported that silicon can reduce stress caused by different abiotic factors, including drought. For example, under drought stress, silicon increases ascorbate peroxidase activity, total soluble sugars content, relative water content, and photosynthetic rate. Silicon also decreases peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activities, and malondialdehyde content. The effects of silicon on drought and concurrently UV-B stressed plants has not yet been studied in detail, but initial studies show some stress mitigation by silicon.

Building resilience at the interface of science and practice is characterized by tensions and a range of approaches to dealing with tensions. To specify this proposition, this research note adopts a strategic spatial planning perspective and introduces the typology of "motors of change " from organizational and management research. We focus on a goal-driven motor of change ( "teleology ") and highlight three approaches to dealing with tensions: developing a strategic focus of knowledge integration, setting priorities to enhance resilience as a pro-active ability of disaster risk reduction (DRR), and compromising in the management of trade-offs, such as those between the scales of resilience. For the purpose of illustration, this research note refers to examples of building resilience at a local level in Germany, dealing with heat stress in urban areas, managing the risk of extreme flood events, and analyzing the resilience of innovative infrastructure solutions.

Recurrent flood events are a challenge for the developing economy of Pakistan in terms of damage to infrastructure and loss of lives. Flood hazard maps can be used for future flood damage assessment, preparedness, and mitigation. The current study focused on the assessment and mapping of flood-prone areas in small settlements of the major snow- and glacier-fed river basins situated in Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) under future climate scenarios. The Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model was used for flood simulation and mapping. The ALOS 12.5 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to extract river geometry, and the flows generated in these river basins using RCP scenarios were used as the inflow boundary condition. Severe flooding would inundate an area of ~66%, ~86%, ~37% (under mid-21st century), and an area of ~72%, ~93%, ~59% (under late 21st century RCP 8.5 scenario) in the Chitral, Hunza, and Astore river basins, respectively.

In the present study, uptake, translocation and accumulation of heavy metals (Cd, Zn and Cu), and their phytoavailability in six flood-tolerant Salix genotypes were investigated under simulated seasonal flooding conditions (non-flooding conditions were kept as the control). Plants were cultivated in a greenhouse with open windows using the soil polluted with Cd, Zn and Cu for 110 days. All the control (non-flooded) genotypes did not exhibit visible toxic symptoms, whereas the flooded genotypes showed leaf chlorosis and developed both lenticels and adventitious roots. Biomass production and metal accumulation in tissues varied with Salix genotypes. The flooded genotypes dramatically decreased aerial biomass production compared with corresponding non-flooded genotypes. All the control Salix genotypes showed relatively high accumulation for Cd, Zn and Cu in aerial parts due to high EDTAextractable metals in the rhizosphere, exhibiting phytoextraction features. In contrast, the flooded genotypes drastically decreased uptake, translocation, accumulation, and extraction capacities for Cd, Zn and Cu in aerial parts, differing with genotypes, and tended to phyto-stabilize them in roots, especially Cu. This study indicated that flooding is a leading factor on phytoremediation efficiency for contaminated sites with willows.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Coping strategies; Floods; Nigeria; Resilience; Vulnerability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; HEALTH	Despite efforts by the Nigerian government to improve on flood infrastructure, the yearly incidences of floods have remained unabated and put households under threats. This study examined the factors that determine households' (flood victims) choice of flood coping strategies in the Jigawa State, Nigeria. Although some of the strategies can also be considered as flood mitigation strategies, the emphasis is on coping strategies. The study used survey data from 251 randomly selected households (flood victims of 2016) and the data was analysed using multivariate probit and random forest models. The results show that factors such as sex, age, education, occupation, income, housing status, flood education and location in specific local government areas are significant in determining households' choice of flood coping strategies. Among the flood coping strategies analysed, access to credit from banks, seeking government's support and access to early warning information systems are crucial. The findings led to the conclusion that policies and programmes designed to manage and reduce flood risks must take into account the input of all relevant stakeholders, particularly the different age and income groups. The study also recommends the need for institutions in charge of flood disaster risk reduction and management to focus more on investing in non-structural measures of flood control to improve households resilience to floods.

The accurate calculation and simulation of snow melting processes can provide reliable data for flood disaster prediction. In order to make the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model more suitable for high altitude mountainous areas, the effect of the daily accumulated temperature on the precipitation pattern and snow melting is fully considered. Applying the modified model to three mountain systems with different latitudes in Xinjiang can not only improve our understanding of the characteristics of snowmelt flooding but can also be used to test the applicability of the modified model. Through comparison, it was found that the simulation accuracy of the modified model of the flood peak value was improved by 56.19%. The correlation coefficient between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and snowmelt increased from 0.27 to 0.68. This study provides a new method for accurately understanding the process of snowmelt runoff in the mountainous area and provides new insights into the effects of snowmelt runoff on vegetation growth at different latitudes.

Previous geological studies demonstrated several complete desiccation and shrinkage events in Lake Mogan since the 1800s. Archival records show at least three desiccation events in 1910, 1934 and 1938, and many severe shrinkages later. Here, the significance of climatic and anthmpogenic drivers is still a subject of curiosity. The back-analysis of the hydrological data during the regulator intervention indicates that Lake Mogan would have dried out in 1974, and would have shrunk considerably in the years 2007/2008 and 2017/2018 if human intervention was not involved. Our lake budget analysis shows that, assuming no human intervention and stream recharge, the water level of both lakes would have dropped below the threshold level in less than a week by natural downstream discharge, and the remaining volume of the lakes would evaporate in less than two years. This fact indicates the benefits of regulators for the protection of the lakes. The meteorological and lake budget data suggest that the underlying climatic threat over the studied lakes is high frequency (sub-decadal) rainfall scarcity coupled with long-term (several decades) insolation increase but not slow, steady deterioration of the climatic parameters.

The research focuses on several predictors including specific trust measures of local, state, and federal authorities, sociodemographic characteristics, and experience with flood damage. Using ordinal logistic regression, we find that residents who perceive the levee system as unlikely to protect their homes and the city are significantly more likely to perceive an increased risk of flooding. Previous flood experience, age, female gender, and race were also significant predictors of flood risk perception. In contrast to prevailing risk research that has found that general trust and general confidence negatively affect risk perception, our findings show mixed support for the hypothesis that higher levels of confidence and trust result in lower perceptions of risk. Our findings reveal the nuances of risk perception and suggest that specific notions of trust and confidence can have positive and negative influences on flood risk perception depending on respondent views toward flood protection systems and specific institutions and government agencies.

In this study, the impacts of the Tekeze hydropower dam on downstream hydrology and river morphology were investigated, including impacts under normal and extreme reservoir operation conditions. Field observations, in-depth interviews, repeat terrestrial photographs, multi-year high-resolution satellite images, daily reservoir water levels and data on hourly to daily energy production were collected and studied. The results show that high flows (Q(5)) have declined (with factor 5), low flows (Q(95)) have increased (with factor 27), seasonal flow patterns have smoothened, river beds have incised (up to 4 m) and locally aggraded near tributary confluences. The active river bed has narrowed by 31%, which was accelerated by the gradual emergence ofTamarix niloticaand fruit plantations. A new post-dam equilibrium had been reached until it was disrupted by the 2018 emergency release, caused by reservoir management and above-normal reservoir inflow, and causing extensive erosion and agricultural losses downstream. Increased floodplain occupation for irrigated agriculture consequently provides an additional argument for reservoir operation optimization to avoid future risks for riparian communities.

Commuting behavior adaptation to flooding: An analysis of transit users' choices in Metro Manila	TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Flooding; Commute behavior adaptation; Beliefs; Choice modeling	TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; WEATHER VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL MEDIA; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; RISK; IMPACTS; MEMORY; CITY	People are likely to adapt their everyday travel behavior when faced with adverse weather conditions like flooding. Variations in their usual travel routine often manifest in changes made in departure time, transport mode use or route taken, or cancellation of travel. The current study aims to understand how commuters in Metro Manila adjust their travel behavior in response to flooding events. Questionnaire data collected among employees demonstrate that in Metro Manila adaptation of commute behavior in response to flood events occur more often during the trip to work than during the return to home, and mostly consist of changes to the departure time. In addition, the outcomes for a series of binary logit models are consistent with the claim that whether adaptations are made to commuting behavior primarily depends on the respondent's commute and employment situation. Perceived flood characteristics sociodemographic profile and commuters' beliefs about changes over time in the frequency of flood events all played a role but were much less weakly associated with the inclination to adapt commuting behavior. Recommendations for transit agencies and employers are derived from the analysis so that affected travelers can adapt to travel conditions during flood events without compromising commitments in the household or in the workplace.

Hardwood floodplain forests are temperate lowland broad-leaved forest ecosystems typical of extensive river valleys. In Central Europe, stands represent biodiversity hotspots for woody species (as habitats for rare tree species such as Ulmus laevis and Populus nigra), but also host numerous fungi and animal species typical of floodplains. Since floodplains have been subject to river regulation activities for centuries, to date less than 10% of the former natural area of floodplain forests remained. Current threats are overexploitation, cultivation of non-native tree species, floodplain construction projects accompanied by drainage, eutrophication, invasive species, and outbreaks of elm and ash dieback by fungi infections and climate change. River flooding constitutes an important abiotic site factor, which in turn is responsible for site-specific disturbance processes such as ice drift, sedimentation or erosion. Remnants of near-natural hardwood floodplain forests are of outstanding conservation value and deserve protection within large-scale nature reserves in riverine landscapes. Successful restoration requires to reestablish the flooding regime, as a precondition for the reintroduction of important plant, fungi, and animal species originating from appropriate donor populations.

Have natural lake expansion and landscape inundation resulted in mercury increases in flooded lakes of the Great Slave Lowlands (Northwest Territories, Canada)?	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Contaminants; Flooding; Lake sediments; Paleolimnology; Mercury	METHYL MERCURY; HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIRS; ORGANIC-MATTER; VEGETATION; SEDIMENTS; DEPOSITION; FISH; SOIL; METHYLMERCURY; DYNAMICS	The inundation of terrestrial vegetation following landscape flooding is an important potential source of mercury to aquatic ecosystems, and may modify mercury cycling, such as through increased methylation. In the Great Slave Lowlands of Canada's Northwest Territories, remarkable landscape flooding has occurred over the recent past, which is the most notable in at least the last several centuries. The potential for this flooding to increase inorganic mercury flux to the lakes of the region has not yet been explored. In this study we used sediment cores from five lakes experiencing a range of recently documented lake expansion to test whether inundation of terrestrial areas has increased the total mercury concentrations in sediments, and resulted in increased total mercury flux. Increases in sedimentary mercury concentrations and fluxes in sediment cores from the expanding lakes were relatively small and within the range of non-expanded systems, suggesting that, to date, flooding has not resulted in major total mercury enrichment, unlike in experimental and natural reservoir impoundments. The potential for increased methylation of existing inorganic mercury following expansion was not explored in this paper because methylmercury is dynamic in sediments and does not preserve well, but is an important consideration for future work.

The ever-widening impervious area in urban watersheds also continuously augments runoff volume. Most measures to prevent urban inundation are structural, such as the construction, rehabilitation, and replacement of urban drainage facilities. Because structural measures require time and money, nonstructural measures are also required for the efficient prevention of urban inundation. Current operations in Korea focus on the individual operation of urban drainage facilities while neglecting the status of effluent streams. A study on urban drainage facilities that considers the status of urban streams is necessary to improve the operation of drainage facilities in urban areas. A revised resilience index is suggested to evaluate measures. For the historical rainfall event in 2010, the system resilience for current and integrated operations was 0.199 and 0.238, respectively. For the 2011 event, the system resilience for current and integrated operations was 0.064 and 0.235, respectively. The integrated operation exhibited good performance for the 2010 and 2011 events. Based on the results of this study, an operation as a nonstructural measure for the total management of urban areas is proposed. The revised resilience index could support decision-making processes for flood-management plans.

Effects of reservoir size and boundary conditions on pore-pressure buildup and fault reactivation during CO<sub>2</sub> injection in deep geological reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Global warming; Climate change; Porous media; Ground surface deformation; CO2 sequestration	STORAGE; SEQUESTRATION; FIELD; BASIN; FLOW; DIP	The excessive burning of the fossil fuels has caused severe global climatic changes such as increasing the global temperature, causing initiation of the wild fire, rising the sea level, increasing the floods, storms, amount of rain and snow. One of the effective global mitigation strategies is sequestration of huge quantity of CO2 deep below the ground level for a long period of time. An important issue is to ensure the permanency and safety of the sequestration process due to the associated pore-pressure buildup. It is necessary to have correct estimates of the pore-pressure buildup, ground uplift and re-activation of any existing fault during the process of CO2 injection and long-term storage. In this investigation, the effects of reservoir size and boundary conditions are investigated by means of geomechanical modeling of the deep Biyadh sandstone reservoir in Saudi Arabia. Currently, carbon dioxide is not injected into the actual Biyadh reservoir. In this investigative modeling, CO2 is injected for an injection period of ten years using a single injection well at the center of the reservoir. The developed modeling scheme for a single injection well has been extended further to include multiple injection wells. For multiple injection wells, the reservoir size and locations of injection wells are varied to evaluate their effect on the pore-pressure buildup and ground uplift. The reservoir stability analysis has been performed using Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for both small and large reservoir models, with the same injection parameters. The simulation results demonstrated that pressure buildup and ground uplift are relatively higher for reservoirs with small sizes and closed boundaries; while in the case of large sizes and open boundaries, the pore-pressure buildup and ground uplift are relatively lower. Moreover, the effect of the reservoir size and boundary conditions on the reactivation of faults during CO2 injection has been evaluated. The stability analysis performed in this study shows that injecting CO2 into larger size reservoir is safer as compared to smaller size reservoir. Injecting CO2 with multiple injection wells will cause pore-pressure buildup of huge magnitudes. The modeling results show that suggesting a representative volume for the reservoir during CO2 injection can under-estimate the pore-pressure buildup and fault re-activation that can cause the reservoir failure and leakage of the stored CO2.

However, there is an urgent need to evaluate the social outcome of this flood adaptation policy given the unequal exposure of vulnerable populations to flood impacts. Here, we use two additional evaluation criteria - equity of benefit distribution and population exposure reduction, along with economic benefit, to assess the social and economic outcomes of five land acquisition strategies in the United States. Under an assumed budget of US$1 billion, we found that land acquisition would generate an economic benefit of US $6.06 to $10.56 billion, ensure an equitable distribution of benefit, and remove 266,000 to 593,000 people from future flood risks. Compared to acquiring lands with high benefit-cost ratios, strategically acquiring lands in poorer and more populous areas would improve both social outcomes with only low to moderate reductions (13 %-43 %) in the economic efficiency. As global flood risk is projected to rise with disproportionate impact on the poor, our research highlights the social and economic capacities of strategic land acquisition for nationwide flood adaptation.

Extreme rainfall is one of the direct and key causes of urban flooding, and accurate rainfall estimates at high spatiotemporal resolution are of great significance for real-time urban flood forecasting. Using existing rainfall intensity measurement technologies, including ground rainfall gauges, ground-based radar, and satellite remote sensing, it is challenging to obtain estimates of the desired quality and resolution. However, an approach based on processing distributed surveillance camera network imagery through machine learning algorithms to estimate rainfall intensities shows considerable promise. Here, we present a novel approach that first extracts raindrop information from the surveillance camera images (rather than using the raw imagery directly), followed by the use of convolutional neural networks to estimate rainfall intensity from the resulting raindrop information. Evaluation of the approach on 12 rainfall events under both daytime and nighttime conditions shows that generalization ability, and especially nighttime predictive performance, is significantly improved. This represents an important step toward achieving real-time, high spatiotemporal resolution, measurement of urban rainfall at relatively low cost.

Rigid pavements are not as sensitive to the strength of underlying layers, so one potential method to improve the resilience of existing asphalt pavements is to construct concrete overlays. In this analysis, typical asphalt pavement sections on collector and arterial streets under Iowa climatic and soil conditions are identified and evaluated under a variety of theoretical flooding scenarios to determine the impact of inundation on service life. Three types of concrete overlay designs are developed for these typical asphalt pavement sections under the same conditions. A life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is performed to compare the costs and performance of the concrete overlay strategies to a conventional flexible pavement rehabilitation strategy under the theoretical flooding scenarios. The results of the LCCA indicate that a variety of concrete overlay designs can provide more cost-effective performance when pavement foundation layers become inundated, depending on the roadway functional class and frequency of flooding. These findings indicate that concrete overlays can be a useful method for improving resilience of existing flexible pavements and mitigating the costs of flood damage.

This study evaluates the different rainfall events categorized by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) over the lower Kosi and Punpun river basin using the gridded rainfall data of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees resolution for the period of 1979-2018. Further, the linkage between Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) and rainfall events is examined. The daily accumulated rainfall shows large variation over the Kosi river basin in compare to the Punpun basin. The number of days of moderate and heavy rainfall over the lower Kosi River has significantly decreased. In addition, light and moderate rainfall over Punpun River has also decreased; however, it is nonsignificant. No significant trend in very heavy rainfall is found for both the river basin. It is observed that the number of days in moderate rainfall events shows an acceptable negative correlation with Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) over basins. This study will be helpful for the mitigation and prevention of disasters and sustainable water resource management under changing climate.	[KUMAR, A. M. I. T.; KUMARI, A. M. I. T.

Unfortunately, there are not many works devoted to practical solutions to this problem in the literature. To fill this gap the article presents the results of interdisciplinary research on the reclamation of inland salt marshes on the example of a nature reserve in Central Europe. The reserve's vegetation, soil seed bank, soil, water and land geology were analysed. To reclaim the area, it was proposed using brine from a nearby health resort. This solution has been analysed in terms of salinity and sanitary safety. The results of the analyses showed that the use of brine to regularly flood the reserve's meadow should result in spontaneous restoration of the habitat rich in halophyte biodiversity. Additionally, conservation and restoration of natural saline biodiverse habitats that can be a source of new crop plants or salinity tolerance genes is important due to the growing problem of salinity in global agriculture. Therefore, presented results could inspire scientists, stakeholders and policymakers in the sustainable management of nature and human infrastructure.

More automatic mapping could support risk assessments of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, a type of natural hazard that poses a risk to communities and infrastructure in valleys below glacial lakes. We propose and evaluate several approaches that incorporate labels from a 2015 survey using Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off imagery to guide segmentation on newer higher resolution satellite images such as Sentinel 2 and Bing Maps imagery, comparing them also to approaches that do not use this form of weak prior. We find that a guided version of U-Net and a properly initialized form of morphological snakes are most effective for these two datasets, respectively, each providing between an 8-10% intersection-over-union improvement over existing U-Net segmentation approaches. An error analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of each method. We design visualizations to support the discovery of lakes of potential concern, including an interactive exploratory interface. All the codes supporting our study are released in public repositories.	[Ortiz, Anthony; Dodhia, Rahul; Ferres, Juan M.

Global Sensitivity Analysis of Groundwater Related Dike Stability under Extreme Loading Conditions	WATER			English	Article						groundwater; flood defenses; sensitivity analysis; dike stability; flood safety	HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; UNCERTAINTY; RELIABILITY; VARIABLES; MODEL	With up to 15% of the world's population being protected by dikes from flooding, climate-change-induced river levels may dramatically increase the flood risk of these societies. Reliable assessments of dike stability will become increasingly important, but groundwater flow through dikes is often oversimplified due to limited understanding of the important process parameters. To improve the understanding of these parameters, we performed a global sensitivity analysis on a comprehensive hydro-stability model. The sensitivity analysis encompassed fifteen parameters related to geometry, drainage conditions and material properties. The following three sensitivity settings were selected to characterize model behavior: parameter prioritization, trend identification and interaction qualification. The first two showed that dike stability is mostly dependent on the dike slope, followed by the type of subsurface material. Interaction quantification indicated a very prominent interaction between the dike and subsurface material, as it influences both groundwater conditions and dike stability directly. Despite our relatively simple model setup, a database containing the results of the extensive Monte Carlo analysis succeeded in finding most of the unsafe sections identified by the official inspection results. This supports the applicability of our results and demonstrates that both geometry and subsurface parameters affect the groundwater conditions and dike stability.

A Model of Optimal Operation of Drainage Works (MOODW) for flat irrigation district was established by incorporating the hydrological model of waterlogging process and waterlogging loss estimation, which was solved by an optimization method of genetic algorithm. The model of waterlogging process was built based on a modified Tank model and hydrodynamic model for the ditch-river system. The waterlogging loss is calculated under the condition of inconstant inundated depth by linear interpolation. The adaptive genetic algorithm with the global optimization function was selected to solve the model. With an extreme rainfall events in Gaoyou irrigation district as cases, results showed that operation time and numbers of pumps increased; thus, operating costs were 1.4 times higher than before, but the yield loss of rice decreased by 35.4% observably. Finally, the total waterlogging loss was reduced by 33.8% compared with the traditional operation of waterlogging work. The most significant improvement was found in units with high waterlogging vulnerability. The MOODW can provide the waterlogging information visually and assist the district manager in making a reasonable decision.</p>	[Liu, Zhenyang; Xu, Juzeng; Yang, Shihong] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhenyang; Xu, Juzeng; Yang, Shihong; Jiang, Zewei] Hohai Univ, Coll Agr Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Yujiang] Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Liu, Fangping] Jiangxi Irrigat Expt Cent Stn, Nanchang 330201, Jiangxi, Peoples R China	Hohai University; Hohai University; Yangtze River Water Resources Protection Bureau	Xu, JZ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.; Xu, JZ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Agr Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.	zhenyangliu@hhu.edu.cn; xiongyj@mail.crsri.cn; xjz481@hhu.edu.cn; ysh7731@hhu.edu.cn; zwaq@hhu.edu.cn; lfp1224@sina.com	, xujunzeng/AGY-0464-2022; Liu, Zhenyang/JXN-5786-2024; Yang, Shihong/AAM-2188-2020; Jiang, Zewei/AAX-6910-2021	Liu, Zhenyang/0000-0002-8453-5744; Jiang, Zewei/0000-0001-6077-5244; Yang, Shihong/0000-0001-7176-8648; Xu, Junzeng/0000-0003-1467-7883	National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1508303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51709010]; Central Public-Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute [CKSF2019174/NY]; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Project of Jiangxi Province [201921ZDKT06, 202124ZDKT09]	National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Central Public-Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Project of Jiangxi Province	This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1508303), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51709010), the Central Public-Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute (CKSF2019174/NY) and the Water Conservancy Science and Technology Project of Jiangxi Province (201921ZDKT06, 202124ZDKT09).		34	4	4	1	21	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4441		WATER-SUI	Water	OCT	2021	13	20							2811	10.3390/w13202811	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13202811			17	Environmental Sciences; Water Resources	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources	WM7PA		gold			2024-04-22	WOS:000711271900001

Managing coastal flood risk to residential properties in England: integrating spatial planning, engineering and insurance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Coastal flood risk management; Resilience; Insurance; Spatial planning; Flood protection engineering	STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT; LAND-USE; MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE; UK; FRANCE; RESPONSIBILITY; PARTICIPATION; REALIGNMENT; ADAPTATION	Flooding is the most damaging natural hazard in England today. Coastal flood risk management aims to reduce the impacts of coastal flooding through adaptation measures including spatial planning, engineered hard and soft interventions, and insurance. Yet there are few reviews which collectively assess these measures. This paper aims to characterise and evaluate coastal flood risk management policy in England across planning, engineering and insurance approaches, focusing on their ability to manage risk to residential properties. An analysis of the literature and government reports reveals that together these management approaches address the different dimensions of flood risk. Nonetheless, the three approaches are legislated and regulated in relative isolation, and in their current formation have contrary implications for existing and future residential developments. There is also further scope to increase the resilience of planning, defence and insurance to social and environmental uncertainties in financing, governance and climate change. We recommend that future research and strategies in coastal flood risk management give greater consideration to multiple flood risk management approaches in conjunction, continuing to expand the integration between planning, engineering and insurance approaches.

J	Marone, E; Bohle, M				Marone, Eduardo; Bohle, Martin			Geoethics for Nudging Human Practices in Times of Pandemics	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						geoethics; social-ecological systems; ethical imperatives; COVID-19 pandemic; responsible science	RESPONSIBILITY; POLICY	Geoscientists developed geoethics, an intra-disciplinary field of applied philosophical studies, during the last decade. Reaching beyond the sphere of professional geosciences, it led to professional, cultural, and philosophical approaches to handle the social-ecological structures of our planet 'wherever human activities interact with the Earth system'. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 and considering geoscientists' experiences dealing with disasters (related to hazards like tsunamis, floods, climate changes), this essay (1) explores the geoethical approach, (2) re-casts geoethics within western philosophical systems, such as the Kantian imperatives, Kohlberg scale of moral adequacy, Jonas' imperative of responsibility, and (3) advances a 'geoethical thesis'. The latter takes the form of a hypothesis of a much broader scope of geoethics than initially envisioned. That hypothesis appears by suspecting a relationship between the relative successes in the COVID-19 battle with the positioning of agents (individual, collective, institutional) into ethical frameworks. The turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic calls for the transfer of experiences between different disciplinary domains to further sustainable governance, hence generalizing the geoethical approach. It is emphasized that only when behaving as responsible and knowledgeable citizens then people of any trade (including [geo-]scientists) can transgress the boundaries of ordinary governance practices with legitimacy.

But its impacts always exist on physical and social environment of the area. The present study was conducted in the River Satluj basin which is well known for its hydropower potential. The main objective of the study was to understand the vulnerability of the Satluj basin and to develop a strategy for the development of hydropower projects. This basin has been facing many problems relating to construction of haphazard development of hydropower projects. This has led multi-hazards like landslides, floods, earthquakes, etc. Here, vulnerability assessment index was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Geographical Information System and peoples' perception were used to study these aspects in the basin. The parameters considered for vulnerability assessment were slope, slope profile, relative relief, curvature, slope aspect, soil texture, lithology, river morphometry, precipitation, hydroelectric projects, land use and land cover, mass-movement, flood, geological elements and earthquake occurrences. The highest vulnerability was found in the middle zone, and finally on the basis of parameters analyzed; the hydropower's development strategy was developed.

An economic evaluation of adaptation pathways in coastal mega cities: An illustration for Los Angeles	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Adaptation pathways; Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Flood risk analysis; Uncertainty; Sea level rise	SEA-LEVEL RISE; REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS; RESILIENCE; LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS	Sea level rise and uncertainty in its projections pose a major challenge to flood risk management and adaptation investments in coastal mega cities. This study presents a comparative economic evaluation method for flood adaptation measures, which couples a cost-benefit analysis with the concept of adaptation pathways. Our approach accounts for uncertainty in sea level rise projections by allowing for flexibility of adaptation strategies over time. Our method is illustrated for Los Angeles County which is vulnerable to flooding and sea level rise. Results for different sea level rise scenarios show that applying adaptation pathways can result in higher economic efficiency (up to 10%) than individual adaptation strategies, despite the loss of efficiency at the initial strategy. However, we identified 'investment tipping points', after which a transition could decrease the economic efficiencies of a pathway significantly. Overall, we recommend that studies evaluating adaptation strategies should integrate cost-benefit analysis frameworks with adaptation pathways since this allows for better informing decision makers about the robustness and economic desirability of their investment choices.

The Ratio between Chronographic and Geographic Variation in the Morphofunctional Features of Bank Vole (Clethrionomys glareolus Shreb.) in the South of Its Range	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						population; bank vole; mandible; chronographic variation; morphofunctional changes; geometric morphometrics	POPULATION	-A simultaneous analysis of the chronographic variation of the mandible of bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus Shreb.) in three longitudinally distant populations that inhabit floodplain forests of Sakmara and Samara rivers in the south of the species range (Orenburg oblast) has revealed significant morphogenetic and morphofunctional changes in each of these populations over 33 years. Changes in the shape of the mandible in allochronous vole samples (1983 and 2015) have been detected using methods of geometric morphometrics. Morphofunctional rearrangements have been assessed based on mandibular indices, which characterize differences in the structure of the mandible resulting from changes in functional loads after a shift in diet. Significant changes in the mandible shape and in the values of these indices have occurred in all allochronous populations. Chronographic variation in the mandible shape in all populations has similar direction in the morphospace; its range exceeds that of geographic variation and reflects a significant historical rearrangement of morphogenesis. The authors discuss the probable relationship of rapid morphogenetic and morphofunctional changes in vole mandibles to the transformation of local trophic conditions caused by different directions of plant successions, which, in turn, are related to local trends of climate changes.

Therefore, this study develops ARMT (automatic combined ground weather radar and CCTV (Closed Circuit Television System) images for real-time flood monitoring), which integrates real-time ground radar echo images and automatically estimates a rainfall hotspot according to the cloud intensity. Furthermore, ARMT combines CCTV image capturing, analysis, and Fourier processing, identification, water level estimation, and data transmission to provide real-time warning information. Furthermore, the hydrograph data can serve as references for relevant disaster prevention, and response personnel may take advantage of them and make judgements based on them. The ARMT was tested through historical data input, which showed its reliability to be between 83% to 92%. In addition, when applied to real-time monitoring and analysis (e.g., typhoon), it had a reliability of 79% to 93%. With the technology providing information about both images and quantified water levels in flood monitoring, decision makers can quickly better understand the on-site situation so as to make an evacuation decision before the flood disaster occurs as well as discuss appropriate mitigation measures after the disaster to reduce the adverse effects that flooding poses on urban areas.

Under the circumstances of an increasingly severe risk situation, it is necessary to enhance urban disaster resilience. Based on the disaster resilience process of prevention, absorption, and enhancement, and considering the safety factors such as personnel, facility, environment and management, this paper forms a dual dimension of the urban disaster resilience assessment model covering the key elements of urban disaster response and the core capacity of urban disaster recovery. Furthermore, if taking into account the characteristics of rainstorm and flood disasters, the paper screens the key indicators to build up an assessment index system of an urban rainstorm and flood disaster. The practical application was implemented in Beijing to have an assessment of the ability to recover from rainstorm and flood disasters in all districts of Beijing. And then, some pertinent suggestions for enhancing the resilience of Beijing to rainstorm and flood disasters were proposed.

With the holistic depiction of the current status, this study quantified rainfall, estimated land cover change and analyzed the drainage system in the western part of Dhaka. Statistical analysis and logarithmic graph fitting methods were used to develop a strong correlation between short-duration and daily rainfall. Land cover maps from 1990 to 2020 were generated using supervised classification in ERDAS IMAGINE, and the future land cover was predicted using the Terrset software with the CA Markov method. This research found that the build-up region increased by about 70% during the last 30 years while about 15.64 km2 of wetland was encroached during the past 15 years leading to the failure of existing drainage network. The assessment of rainfall demonstrated that the extreme events aggravated the issue. Restoration of natural canals is required for activating proper drainage system in the city.

We also find among the four extreme weather events such as droughts, extreme temperature, floods, and storms that floods have the most prominent adverse impact on green innovation. Furthermore, the significantly negative effect of extreme weather is manifested in countries with a high level of corruption and low level of trade openness, but not in the countries with a low level of corruption and a high level of trade openness. Lastly, we show that extreme weather events have an adverse impact on green innovation by decreasing economic growth level, hindering financial development, widening income inequality, damaging the accumulation of human capital, and increasing the political risk.

Observations have demonstrated increasing trends in extreme precipitation in North America, and models and theory consistently suggest continued increases with future warming. Here, we address the question of whether observed changes in annual maximum 1- and 5-d precipitation can be attributed to human influence on the climate. Although attribution has been demonstrated for global and hemispheric scales, there are few results for continental and subcontinental scales. We utilize three large ensembles, including simulations from both a fully coupled Earth system model and a regional climate model. We use two different attribution approaches and find many qualitatively consistent results across different methods, different models, and different regional scales. We conclude that external forcing, dominated by human influence, has contributed to the increase in frequency and intensity of regional precipitation extremes in North America. If human emissions continue to increase, North America will see further increases in these extremes.

As a direct impact of climate change, the frequency and intensity of these events are also expected to increase in the future. This paper presents a comprehensive review of a four-phase resilience assessment of coastal bridge structures, namely, (i) characterization of external wave induced forces, (ii) structural response of bridges, (iii) vulnerability assessment of damaged components, and (iv) post-disaster recovery. The four comprehensive modules are adopted from the classic framework of PEER PBEE and constitute the integrated knowledge needed for the prediction of the resilience of infrastructure under extreme wave-induced loads. The study also presents new expressions for resilience restoration that simultaneously account for the time, resources (cost) and environmental impacts of different recovery options with variable importance levels to different stakeholders.

Ecological challenges for the use of soil and water bioengineering techniques in river and coastal engineering projects	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							STREAMBANK STABILIZATION; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; BANK STABILIZATION; PLANT DIVERSITY; EROSION; INVASIONS; GRADIENT; HABITAT; CLIMATE; DESIGN	A major challenge for the modern river and coastal management is a holistic design approach in order to integrate flood and erosion protection combined with ecological restoration. Nowadays, a lot of EU regulations request nature-based engineering solutions such as soil and water bioengineering techniques (SWBE). In contrast to conventional 'hard' civil engineering structures, the idea of SWBE structures is the use of biological components in the engineering structure to not just consider a technical function, but also ecological and aesthetic values. While SWBE techniques are applied worldwide and well established as an engineering discipline, there is a high demand on the further development specifically in terms of ecology. The use of plants in river engineering projects requires the right choice of species depending on the techniques used and the environmental conditions. Furthermore, a right harvest, storage and implementation of the plants is significant. Their use also requires the quantification of the hydraulic and sedimentological impact of riparian vegetation on the one hand and on the other hand to know the impact of SWBE structures on the aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Different ecological, vegetational and phytosociological criterias are available and discussed in terms of assessment of SWBE structures. All these criteria can be helpful to develop a framework supporting stakeholders to define objectives, design, implementation work and to assess the post-construction lifetime phase, which is most relevant for SWBE structures. From a wider point of view, when looking at the multitaxonomic diversity in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, it has been shown that SWBE techniques could enhance global riparian habitat quality by allowing a greater richness and density of pioneer tree species. The use of phytosociology has become more important for the application of SWBE structures as nature-based vegetation composition. Specific challenges arise for river managers and practitioners with invasive alien species and climate change forcing us to redefine what is meant by 'non-native' species. Therefore, using a local and historical phytosociological typology to define the reference to be achieved could become increasingly misleading. By analyzing the ecological value of SWBE structures, another aspect must be considered from an ecological point of view. The possible negative impacts on ecosystems caused by SWBE measures, during the period of construction (e.g., emissions, energy consumption, intervention in nature) should be taken into consideration. A popular methodology to provide the possibility of achieving a better understanding of environmental burdens and to assess the potential environmental impact of products or services is environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). We are faced with the problems of climate change which means that we have to optimize our civil engineering (including SWBE) construction activities in terms of positive effects, for example urban heat islands or carbon storage and also any potential negative effects, for example emission of greenhouse gases or energy demand. We must critically examine our model of the SWBE approach, the application of SWBE techniques does not automatically mean an ecological improvement. SWBE systems are dynamic and always different, depending on their field of application. A harmonization of strategies and goals needs to be developed in order to support coherent measures aimed at improving the ecological status of river bodies, coastal areas and at the same time, guaranteeing hydraulic safety and adequate protection of human activities from hydromorphological hazards (flooding, floodplain erosion, failure of river and coastal-related infrastructures).

Enabling pathways for sustainable livelihoods in planned relocation	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							MANAGED RETREAT; RESETTLEMENT; DISPLACEMENT; VILLAGE; LESSONS; FSQCA	The planned relocation of entire communities to less hazard-exposed destinations is an increasingly salient climate change adaptation strategy but often results in maladaptive livelihood outcomes. There needs to be understanding of how planning decisions affect outcomes-relocated people's access to sustainable livelihoods, including physical, economic, natural, human, social and cultural assets. Here, drawing on data from 14 completed flood-related relocation cases, we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and find that planning decisions, alone and taken together, contributed to sustainable livelihood outcomes. Relocation processes initiated and driven by community members had better outcomes than government-driven processes, adding a global comparative perspective to prior findings. Speed and transfer dynamics were also critical, with different implications for small and large communities. As a result, multiple pathways of planning decisions can lead to better outcomes, highlighting potential entry points for policy to promote more sustainable and people-centred planned relocation. Planned relocation can be an adaptation approach to avoid damages from increasing natural hazards yet concerns over maladaptive outcomes remain. Based on flood-related relocation cases, this study highlights the importance of community engagement in enabling sustainable livelihoods.	[Bower, Erica R.

Coral reefs are highly effective at reducing wave energy and thereby diminishing the impact of both flooding and erosion in coastal areas. Understanding these benefits, and their spatial distribution, can play a critical role in driving efforts to protect or even restore coral reefs, with critical societal benefits. Simple, high-resolution models were used to generate a global map which suggests that 26 % of the coastline of the world's coral reef nations receive some protection benefits, and that, over decadal periods some 5.3 million people and $109 billion of GDP are protected by coral reefs. Separate maps show the values at the shore and plot the reefs providing those values. Differences exist between metrics (population, GDP and night-time lights as a metric for infrastructure) raising the importance of considering ecosystem service values with multiple metrics, including non-monetary values. Patterns of protection are highly heterogeneous, however many of the most important areas are adjacent to highly developed shores and many of these receive little or no management attention.

J	Meng, M; Dabrowski, M; Xiong, L; Stead, D				Meng, Meng; Dabrowski, Marcin; Xiong, Liang; Stead, Dominic			Spatial planning in the face of flood risk: Between inertia and transition	CITIES			English	Article						Policy change; Spatial planning; Planning tradition; Flood resilience; Climate adaptation; Path dependence	PATH DEPENDENCE; NONSTRUCTURAL MEASURES; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; LESSONS; CITY	Given the greater risk of flooding in cities due to climate change, spatial planning systems are increasingly expected to contribute to flood resilience. However, incorporating expanded adaption measures in conventional planning practices remains a major challenge due to institutional barriers. Based on the theories of historical institutionalism in relation to path divergence, this paper aims to understand the factors which determine the fate of innovations and departures from established practice. Using Guangzhou as a case study, the paper traces the history of the city's struggle against flooding from the 1920s onwards, building on documentary analysis, mapping and interviews. The findings highlight a deeply rooted attachment to engineering-based solutions to tackle flood risk. It also indicates that departing from an established path to embed nature-based and non-structural solutions in the planning system is more likely to take place in response to changing socioeconomic needs and strong institutional support for changes, rather than in response to major flooding events. These findings provide lessons for policymakers and urban planners seeking to enact new policies to enhance flood resilience in spatial planning.

Soil texture and environmental conditions influence the biogeochemical responses of soils to drought and flooding	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							GLOBAL WATER CYCLE; ORGANIC-MATTER; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CARBON; INTENSIFICATION; BACTERIA; DEGRADATION; POTENTIALS	Climate change is intensifying the global water cycle, with increased frequency of drought and flood. Water is an important driver of soil carbon dynamics, and it is crucial to understand how moisture disturbances will affect carbon availability and fluxes in soils. Here we investigate the role of water in substrate-microbe connectivity and soil carbon cycling under extreme moisture conditions. We collected soils from Alaska, Florida, and Washington USA, and incubated them under Drought and Flood conditions. Drought had a stronger effect on soil respiration, pore-water carbon, and microbial community composition than flooding. Soil response was not consistent across sites, and was influenced by site-level pedological and environmental factors. Soil texture and porosity can influence microbial access to substrates through the pore network, driving the chemical response. Further, the microbial communities are adapted to the historic stress conditions at their sites and therefore show site-specific responses to drought and flood. Soil texture governs chemical responses of soils to water stress while environmental conditions and disturbance history influence microbial community responses in incubations of soil cores from Alaska, Florida and Washington, USA.

The study was performed using daily values of river discharge at 29 gauging stations for hydrological years 1976-2014. The results show regionally specific patterns, such that seasonality is high for the lowland rivers (low flows occur during the warm season), while in the upland rivers a 10- to 15-year cycle is observed. Increasing trends in warm-season temperature and a decrease in humidity were observed; however, no direct correlation with low flows was found. These results suggest that the initiation and maintenance of low-flow events over some regions are more sensitive to local surface water and groundwater circulation conditions than to atmospheric drivers, especially when the recurrence interval of events is low, and that the primary mechanisms driving and maintaining low-flow conditions can change over relatively small spatial scales.

Investigating environmental changes as the driving force of agricultural intensification in the lower reaches of the Yellow River: A case study at the Sanyangzhuang site	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Agricultural intensification; Environmental changes; The Yellow River; Sanyangzhuang	HOLOCENE ASIAN MONSOON; HIGH-RESOLUTION; HENAN PROVINCE; CHINA; RECORD; CAVE; TECHNOLOGY; SEDIMENTS; WHEAT	In many different societies around the world, people transitioned from slash-and-burn agriculture to an intensive mode of agricultural production. However, why agriculture was increasingly intensified by early farmers remains less understood. This study investigates the driving forces of agricultural intensification from an environmental perspective. Based on our fieldwork at the Sanyangzhuang site and previous paleoclimatic studies, we reconstruct the depositional processes and climatic changes at Sanyangzhuang and its surrounding area between 5000 yr BP and 2000 yr BP. Data suggest that farmers in the lower reaches of the Yellow River were confronted with increasingly severe Yellow River flooding and drier and colder climate during this time period. The environmental changes increase risks of crop failure and famine, disrupt the equilibrium of the social system and induce a process that brings about initial agricultural intensification. This environmental pressure is aggravated by social/political factors and results in the further development of agricultural intensification.

This study explored differences in the precipitation estimates and trends of 12 widely applied precipitation datasets, including gauge-, satellite-, and reanalysis-based products, for the world's 6,292 river basins. Results showed that disparities between the 12 precipitation datasets were considerable. A total of 3,125 river basins, with a land area of 5,989.1 x 104 km(2), had differences in estimated annual average precipitation exceeding 500 mm year(-1), and these basins were mainly distributed in Greenland, Africa, Oceania, and West Asia. Disparities between the precipitation datasets were particularly large during the dry season when the percentage difference between the highest and lowest precipitation estimates exceeded 500% in 1,390 river basins (4839.7 x 104 km(2)). Differences in rainfall trends also varied markedly between data sources. The data products do not agree on precipitation trends for all the river basins. These findings illustrate the importance of accurate precipitation data to ensure effective policy and planning in terms of hydropower generation, domestic water supply, flood protection, and drought relief at the river basin scale and highlight the uncertainty that exists in current global precipitation data.

J	Mukherjee, J; Ghosh, S				Mukherjee, Jayesh; Ghosh, Surajit			Decoding the Vitality of Earth Observation for Flood Monitoring in the Lower Godavari River Basin, India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; WATERS	The entire Indian subcontinent experienced devastating floods in the year 2022. The central section of the Godavari river basin (GRB) received torrential rainfall from the southwest monsoon during the second week of July 2022. This study exhibits how Earth observation (EO) datasets and cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) can be used for swift, lucid and accurate decoding of the flood inundation signatures. Geospatial analysts can estimate concurrent floods using high-resolution C-band SAR/Sentinel-1 images, gridded precipitation and streamflow forecast datasets. The GPM (IMERG) precipitation data showed an incremental trend with prime hotspots, rainfall dissemination and retrieval from 01-20 July 2022 in the mid-GRB. The flood inundation layers were derived based on Otsu's method with selective topographic conditions from Sentinel-1 in GEE. Five significant flood affected case sites were identified in the lower GRB from Kothapalli to Yanam town, where the Godavari river meets the Bay of Bengal. Large stretches of agricultural lands were found to be inundated, resulting in extensive economic losses. Such flooded farmlands surrounding Kothapalli, Bhadrachalam, Kunavaram, Polavaram and Yanam towns were estimated as 60, 91, 86, 170 and 142 km(2) on 16 and 21 July 2022, respectively. The results were validated and cross-verified using bulletins and maps issued by various national agencies. Hence, EO, GEE and cloud analytical techniques are modern untapped potential e-assets vital for incorporation in policy frameworks helping disaster managers with comprehensive flood condition analysis.

Based on the commonly used category of flood damages, the flood damage of Syracuse was divided into loss of buildings and loss of population. The results showed that the city's center would have the highest damage rate for buildings and a total of 1139 buildings would be inundated, of which 326 buildings would be severely damaged by more than 80%. Furthermore, about 7390 people would be directly affected by the flood event, among which approximately 900 people might lose their lives. Communities near Onondaga Creek were assigned designated evacuation shelters based on the accessibility and distance to the shelters. The shortest available evacuation routes were calculated. More shelters should be provided in the central downtown area, with its large population, and distributed along the western bank of Onondaga Creek. This research offered a first approximate flood loss estimation that might lead to more attention and studies concerning a potential flood hazard in the future. It also provided science-based guidelines for city authorities to refer to in practical flood hazard mitigation.

We specifically detail the IPGP in two contrasting coastal temperate ecosystems under the influence of rivers highly rich in nutrients: the Bay of Brest and the Bay of Vilaine. In both coastal ecosystems, we observed a large interannual variation in the IPGP influenced by sea temperature, river inputs, light availability (modulated by solar radiation and water turbidity), and turbulent mixing generated by tidal currents, wind stress, and river runoff. We show that the IPGP is delayed by around 30 d in 2019 in comparison with 2010. In situ observations and a one-dimensional vertical model coupling hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry, and sediment dynamics show that the IPGP generally does not depend on one specific environmental factor but on the interaction between several environmental factors. In these two bays, we demonstrate that the IPGP is mainly caused by sea surface temperature and available light conditions, mostly controlled by the turbidity of the system before first blooms. While both bays are hydrodynamically contrasted, the processes that modulate the IPGP are similar. In both bays, the IPGP can be delayed by cold spells and flood events at the end of winter, provided that these extreme events last several days.

Increasing agricultural water productivity by reducing the amount of irrigation water without affecting the yields, especially in paddy rice, is necessary. This is possible with alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation. This study was conducted under greenhouse conditions at Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan to evaluate the response of yield, water productivity and harvest index with different water regimes. The experiment was performed in pots with four water regimes as treatments and three replications, making 12 pots. The water regimes were continuous flooding irrigation as control and three AWD conditions-AWD5, AWD10 and AWD15-in which pots were irrigated when water reached 5, 10 and 15 cm soil depth, respectively, after the disappearance of surface ponding water. Yield components, harvest indexes and water productivity showed no significant difference (p < 0.05) between irrigation treatments. In this research, as there is more than a 25% reduction in water use and only 6.4% in grain yield, AWD15 was considered the best irrigation practice among the other treatments. This study provides data reference for theoretical scientific knowledge and understanding of safe AWD practice for countries facing water shortages.

The peak discharge of flashfloods and rainwater harvesting (RWH) was assessed by the integration of GIS, the RS tool and hydrologic modeling. This approach is still under further improvement to fully understand flashflood and rainwater harvesting potentialities. Different morphometric parameters are extracted and evaluated; they show the most hazardous sub-basins. Vulnerability potential to flooding is high relative to steep slopes, high drainage density, and low stream sinuosity. Using hydrologic modeling, lag time, concentration time, peak discharge rates, runoff volume, rainfall, and total losses are calculated for different return periods. The hydrologic model shows high rainfall rates, and steep slopes are present in the southeastern part of the study area. Low rainfall rates, moderate-high runoff, and gentle slopes are found in the central and downstream parts, which are suitable sites for rainwater harvesting. An analytic hierarchy process is utilized for mapping the best sites to RWH. These criteria use land-cover, average annual max 24 h rainfall, slope, stream order, and lineaments density. About 4% of the basin area has very high potentialities for RWH, while 59% of the basin area has high suitability for RWH. Ten low dam sites are proposed to impact flooding vulnerability and increase rainwater-harvesting potentialities.

The purpose of this study is to visualize the knowledge background, research status, and knowledge structure of relevant literatures by using a Citespace based scientometrics survey. The results show that UR is an increasingly popular topic, with 2629 articles published during the study period. (1) The most prolific publications and journals involved in the flourishment of UR research were identified by co-citation. The United States was the most productive contributor, with numerous publications and active institutions. Journal of Cleaner Production, Sustainability, International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction were the three most cited journals. (2) Co-occurrence analysis was employed to determine the highly productive keywords, and subject categories in the UR domain, including "environmental science & ecology", "environmental sciences, "science & technology", "environmental studies", "green & sustainable science & technology", and "water resources". (3) The diversity of highly cited authors in different countries and regions confirmed the evolution of UR studies. (4) Furthermore, the classification of UR knowledge was performed in the form of clusters and knowledge structure to achieve ten distinct sub-domains (e.g., Urban floods and stormwater management, Urban ecosystem services, Urban landscapes, and Trauma). This study provides an overview of UR research and research topics so that future researchers can identify their research topics and partners.

However, little is known about the function of hydrological factors in influencing the seasonal dynamics of plankton. We used multivariate and Partial Least Squares Path Modeling to analyze the seasonal variation in crustacean zooplankton and related environmental factors from winter 2009 to winter 2016 in Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China. We found a distinct seasonal pattern in zooplankton development, which deviated, in part, from the PEG model, as we found indications of (1) a weaker degree of food limitation in winter and spring, likely due to high concentrations of allochthonous sources caused by decomposition of seasonally flooded hygrophytes, also affecting sediment dynamics; (2) a peak in crustacean zooplankton biomass in summer when the water level was high (and predation was lower), and where horizontal transport of zooplankton from the littoral zone to the pelagic was possibleand (3) a higher predation pressure in autumn, likely due to a shrinking water volume that left the fish concentrated in less water. The majority of these differences can be attributed to the direct or indirect impacts of physical factor variation.

Risk of nest flooding in a population of the Magdalena River turtle (<i>Podocnemis lewyana</i>) inhabiting the climatic equator in northern Colombia	SOUTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Nest mortality; Podocnemididae; Reproductive ecology	SEX DETERMINATION; SOUTH-AMERICA	We quantified nesting activity and incidence of nest flooding in a population of the Magdalena River turtle (Podocnemis lewyana), which inhabits the climatic equator in northern Colombia, during two dry seasons when beaches formed ("verano"-December to March-and "veranillo"-July and August). Nesting activity was concentrated in the verano period, despite the presence of suitable nesting habitat in both dry season periods. More than half of all nests were harvested by local people, and 42.5% of the nests in both dry seasons that survived harvest were subsequently lost to flooding due to rises in the river to approximately a 4.15 m level. We used this value as a threshold value for the appearance of beaches and inspected a 44-year data base on river levels in this area. The verano and veranillo nesting periods did not differ in terms of opportunities for successful nesting, but there was evidence that the veranillo nesting season has increased significantly in duration in recent years, as well as experienced fewer flooding events. It is not clear why nesting each year is principally concentrated in the verano nesting season, but the evidence that this section of the Magdalena River is drying more in recent years during veranillo may entail a new threat to this population if it implies that non-nesting habitat (adjacent wetlands and channels) might eventually disappear.

Perceptions and realities of hydroclimatic change affecting Guyanese rice farming	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Guyana; Agriculture; Rice; Hydroclimate; Perceptions; Small Farmers; Key Informants	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FARMERS PERCEPTION; GAUGE OBSERVATIONS; ADAPTATION; SMALLHOLDER; PRECIPITATION; MODEL	This study explores small farmers' perceptions of changes in climate across Guyana's rice producing regions. Qualitative, primary data were collected from a random sample of 189 small farmers, supplemented with 28 key informants, from across Guyana's five main rice producing regions. The most prevalent perception related to precipitation among farmers is an increase in rainfall year-round (56%), while for informants, it is an increase in rainfall intensity (81%). When considering the atmospheric conditions of temperature and humidity, farmers (88%) and informants (96%) overwhelmingly perceive warmer conditions. Considering weather and climate volatility, farmers (72%) and informants (82%) most prevalently perceive an increase in excess rainfall/flooding, but secondly, farmers (58%) and informants (71%) communicated a perceived increase in drought. Secondary quantitative hydroclimate data support the perception of a wetter climate, and to some degree, increased hydroclimatic volatility. Precipitation is critical to rice cultivation, and the data sets, combined, signal a wetter Guyanese climate, which has major economic implications for small farmers, the broader rice industry, and the economy of Guyana. However, granularity in farmers' perceptions suggests a need for more detailed hydro climate monitoring across Guyana.

This study hereby seeks to propose a modeling framework for urban flood analysis in ungauged drainage basins. A platform called "RainyDay" combined with a nine-year record of hourly, 0.1 degrees remotely sensed rainfall data are used to generate extreme rainfall events. These events are used as inputs to a hydrological model. The comprehensive characteristics of urban flooding are reflected through the projection pursuit method. We simulate runoff for different return periods for a typical urban drainage basin. The combination of RainyDay and short-record remotely sensed rainfall can reproduce recent observed rainfall frequencies, which are relatively close to the design rainfall calculated by the intensity-duration-frequency formula. More specifically, the design rainfall is closer at high (higher than 20-yr) return period or long duration (longer than 6 h). Contrasting with the flood-simulated results under different return periods, RainyDay-based estimates may underestimate the flood characteristics under low return period or short duration scenarios, but they can reflect the characteristics with increasing duration or return period. The proposed modeling framework provides an alternative way to estimate the ensemble spread of rainfall and flood estimates rather than a single estimate value.

Trends were identified using statistical tests (regression analysis, Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests). New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Almost 12 % of the sites show a trend in the magnitude of AM and frequency, and 6% show a trend in the magnitude of POTs. Globally, more negative trends have been detected, but the proportion of positive trends is higher in the Scheldt catchment than in the Meuse catchment. The results of nonstationary analysis indicate important changes in the magnitude of the 100-year flood (up to 18 % increase/11 % decrease in 10 years) and the frequency of peak flows (up to 42 % increase/31 % decrease). These changes could therefore impact future flood risk management in Wallonia. However, the time-series are short (30-50 years) and some uncertainty remains. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the trends is essential to obtain better estimates of future flood flows. A first analysis of potential drivers reveals that changes in precipitation match the trends in high flows, and lower snowfall quantities and higher evapotranspiration rate, caused by the increase in temperature, could have contributed to the decrease in high flows in some regions.

A key gap in our understanding of the causality of disasters remains establishing how spatially and temporally distant factors - 'root causes' - drive local risk conditions. This is particularly the case for small-scale but high-impact disasters. It includes understanding the role that institutions play in influencing such pathways of risk production. This paper addresses this question using a holistic approach to risk analysis that links past drivers to contemporary conditions. We apply this in three case studies of coastal flood management in urban areas of differential size and integration within the European Union - Rethymno (Crete), Genoa (Italy) and St Maarten (Dutch Caribbean). The paper reveals the importance of local institutions in mediating the impacts of higher-level economic and political changes on local risks. It provides new empirical evidence of the relationship between austerity, institutional reform and local disaster risk reduction. The analysis supports a stronger causal epistemology of resilience to disasters but also leads to re-consideration of the institutional entry points for risk reduction, and the importance of considering context and trade-offs.

Vulnerability assessment for flash floods using GIS spatial modeling and remotely sensed data in El-Arish City, North Sinai, Egypt	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flash floods; Vulnerability assessment; Composite Index; GIS; Remotely sensed; Multi-criteria analysis; Wadi El-Arish; Sinai; Egypt	LAND-COVER; DRAINAGE DENSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL; CATCHMENT; HAZARD; INDEX; PARAMETERS; FRAMEWORK; KINGDOM	Egypt suffers from freshwater crisis, and the shortage is predicted to become severe by 2025. Egypt is exposed to flash floods, especially in Sinai governorate, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time and can trigger other catastrophic hazards associated with damage, danger to human life, properties and environment. Flash floods may be considered a source of water that can be explored to meet the water shortage problem. In this study, a composite flash floods vulnerability index based on an integrated hydro-climatic and physical vulnerability component was created. The composite index was based on eight parameters including rainfall distribution, elevation and slope, flow direction, streams, geomorphological features, soil type and land cover. The composite index was ranked into three categories: high, moderate and low. The index can help identify the weak and strong points to support the decision-making process concerned with water management as an essential prerequisite for Egypt sustainable development. The results revealed that the urban, vegetation cover, loamy sand, sand dunes, the low elevation and the flat areas are the most affected by the flash floods in EL-Arish City in Sinai governorate. 42% of Wadi El-Arish had low vulnerability, 45% moderate vulnerability and 13% high vulnerability.

Furthermore, heavy rainfall frequency has increased because of climate change, thus exceeding the design frequency and resulting in sewer pipes' lack of flood control capacity, with damage expanding from low-lying areas. Despite many urban disaster-mitigation policies, complex causes and uncertainties make reducing urban inundation damage difficult. This study established a rainfall-related disaster-prevention standard by time duration considering rainfall characteristics targeting urban disaster-induced inundation damage. Based on the South Korean urbanization rate and population, seven target regions were selected. Rainfall by time duration was analyzed with respect to disaster length (number of days) from 2010-2017. The average rainfall for durations from 1-24 h were analyzed according to disaster length (1-13 days). Using the results, an equation was proposed for rainfall estimation by length of disaster resulting in urban inundation damage, through multiple regression analysis. An equation was developed for rainfall-related disaster-prevention in urban areas considering the length of disaster and rainfall duration. This was accomplished by selecting a duration whereby the average rainfall of duration corresponded to 50% of total rainfall during the disaster period.

The volume of water contained in a snowpack is quantified by snow water equivalent, the near-real-time estimation of which is essential to issue early warnings against snow-melt floods. We propose a new approach for rapid and high-resolution estimation of snow water equivalent for small mountainous basins, employing unmanned aerial vehicles known as drones. Numerical maps of snow water equivalent are automatically produced for subareas of a river basin by combining drone-based snow depth maps with snow density estimates. The reconstructions for subareas are extrapolated to the entire river basin using a zonal version of multiple linear regression. Validation is conducted on the example of the Kwisa river in southwestern Poland by balancing drone-based snow water equivalent with snow-melt runoff separated using a hydrologic model from discharges continuously measured during a thawing period. Differences between the drone-based and reconstructed snow-melt runoff are found to be of -11.2, +1.6 and +18.9%, providing evidence for the considerable worth skills of the new drone-based flood risk assessment method.

J	Li, YC; Cheng, LY; Miao, CY; Liu, ZY				Li, Yichan; Cheng, Linyin; Miao, Chiyuan; Liu, Zhiyong			Observational Uncertainty for Global Drought-Pluvial Volatility	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATURAL HAZARDS; PRECIPITATION; FLOOD; RISK; INDEX; WET; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY	Droughts and pluvials have occurred in most regions in the past. However, what calls growing attention is the additive effects of these two opposite extreme events occurring in spatial-temporal proximity to one another, sometimes beyond either of the hazards individually. This study examines the likelihood of global drought-pluvial volatility which involves both meteorological drought-to-pluvial (DTP) and pluvial-to-meteorological drought transitions; meanwhile, identifies discrepancies and agreements among the widely used observations for such events, an aspect that remains currently overlooked. Globally, we find that the observation-based data sets including Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC), Climate Research Unit (CRU) and ERA5 reach a good agreement in estimating the event transition rates, with an average 15.46% (15.49%) of all meteorological droughts (pluvials) being succeeded by pluvials (meteorological droughts) in the following season. At the regional scale, our results reveal that the spatial variability and frequency associated with meteorological DTP transitions are slightly larger than that with pluvial-to- meteorological drought transitions, but the observational uncertainty is more pronounced in the latter case as a result of greater uncertainty in the univariate drought depiction and enhanced regional divergence among the observed data. In general, GPCC and CRU exhibit higher consistency, albeit with less agreement under pluvial-to- meteorological drought transitions, while ERA5 yields underestimations and reduced spatial variability considering both transition scenarios. The study highlights a need of using multiple independent observation-based data sets for compound/multivariate extreme analysis, particularly in the context of climate-related decision-making, water resources planning, and future model validation studies. As the planet continues to warm, climate changes express themselves most obviously through the earth's water cycle, fueling more intense and frequent droughts and pluvials, even at the exact same location. While the uncertainties related to individual droughts/pluvials in model-observation and observation-observation comparisons are usually reported, uncertainties in the observational references of their compound events remain weakly explored. Accurate observational references in this regard can assist identifying geographical hot spots of drought-pluvial seesaws with increased confidence, evaluating whether models represent the hydrological cycle well, and making their joint risk assessment more convincing-whereas, large discrepancies or even inaccurate observations could limit the capability for event monitoring and attribution, model validation and decision making. Our study consists of three flavors: first, we investigate the likelihood of drought-pluvial volatility, measured through rapid meteorological DTP and pluvial-to- meteorological drought transition rates over global land areas; second, we demonstrate observational uncertainty associated with such events by analyzing three widely used observation-based data sets; lastly, we provide evidence of enhanced intra-annual drought-pluvial volatility in a number of regions that are consistently supported by these data sets. The research findings can have important implications for climate-related decision-making, water resources planning, and future model validation studies.

Mean daily discharge data recorded by Bangladesh Water Development Board were collected and analyzed for the period of 1995-2019. Stream flow characteristics were determined in terms of different parameters including mean annual runoff discharge, specific water yield, run-off ratio, peak flow, seasonal flow and flow duration. Various statistical measures including mean, standard deviation, co-efficient of variation, lag-1 serial correlation, Mann Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were applied to justify these parameters. The mean annual runoff discharges of 2167.77 and 1490.61 million cubic meters (mcm) were measured at the gaging stations at Sangu and Matamuhuri watershed, respectively. Matamuhuri basin showed higher value of specific water yield (1.52 mcm/sq. km) compared to the Sangu basin (1.02 mcm/sq. km). The average annual runoff coefficient value of Sangu watershed was found 0.36 while in case of Matamuhuri watershed it was about 0.49. The mean annual peak discharges of 25 years were found 607.63 m3s-1 and 628.42 m3 s-1 at Sangu and Matamuhuri watershed, respectively. Mann-Kendall Test (MK) and Sen's Slope Estimator method were applied for temporal trend analysis. An increasing trend in runoff observed during wet season which may cause flash floods and a decreasing trend observed during dry season that may cause water scarcity in Sangu-Matamuhuri watershed area. Flow duration curves based on 25 years' hydrological data were developed which showed pro-gressive reduction in flows over time in both the watersheds for three periods 1995-2002, 2003-2010 and 2011-2019 with major changes occurred in Matamuhuri watershed during 2011-2020 which might be due to the impact of land use and land cover changes as well as changes in precipitation pattern. Implications of these findings indicate baseline information that can be used to evaluate the impacts of land use changes and climate change, and thereby may facilitate the planning and local management of water resources in the long term.

Estimating the costs of these disasters is one of the five global research priorities identified by WHO. The 2018 Japan Floods hit western Japan causing extensive destruction and many deaths, especially among vulnerable elderly. Such affected elderly would need long-term care due to the various health problems caused by the disaster. A Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) system provides care services in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the 2018 Japan Floods on LTCI costs and service utilization. Methods The participants of this retrospective cohort study were all verified persons utilizing LTCI services in Hiroshima, Okayama and Ehime prefectures. The observation period was from 2 months before to 6 months after the disaster. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to examine the association between disaster status (victims or non-victims) and the monthly total costs of LTCI service (with gamma-distribution/log-link) by residential environment (home or facility). Among home residents, we also examined each service utilization (home-based service, short-stay service and facility service), using the GEEs. After the GEEs, we estimated Average Marginal Effects (AME) over all observation periods by months as the attributable disaster effect. Results The total number of participants was 279,578. There were 3024 flood victims. The disaster was associated with significantly higher total costs. The AME for home residents at 2 months after was $214 (Standard Error (SE): 12, p < 0.001), which was the highest through the observation period. Among facility residents, the AME immediately after the disaster increased by up to $850 (SE: 29, p < 0.001). The service utilization among home residents showed a different trend for each service. The AME of home-based services decreased by up to - 15.2% (SE:1.3, p < 0.001). The AME for short-stay service increased by up to 8.2% (SE: 0.9, p < 0.001) and the AME for facility service increased by up to 7.4% (SE: 0.7, p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions The 2018 Japan Floods caused an increase in LTCI costs and the utilization of short-stay and facility services, and a decrease in utilization of home-based services.

Thermokarst lagoons are an important transition stage with complex depositional histories during which permafrost and lacustrine carbon pools are transformed along eroding Arctic coasts. The effects of temperature and salinity changes during thermokarst lake to lagoon transitions on thaw history and lagoon deposits are understudied. We analyzed two 30-m-long sediment cores from two thermokarst lagoons on the Bykovsky Peninsula, Northeast Siberia, using sedimentological, geochronological, hydrochemical, and biogeochemical techniques. Using remote sensing we distinguished between a semi-closed and a nearly closed lagoon. We (1) characterized the depositional history, (2) studied the impact of marine inundation on ice-bearing permafrost and taliks, and (3) quantified the OC pools for different stages of thermokarst lagoons. Fluvial and former Yedoma deposits were found at depth between 30 and 8.5 m, while lake and lagoon deposits formed the upper layers. The electrical conductivity of the pore water indicated hypersaline conditions for the semi-closed lagoon (max: 108 mS/cm), while fresh to brackish conditions were observed beneath a 5 m-thick surface saline layer at the nearly closed lagoon. The deposits had a mean OC content of 15 +/- 2 kg/m(3), with higher values in the semi-closed lagoon. Based on the cores we estimated a total OC pool of 5.7 Mt-C for the first 30 m of sediment below five mapped lagoons on the Bykovsky Peninsula. Our results suggest that paleo river branches shaped the middle Pleistocene landscape followed by late Pleistocene Yedoma permafrost accumulation and early Holocene lake development. Afterward, lake drainage, marine flooding, and bedfast ice formation caused the saline enrichment of pore water, which led to cryotic talik development. We find that the OC-pool of Arctic lagoons may comprise a substantial inventory of partially thawed and partially refrozen OC, which is available for microbial degradation processes at the Arctic terrestrial-marine interface. Climate change in the Arctic leading to sea level rise, permafrost thaw, coastal erosion, and sea ice loss may increase the rate of thermokarst lagoon formation and thus increase the importance of lagoons as biogeochemical processors of former permafrost OC.

The effective evaluation of LID facilities in sponge cities is of great guiding significance for the promotion and construction of sponge cities. IFMS (Integrated Flood Modeling System) Urban was selected to construct the rainstorm simulation. LID parameters were added to simulate the improvement of urban waterlogging after the construction of sponge city. A reasonable disaster loss assessment method was used to calculate the disaster mitigation benefit brought by the construction of sponge city. Through the comparison of the inundation situation before and after LID facilities' construction, it can be concluded that the mitigation effect of LID facilities on the overall inundation area of the city decreases with the increase of rainfall recurrence period, with the maximum reduction rate reaching 13.63% in the 5-year recurrence period and the minimum reduction rate of 11.06% in the 50-year recurrence period. LID facilities have a better disaster reduction effect for rainfall events with a small recurrence period than for rainfall events with a large recurrence period.

Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing have proved to be effective tools in delineation to find the drainage pattern and different geometric methodologies of geomorphologic watershed management. Even GIS has been widely used in several flood management, and environmental applications. The river Beki with an area of 19,354.35 sq. km2 originates at the Himalayan glacier (Kula Kangri glacier in Bhutan) at 26.18 & DEG;N latitudes and 90.53 & DEG;E longitudes and flows through the plains of Assam and finally to the mighty Brahmaputra at 26.48 & DEG;N latitudes and 91.02 & DEG;E longitudes have been selected for a detail analysis morphometric parameters. Morphometric parameters via; Circularity ratio, Elongation ratio, Compactness ratio, etc. were measured for prioritization and compound parameter values were calculated. The local people from this study will be able to utilize the resources in the right manner for a sustainable water resource development of the basin area. Moreover, the study can also be referred to as a benchmark for studies on temporal change in geomorphology resulting from climate change. Various Morphometric analyses explain the physical properties of the watershed, which are important for land use planning, soil conservation, terrain elevation, and soil erosion.

It begins with an overview of what frazil ice is and what is required for the occurrence of frazil ice events, namely a supercooled water column. Methodologies to anticipate frazil ice events in the short term are based on air temperature and water discharge, underlining the significance of these two parameters for any predictive methods. Longer-term approaches, calibrated against past events (hindcasting), are used to anticipate frazil ice activity into the future (forecasting), with indicators such as frazil ice risk, water temperature and frazil volume. Any of these approaches could conceivably be applied to frazil-prone river stretches. To assess climate impact, each location should be treated separately. River ice dynamics can lead to the formation of a hanging dam, a frequent outcome of frazil ice generation in the early winter, causing flow restriction. Flood modeling and forecasting capabilities have been developed and implemented for operational use. More frequent mid-winter breakups are expected to extend the occurrence of frazil ice events into the winter months - the prediction of these will require climate model output to adequately capture month-to-month variability.

This study investigates the changes in LULC and its impact on water resources of the Wabi Shebele basin using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and a separation method. Surface and groundwater parameters in the northwestern; and soil and surface parameters in the eastern highland and southern lowland parts of the basin are identified as sensitive parameters in water production. The coverage of cropland was increased by 48.63% while forest and woodland decreased by 49.14 and 14.76%, respectively, between the 1980s and 2010. Streamflow simulated during this period indicates increases in those watersheds showing significant cropland increases and forest coverage decreases particularly in Wabi at Dodola, Maribo, Robe, and Erer watersheds. Flood indices (i.e., AMAX, SMW, SMSp, and SMSu) calculated from simulated daily streamflow under different LULC map indicates an increase in the middle and northwestern watersheds up to 1.83 and 0.44%, respectively. The impact level of LULC change on flood discharge shows a comparable level with climate change impact on flood hazard particularly in the middle part of the basin.

Most of these systems are based on powerful tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI methods for high-flow extremes prediction. The review starts with an overview of the state-of-the-art AI techniques and examples of their application, followed by a SWOT analysis to benchmark their predictive capability based on set of criteria. Finally, the most suitable AI methods for short-term and/or long-term prediction, based on a rigorous suitability assessment are proposed. As a result, Fourteen AI methods have been identified. Their evaluation revealed that the methods that averagely behave the best for achieving high-flow extremes prediction are ANNs, SVMs, wavelets and Bayesian methods, at all-time scales. The latter, as stochastic methods, have the privilege by their cheap computation cost, their reliability and ability to handle hydrological uncertainty, and their capacity to perform causal relationships between features. This study also urges researchers to further explore the predictive potential of decision trees, ensembles, CNNs, MARS, GP and agent-based methods for high-flow extremes.

During the last deglaciation substantial volumes of meltwater from the decaying Laurentide Ice Sheet were supplied to the Arctic, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic along different drainage routes, sometimes as catastrophic flood events. These events are suggested to have impacted global climate, for example initiating the Younger Dryas cold period. Here we analyze the authigenic Pb isotopic composition of sediments in front of the Arctic Mackenzie Delta, a sensitive tracer for elevated freshwater runoff of the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet. Our data reveal continuous meltwater supply to the Arctic along the Mackenzie River since the onset of the Bolling-Allerod. The strongest Lake Agassiz outflow event is observed at the end of the Bolling-Allerod close to the onset of the Younger Dryas. In context of deglacial North American runoff records from the southern and eastern outlets, our findings provide a detailed reconstruction of the deglacial drainage chronology of the disintegrating Laurentide Ice Sheet.

This process, and its generalisation on a global scale, affect directly the basic functions of the soil, increasing other problems such as the loss of biodiversity, pollution, soil degradation, flooding and the effects of climate change. In the study area (Mazarron, Region of Murcia) this problem is exemplary: the binomial urban development associated with the increase of beach tourism and intensive agriculture (under greenhouses) alter drastically the nature of the soil. The aim of this paper is twofold: to establish a supervised classification model that distinguishes, with an assumable error, the different classes established, highlighting those considered as sealed surfaces and, in addition, to make a comparison with the latest Corine Land Cover available information (2018). For this purpose, Sentinel 2A satellite images were selected and a maximum likelihood classification was performed. To validate the results, a confusion matrix was developed and an overall accuracy of 89% was obtained. Finally, a significantly underestimation by the Corine Land Cover of 75% of the sealed surfaces was observed, mainly due to its resolution.

Therefore, an effective and environmental protection waterproof system is essential. The mobile flood protection wall not only has the flood control capacity comparable to the traditional flood control system but also has a better landscape effect that can meet the needs of residents. However, the mobile flood protection wall presently lacks the basis of practical application and theoretical calculation. Therefore, this paper provides a theoretical calculation method for strains and stresses on a mobile flood protection wall and carries out a real test to verify the reliability of the theoretical calculation. A test pool was built to obtain the data of the strain of the mobile flood protection experiments and reflections on the risk wall during the impoundment process by strain gauge and data acquisition instrument. Through the theoretical calculation method provided in this paper, the actual test conditions are calculated, and the results obtained in the test are mutually validated. The test validates that the mobile flood protection wall is reliable in practical engineering, and the proposed calculation method can be applied to the mobile flood protection wall.

Here, we compare the ecology, economy, and social network of a community of traditional fishers in the Brazilian Pantanal between the dry season and the flood season in which their wetland ecosystem is transformed. Using data derived from satellite imaging we show that during the flood season of 2019 the total amount of open water accessible to fishers more than doubled and led to drastic qualitative changes. We show that although fishers adapted to this extreme seasonality by changing where, how, and what they fish between seasons, the structure of the social network in our study community did not differ. We argue that strong networks are especially important in social-ecological systems with extreme seasonal changes. More generally, we suggest that case studies of seasonal adaptation such as ours can contribute to a broader understanding of how communities may be able to successfully adapt to novel social-ecological changes.

Additionally, the 2020 typhoon season had below average activity with especially quiet activity during the first half of the season in the western North Pacific (WNP). Sea surface temperature changes in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans all contributed to the heavy rainfall in China, but the Atlantic and Indian Oceans seem to have played dominant roles. Enhancement and movement of the Siberian High caused a wavier pattern in the jet stream that allowed cold polar air to reach southward, inducing cold surges in China. Large vertical wind shear and low humidity in the WNP were responsible for fewer typhoons in the first half of the typhoon season. Although it is known that global warming can increase the frequency of extreme weather and climate events, its influences on individual events still need to be quantified. Additionally, the extreme cold surge during 16-18 February 2021 in the United States shares similar mechanisms with the winter 2020/21 extreme cold surges in China.

If the inlet structure is blocked, the urban drainage system is hampered, leading to urban flooding. To quantitatively analyze the influence of clogging conditions on inlet discharge capacity, laboratory experiments were conducted to address the impact of different inlet clogging conditions on inlet discharge capacity under different upstream discharge conditions. These were based on a two-layer platform that mimicked a complete inlet structure including a drainage grate, a rainwater well, and a connecting pipe. The results show that the water flow near the inlet was similar to weir flow when the rainwater well was not full, whereas the water flow state near the inlet behaved similarly to orifice flow after becoming full. In addition, it was found that the clogging extent and position can significantly influence the comprehensive discharge capacity of the street inlet. The experimental dataset was used to calculate the inlet discharge coefficients of the weir and orifice flow states under different clogging conditions. The results are applicable to research addressing the formation mechanisms of urban floods. Additionally, this study is of practical significance for early warning systems and emergency response support during heavy rainfall.

J	Emeis, S				Emeis, Stefan			Analysis of decadal precipitation changes at the northern edge of the Alps	METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT			English	Article						precipitation; statistics; flash floods; data analysis3mm	CLIMATE; EXTREMES; TEMPERATURE; EUROPE; TRENDS; MODEL	Precipitation data from four weather stations in Bavaria, Germany, situated at the northern edge of the Alps have been evaluated for the period 1901 to 2019. Decadal changes have been computed as sliding 30-year averages and as the difference between the 30-year periods 1990-2019 and 1901-1930. The annual precipitation at these four stations increases, fitting in magnitude roughly to the temperature increase in the course of global warming. The number of dry days slightly increases as well as a consequence of a northward shift of the storm tracks over Europe. Due to these two features the precipitation intensity on wet days increases. The increase in maximum daily precipitation amounts is less than the increase in the annual precipitation amount. The observed maximum daily precipitation in the full four datasets is 138.5 mm at the station HohenpeiBenberg in 1999. The length of dry spells is increasing at three of the four stations as well. The overall observed precipitation patterns fit to the findings of regional climate model simulations for future climate scenarios for this region. Thus, they can be interpreted as signs that climate change is well underway in Southern Bavaria as it is in most places of the world.

A and C support base flow in the sub-basin upstream of Sierra Vista. A, B, and C combine to support base flow near St. David. Source C in this area is ancient deep-basin groundwater. Source C dominates in Cascabel near Benson Narrows, with downstream additions from A. In Cascabel near Gamez Road, sources A and C combined to support base flow that had disappeared by 2019. Near Redington, source C appears to have operated through a limestone aquifer vulnerable to short-term drought. Groundwater sub-basins separated by impermeable sills in the riverbed are evolving into hydrologically separate subbasins as base flow across the sills decreases. The decrease in base flow partly reflects regional long-term drought, which has been exacerbated by pumping. Additional groundwater demand from urban growth upstream of Benson is likely to cause further decline of base flow near St. David and Sierra Vista.

Climate change may increase their incidence by altering the epidemiology of waterborne pathogens through changes in rainfall patterns. To assess potential impacts of future changes in rainfall patterns, we analyzed 33,927 cases of diarrhea across all Ministry of Health clinical facilities in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador, for a 24-month period from 2013 to 2014, using mixed-effects Poisson regression. We assessed the association between the incidence of diarrheal diseases and heavy rainfall events (HREs) and antecedent rainfall conditions. In rural areas, we found no significant associations between HREs and incidence. In urban areas, dry antecedent conditions were associated with higher incidence than wet conditions. In addition, HREs with dry antecedent conditions were associated with elevated incidence by up to 1.35 (incidence rate ratio, 95% CI: 1.14-1.60) times compared with similar conditions without HREs. These patterns may be driven by accumulation of fecal contamination during dry periods, followed by a flushing effect during HREs. This phenomenon is more important in dense urban environments with more impervious surfaces. These findings suggest that projected increases in rainfall variability and HREs may increase diarrhea burden in urban regions, which are rapidly expanding globally.

J	Molenveld, A; van Buuren, A				Molenveld, Astrid; van Buuren, Arwin			Flood Risk and Resilience in the Netherlands: In Search of an Adaptive Governance Approach	WATER			English	Article						IAD framework; adaptive governance; multi-level safety; untaming	INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; CLIMATE; SUSTAINABILITY; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; LESSONS; MODES	In the Netherlands, dealing with the risk of flooding in the face of the current climate change requires a governance approach that is less based upon the long-standing tradition of prevention and protection, and more oriented toward ideas of resilience and adaptivity. Such an approach is assumed to be more resilient compared to static approaches and better equipped to deal with the indeterminate character of a problem like flood risk. This article presents the Dutch attempt to introduce a more polycentric and adaptive governance approach in flood management, called multilayered safety (MLS). We studied this approach via interviews and an extensive document study, and analyzed the institutions governing the issue using the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework of Elinor Ostrom. For years, the issue was in the hands of a small network of actors, mainly occupied by water experts and governed by a strong lead organization and permanent bodies. While introducing a new, more adaptive policy concept the government encountered both resistance and inability within the existing policy regime. This article shows that the issue of flood safety was successfully 'tamed' for decades. Adopting a more adaptive and polycentric approach necessitates 'untaming' the issue of flood safety.

A partition of the combined impacts of socioeconomic development and climate variation on economic risks of riverine floods	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						benefit-cost appraisal; climate change; flood mitigation; risk assessment	FINANCIAL CRISIS; MODEL; DAMAGES; LOSSES	Nonstationarities in both climate and socioeconomic systems play a role in flood risk. Based on a data-driven case study in an urbanised watershed subjected to nonstationary factors in climate (rain, snow, and rain on snow) and socioeconomic conditions (e.g., built environment market changes), a multiscale, multimodel approach was adopted to develop local-scale flood hazard predictions and an analytical framework was developed to quantify the associated flood risk. The case study shows that socioeconomic development can have a comparable contribution as climate variability when evaluating the expected annual damage. The relative contributions from socioeconomic development, in some cases, do not necessarily compound the risk, but can, in fact, act as a mitigating factor in annualised risk. Timelines of risk management planning are an important factor to consider. Socioeconomic factors such as market value can produce nonlinear and reversed trends in flood impact assessments within the 10-year time frame. Furthermore, the nonstationarity of climate and development conditions together was shown to cause up to 43% of the variation in risk estimates and up to 70% of the variation in the benefit-cost effectiveness.

J	Williams, J				Williams, Joanna			Circular cities	URBAN STUDIES			English	Editorial Material						circular economy; environment; infrastructure; land use; planning; policy; sustainability	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; METABOLISM; LAND	A circular approach to the way in which we manage the resources consumed and produced in cities - materials, energy, water and land - will significantly reduce the consumption of finite resources globally. It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-of-the-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city. I then use this to develop my own definition and conceptualisation of a circular approach to urban resource management.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between hospitalization rates due to infectious diarrheal diseases among the population of the municipality of Rio Branco (AC), Brazil and precipitation, river level, humidity and temperature between 2000 and 2013. Data were retrieved from the Hospital Information System of the SUS (Unified Health System), the National Institute of Meteorology and the National Water Agency. Multiple Poisson and negative binomial regression models were adjusted. Results showed that there is a positive association between hospitalization due to infectious diarrheal diseases and the level of the Acre river (RR: 1.07; CI 95%: 1.04 to 1.1); these hospitalization rates fell 14% between 2000 and 2013 (RR: 0.86; CI 95%: 0.85 to 0.87). The most vulnerable group was the age group of less than 1 year of age. This study showed the vulnerability of an Amazonian city to climate variability and its respective epidemiological influence on the incidence of hospitalizations due to infectious diarrheal diseases.

J	Kron, W; Müller, O				Kron, Wolfgang; Mueller, Olaf			Efficiency of flood protection measures: selected examples	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Cost-benefit analysis; Flood control; Flood losses; Flood risk; Loss trends; Risk management		The frequency of flood loss events is increasing, both regionally and globally, due to the rising population and subsequent development of flood-prone areas, and as a result of environmental and climatic changes. This observation is not universally true for the time series of the losses themselves, at least not in the past one or two decades. One explanation for this is the improvement in flood control and flood protection in certain countries, both for floods that originate in the sea (storm surges) and for inland floods. While the qualitative effect of protection measures - reducing losses - is undisputed, quantitative examples are rare. Performance, or efficiency, needs to be calculated by comparing the costs of investment and maintenance against the losses prevented after a measure was put in place. In this article, a quantitative analysis of the performance of flood control measures is presented for four cases: the storm surge protection of the city of Hamburg, the Mississippi River and Tributary project, the activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Sylvenstein Reservoir in Bavaria. In each case, a significant benefit has been observed in the past decades, proving that flood protection pays off many times over.

This situation caused aerial exposure of some reservoirs drawdown zone. This study aims to measure methane fluxes emitted by this drawdown zone along the Funil hydropower reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was observed that there was a temporal variation of the methane flux in the sediments exposed in the three scenarios studied: drought, flooding and full (0.43, -0.31 and -0.01 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). The CH4 flux by area in the scenario with the highest exposed sediment area was 0.195 ton CH4 d-1. Considering the values recorded, the contribution of these emissions must become considered in the overall balance of methane in the atmosphere as a new pathway by reservoirs, mainly with the expected forecasts and possible cycles of droughts that may occur frequently. However, the temporal variability of these fluxes indicated the need for future monitoring initiatives that seek to understand how climate change affects the biochemical processes within the exposed sediments of drawdown zones.

Cost-benefit analysis is the dominant tool used by decision-makers to assess flood risk avoidance projects. Yet, few guidelines are available about how to implement such analysis. This paper advocates for a probabilistic cost-benefit analysis and details a step-by-step procedure via a realworld example. The results show that relocation can be a cost-effective strategy for many highrisk properties and neighborhoods. The level of indemnities and the inclusion of intangible losses are two key drivers of profitability. The paper also analyzes three distinct designs of relocation programs. The results reveal that proactive and innovative schemes, such as managed retreat and usufruct arrangements, constitute worthwhile alternatives to a more conventional post-flood response design.

However, the mechanism of cascading hazards that cause small outbursts to transition into big disasters is poorly understood. We investigated the Gongbatongshaco GLOF in the Himalayas, to reveal a novel disaster model and mechanism, considering increasing regional temperature, glacial lake area, and glacial retreat. Global warming drives glacial retreat, and uncover loose sediment that can be mobilized as debris flows, triggering small glacial lake outbursts in high mountain regions. Sediment generated from earthquake-induced landslides exacerbates the flow magnitude in a valley to increase the disaster risk. Concentrations of in-habitants located in these areas are subject to socioeconomic vulnerability, leading to post-disaster poverty within these communities. A reasonable GLOFs resilient mitigation framework is proposed. The results offer new insights into risk assessment, especially for small glacial lakes in tectonically-active high mountain environments influenced by climate change and earthquake activity.

Weather generators can alleviate this problem, but easily become complex. In this study, a weather generator combining Bartlett-Lewis models and vine copulas is presented. This combination allows for the generation of time series with statistics similar to those of the input. This model chain has never been assessed on the basis of future simulations. However, it could have value for extending climate simulations. The model chain was applied to historical observations and one climate model time series. The statistical moments and the correlation on the basis of the future simulations were comparable to those on basis of the historical observations. The results for the extremes were ambiguous, but still provided valuable information. The adequate performance for the statistical moments and the correlation indicates that the weather generator might be useful for the characterization of future extremes.

Certain parts of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam are under the constant threat of inundation due to sea-level rise. We integrate the hedonic property model in a difference-in-differences framework and spatial econometric analysis into a single analytical framework to estimate the economic effect of pluvial flooding. We find prices for affected houses were discounted by 9% after a large flood event on 30 September 2017. This research contributes to the existing literature as follows. First, we study the economic impact of pluvial floods, which has received less attention in existing studies where large and irregular floods are their focus. Second, the inclusion of legal status as a control variable accounts for the unique character of the Vietnamese housing market. Third, we also identify the recovery of house prices after the flood event.

The study proposes a new Composite Fragility Index to assess the environmental fragility of Italian ecoregions, which represent ecologically homogeneous areas within which natural communities and species interact with the physical elements of the environment. The environmental fragility is the susceptibility of an area to change as a result of a disturbance. The index measures fragility related to natural and anthropic factors. The variables employed are an expression both of natural and anthropic hazard and pressures. Study findings allow for building maps of environmental fragility across Italy, and the derivation of a local spatial autocorrelation index results in the detection of clusters of high or low fragility areas, to which sustainable targeted planning strategies should be promptly addressed.

Rapid basal melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet from surface meltwater drainage	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Greenland; glaciology; ice sheets; climate change; radio echo sounding	STORE GLACIER; PHYSICAL CONDITIONS; SUBGLACIAL DRAINAGE; OUTBURST FLOODS; FLOW; BENEATH; EVOLUTION; SYSTEM; RADAR; HYDRAULICS	Subglacial hydrologic systems regulate ice sheet flow, causing acceleration or deceleration, depending on hydraulic efficiency and the rate at which surface meltwater is delivered to the bed. Because these systems are rarely observed, ice sheet basal drainage represents a poorly integrated and uncertain component of models used to predict sea level changes. Here, we report radar-derived basal melt rates and unexpectedly warm subglacial conditions beneath a large Greenlandic outlet glacier. The basal melt rates averaged 14 mm . d(-1) over 4 months, peaking at 57 mm . d(-1) when basal water temperature reached +0.88 degrees C in a nearby borehole. We attribute both observations to the conversion of potential energy of surface water to heat in the basal drainage system, which peaked during a period of rainfall and intense surface melting. Our findings reveal limitations in the theory of channel formation, and we show that viscous dissipation far surpasses other basal heat sources, even in a distributed, high-pressure system.

These tools are now well-established in risk management practices for most natural perils. The number of applications has also grown in time and while at the beginning catastrophe models were solely used by insurance companies to assess the insurability of a certain peril, they are now applied to address many different risk management problems, not limited to the insurance industry. Flood risk in particular saw an increased interest from stakeholders in recent years, mainly driven by a sharp increase in global flood losses as well as projections on how these will be impacted by climate change. This contribution aims to provide a broad introduction to catastrophe risk models with focus on flood risk. In particular, after providing a description of catastrophe risk models, we discuss current methods to model flood hazard for such models. Subsequently, we identify four unique challenges in the development of flood risk models and how these differ from other natural perils.

What drives their distribution today and how it may shift in the future are open questions. Feedbacks among climate, fire, herbivory, and land use are known drivers. Here, we show that alternating seasonal drought and waterlogging stress favors the dominance of savanna-like ecosystems over forests. We track the seasonal water-table depth as an indicator of water stress when too deep and oxygen stress when too shallow and map forest/savanna occurrence within this double-stress space in the neotropics. We find that under a given annual precipitation, savannas are favored in landscape positions experiencing double stress, which is more common as the dry season strengthens (climate driver) but only found in waterlogged lowlands (terrain driver). We further show that hydrological changes at the end of the century may expose some flooded forests to savanna expansion, affecting biodiversity and soil carbon storage. Our results highlight the importance of land hydrology in understanding/predicting forest-savanna transitions in a changing world.	[Mattos, Caio R.

The study area is the Fella River basin at Pontebba and its upstream Uque sub-basin, in the northeastern Italian Julian Alps. A non-stationary hydraulic model is combined with field measurements to derive rating curves at the downstream outlet which lacks discharge data. Five-minute rainfall series are exploited to predict hydrographs through a semi-distributed hydrological model, at continuous and event scales. The hydrological modelling is verified on an ungauged basin at the inner upstream outlet. Results indicated that the predictability of intense events is improved when a single storm is evaluated compared to a continuous hydrograph; event-based hydrographs at the upstream outlet are well reproduced by the model calibrated with downstream data, thus allowing the use of the parameters in an ungauged basin.

This paper aims to assess the socio-economic benefits of forest goods and services in a changing climate by focusing on the forest products of Colophospermum mopane (C. mopane) in the Kunene and Omusati regions in northern Namibia. We used C. mopane product data from 2011 to 2021. Our analyses showed that local communities harvested five main products from C. mopane, namely firewood, poles, droppers, rafters, and roots. Firewood and poles were the primary C. mopane products harvested by local communities, mainly for subsistence use. Our results suggest that C. mopane potentially continues to the provision of goods and services for the livelihood of local communities, despite the changing climate in northern Namibia. We propose future studies in predictive analysis focus on extreme weather events, such as forest fires, droughts, floods, and other climate-related hazards that affect goods and services provided by forest ecosystems in the northern regions and the entire country.

J	Naz, F; Doneys, P				Naz, Farha; Doneys, Philippe			Gender-based differences in access to and use of loans from rural credit programs for flood adaptation in the farming-dependent<i> char</i> communities of Bangladesh	WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM			English	Article						Gender; Adaptive capacity; Floods; Char; Adaptation	WOMENS EMPOWERMENT; RIVERBANK EROSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICROFINANCE; HOUSEHOLD; POWER; STRATEGIES; OWNERSHIP; RESOURCES; MARRIAGE	Recent research on gendered access to credit shows that while women borrowers bear the liability of rural credit programs, the proceeds are often directly invested by their male partners. This paper examines loan access and flood adaptation-related investment activities among char female borrowers. Primary data from a survey of fe-male respondents in 129 households and qualitative data from 6 key informant interviews, 3 focus group dis-cussions, and 18 in-depth interviews reveal that women have limited control over loan investment activities. Men's financial control undermines positive social externalities of women's adaptive capacity from loan use, and loans exacerbate households' gender-related tensions. Although loans foster women's capacity for collective action and flood adaptation, the nexus of gender and microcredit access between partners determines women's access to and use of credit. Further research should investigate how institutions can increase equitable access to loans to improve both men and women's adaptive capacity to natural hazards.

The research of agriculture's floods vulnerability is the premise of scientifically dealing with floods. Based on the vulnerability assessment framework of "sensitivity-exposure-adaptability," this paper selects 14 evaluation indicators from three aspects: sensitivity, exposure, adaptability, and the index weights which are determined by the entropy weight method to evaluate the sensitivity, resilience, and vulnerability of flood In terms of time, China's overall flood vulnerability shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. From a spatial point of view, the number of highly vulnerable areas is relatively small which are mainly concentrated in Henan, Hubei, Anhui and other provinces, and most areas of the country are at low and mild levels. From the factor analysis model, the main contributing factors of agricultural flood exposure, sensitivity and adaptability are soil erosion control area, forest coverage rate, total reservoir capacity and total power of agricultural machinery. Therefore, controlling soil erosion, increasing forest coverage, further improving water conservancy facilities and strengthening agricultural mechanization level are the keys to reduce vulnerability of agricultural floods.

The concerns are more profound in countries like India, where agriculture the primary source of livelihood is mainly rainfed. Based on the primary survey of 180 rural farm households in the highly natural disaster-prone state of India, this study elucidates how farm households perceive and respond to manage climatic shocks and associated risks. Results show that the majority of the households perceived the occurrence of adverse weather events, but a sizeable proportion of them in the drought-prone regions appear to be neglecting or downplaying the risk outcomes. The households in flood prone region were proactive in controlling and monitoring risks and resorted to multiple risk mitigation measures like diversification of crop and enterprises, changing agronomic practices, etc. The economic position of the households played the most significant role in influencing the adoption of a particular strategy. The weak empirical relationship between the communication variables and management of weather-induced risks was reflective of the lack of quality information available to the farmers through various sources.

The present study identifies glacial architecture of Bindo Gol valley (BGV) glacier present in HinduKush region of Pakistan with emphasis on Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) lake development. The study integrates meteorological (temperature, precipitation) and geophysical (Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)) data to demarcate glacial architecture and possibility of GLOF lake development. Several moraines filled crevasses were identified (from GPR) mostly towards the center and south of the study area. Some of these crevasses were connected to the surficial running water channels that were also detected by GPR. A dense network of cavities was identified towards southeast of the glacier, despite being shallow, these cavities could facilitate the development of GLOF lake. The study indicates a good relationship between geophysical (presence of crevasses and subsurface cavities) and meteorological (variations in temperature and precipitation) data for the identification of source for the accumulation of larger volumes of water possibly resulting in GLOF events.

Clustering model responses in the frequency space for improved simulation-based flood risk studies: The role of a cluster number	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cluster analysis; ensemble; flood risk; frequency space; hydrologic model; k-means; representative parameter sets; uncertainty	HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CATCHMENT; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; REGIONALIZATION; FRAMEWORK; RAINFALL; PEAKS	Hydrologic models are often employed in flood risk studies to simulate possible hydrologic responses. They are, however, linked with uncertainty that is commonly represented with uncertainty intervals constructed based on a simulation ensemble. This work adapts an alternative clustering-based approach to first, learn about hydrological responses in the frequency space, and second, select an optimal number of clusters and corresponding representative parameters sets for a hydrologic model. Each cluster is described with three parameter sets, which enable percentile and prediction intervals to be constructed. Based on a small Swiss catchment with 10,000 years of daily pseudo-discharge simulations, it was found that clustering the ensemble of 1000 members into 5-7 groups is optimal to derive reliable flood prediction intervals in the frequency space. This lowers the computational costs of using a hydrological model by 98%. The developed approach is suitable for probabilistic flood risk analysis with current or future climate conditions to assess hydrologic changes.

Even though the Early Cretaceous Parana-Etendeka Igneous Province has a comparable erupted volume (>1 Mkm(3)) to other LIPs (e.g., Deccan, Emeishan and Siberian Traps), it remains controversial why this LIP did not contribute to a mass extinction and whether it is associated with the Weissert Event. This work presents new 40Ar/39Ar dating over a 425-m vertical stratigraphic profile (out of 1,000 m) that spans three formations of the PE-LIP in southern Brazil (low-Ti Vale do Sol and Esmeralda, and high-Ti Palmas). Our data demonstrate that this mafic lava pile was emplaced in c. 2.0 m.y., from c. 135.5 Ma to c. 133.5 Ma, and endorse the hypothesis that the basaltic and andesitic flows of the Vale do Sol Formation (peak of mafic magmatism) contributed to the Weissert Event.

The flood basalt dammed a local drainage system to form the paleolake, which preserved a plant fossil Lagerstatte in its deposits. However, the precise age and temporal duration of the lake remain unsettled. We present the first unequivocal U-Pb zircon ages from interbedded volcanic ashes at the P-33 type location, constraining the deposition to 15.78 +/- 0.039 Ma. Using micro-X-ray fluorescence and petrographic and spectral analyses, we establish the annual characteristics of laminations throughout the stratigraphic profile using the distribution of elemental ratios, mineral assemblages, and grain-size structures, as well as organic and fossil contents. Consequently, the similar to 7.5-m-thick varved deposit at the type location P-33 represents similar to 840 yr of deposition, coincident with the end of the main phase of Columbia River Basalt Group eruptions during the Miocene Climate Optimum. The timing and temporal resolution of the deposit offer a unique opportunity to study climate change in unprecedented detail during global warming associated with carbon-cycle perturbations.

The impact on the stability of an embankment due to rainfall patterns is specific to the geography, topography, and geometry of the embankment. However, this stability has not been widely assessed and updated with respect to new climate regimes. In this study, the slope stability of an agricultural embankment was evaluated based on five synthetic rainfall patterns derived from actual heavy rainfall events. The rainfall patterns were generated based on common patterns of rainfall hyetographs used in hydrological design and practice. The stability of the embankment was computed using the limit equilibrium method. Results of the stability analyses revealed time-series slope instability under rainfall patterns, and particularly the rainfall pattern that caused the most instability to the embankment was identified. Therefore, reassessment of the stability of the embankment in potential areas prone to heavy rainfall and flooding is beneficial to the preparation of early warning and emergency planning and preparedness as countermeasures for mitigating sediment-related hazards and disasters.

The developed methodological approach allows quantitative planning of strategies to tackle the effect of recurrent floods and droughts in a salt lake basin through the formulation of an optimal control problem, which constitutes a novel approach to ecohydrological systems management. The control variables correspond to (i) diversion flows from a lake tributary to an artificial freshwater reservoir to damp lake flooding, (ii) freshwater flows from the reservoir to the salt lake to keep its salinity at desired values and (iii) freshwater flows to irrigate crops during drought periods. Further, we address the economic valuation of ecosystem services in the basin. Quantitative results provide useful insights on optimal management strategies and the effects of their implementation, as well as their impact on the valuated services in the watershed under study.

Our improved preparation against and response to this hazard would benefit from an enhanced understanding of the physical processes at play. Here, a database of 399 African stream gauges is used to analyze the seasonality of observed annual maximum flood, precipitation and soil moisture between 1981 and 2018. The database includes a total of 11,302 flood events, covering most African regions. The analysis is based on directional statistics to compare the annual maximum river flood with annual maximum rainfall and soil moisture. The results show that the annual maximum flood in most areas is more strongly linked to the annual peak of soil moisture than of annual maximum precipitation. In addition, the interannual variability of flood magnitudes is better explained by the variability of annual maximum soil moisture than by the variability in the annual maximum precipitation. These results have important implications for flood forecasting and the analysis of the long-term evolution of these hydrological hazards in relation with their drivers.

Therefore, the characterization of the molecular mechanisms activated under hypoxic and anoxic conditions might lead to low oxygen resilient crops. Although in mammalian systems prolyl 4 hydroxylases (P4Hs) are involved in the oxygen sensing pathway, their role in plants under low oxygen has not been extensively investigated. In this report, an Arabidopsis AtP4H3 T-DNA knock out mutant line showed higher sensitivity to anoxic treatment possibly due to lower induction of the fermentation pathway genes, ADH and PDC1, and of sucrose synthases, SUS1 and SUS4. This sensitivity to anoxia was accompanied by lower protein levels of AGPs-bound epitopes such as LM14 in the mutant line and induction of extensins-bound epitopes, while the expression levels of the majority of the AGPs genes were stable throughout a low oxygen time course. The lower AGPs content might be related to altered frequency of proline hydroxylation occurrence in the p4h3 line. These results indicate active involvement of proline hydroxylation, a post-translational modification, to low oxygen response in Arabidopsis.

Shorter cyclone clusters modulate changes in European wintertime precipitation extremes	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						cyclone clustering; anthropogenic climate change; precipitation; extremes; flooding; compound events; storylines	ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONES; CLIMATE; PROJECTIONS; FLOODS; CMIP5	Wintertime extreme precipitation from cyclone clusters, i.e. consecutive cyclones moving across the same region, can lead to flooding and devastating socio-economic impacts in Europe. Previous studies have suggested that the future direction of the changes in these events are uncertain across climate models. By employing an impact-based metric of accumulated precipitation extremes, we show that projections of cyclone clusters are instead broadly robust, i.e. consistent in sign, across models. A novel physical diagnostic shows that accumulated precipitation extremes are projected to grow by only +1.0 %/K on average across Europe, although the mean precipitation per cyclone increases by +4.7 %/K. This results from a decreased number of clustered cyclones, associated with decreased wintertime storminess, the extent of which varies from northern to southern Europe and depends on the future storyline of atmospheric circulation change. Neglecting the changes in the number of clustered cyclones, i.e. assuming that accumulated precipitation extremes would change as the mean precipitation per cyclone, would lead to overestimating the population affected by increased accumulated wintertime precipitation extremes by 130-490 million across Europe.

These algorithms have been used for flood modelling, infrequently. A total of 287 flood locations were randomly categorized into training (70%; 201 floods), and validation (30%; 86 floods) datasets for modelling process and evaluation. The Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) technique was applied to evaluate the role of nine dominant factors on flood occurrence. The results of using the ANFIS and the artificial intelligence ensemble algorithms were three flood susceptibility maps. Results indicated that the ANFIS-BBO had the highest accuracy in comparison with the ANFIS and ANFIS-BA models in flood modelling. In addition, BBO algorithm showed its great potential by considering higher accuracy and lower computational time, in mapping and assessment of flood susceptibility.

We present the performance of such a model in simulating Mediterranean floods, with a focus on the initialization and on the impact of the rainfall uncertainties on the calibration of the model. The distributed event-based parsimonious Soil Conservation Service Lag-and-Route (SCS-LR) model was applied in the Real Collobrier catchment, France, which has a very high density of raingauges. The initial condition of the model was highly correlated with predictors, such as baseflow or soil water content. A reduction in the raingauge density can markedly change the calibration of the model. As the density of raingauges is generally low in most catchments, the uncertainties associated with rainfall measurement are thus expected either to mask the actual accuracy of the model, or to alter the model parameters.

Habitat and fish community data were collected using conventional field sampling methods, and reach-scale habitat data were compiled with the aid of a geographic information system. We found that occupied sites had lower baseflow indices and reach slopes but higher conductivity and agricultural land uses than unoccupied sites. More grass pickerel were detected when conductivity, channel cover, and wetlands in the floodplain were highest and bank slopes lowest; this is consistent with habitat preferences described elsewhere in its range. Habitat features at the site scale appeared more important than reach-scale features suggesting that grass pickerel may be using small habitat patches. This study identifies habitat elements important to grass pickerel and offers insights into management implications.	[Colm, J. E.; Tufts, B.

In this study, an alternative parallel computing architecture is presented that uses the Unified Parallel C (UPC) architecture, which combines the respective advantages of message passing interface (MPI) scalability with the direct memory access of OpenMP. A second-order Godunov-type monotone upstream scheme flood model, called ParaFlood2D, is developed using UPC as the first approach. The computational efficiency of ParaFlood2D is investigated with two cases of flood wave propagation on shared-memory and distributed-memory systems. In both cases, the simulation results demonstrate reasonably good accuracy when compared with the respective analytical solutions. At the same time, the obtained speed-up performance of UPC is generally more favorable when compared with that of MPI and OpenMP in their respective basic designs. Overall, the study indicates that UPC parallel architecture can be a viable alternative for large-scale flood modeling simulations.

However, there is still a lack of basin-scale study in documenting trend, changes, and variation across Peninsular Malaysia and its relation with flood occurrence. Therefore, Johor River basin (JRB) which plays a pivotal role in the country's development was selected as a case study by evaluating 24 rainfall stations for homogeneity over the period 1970-2015 and followed by the analysis of rainfall seasonality and extreme rainfall trend. Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to show the area within JRB that is subjected to change at 95% significance level. Even though 75% of the stations had strong auto-correlation in the time series due to large-scale climate influence, the imputed rainfall stations showed no potential discontinuity with t-test statistics between 0.87 and 0.90 and R2 between 0.995 and 0.999 for the double mass curve of the yearly rainfall time series. The constructed PDF showed the restoration of the normal distribution of the rainfall data with higher peak as the missingness of the high-intensity rainfall has been restored. After that, a homogeneity test was conducted for annual and seasonal rainfall using a hybrid of Standard Normal Homogeneity test, Pettit test, Buishand Range test, and Von Neumann ratio test. The results showed that for the annual series, 43% of the total stations were found to be 'useful', but more 'useful' stations based on the seasonal data, with 67% and 52% of the total stations for NE and SW monsoons, respectively. As no anthropogenic effect can be deduced, the presence of inhomogeneity in some stations is associated with the influence of high climate variability. Although non-significant change was observed, the seasonality index (SI) showed that the annual rainfall regime in JRB is mainly classified as 'rather seasonal with a short drier season' (SI range from 0.39 to 0.47). Comparatively, the rainfall regime during the drier SW monsoon is more irregular (SI range from 0.67 to 0.72) than the wetter NE monsoon (SI range from 0.57 to 0.68). Spatially, increasing SI was observed in the downstream area indicating increasing occurrence of extreme rainfall over a shorter period. For trend analysis, RClimDex was utilised to compute eleven extreme rainfall indices as recommended by ETCCDI, consisting of frequency and intensity extreme rainfall indices. Generally, the results showed that increasing extreme rainfall in the form of frequency indices is more prominent throughout JRB particularly at the end of the NE monsoon. During the NE monsoon, frequency index of R10 showed a significant increasing trend at thirteen stations. Meanwhile, R20 and R25 showed increasing trend at five stations, mainly in the downstream and at the west of the basin. During the SW monsoon, R10 showed a significant increasing trend at six stations, but R20 and R25 showed a significant decreasing trend at two and one station, respectively. Based on the past flood record, increasing trend of R10, R20, R25, and CWD during the NE monsoon across flood prone area in Sayong river, Kota Tinggi town and downstream urbanised area is expected to worsen the flood conditions, which required improved flood mitigation and adaptation strategy.

J	Pang, TZ; Penney, HD; Wang, XQ				Pang, Tianze; Penney, Heather D.; Wang, Xiuquan			Effective Communication of Coastal Flood Warnings: Challenges and Recommendations	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						environmental communication; coastal flood; emergency warning; risk management; disaster reduction		With the increasing risk of coastal flooding facing coastal communities due to climate change, coastal flood warnings (CFWs) are expected to play a critical role in the protection of people and property to ensure communities' sustainable development. However, as destructive coastal flooding hazards have caused considerable damage in recent years, the effectiveness of coastal flooding warnings could be questioned considering their objective of disaster risk reduction. Here, we deliver a review investigation of the current CFWs in the USA and Canada based on their setup and dissemination, and a case study of two representative coastal flooding events. Through this review, we found that collaboration between multi-level administration regarding CFW mechanisms has the potential to strengthen these mechanisms, improving their efficacy. We also found that CFWs presented in the media often lacked consideration of public acceptance and practicability in their reports, which may have affected the performance of these CFWs. Meanwhile, the technological limitations and uncertain public acceptance may also reduce the CFWs' effectiveness in application. Accordingly, the media should further consider the understandability of CFW-related reports. Moreover, emergency information channels should be set in both traditional media and social media for accessible use by residents with different customs. Lastly, starting from the normalized prevention of coastal flood disaster, a consensus of crisis awareness should be built with which the social aspects of the defense against coastal flooding can be established for future environmental sustainability.

Precipitation prediction by integrating Rough Set on Fuzzy Approximation Space with Deep Learning techniques	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Deep Learning (DL); Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Rough Set on Fuzzy Approximation Space; (RSFAS); Prediction; Climate change	CROP SUITABILITY PREDICTION; MODEL	Artificial intelligence has evolved into a mechanism that can predict environmental changes and investigate climatic conditions. In recent days, extreme precipitation and flooding have resulted in huge damage to the society of human beings and farmers. In real-life, the climatic conditions were predicted using huge collected data. However, the collected data are not utilized properly due to the presence of uncertainty. Most of the research was carried out in time series data for classification and prediction. However uncertain data leads to erroneous predictions. Thus, an integrated model is required to overcome the uncertainty and to improve the prediction accuracy. The paper aims in integrating the Rough Set on Fuzzy Approximation Space (RSFAS) with a Deep Learning (DL) techniques to predict the precipitation level in the southern coastal areas of India in a seasonal way. The proposed model can handle uncertainty using an RSFAS whereas the DL technique is utilized for classification and prediction. The developed model is estimated based on various evaluation metrics and optimizers, benchmarked with existing Deep Learning and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to demonstrate the prediction accuracies obtained with minimized error rate. Consequently, the proposed model assists in understanding the climatic conditions in extreme events to provide a prior warning about heavy rainfall to the people who live near the coastal areas.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

For urban contexts, however, the issues of its bias and insufficient resolutions still exist. This study aims to develop high-precision and high-resolution (e.g., 0.01 degrees/1 h) data for a metropolitan region based on IMERG and gauge precipitations. The original IMERG product is evaluated using hourly in situ precipitations from 47 gauges. A spatial downscaling-calibration (DC) technique is then developed to enhance the IMERG using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The results show the limited capability of IMERG to capture sub-daily precipitation and high-intensity precipitation. The proposed DC method significantly improves IMERG performance, with correlation coefficient (CC) increasing from 0.07 to 0.75, and probability of detection improving from 0.34 to 0.90 at the hourly scale. In terms of spatial rainfall distribution, 86% of mean absolute error and 80% of RMSE are improved with CC increasing from 0.07 to 0.91 on average. Additionally, the calibrated downscaled product provides finer information in local areas, capturing three times more spatial variabilities of urban precipitation against the original IMERG input data. The results highlight the necessity of improving urban observations for flood risk management at fine spatiotemporal resolutions.

JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; NETHERLANDS; ADAPTATION; CITIZENS; IMPASSES; BARRIERS; ESTUARY	Storm surge barriers, levees, and other coastal flood defense megaprojects are currently being proposed as strategies to protect several US cities against coastal storms and rising sea levels. However, social conflict and other political factors add a layer of complexity that casts doubt on their status as practical climate adaptation options. The specific mechanisms responsible for some projects not progressing beyond initial planning stages remains unclear. In this study, we examined the outcome of two USACE storm surge barrier proposals to explore the political reasons why some coastal flood protection megaprojects break ground in the US, while others do not. Using original archive research, we concluded that storm surge barriers are politically challenging climate adaptation options because of modern environmental laws that provide avenues for expression of oppositional views within the decision process and the allure of alternative options that are more aesthetically pleasing and cheaper and faster to implement. To better allocate public resources and utilize the expertise of USACE, future flood protection megaprojects should first achieve broad support from the public, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and elected officials before beginning serious planning. This support could be achieved through new innovative designs that simultaneously address adverse environmental impacts and provide cobenefits (e.g., recreation). New designs should be studied to better understand the level of protection offered and their associated reliability so that USACE has confidence in their use.	[Rasmussen, D.

The spread of hard protection to adapt to coastal erosion and flooding along island coasts in the Pacific and Indian Ocean	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Adaptation; Maladaptation; Diffusion; Small island developing states (SIDS); Hard protection; Coastal erosion	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY DIFFUSION; SHORELINE CHANGE; BEACH EROSION; STATES; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; ATOLL	Coastal erosion occurs along many of the world's shorelines, but is of particular concern to small islands. In response, island shorelines are often armoured through engineered structures such as seawalls, rip-raps, dikes or similar. Such hard protection is rarely successful in island contexts; rather than stop erosion, hard protection often simply redistributes and sometimes exacerbates shoreline erosion, and fails to protect property, land and food production. Such hard-protection structures frequently collapse shortly after construction. Why then does hard protection remain widespread? We argue that diffusion, specifically learning and emulation, helps explain the spread of hard protection. Island communities learn from the apparent effectiveness of hard protection in some contexts, and consider it an appropriate and accepted response to coastal erosion, regardless of its actual consequences (emulation). Case studies from the Pacific (Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia) and Indian Ocean (Maldives, Mauritius) show that both mechanisms are at work in small island states (SIDS) and may be mutually reinforcing. The case studies underline the role of the specific context in the understanding of not only why a specific adaptation measure is introduced, but also how it may change and evolve over time-and accordingly, when and how communities can move to more effective and sustainable alternatives to hard protection.

Pastoral community's vulnerability under extreme floodings accelerated by rangeland degradation among Turkmen transhumant, Northern Iran	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						agro-pastoralist; flood exposure; livelihood; local communities; natural hazards; socio-economic	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; GOLESTAN PROVINCE; LAND-USE; GIS; RISK; INFILTRATION; CHALLENGES; DROUGHT; EROSION; REGIONS	Flood disaster is considered a significant natural hazard due to their devastating effects. The 2019 flood in Northern Iran drastically affected the lives of Indigenous Turkmen pastoralists. This work assesses the vulnerability of the pastoral families living in flood regions. We used the Geographical Information System, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, and semi-structured interviews to analyze the flood vulnerable areas. Initially, we interviewed 20 individuals and then formulated a questionnaire completed by 69 pastoralists in rangelands affected by floods in Golestan province. Result showed that 91% of the participants thought road networks and 76% thought livestock were the most affected components of the rangeland ecosystems in the 2019 flood. Moreover, we found supplementary feeding, watering costs, and forage quantity to be the most affected items in the economy of pastoral families. The main rangeland degrading factors were overgrazing, climate change, drought, and water shortages. The main reasons for overgrazing were the high prices of supplementary feeding, low forage productivity of the rangelands, and financial difficulties of pastoralists. We indicated that pastoral communities in the semi-arid rangeland of Northern Golestan were highly vulnerable to flood. Hence, proper management of rangelands and building pastoral family resilience requires the attention of nature conservationists and management organizations at the national level.

Small-Area Estimations from Survey Data for High-Resolution Maps of Urban Flood Risk Perception and Evacuation Behavior	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						evacuation behavior; mapping; risk perception; small-area estimations; survey data	PUBLIC-OPINION; MULTILEVEL REGRESSION; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; US STATES; POSTSTRATIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; RESILIENCE	"Behavior-blind" risk assessments, mapping, and policy do not account for individual responses to risks, due to challenges in collecting accurate information at scales relevant to decision-making. There is useful spatial information in social survey data that is sometimes analyzed for spatial patterns despite potential biases. This article explores whether risk perception and adaptive behavior can be inferred from census and hazard exposure data with a specifically designed survey. An underlying question is what precautions surveys should take before mapping the results. We find that a hybrid multilevel regression and (synthetic) poststratification (MRP-MRSP) model can facilitate the transition from individual survey data to small-area estimations at different scales, including 200-m grid cells. We demonstrate this model using municipal-level survey data collected in the Paris region, France. We find that model accuracy is not decreased at finer scales provided there is a strong spatial predictor such as hazard exposure. Our findings show that a wide range of flood risk perception and evacuation behavior can be estimated with such downscaling techniques. Although this type of modeling is not yet commonly used among geographers, our study suggests that it can improve mapping of survey results and, in particular, can provide spatially explicit behavioral information for risk assessment and policy.

Since RFFA extreme value estimates depend on the shape of the selected distribution of the data-generating stochastic process, there is need for a suitable goodness-of-distributional-fit measure in order to optimally utilize given data. Here we present a novel, least-squares-based measure to select the optimal fit from a set of five distributions, namely Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Logistic, Gumbel, Log-Normal Type III and Log-Pearson Type III. The fit metric is applied to annual maximum discharge series from six hydrological stations along the Sava River in South-eastern Europe, spanning the years 1961 to 2020. Results reveal that (1) the Sava River basin can be assessed as hydrologically homogeneous and (2) the GEV distribution provides typically the best fit. We offer hydrological-meteorological insights into the differences among the six stations. For the period studied, almost all stations exhibit statistically insignificant trends, which renders the conclusions about flood risk as relevant for hydrological sciences and the design of regional flood protection infrastructure.

Characterisation of dissolved organic matter from temperate wetlands: field dynamics and photoreactivity changes driven by natural inputs and diagenesis along the hydroperiod	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Patagonia; temperate wetlands; dissolved organic carbon; photoreactivity/photolability; hydroperiod	ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; MACROPHYTE LEACHATES; AQUATIC SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UV-RADIATION; LAKE WATER; CARBON; FLUORESCENCE; PATTERNS; PRECIPITATION	Wetlands store large amounts of C in biomass, sediments and water. A major C fraction is in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) with multiple regulatory functions. Patagonian wetlands undergo changes in the water cycle due to climate warming and lower precipitation, causing shorter hydroperiods and reduced landscape connectivity with effects on C budgets. This study focuses on the optical characterisation of the DOM of an ephemeral wetland of North Patagonia. Along the hydroperiod the DOM showed optical signatures indicating terrestrial inputs, degradation and internal production. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration ranged between similar to 4 and similar to 9 mg L-1. The DOM pool displayed high molecular weight/size and aromatic fingerprints. Humic components C1 (microbial and/or vegetation derived) and C2 (soil/sediment) prevailed in the DOM, whereas the non-humic component C3 (from aquatic processes) increased from early spring. Experimental exposure to PAR + UVR produced slight changes in DOC and reduction in DOM molecular weight/size. The components showed distinctive photoreactivity/lability: C1 > C3 > C2. Along the hydroperiod the relative contribution of the humic vs. non-humic components (C1 and C3) determined the reactivity/lability of the DOM. In Fantasma pond, the DOM pool fluctuates in response to hydrology and degradation processes, and the alternance between dry and flooded periods determines C dynamics.

J	Miguel, T; Eudave, RR				Ferreira, Tiago Miguel; Ramirez Eudave, Rafael			Assessing and Managing Risk in Historic Urban Areas: Current Trends and Future Research Directions	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						risk assessment; seismic vulnerability; fire risk; flood risk; historic urban areas	VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; FIRE RISK; LANDSCAPE	Historic urban centres are, almost by definition, risk-prone areas. The buildings in the historical sites are often highly vulnerable to natural and human-made hazards, not only due to their construction and material characteristics but also because they are usually very degraded due to ineffective maintenance and conservation policies. Moreover, the recent world tourism boom has led to a significant increase in the number of people who live, work and visit these areas, which, together with land use and climate change-related impacts, make historic centres particularly exposed areas. This paper addresses the issue of assessing and managing risk in historic urban centres departing from the complexity of defining the historic city and the concept of risk, providing a comprehensive discussion on current trends and future research directions in this field. After analysing the most suitable methodologies to assess the vulnerability of these areas to different hazards, the focus is on data collection and organisation-related issues and how the different vulnerability assessment outputs can be used to manage and mitigate risk. Vulnerability and loss scenarios, evacuation and emergency planning, and retrofit and cost-benefit analyses are some of the aspects addressed herein. This discussion includes some considerations on the accuracy of these approaches and aspects related to their calibration and validation, covering from empirical calibration models to advanced artificial Intelligence-based techniques.

Functional traits were considered as a potential target for researchers to identify the fitness advantage of invasive species in their habitats. This study aimed to examine the effects of flooding level and N-enrichment on a worldwide noxious invasive weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb, and its congener native, Alternanthera sessilis (L.). An experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, at which ramets of both species were treated with two flooding levels (F1: 12 cm and F2: 24 cm) combined with three nitrogen (N) concentrations applied with Hoagland solution as 0.21 mg/L (control, Ck), 21 mg/L (N1), and 210 mg/L (N2) under mono- and mixed-culture. This study exhibited that the flooding with increased N concentration (at N2) severely inhibited the growth of native A. sessilis under mixed-culture. In contrast, increased N concentration (at N2) under both mono- and mixed-culture under flooding produced higher biomass of A. philoxeroides. A. philoxeroides also expressed higher phenotypic plasticity and positive relative interaction by enhancing its leaf chlorophyll and leaf nitrogen. Therefore, our results conclude that high N-concentrations in water could facilitate the A. philoxeroides to adapt flooding over A. sessilis.

Effects of different carbon sources on methane production and the methanogenic communities in iron rich flooded paddy soil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Organic matter; Methanogen; High-throughput sequencing; Rice paddy; Iron reduction	ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; PLANT-MATERIAL; REDUCTION; CH4; CO2; DECOMPOSITION; DIVERSITY; EMISSIONS; SEQUENCES	Y Various carbon sources as substrates and electron donors can produce methane via different metabolic pathways. In particular, the methane produced by rice cultivation has a severe impact on climate change. However, how Fe3+, the most abundant oxide in paddy soil, mediates the methanogenesis of different carbon sources is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of four carbon sources with different chain lengths (acetate, glucose, nonanoate, and starch) on CH4 production and associated methanogens in iron-rich paddy soil over 90 days of anaerobic incubation. We found that glucose and starch were the more preferential substrates for liberating methane compared to acetate, and the rate was also faster. Nonanoate was unable to support methane production. Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales were the most predominant methanogenic archaea as shown by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, though their abundance changed over time. Additionally, a significantly higher content of iron-reducing bacteria was observed in the glucose and starch treatments, and it was significantly positively correlated with the copy number of the methanogenic mcrA gene. Together, we confirmed the methanogenic capacity of different carbon sources and their related microorganisms. We also showed that iron oxides play a central role in regulating methane emissions from paddy soils and need more attention to be paid to them.

In this paper, we asked: How do the frequency and amplitude of water availability variation affect both the social-ecological regimes present and how the system transitions between them? How do these transitions differ under flood-prone and drought-prone conditions? We modified a dynamical systems model of a complex watershed to directly link environmental variability to system-level outcomes, specifically the livelihoods present in the system. The model results suggest that flood-prone systems exhibit more drastic regime shift behavior than drought-prone systems, with abrupt shifts from the complete participation to complete abandonment of livelihood sectors. Drought-prone systems appeared to be more sensitive to the amplitude of water variability, whereas flood-prone systems exhibited more complex relationships with amplitude and frequency, with frequency playing a bigger role compared to drought-prone systems. Lower frequency variations with sufficient amplitudes exposed the system to extended periods of environmental hardship, reducing the system's ability to recover. Our analysis also highlighted the importance of environmental stochasticity: the deterministic version of the model that assumed no stochasticity overestimated system resilience. The model and analysis offer a more systematic framework to investigate the linkages between sustainability of social-ecological systems and environmental variability. This lays the groundwork for future research in systems with significant current or predicted environmental variability due to climate change.

This paper proposes a novel distributed rainwater harvesting approach to communal rainwater harvesting in which individual households connect the outflow of their RWH systems to a communal storage from which they can retrieve water when their system is not able to meet their water demands. We simulated the performance of the system in two cities, Houston and Jacksonville, for multiple private and communal storage combinations. We measure the performance of the system using the volumetric reliability (VR) metric, which is the ratio of rainwater that the communal system is able to provide to the total water demand. Results showed that the VR gains over a private system of 1%-6% and 1%-4%, can be achieved for up to 10 and 7 connected households, respectively, for Houston and Jacksonville if the emphasis is on VR gain >1.5%. The system achieved higher VR gains for lower total storage capacity in Houston, whereas the system achieved higher VR gains for higher total storage capacities in Jacksonville. This proposed decentralized rainwater harvesting system is attractive in the face of climate change, increases the resilience of water/stormwater infrastructure, and potentially could decrease the likely effects of flooding and property damage from stormwater.

As floodplains are flat, often with highly fertile and well-accessible land, they have become the intrinsic focus of human society-while providing a variety of goods and ecosystem services. Intensive land use of floodplains is degrading their natural values and significantly reducing their ecosystem functions and services. A significant part of these key services is related with the ability of floodplains to retain water and nutrients, which can be understood as a flood control and a water-retention function. Although these ecosystems serve a number of other basic functions, the importance of floodplains as a place for water retention during extreme discharges caused by intense rainfall or snowmelt and the supply of water in times of drought are essential under conditions of global change. In order to increase the ability of floodplains to perform these functions, it is increasingly required to preserve the connectivity of rivers with surrounding floodplains and adapt human activities to maintain and restore river ecosystems. This article reviews the recent understanding of floodplain delineation, the most common causes of disturbance, the ecosystem functions being performed, discussing in turn the measures being considered to mitigate the frequency and magnitude of hydrologic extremes resulting from ongoing environmental changes.

This study examines the actual vs perceived drought risks by constructing risk indices at the household and expert levels using survey data from the lower Teesta River Basin in northern Bangladesh. The survey data were collected from 450 farmers using a structured questionnaire conducted between August and September 2019. A composite drought risk index was developed to understand households' perceived and actual risks in the designated areas. The results show that the actual and perceived risk values differ significantly among the three case study sites locally known as Ganai, Ismail, and Par Sekh Sundar. The risk levels also differ significantly across the households' gender, income, occupation, and educational attainment. People with insolvent socioeconomic status are more prone to drought risk compared to others. Results also reveal that the mean level of perceived risk agrees well with the actual risk, whereas females perceive comparatively higher risk than their male counterparts. Expert views on drought risk are similar to the individual household level perceived risk. The outcomes of this study would assist the policymakers and disaster managers to understand the concrete risk scenarios and take timely disaster risk reduction actions for ensuring a drought-resistant society.

Both the EFRS and the relationship between EFRS supply and demand may change across flood return periods. However, most studies only considered the EFRS under a single flood return period. In this regard, a new framework is proposed that integrates multiple flood return periods to assess the expected annual EFRS supply and demand. It also considers the upstream EFRS supply flowing from the headwaters toward the downstream. A case study in the Yangtze River Basin, China, shows that the EFRS demand increases dramatically from 25- to 200-year return periods, while the EFRS supplies remain relatively constant. In terms of the expected annual EFRSs that integrate the four return-period EFRS demands and local supplies, 47 (or 43.12%) sub-basins are found to be unsatisfied (the demand is larger than the supply). This number could be reduced to 17 (or 15.60%) sub-basins if the upstream EFRS supply is considered in comparing the EFRS supply and demand, implying the importance of a catchment-wide EFRS management, particularly protecting the upstream forests, rivers and lakes, grasslands, as well as properly regulating the dams. The proposed framework could be readily applied in other basins and shed light on a comprehensive understanding and management of the EFRSs.

Hydroclimatic Extremes Evaluation Using GRACE/GRACE-FO and Multidecadal Climatic Variables over the Nile River Basin	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GRACE; GRACE-FO; hydroclimatic extremes; drought indices; GRACE derived indices; flood	TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; LAKE TANA BASIN; SOIL-MOISTURE; DROUGHT INDEX; GROUNDWATER DROUGHT; SEVERITY INDEX; GRACE-FO; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; IMPACT	Hydroclimatic extremes such as droughts and floods triggered by human-induced climate change are causing severe damage in the Nile River Basin (NRB). These hydroclimatic extremes are not well studied in a holistic approach in NRB. In this study, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its Follow on mission (GRACE-FO) derived indices and other standardized hydroclimatic indices are computed for developing monitoring and evaluation methods of flood and drought. We evaluated extreme hydroclimatic conditions by using GRACE/GRACE-FO derived indices such as water storage deficits Index (WSDI); and standardized hydroclimatic indices (i.e., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and others). This study showed that during 1950-2019, eight major floods and ten droughts events were identified based on standardized-indices and GRACE/GRACE-FO-derived indices. Standardized-indices mostly underestimated the drought and flood severity level compared to GRACE/GRACE-FO derived indices. Among standardized indices PDSI show highest correlation (r(2) = 0.72) with WSDI. GRACE-/GRACE-FO-derived indices can capture all major flood and drought events; hence, it may be an ideal substitute for data-scarce hydro-meteorological sites. Therefore, the proposed framework can serve as a useful tool for flood and drought monitoring and a better understanding of extreme hydroclimatic conditions in NRB and other similar climatic regions.

Here we collected data over 3 years (2016-2018) in the episodic wetland outflow channel (Aluize), Banhine National Park, in which the system state changed from dry to wet to dry. Field sampling included vegetation records, small-scale vegetation zoning, the seed bank and water and soil quality. The same main plant species were found in both dry and wet conditions across the riverbed of the outflow channel. We found only very few diaspores of plants in the soil after prolonged drought. In the subsequent flooded state, we examined very dense vegetation on the water surface, which was dominated by the gramineous species Paspalidium obtusifolium. This species formed a compact floating mat that was rooted to the riverbed. The Cyperaceae Bolboschoenus glaucus showed high clonal growth in the form of root tubers, which likely serve as important food reservoir during drought. Soil and water analyses do not indicate a limitation by nutrients. We outline how resident people may change the plant community structure with an increasing practice of setting fire to the meadows in the dried-up riverbed to facilitate plant regrowth as food for their livestock.

The goal of the study is to design adaptation pathways for enhancing livelihood resilience of flood-affected households in Bangladesh-one of the most flood-vulnerable countries in the world. We developed adaptation pathways by using three sequential steps: (1) assessing livelihood resilience by constructing resilience indices; (2) determining adaptation options by employing principal component analysis (PCA) of resilience indicators; and (3) designing pathways of selected adaptation options by conducting key informant interviews (KIIs), and participatory workshops. Livelihood resilience was assessed based on an established framework that builds on 18 indicators representing three capacities (absorptive, adaptive and transformative) and six dimensions: social, institutional, economic, ecological, physical, and political. Using a structured questionnaire survey, we collected data from 360 households of 18 villages of 9 sub-districts in Bangladesh. Results revealed that about one-third of total households had capacities to reduce flood shocks and stresses and improve livelihood opportunities. Following a resilience assessment, we conducted PCA for determining adaptation options, namely learning, infrastructure, and governance. Through KIIs and stakeholder engagement workshops, pathways of selected adaptation options were designed. The adaptation pathways entail short-, medium-, and long-term adaptation options, which contribute to maintaining persistence, leading to the transition, and facilitating transformation. Essential issues of implementation of adaptation pathways were determined. Critical policy implications around strengthening governance, promoting economy, and managing technologies were outlined.

Flooding and Arboviral Disease: Predicting Ross River Virus Disease Outbreaks Across Inland Regions of South-Eastern Australia	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						arboviral; Ross River virus; outbreak; flood; riverine	MOSQUITO SPECIES DIPTERA; WEST NILE FEVER; MURRAY VALLEY; EPIDEMIC POLYARTHRITIS; TEMPORAL ANALYSIS; RAPID ASSESSMENT; TRANSMISSION; CULICIDAE; WALES; INFECTION	Flood frequency is expected to increase across the globe with climate change. Understanding the relationship between flooding and arboviral disease can reduce disease risk and associated costs. South-eastern Australia is dominated by the flood-prone Murray-Darling River system where the incidence of Australia's most common arboviral disease, Ross River virus (RRV), is high. This study aimed to determine the relationship between riverine flooding and RRV disease outbreaks in inland south-eastern Australia, specifically New South Wales (NSW). Each study month from 1991 to 2013, for each of 37 local government areas (LGAs) was assigned 'outbreak/non-outbreak' status based on long-term trimmed-average age-standardized RRV notification rates and `flood/non-flood' status based on riverine overflow. LGAs were grouped into eight climate zones with the relationship between flood and RRV outbreak modeled using generalized estimating equations. Modeling adjusted for rainfall in the previous 1-3 mo. Spring-summer flooding increased the odds of summer RRV outbreaks in three climate zones before and after adjusting for rainfall 1, 2, and 3 mo prior to the outbreak. Flooding at any time of the year was not predictive of RRV outbreaks in the remaining five climate zones. Predicting RRV disease outbreaks with flood events can assist with more targeted mosquito spraying programs, thereby reducing disease transmission and mosquito resistance.

The annual statistics of extreme precipitation across Nepal show a significant increase since the end of the 20th century. However, seasonal mean precipitation shows a remarkable decrease in western Nepal, particularly since 1980, forming an east-west division in the precipitation change. This decreasing trend of precipitation led to a reduction to the dry-season stream flow of Karnali River, the major river in western Nepal. At the same time, the increasing extreme precipitation produced greater threat of flash flood in Nepal. This east-west division of the precipitation trend agrees with the second leading mode of the mean precipitation variability, which was traced to the interannual variability of the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature that showed a slowdown of warming. Similar to the APHRODITE trends, precipitation simulated by the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models depicted the decreasing historical trend in western Nepal, but future projections reverse that trend towards an all-Nepal increase. CMIP5 future climate projections depict continual warming in the Indian Ocean, potentially reversing the historical decreasing trends of precipitation in western Nepal.

The partial runoff is highlighted by horizontal soil heterogeneity as well. How to identify the partial runoff and develop a variable threshold for runoff generation is a great difficulty and challenge. In this work, the partial runoff is identified by using a variable active runoff layer structure, and a variable soil water storage capacity is proposed to act as a threshold for runoff generation. A variable layer-based runoff model (VLRM) for simulating the complex partial runoff was therefore developed, using dual distribution curves for variable soil water storage capacity over basin. The VLRM is distinct in that the threshold for runoff generation is denoted by variable soil water storage capacity instead of infiltration capacity or constant soil water storage capacity. A series of flood events in two typical basins of North China are simulated by the model, and also by the Xinanjiang model. Results demonstrate that the new threshold performs well and the new model outperforms the Xinanjiang model. The approach improves current hydrological modelling for complex runoff in regions with large deficiencies in soil water storage.

This article introduces a methodology for assessing urban flood resilience, utilizing a social-ecological synthesis index that integrates geographical and temporal data with GIS. The study focuses on ten administrative subdistricts in Wuhua District, Kunming City, China, and selects 18 social-ecological indicators. These indicators, chosen from social and ecological perspectives, are weighted using the entropy weight method to determine their significance in the assessment system. By combining scores for each subdistrict, the study quantifies flood resilience and creates a spatial distribution map using ArcGIS. Key findings reveal that out of the ten administrative subdistricts, five in Wuhua District, particularly in the core urban area of Kunming, demonstrate strong overall flood resilience. Influenced by social-ecological indicators, there is significant spatial differentiation in flood resilience within Wuhua District, with a decreasing trend radiating from the city center to areas farther from the urban core. The research indicates that regions with well-established transportation infrastructure, a wide distribution of government institutions, improved water management facilities, and a substantial population with higher education levels contribute significantly to enhancing urban flood resilience.

We examine the relationship between flood-exposed populations and socioeconomic factors at the regency level, particularly in Central Java, using open data encompassing flood-prone areas, topography, population distribution, and socioeconomic indicators. Key findings include population exposure to flooding varies significantly across the 33 regencies and 7 cities, ranging from 1% to 61% in exposure rate. A notable 5.8-fold difference in average income exists among regencies, with income strongly correlating with higher education rates. Similarly, poverty rates correlate with low educational attainment; there was a very large range in the balance between the size of the exposed economy and the number of exposed poor population in each administrative division. Consequently, we propose a classification system that considers social vulnerability due to poverty, low-education, and economic impacts. The map reflecting these classifications is a risk map that facilitates the understanding of the risk characteristics and the relative risk magnitude of each administrative district. Our analysis underscores the importance of adapting flood risk management strategies to local socioeconomic characteristics and suggests the importance of the use of local wisdom.

In this article, we use patent data to describe the global pace of innovation in climate adaptation technology. We identify the leading countries, track technology diffusion across borders, and relate innovation trends to adaptation needs. We find that innovation in adaptation technology has developed less rapidly than innovation in low-carbon technologies since 2005. This seems mainly due to the fact that adaptation is more important in sectors where the overall pace of innovation is slower than average, such as agriculture. Moreover, innovation is highly concentrated, with China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United States accounting for nearly two-thirds of global patented inventions that are relevant to climate adaptation. Other economies could benefit through international technology transfer, but we find only limited technology diffusion through the patent system. International diffusion is particularly low in agriculture and flood protection, and there is virtually no transfer of the relevant patented knowledge to low-income countries. As a result, we find a striking mismatch between countries' adaptation needs and technological availability.

Geographic location or experience: Using PRISM to understand how people seek flood risk information	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						communication; disasters; flood risk; information seeking; PRISM	MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; HEALTH; POLITICS; BEHAVIOR; MATTER	Flooding is increasing worldwide, and with climate change, people need help understanding these changing conditions and that their flood risk may also change. This study extends the planned risk information seeking model (PRISM) into the flood risk domain and examines the antecedents that explain flood risk information seeking behavior. Using a survey reflective of the population in the state of Texas (N = 1079), this study includes an operationalization of risk perception specific to the complexity of floods and explores two key moderators in the PRISM model. Findings suggest that using PRISM to elaborate flood risk information seeking behaviors explains 48% of the variance in information seeking intent and 37% of the variance in affective risk perception. Using multigroup modeling, the findings also reveal that simply living in an area at high risk for floods does not significantly impact any relationships in the model. However, having experience with flooding increases the strength of risk perception paths-in particular, perceived probability of flood risk-and better explains flood risk information seeking. Suggestions for how to use communication to influence risk perceptions and information seeking, as well as future directions for research, are also discussed.

Despite wide public concerns about water quality and human health risks from catastrophic coal ash spills and chronic leaking of coal ash ponds, coal ash disposal has only been partially regulated, and its impacts on aquatic sediment quality and ecological health have been overlooked. Here, we present a multiproxy approach of morphologic, magnetic, geochemical, and Sr isotopic analyses, revealing unmonitored coal ash releases over the past 40 to 70 years preserved in the sediment records of five freshwater lakes adjacent to coal-fired power plants across North Carolina. We detected significant sediment contamination and potential chronic ecological risks posed by the occurrence of hundreds of thousands of tons of coal ash solids mainly resulting from high-magnitude stormwater runoff/flooding and direct effluent discharge from coal ash disposal sites. The proximity of hundreds of disposal sites to natural waterways across the U.S. implies that such contamination is likely prevalent nationwide and expected to worsen with climate change.

In 2013, China proposed the Sponge City, a strategic measure for urban waterlogging control. This study quantifies the effects of stormwater management measures in runoff reduction for different levels of rainfall and conducts a one-dimensional visual analysis of urban waterlogging risks. At the same time, the best cost-effective scheme is determined based on life-cycle cost, analytic hierarchy process, and regret decision theory. The results showed stormwater management measures could realize the function of runoff control and waterlogging prevention, especially under low precipitation. However, these measures were still not enough to eliminate waterlogging risk. Combined measures have stronger runoff control capabilities than single measures. Considering economic, environmental, and operational impacts comprehensively, the combined measures of bio-retention (BR), permeable pavement (PP), and green roof (GR) were determined as the best cost-effective scheme because of the lowest regret value. The proposed method is helpful to provide reference and decision-making basis for the construction of sponge cities in the future.

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) works with local and state officials to produce flood maps. Using these flood maps and demographic attributes, prior research has demonstrated correlations between the percent of a tract identified as disadvantaged and the percent of the tract covered by flood zones. Until recently, FEMA flood maps were the primary assessment tool for flood risk, but First Street Foundation (FSF) has developed its own flood risk tools. This paper compares these alternative flood risk measures as a percent of census tracts in the Southeastern US states and assesses models of the risk measures with demographic, housing, policy and control variables. The main results are first that the FEMA and FSF maps often reveal diverging levels of risk per tract. Second, the demographics correlating with tract-level risk differ markedly for the two risk measures. Third, the results vary considerably by state with more divergence in some states than others, and who is at risk of flooding across the states varies between the FEMA and FSF measures.

A quantitative review of soybean responses to waterlogging: agronomical, morpho-physiological and anatomical traits of tolerance	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Review						Soybean; Waterlogging; Yield; Dry weight; Aerenchyma; Adventitious roots; Nodulation	MAX L. MERR.; BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; RADIAL OXYGEN LOSS; GLYCINE-MAX; SECONDARY AERENCHYMA; FLOODING TOLERANCE; GENOTYPE RESPONSE; ZEA-NICARAGUENSIS; YIELD COMPONENTS; ROOT-NODULES	The impact of waterlogging on crops has increased during the last decades due to climate change, being considered the second most important abiotic stress after drought in soybean, with yield reductions of up to 80%. In this review, we performed a quantitative review from 54 papers about waterlogging effects in soybean. Yield losses are greater (57%) with waterlogging occurring at reproductive stages between R1 and R3 compared to vegetative stages, which is mostly related to a diminished number of pods per plant. Waterlogging impacts on biological nitrogen fixation, with losses of about 30 and 50% in nodule number and weight, with the greatest reductions in reproductive stages. The nitrogenase activity is drastically reduced with water excess but can quickly restore after. Losses in photosynthesis are about 30-50%, mostly related to reduced stomatal conductance and poor N status. Soybean can also develop aerenchymatous tissue in roots, hypocotyls and nodules, which may alleviate the anoxia generated by waterlogging by facilitating oxygen transport. Further efforts should be invested in investigating the effect of waterlogging on nodulation and the impact and subsequent recovery of root growth.	[Ploschuk, R. A.; Miralles, D. J.; Striker, G.

The trend analysis of hydro-meteorological data is crucial for planning and managing various activities (agriculture, design of hydraulic structures) in the basin. The present study aims to analyze the trends in the annual maximum and annual average discharge, annual maximum, and annual average rainfall for the Jhelum River basin. The trend analysis was performed using the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test, Sen's slope, and innovative trend analysis (ITA) at various hydro-meteorological stations. The outcomes of trend analysis using the ITA test showed non-monotonic trends at multiple stations for different time series data and brought forth more significant data to analyze changes in hydro-meteorological data. Moreover, the overall trend shows a significant decrease in annual average rainfall and discharge, while annual maximum rainfall and discharge revealed a significant increasing trend via ITA. The trend analysis depicts changes in hydro-meteorological data which would be useful for future management of water resources. Moreover, changes in the discharges in the Jhelum River are due to climatic change and anthropogenic activities in the basin.	[Umar, Sheikh; Lone, M.

It involves the active involvement in search and rescue to reconstruction that people affected by disasters undertake unsolicited. Predictive power in disaster recovery has further increased its relevance. However, quantitative analysis that community participation has on disaster mitigation measures is scant. The study analyses community participation's impact on disaster mitigation measures following the Kochi flood of 2018 and 2019 in India. We use a Multivariate Probit Regression model with a sample size of 750 to analyse the relationship between disaster mitigation measures (namely, disaster event planning, previous experience, following disaster-related news closely, and neighbourhood relationship) and community participation. The results show participants who were active in community events were 23% more likely to adopt all the disaster mitigation measures than those who did not. In addition, households with special needs members were more likely to be prepared for an unanticipated event. The results also showed higher education levels directly correlated to implementing more significant disaster mitigation measures. Implications for government policy formation include schemes to enhance community rehabilitation and promote social participation to mitigate future disaster events.

In this study, we investigate the non-hazard variables and sewer system types in relation to damage costs in the city of Malmo center dot, Sweden. A comprehensive data set of around 1000 records of direct damage to residential buildings from a cloudburst event on 31 August 2014 in Malmo center dot, Sweden has been analysed at property scale with no lumping together of data. The results show that properties connected to combined sewer systems are much more exposed to pluvial flood damage than properties connected to separated sewer systems, with the ratio of the number of claims being close to three. The analysis of building-specific variables shows no clear statistical relationships to the damage costs. To further the understanding of damage costs caused by urban pluvial flooding, it is necessary to extend the group of explanatory variables to include information about the socio-economic background of households, the actual value of assets in basements and the precautionary measures taken by house owners.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						regional climate vulnerability; assessment; operationalization; indicators; mapping; climate communication; adaptation strategies	FLOOD RISK	Climate vulnerability assessments are an important prerequisite for establishing successful climate adaptation strategies. Despite a growing number of assessments on the national or global scale, there is still a need for regionalized studies with a high resolution to identify meso-scale vulnerability patterns. In this paper, we present an indicator-based assessment that was carried out in the Trinational Metropolitan Region Upper Rhine within the Interreg-V project Clim'Ability. The analyzed region is characterized by strong cross-border and transnational linkages, similar ecological features and climatic stressors but differing political, administrative, cultural and legal conditions. In this rather complex setting, we operationalized a state-of-the art vulnerability framework using 18 quantified indicators and aggregating them into a vulnerability index. We show that it is possible to downscale the methods used in recent assessments to a regional context with a challenging data situation and discuss strengths and uncertainties. The results are mapped for stakeholder communication purposes. They provide an evidence-base to the identification of the trinational vulnerability pattern and may enable stakeholders and decision-makers to enhance their own climate adaptation planning.

Here we apply an integrated assessment model - Delta Dynamic Integrated Emulator Model (Delta DIEM) - to the south-west coastal zone of Bangladesh to explore the outcomes of four contrasting and plausible development trajectories under different climate and socio-economic scenarios: (1) embankment rehabilitation; (2) build elevation via controlled sedimentation; (3) planned migration (managed retreat) and (4) 'do nothing' (unplanned migration and abandonment). Embankment rehabilitation reduces flood risk, but at a high economic cost and enhancing waterlogging. Planned and unplanned migration combined with limited infrastructure management and governance both result in significant abandonment. Building elevation through sedimentation has the potential for increased environmental and economic sustainability but raises equity issues. Poverty and inequality persist across all scenarios, and outmigration from the coastal zone continues, although the magnitude is sensitive to assumptions about sea-level rise, socio-economic development and development trajectory. Integrated assessment tools linking the environment, people and policy choices, such as the Delta DIEM used here, highlight the complex interactions occurring in a dynamic delta environment. Such analysis supports informed management, development and adaptation.

SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF AGRICULTURAL SOIL COVER IN RUNOFF GENERATION	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA			English	Article						flood; flow peak; hydrological simulation; agricultural soil use	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; LAND; IMPACTS; REGIONALIZATION; PRECIPITATION; URBANIZATION; SIMULATION; INTENSITY; CATCHMENT	Seasonal changes in agricultural soil use due to agroclimatic conditions affect the water cycle in watersheds. This study aimed to understand the temporal variation of runoff inherent to the seasonal occupation dynamics of the agricultural soil in the basin that drains the upper valley of the Marrecas River, upstream of the urban perimeter of Francisco Beltrao, PR. The effects of runoff were verified through flow peaks simulated by the HEC-HMS model in twelve monthly soil use scenarios, under seven precipitation return periods. The results indicated a strong relationship between bare soil and flow peaks, temporally delimiting April and March as the largest runoff generators and January and August as the smallest ones. The ratio quantified by rates of increase in flow peaks ranging from 0.78 to 1.64 m(3) s(-1) per km(2) of bare soil. In addition, the survey of historical precipitation data also warns of the generation of large runoff volumes in October. Therefore, the strong correlation between the increase in flow peaks and occupation by bare soil can be quantified with good precision, but it is also necessary to consider historical precipitation records to understand the temporal distribution of runoff and flood risks.

Nest traits and major flooding events influence nest survival of Emperor Geese while regional environmental variation linked to climate does not	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Alaska; Anser canagicus; Emperor Goose; environmental variation; nest survival; nest traits; Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta	YUKON-KUSKOKWIM DELTA; LESSER SNOW; INCUBATION BEHAVIOR; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; BREEDING SUCCESS; LEMMING CYCLES; CACKLING GEESE; BODY-MASS; DENSITY	The reproductive ecology of geese that breed in the Arctic and subarctic is likely susceptible to the effects of climate change, which is projected to alter the environmental conditions of northern latitudes. Nest survival is an important component of productivity in geese; however, the effects of regional environmental conditions on nest survival are not well understood for some species, including the Emperor Goose (Anser canagicus), a species of conservation concern that is endemic to the Bering Sea region. We estimated nest survival and examined how indices of regional environmental conditions, nest traits (nest age, initiation date, and maximum number of eggs in the nest), and researcher disturbance influenced daily survival probability (DSP) of Emperor Goose nests using hierarchical models and 24 years of nest monitoring data (1994-2017) from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (Y-K Delta) in western Alaska. Our results indicate that overall nest survival was generally high (mu = 0.766, 95% CRI: 0.655-0.849) and ranged from 0.327 (95% CRI: 0.176-0.482) in 2013 to 0.905 (95% CRI: 0.839-0.953) in 1995. We found that DSPs of nests were influenced by nest traits, negatively influenced by major tidal flooding events and by researcher disturbance, but were not influenced by regional indices of spring timing, temperature and precipitation during nesting, or fox and vole abundance on the Y-K Delta. However, the number of nests found each year was negatively related to our index of fox abundance, suggesting nests that failed as a result of fox predation may have never been discovered due to our limited nest-searching efforts during egg laying. Our results suggest that regional environmental variation had minimal influence on the nest survival of Emperor Geese, although major flooding events were important. Nevertheless, we suspect that within-year variation in local weather conditions and local abundance of predators and alternative prey may be important and should be considered in future studies. Lay Summary center dot Due to projected changes in environmental conditions of northern latitudes, the reproductive ecology of geese that breed in the Arctic and subarctic is likely susceptible to the effects of climate change. center dot No previous studies have examined the effects of regional environmental conditions on the nest survival of Emperor Geese (Anser canagicus), a species of conservation concern endemic to the Bering Sea region. center dot We estimated the nest survival of Emperor Geese on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in Alaska and quantified the effects of regional environmental variation and nest traits (nest age, nest initiation date, and number of eggs in the nest) on nest survival. center dot Our results suggest that regional indices of spring timing, temperature and precipitation during nesting, and abundance of predators (foxes) and alternative prey (voles) did not influence nest survival of Emperor Geese, although major flooding events and nest traits appeared to be important. center dot We recommend that future research on the nesting ecology of Emperor Geese should focus on within-year variation in local weather conditions and local abundance of predators and alternative prey.

Evaluation and projected changes in daily rainfall characteristics over Central Africa based on a multi-model ensemble mean of CMIP5 simulations	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; INTENSITY	This study uses daily rainfall data from 20 global climate models (GCMs) simulations, participating in the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and eight daily rainfall indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), to investigate the changes in extreme weather conditions over Central Africa under the representative concentration pathway 8.5. The performance of the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean which in fact refers to the best performing models selected through the Taylor diagram analysis was evaluated by comparing with two gridded daily observation datasets during the historical period (1998-2005). Results show that although some uncertainties may exist between the gridded observation datasets, MME consistently outperform individual models and reasonably reproduced the observed pattern of daily rainfall indices over the region, except in the case of consecutive wet day (CWD) where the high variability of individual members has resulted in the degradation of the overall skill of the MME. The assessment of the climate change signal in the eight daily rainfall indices was done for the mid and late twenty-first century (2026-2056 and 2066-2095 respectively), relative to the baseline historical time period (1976-2005). We found a significant increase in the total wet day rainfall amount (PRCPTOT) over southern (northern) Central Africa from December to February (from September to November). This is mainly due to the increase of high intense rainfall events rather than their frequency. The results also reveal that the increase in PRCPTOT was coupled with increase in the maximum consecutive 5-day rainfall amount (RX5DAY), the 95th percentile (R95), and the total wet day rainfall amount above the 95th percentile (R95PTOT), with more robust patterns of change at the late twenty-first century. The increase in extreme rainfall events (RX5DAY, R95, and R95PTOT) is likely to increase flood risks over Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, Congo, Angola, Zambia, and Democratic Republic of Congo. On the other hand, changes in CWD and PRCPTOT are projected to significantly decrease over Angola, Zambia, and Democratic Republic of Congo from September to November. This is due to a substantial increase of zonal moisture divergence fluxes in upper atmospheric layers. The analysis has also shown that areas where CWD and PRCPTOT decreases coincides with those where consecutive dry days (CDD) increase. The decrease in CWD and PRCPTOT coupled with the increase in CDD could worsen drought risk and significantly disrupt priority socio-economic sectors for development such as rain-fed agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, and water resource availability. The results thus underline the importance for decision-makers to seriously consider adaptation and mitigation measures, in order to limit the risks of natural disasters such as severe droughts and floods that Central African countries may suffer in the future.

The species is endemic to fast-flowing rivers and streams of the Western Ghats of India. The species was not very popular earlier in aquatic trade but has been in great demand in global aquarium trade since it was exhibited at AQARAMA 1997 in Singapore and ranked third under the new species category. The export of the species from India started in 1996-1997, which increased progressively and constituted about 60%-65% of a total of 1.44 million US$ worth of ornamental fish exported from India in 2007-2008. Thereafter, it started declining and presently became negligible. It was attributed to depleting stocks of P. denisonii in rivers and streams of Western Ghats. The species was recommended to be listed as endangered on the IUCN red list in a CAMP workshop held at NBFGR, Lucknow, India in September 1997, owing to habitat degradation and the declining number of mature individuals in the wild. It was categorized as Vulnerable in 2009 and Endangered in 2015 under the IUCN red list. The Department of Fisheries, Government of Kerala has restricted the collection of smaller size fish from natural water bodies since 2008 to revive wild stocks. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India has now proposed to include P. denisonii along with two other freshwater fish species, Semiplotus semiplotus (Assamese kingfish) and Osteobrama belangeri (Manipur osteobrama), as Schedule-I species under the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2021 of India. The species listed under this Schedule are prohibited to be hunted throughout the country. The captive breeding technology of P. denisonii has already been developed in the country more than a decade back, and fish is being produced commercially at several farms presently including hatcheries of the Kerala Government. The species is also being cultured and produced on a commercial scale by many ornamental fish farmers of Indonesia and supplied to the global ornamental fish trade at cheaper rates, and more color strains. The major factors that are responsible for the depletion of the stocks of P. denisonii and the overall fish biodiversity of Western Ghat regions are discussed in detail. The conflicts and repercussions that will arise because of the inclusion of Denison Barb or any other freshwater fish as Schedule-I species under the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2021 of India are also discussed.

According to the public's intention to participate in geohazard mitigation activities, this study introduces the analytical framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), with attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control as the primary explanatory variables, with three added explanatory variables: risk perception, disaster experience, and participation perception.Survey data obtained from 260 respondents in Jinchuan County, Sichuan Province, China, are analyzed using structural equation modeling and combined with multivariate hierarchical regression to test the explanatory power of the model. The results indicate that attitude, subjective normative, perceived behavioral control, and participatory cognition are significant predictors of public intention to participate. Disaster experience is negatively associated with public intention to participate. In addition, the extended TPB model contributes 50.7 % to the explanation of the behavioral intention of public participation.Practical suggestions and theoretical guidance are provided for strengthening geohazard risk management and achieving sustainable disaster reduction. In particular, it is concluded that, while correctly guiding public awareness of disaster reduction activities, policymakers should continue developing participatory mechanisms, paying attention to two-way communication bridges between the public and the government, uniting social forces, and optimizing access to resources.

Stress Response of European Common Frog (<i>Rana temporaria</i>) Tadpoles to Bti Exposure in an Outdoor Pond Mesocosm	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis; Mosquito control; Amphibians; GST; Protein carbonyl	THURINGIENSIS-VAR. ISRAELENSIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TEMPERATURE; POPULATION; DECLINES; TOXINS	The biocide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) is applied to wetlands to control nuisance by mosquitoes. Amphibians inhabiting these wetlands can be exposed to Bti multiple times, potentially inducing oxidative stress in developing tadpoles. For biochemical stress responses, ambient water temperature plays a key role. Therefore, we exposed tadpoles of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) three times to field-relevant doses of Bti in outdoor floodplain pond mesocosms (FPM) under natural environmental conditions. We sampled tadpoles after each Bti application over the course of a 51-day experiment (April to June 2021) and investigated the activity of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and protein carbonyl content as a measure for detoxification activity and oxidative damage. GST activity increased over the course of the experiment likely due to a general increase of water temperature. We did not observe an effect of Bti on either of the investigated biomarkers under natural ambient temperatures. However, Bti-induced effects may be concealed by the generally low water temperatures in our FPMs, particularly at the first application in April, when we expected the highest effect on the most sensitive early stage tadpoles. In light of the global climate change, temperature-related effects of pesticides and biocides on tadpoles should be carefully monitored - in particular since they are known as one of the factors driving the worldwide decline of amphibian populations.

Natural catastrophes, including flooding and wildfires, are the sources of significant declines in crop production. National governments make an essential commitment, and foreign institutions work together to mitigate disasters' resilience vulnerability. These hazards have pushed catastrophe management to the forefront and made it an expanding scholarly area of study. The remarkable growth of information technology has motivated the scientific group to integrate this technology into emergency management. In this article, agricultural disaster risk management (ADRM) is offered to decide the status quo of the research on agriculture disaster management and the significance of big data. This article's primary objective is to provide technical metric analysis to analyze the body of research carried out in the past decade on different forms of disasters and the use of significant volumes. For the data assessment, the annual growth of publication outcomes, the corresponding categories of topics, and the productivity study specifications was determined. The flux of raw and analytical data from comprehensive data is so established that another effect is heavily affected in the final performance of forecasting.

The targets set by the United Nations under Sustainable Development Goal 6 in relation to freshwater ecosystems also make accurate surface water monitoring increasingly vital. However, the last decades have seen a steady decline in in situ hydrological monitoring and the availability of the growing volume of environmental data from free and open satellite systems is increasingly being recognized as an essential tool for largescale monitoring of water resources. The scientific literature holds many promising studies on satellite-based surface-water mapping, but a systematic evaluation has been lacking. Therefore, a round robin exercise was organized to conduct an intercomparison of 14 different satellite-based approaches for monitoring inland surface dynamics with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 imagery. The objective was to achieve a better understanding of the pros and cons of different sensors and models for surface water detection and monitoring. Results indicate that, while using a single sensor approach (applying either optical or radar satellite data) can provide comprehensive results for very specific localities, a dual sensor approach (combining data from both optical and radar satellites) is the most effective way to undertake largescale national and regional surface water mapping across bioclimatic gradients.

In addition to the personal and property losses, another important consequence of a flood disaster was release and exposure risks from emerging contaminants, which was usually overlooked. The remobilization and fate of the antibiotics induced by floods remain unclear. We captured antibiotic concentrations around the Chaohu Lake after an unprecedented flood with a range of 5.0-317 ng/L. Higher concentrations in polder waters than their receiving rivers were attributed to the antibiotic release from soil particles and the sharp increase of water: soil ratio by flood storage. Source apportionment analysis of antibiotics implied that diffuse pollution by manure application and aquaculture activity was the predominant sources. Commonalities of spatial variations of antibiotics in polders were related to the condition of waterlogging and pollution source. The total antibiotic storage for all submerged polders was estimated at 27.9 kg. The concentrations and risks from pumping floodwater detained by polders into the lake were much higher than that from discharging flood directly into the lake. The retention-reaction-remobilization process would pose unexpectedly high risks for the lake. This study provided a new sight for constructing ecological wetland flood storage areas.

Parallel-Computing Two-Way Grid-Nested Storm Surge Model with a Moving Boundary Scheme and Case Study of the 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan	WATER			English	Article						COMCOT-SURGE; two-way grid-nesting; solitary wave runup; 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan; storm surge inundation	SEA-SURFACE; WAVE MODEL; COASTAL; RUNUP; INUNDATION; WIND; TIDE	This study presents a numerical tool for calculating storm surges from offshore, nearshore, and coastal regions using the finite-difference method, two-way grid-nesting function in time and space, and a moving boundary scheme without any numerical filter adopted. The validation of the solitary wave runup on a circular island showed the perfect matches between the model results and measurements for the free surface elevations and runup heights. After the benchmark problem validation, the 2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan event was selected to showcase the storm surge calculations with coastal inundation and flood depths in Tacloban. The catastrophic storm surges of about 8 m and wider, storm-induced inundation due to the Super Typhoon Haiyan were found in the Tacloban Airport, corresponding to the findings from the field survey. In addition, the anti-clockwise, storm-induced currents were explored inside of Cancabato Bay. Moreover, the effect of the nonlinear advection terms with the fixed and moving shoreline and the parallel efficiency were investigated. By presenting a storm surge model for calculating storm surges, inundation areas, and flood depths with the model validation and case study, this study hopes to provide a convenient and efficient numerical tool for forecasting and disaster assessment under a potential severe tropical storm with climate change.

Impact of the Change in Topography Caused by Road Construction on the Flood Vulnerability of Mobility on Road Networks in Urban Areas	ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART A-CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Road vulnerability; Vehicle mobility; Flood modeling; Urban floods; Soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; RUNOFF; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; TRANSPORT; WEATHER; SURFACE	In urban watersheds, floods directly affect mobility on road networks. The present study proposes a methodology for analysing the impact of road construction or reconstruction on topography and, ultimately, on causing floods. The study first proposes a methodology to estimate the vulnerability to mobility on road networks due to flooding, illustrated on a road network in Nagpur city in central India. The study proposes the flood vulnerability road mobility index (FVRMI) through hydrologic modeling using parameters such as precipitation trends, the land use function, elevation models generated by satellite data, flood inundation depth calculated using the soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method, a time area histogram, and the flood-safe driving speed of a road network. Then, FVRMI was estimated for the changed topography observed through elevation models generated by satellite data due to road reconstruction from 2010 to 2018. Results show that this has affected the flow regime of the Nagpur urban watersheds. The estimated FVRMI was 20% higher for the changed topography in 2018 (Model II) than the topography scenario of the base year, 2010 (Model I). The results show that about 63% of road segments had a higher FVRMI value in 2018. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Mukesh, M.

A.; Longueville, Francois			Chronic flooding events due to sea-level rise in French Guiana	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MUD BANKS; MODEL; PROJECTIONS; IMPACTS; TIDE	As sea levels are rising, the number of chronic flooding events at high tide is increasing across the world coastlines. Yet, many events reported so far either lack observational evidence of flooding, or relate to coastal areas where ground subsidence or oceanic processes often enhance climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR). Here we present observational and modelling evidence of high-tide flooding events that are unlikely to occur without SLR in French Guiana, where sea-level rise rates are close to the global average and where there is no significant ground subsidence. In particular, on 16 October 2020, a well-documented flooding event happened in Cayenne under calm weather conditions. Our probabilistic assessment of daily maximum water levels superimposed on SLR shows that this event can be modelled and is a consequence of SLR. As sea levels will continue to rise, we show that the number, severity and extent of such high-tide flooding events will increase across several urban areas of French Guiana, with an evolution depending on the topography. As concerns are growing regarding the economic impacts and adaptation challenges of high-tide chronic events across the world, our study provides new evidence that this early impact of SLR is emerging now.

Informality is taking place at locations that are exposed to various hazards, and therefore, resilience building of both informal and formal settlements is needed to achieve sustainable development. Resilience assessment is key in defining appropriate area-specific resilience measures. Given that, this research assesses the resilience of formal and informal settlements of Surat city in India and presents implications for sustainable development. To assess resilience, an indicator-based approach was taken, using a household survey to collect the data. Analysis suggests that the resilience of formal and informal settlements is significantly different. Key differences were found in physical and institutional resilience, where informal settlements were found to be significantly less resilient than formal settlements. Several measures, such as gender-sensitive education and livelihood programs, as well as mobile water and sanitation, have positive implications for sustainable development. Overall, the study can guide disaster managers and policy makers to adopt a strategic and more targeted approach to strengthen resilience and achieve sustainable development.

In July 2022, torrential storms affected northeastern UAE. The damaging impacts prompted a broader consideration of flash-flood risks, especially for rapidly-urbanising arid landscapes. Occurring unexpectedly in mid-summer when rainfall is normally absent, the storms were produced by a combination of climatic and oceanic conditions: ITCZ position, unusual westward extension of a humid air mass from the Indian monsoonal trough, a cool sea-surface temperature anomaly that drove strong onshore moisture advection, and orographic precipitation enhancement by the coastal ranges. A foreign media suggestion that cloud seeding was partly responsible, however, is contested. Although flood emergency management was coordinated and effective, it is argued that various strategies may be strengthened to reduce future disaster risks. These include increased monitoring of mountain wadi systems to augment meteorological forecasts with hydrological information, and improved modelling to predict runoff-generation processes better in ungauged catchments. Greater capture of floodwaters to infiltrate and replenish groundwater aquifers also supports ongoing national efforts to develop sustainable solutions for addressing freshwater scarcity.

Impacts of sea level rise on wave overtopping rates around the coast of England	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MARITIME ENGINEERING			English	Article						climate change; coastal engineering; embankments		There is unequivocal evidence that global sea levels are rising. It is therefore inevitable there will be socioeconomic impacts as a result of this. To aid mitigation, and the implementation of adaptation measures, it is vital the magnitude of the potential impact is quantified. Current approaches in the UK make simplifying assumptions regarding the relationship between present-day and future economic damage relating to coastal flood risk. The analysis undertaken here supports studies of an improved impact of sea level rise by providing national-scale estimates of changes in wave overtopping rates and flood defence overflow rates, as a result of different amounts of sea level rise. The analysis involves the application of components of an existing risk-based coastal flood risk analysis method. A subset of almost 600 flood defence assets around the country has been analysed for sea level rise rates up to 1 m. The resulting analysis shows that, on average, the wave overtopping rate increases by up to 150 times above present-day rates for lower return periods and by up to five times for higher return periods. This differential arises as a result of non-linearities in overtopping rates with increasing extreme sea levels.

Global warming is a reality that adversely affects the metabolic and physiological activities of crops, and the sugarcane crop is not an exception; it is also affected from climate change and various other sustainability issues. To address these issues, researchers have recommended many climate-smart technologies (CSTs) for enhancing sugarcane yield and ensuring its long-term viability. CSTs interventions such as fine-tuning of various crop production methods/techniques, planting methods, nutrient management techniques, insect-pest, and infection control alternatives including methods like cultural methods and physical methods, using of bio-agents, bio-pesticides, botanicals, light/pheromone, or combo traps, and so on can be a wise decision. Furthermore, maintaining its suitability under drought and flood conditions, eco-friendly biomass waste cycling, and their safe use enhance soil health and cane yield sustainably. This article comprehensively highlights climate-smart technologies, which are the best solutions to reduce carbon, water, fertilizer, and pesticide footprints in sugarcane production to enhance overall growth and yield and quality canes with improved livelihoods of the cane farmers.

Practicing AWD in rice production can reduce water consumption by 30% and mitigate methane emissions by 30-70% without yield penalty. Primary research was conducted in Rangpur, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, and Sherpur Divisions. The analysis depicts the dynamic among the stakeholders involved in scaling AWD using the Net-Map tool, and demonstrates the influence of irrigation management systems in the selected catchment areas and the impacts of AWD in rice farming. Findings reveal that AWD-practicing farmers, pump owners, and the Upazila Irrigation Committee are the three most powerful influencers for scaling AWD. The pre-paid irrigation system significantly improves water efficiency and cost-effectiveness when practising AWD. Additionally, AWD leads to a lower frequency of pumping resulting in reduced costs compared to the continuous-flooding practice. Finally, the results guide the formulation of recommendations to create favourable conditions for AWD scaling, which contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing sustainable rice production in Bangladesh.

The world's largest cascade-reservoir group, which counts for 22 cascade reservoirs in the upper Yangtze River, cooperated in real time to control floods. The cooperation prevented evacuation of 600,000 people and extensive inundations of farmlands and aquacultural areas. In addition, no water spillage occurred during the flood control period, resulting in a world-record annual output of the TGR hydropower station. This work describes decision making challenges in the cooperation of super large reservoir groups based on a case-study, controlling the 4th and 5th floods (from Aug-14 to Aug-22), the efforts of technicians, multi-departments, and the state, and reflects on these. To realize the full potential of reservoir operation for the Yangtze River Basin and other basins with large reservoir groups globally, we suggest: (i) improve flood forecast accuracy with a long leading time; (ii) strengthen and further develop ongoing research on reservoir group cooperation; and (iii) improve and implement institutional mechanisms for coordinated operation of large reservoir groups.

The benefits of coastal adaptation through conservation of foreshore vegetation	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						coastal; disaster risk reduction; flood damages; green infrastructure	SEA-LEVEL RISE; FLOOD PROTECTION; CLIMATE; COSTS; MANGROVES; DEFENSES; FUTURE; COMMUNITIES; ATTENUATION; UNCERTAINTY	Due to rising sea levels and projected socio-economic change, global coastal flood risk is expected to increase in the future. To reduce this increase in risk, one option is to reduce the probability or magnitude of the hazard through the implementation of structural, Nature-based or hybrid adaptation measures. Nature-based Solutions in coastal areas have the potential to reduce impacts of climate change and can provide a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to structural measures. In this paper, we present the first global scale assessment of the benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation as a means of adaptation to future projections of change in coastal flood risk. In doing so, we extend the current knowledge on the economic feasibility of implementing global scale Nature-based Solutions. We show that globally foreshore vegetation can contribute to a large decrease in both absolute and relative flood risk (13% of present-day and 8.5% of future conditions in 2080 of global flood risk). Although this study gives a first proxy of the flood risk reduction benefits of conserving foreshore vegetation at the global scale, it shows promising results for including Nature-based and hybrid adaptation measures in coastal adaptation schemes.

While Harvey could have made landfall elsewhere along the Gulf coast, traditional flood frequency methodologies only consider the risk of Harvey in the region that it hit. This may be a shortcoming of flood frequency methodologies as the intensity of Harvey was greater due to climate change; therefore, Harvey may be more indicative of future hurricanes than other historical observations. To that end, this study investigates what effect Harvey would have had on flood frequency statistics if it had made landfall elsewhere. To do so, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to shift Harvey's rainfall within alternative landfall locations. This rainfall was then applied to synthetic unit hydrographs to estimate peak flows that were applied in Log Pearson III and Regional Flood Frequency Analyses. Log Pearson III analyses with simulated Harvey streamflows produced median 100-year peak flows that were 17%-66% higher than analyses that only used historical records. A regional flood frequency analysis in the central coastal geomorphologic region of Texas showed that predictive equations, based upon basin area and shape factor, had an average increase of 30.2% in the 100-year peak discharge.

Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to floods, and ENSO has a great influence on it. El Nino (La Nina) represents the warm (cold) phase of the ENSO cycle. Southern Oscillation Index data and a long-term flood records have been identified from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Bureau of Meteorology, Australia, and historical archives, respectively. Synoptic features-precipitation, wind, geopotential height, precipitable water, relative humidity, and surface runoff data-were used to examine the influence of ENSO. Result shows that the Indian summer monsoon contributes the major flood events and largely influenced by both El Nino and La Nina events, with a slightly higher frequency for the latter. Physical mechanisms (distribution of precipitation, wind, geopotential height, precipitable water, relative humidity, and surface runoff) supported these flood events; however, they are quite distinct during El Nino and La Nina condition. Moreover, ENSO's impacts to the Bangladesh region are different to the west part of the monsoon region. Therefore, if ENSO forecast is reliable, the predictability of the monsoon-related flood events can be improved.

Facilitating use of climate information for adaptation actions in small coastal communities	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Municipal; Adaptation; Coproduction; Flooding; Climate; Knowledge to action	SEA-LEVEL RISE; TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH; SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE; KNOWLEDGE; INDICATORS; BARRIERS	Municipalities are key agents in the transition to sustainability, and yet we have poorly developed theories and practices for how to facilitate the use of climate information by local governments in adapting to climate change. Existing research suggests that climate information is more likely to lead to adaptation actions when it is coproduced by researchers and policy makers because doing so increases the likelihood that the content of information is credible, salient, and legitimate. In this study, we explored how the coproduction process facilitated or hindered use of information from two climate adaptation projects in coastal New Hampshire. Based on 17 interviews and document review, we found that, contrary to expectations, highly engaged coproduction of knowledge may not be necessary due, in part, to preexisting trust among New Hampshire coastal municipalities, technical service providers, and researchers. However, we found in small towns with limited capacity, even the best climate knowledge is unlikely to be used without ongoing context-specific implementation assistance. Our research provides both practical recommendations for those actively advancing climate adaptation, as well as contributions to the undertheorized third phase of transdisciplinary research in which knowledge is translated to action.

However, maladaptation can happen when adaptation actions unintentionally increase community vulnerability. To evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of adaptation policies under uncertain sea-level rise, this study presents an agent-based model by integrating the random nature of storm surges, private adaptation decisions, and real estate market valuation. We evaluated the evolving flood damage of different adaptation strategies under two bounding cases of real estate market change. Our model results quantitatively illustrate the accelerating damages of storm surges under climate-induced sea-level rise. A reform in flood insurance to risk-based rates with a means-tested voucher program and a government-subsidized "twice and out" buyout program could both substantially improve coastal resilience. However, community adaptation with a public seawall may deliver false risk perception to high-risk property owners and result in maladaptation when sea-level rise rate is high. The modeling approach developed in this study can be used as a policy analysis tool to measure the impacts of sea-level rise and the effectiveness of adaptation strategies in coastal communities.

Salinity Tolerance and Occurrence of <i>Salix nigra</i> Marshall (Black Willow) in Tidal Wetlands of Chesapeake Bay Tributaries	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FRESH-WATER; FOREST; DYNAMICS; SPP.	Salix nigra Marshall (Black Willow) is a pioneer tree species that establishes in North American river floodplains and is widely used for bank stabilization. However, its salinity tolerance and occurrence in tidal wetlands of estuarine systems along the North American Atlantic coast is largely unknown. Climate change accompanied by land subsidence and changes in precipitation pattern induce increases in salinity that may affect coastal vegetation. Alteration of hydromorphology of coastal plain estuaries causes additional increases in salinity that affects forested tidal freshwater wetlands. We investigated the salinity tolerance and occurrence of Black Willow in tidal wetlands of 2 Chesapeake Bay tributaries and in a greenhouse hydroponic experiment. A salinity of more than 1 part per thousand (ppt) salt limited the willows' occurrence in the field and the cuttings' performance in the experiment. Dry mass was significantly lower in salinity of 2 and 3 ppt compared to the control and salinity of 1 ppt. Cuttings originating from tidal freshwater wetlands developed more belowground biomass and leaves than cuttings from brackish wetlands. The better performance of cuttings originating from tidal freshwater wetlands may indicate a higher resilience to short-term increases in salinity in tidal freshwater wetland forests with implications for tidal forest restoration in eastern North America.

J	Li, ZM; Zhang, XX; Ma, YF; Feng, CY; Hajiyev, A				Li, Zongmin; Zhang, Xinxin; Ma, Yanfang; Feng, Cuiying; Hajiyev, Asaf			A multi-criteria decision making method for urban flood resilience evaluation with hybrid uncertainties	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urban Flood Resilience; Hesitant fuzzy VIKOR; Information aggregation; Multi-criteria decision making	GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; SUSTAINABILITY; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; CITIES	Urbanization and climate change have increased the frequency of damaging urban floods. While some urban floods are inevitable, it is critical to ensure urban flood resilience to minimize flood losses. This paper develops an urban flood resilience evaluation system that can provide guidance for municipal decision makers. This study first builds a comprehensive flood resilience evaluation system with the whole period of the disaster cycle that covers the resistance capacity before a flood, the coping and recovery capacities during a flood, and the adaptive capacity after a flood. The proposed evaluation system includes hybrid uncertain information that involves hesitant fuzzy judgements from experts and random data. Then, to conquer the weighting difficulty, a maximum consensus model for experts' weights is proposed. After that, the traditional VIKOR method is expanded to aggregate all crisp, random and hesitant fuzzy information, so that, the aggregation method is more adaptive to hybrid uncertain environment. In addition, the proposed method is applied to 5 south-eastern coastal cities in P.R.China. Practical managerial suggestions are put forward to increase urban flood resilience in these cities. Finally, the sensitivity analysis for the results and the comparison analysis are conducted.

As the introducer, China plays a key role in the initiative. However, the coastal areas in China have frequently been hit by typhoons that lead to huge casualties and economic losses. In order to reduce damages caused by natural disasters, this paper selected the coastal regions of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road as the study areas, specifically Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan, to estimate the vulnerability to typhoon disasters based on the historical data about typhoon disasters and the super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluation model. Although Shanghai is a low-vulnerable region, it needs to pay close attention to the risk of typhoon disasters due to the outstanding economic influence. In addition, it was found that the vulnerability to typhoons in Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hainan showed a dramatic fluctuation from 2011 to 2016, and Zhejiang's vulnerability in 2013 was extremely high compared to other years. Meanwhile, Guangdong and Hainan are highly vulnerable areas, suffering from typhoon disasters heavily. Moreover, the vulnerability to typhoons for Fujian is relatively low.

Incorporating surface runoff and conduit flow modelling capabilities has enabled the prediction of urban flood hazards. This study synthesises methodologies for simulating flood processes and evaluating flood hazards in urban environment. Existing models and their associated uncertainties are summarised, and state-of-the-art techniques to build up a numerical model for simulating urban floods and the applications to specific cases are illustrated. A schematic framework for urban flood hazard prediction is proposed, within which multi-source observation retrieval, physics-based modelling, parameter optimisation, uncertainty estimation, model-observation fusion, evaluation of compound effects of multiple factors and digital twin techniques are included. The major challenges and uncertainties in flood process modelling originate from input data, model structures, validation processes and compounding effects. Multidisciplinary techniques for estimating the input data and enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the flood evaluation should be developed. Great efforts are needed in understanding the process-dependent indicators, coupled modelling and data-model assimilation. Determining the probability of compound floods and understanding the driving factors are also essential for evaluating flood risks.

Over the past 30 years, nature-dependent livelihood and economic activities have generated employment, income and shelter to people but has also enhanced exposure level and consequent vulnerability and risks to fast growing economic activities and human settlements to projected climate-induced natural disasters. Satellite imageries clearly show the changing land-use pattern due to human intervention. On the ground, questionnaire-based, face-to-face interview method has helped in understanding the key drivers behind the changing economic activities, occupation category-wise exposure and vulnerability of the people along the coast. Fishing, salt-shrimp practice, fish drying, agriculture, tourism, and related small trading business are now the main economic activities, and human settlement expansion has changed the coastal ecosystem. The vulnerability assessment suggests that the fast emergence of salt-shrimp farm-based employment and livelihood is one of the most sensitive to natural threats. As per anthropogenic threats, the hotel and restaurant industries are polluting the most fragile coastal ecosystem.

Some technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), can potentially sequester billions of tons of CO2 per year. One of the promising methods is the use of carbon mineralization as a CCS methodology. For this approach, some minerals can be investigated, such as wollastonite, which can be obtained from agricultural waste recovery. One topic of interest in these studies is agriculture, demonstrating that it can play an important role in climate change mitigation. This work presents a critical review of the studies of rice waste use for potential synthesizing wollastonite as a path for CO2 storage, promoting the circular economy. Several works were analyzed and presented, addressing eco-friendly wollastonite use, such as in the cement industry, and they can contribute to a lower global warming potential. There is a promising way to explore, once there are few studies in the literature about CO2 capture and storage of wollastonite by carbon mineralization.

Catchments are complex systems with interrelated natural, social, and technical aspects. The exposure, vulnerability, and resilience of these aspects (separately and in combination) are the latent conditions, which, when triggered by a hydrohazard, result in catchment impacts. In complex catchment systems, resilience is the ability to bounce back, the ability to absorb, and the ability to transform. When all three abilities are accounted for, we are forced to consider the interactions of the catchment system. Six main complexity concepts can be used to frame how we approach evaluating catchment resilience. These concepts are: natural-social-technical aspects, interactions, spatial scales, time scales, multiple forms of evidence, and uncertainty. In analysing these complexity concepts, we have found that there are several gaps in current practice. Requirements for future methodological approaches are suggested. Central to any effective approach is the incorporation of a linking systems or interaction analysis, which draws together the natural-social-technical system in a meaningful way. If our approaches do not begin to acknowledge the interdependencies and interactions, we may miss substantial opportunities to enhance catchment resilience.

Local stakeholders have developed various measures for coping with flooding impacts according to past experience. These adaptive measures not only involve managing the impact of heavy rainfall but also resisting the disastrous effects of land subsidence. However, in 2009, Typhoon Morakot caused multiple days of intense rainfall and nearly rendered ineffective the adaptive measures employed to prevent damage. Stakeholders adopt diverse measures according to different needs and vulnerabilities. Consequently, some adaptive measures are likely to cause an increase in the vulnerability of different sectors and induce additional socioeconomic impacts. This paper presents the results of a semistructured questionnaire and field survey conducted for analyzing the adaptive measures adopted by local stakeholders before and after Typhoon Morakot. According to the routes and pathways of maladaptation in the Jiadung coastal area, this study analyzed the main adaptive measures and functions as well as identified the entities affected by maladaptation. Furthermore, this study emphasizes a bottom-up viewpoint for adaptation policy decision makers.

In these regions, the effects of environmental stressors overlap with rapid urbanization, which significantly aggravates the hazard potential. Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in southern Vietnam is a prime example of this set of problems and therefore a suitable case study to apply the concept of low-regret disaster risk adaptation as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In order to explore and evaluate potential options of hazard mitigation, a hydro-numerical model was employed to scrutinize the effectiveness of two adaptation strategies: (1) a classic flood protection scheme including a large-scale ring dike as currently constructed in HCMC and (2) the widespread installation of small-scale rainwater detention as envisioned in the framework of the Chinese Sponge City Program (SCP). A third adaptation scenario (3) assesses the combination of both approaches (1) and (2). From a hydrological point of view, the reduction in various flood intensity proxies that were computed within this study suggests that large-scale flood protection is comparable but slightly more effective than small-scale rainwater storage: for instance, the two adaptation options could reduce the normalized flood severity index (INFS), which is a measure combining flood depth and duration, by 17.9% and 17.7 %, respectively. The number of flood-prone manufacturing firms that would be protected after adaptation, in turn, is nearly 2 times higher for the ring dike than for the Sponge City approach. However, the numerical results also reveal that both response options can be implemented in parallel, not only without reducing their individual effectiveness but also complementarily with considerable added value. Additionally, from a governance perspective, decentralized rainwater storage conforms ideally to the low-regret paradigm: while the existing large-scale ring dike depends on a binary commitment (to build or not to build), decentralized small- and micro-scale solutions can be implemented gradually (for example through targeted subsidies) and add technical redundancy to the overall system. In the end, both strategies are highly complementary in their spatial and temporal reduction in flood intensity. Local decision-makers may hence specifically seek combined strategies, adding to singular approaches, and design multi-faceted adaptation pathways in order to successfully prepare for a deeply uncertain future.

The relationship between human settlement, climate change, and the frequency of flooding at long time scales is still unclear primarily due to the lack of a robust chronology for flooding deposits. In this study, AMS 14C dating, single-grain quartz OSL dating, and single-grain K-feldspar pIRIR dating using pIR50IR170 and pIR200IR290 signals were applied to the fluvial-paleosol sequence at the archaeology site Shalongka (SLK20) in the upper Yellow River valley on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, where Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age cultural layers were found. Utilizing luminescence characteristics analysis and a comparison of quartz OSL ages, K-feldspar pIRIR ages, and charcoal 14C ages, the reliability of single-grain quartz OSL and K-feldspar pIRIR ages was tested. Our results indicate that single-grain K-feldspar pIRIR170 dating with the minimum age model (MAM) can be used to date Holocene fluvial deposit that have been poorly bleached. Based on the age-depth model, proxy data of the SLK20 grain size and magnetic susceptibility demonstrate that Yellow River overbank flooding increased during the periods 9.9-9.1,-8.0, 7.6-6.3 and 5.0-3.4 kyr BP; during the intervals between these periods, Yellow River overbank decreased and paleosols developed. Human occupations, as indicated by the appearance of cultural layers at the SLK20 site during the-8.1,-7.8, 6.3-5.0 and 3.4-2.0 kyr BP periods, occurred when paleosol developed. The variation in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensities caused a moist and warm mid-Holocene climate at the SLK20 site, which was conducive to human settlement. Flood events caused by EASM precipitation changes during the mid -Holocene significantly influenced human settlement at the SLK20 site. During the middle to late Holo-cene, as EASM decreased in the region, the improvement of subsistence strategies likely dominated human settlement on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Contemporary Trends in River Flow, Suspended Sediment Load, and Soil/Gully Erosion in the South of the Boreal Forest Zone of European Russia: The Vyatka River Basin	WATER			English	Article						large river; runoff; discharge; sediment yield; soil freezing; land-use change; land-cover change; abandoned land; climate change; taiga; East European Plain	SOIL-EROSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS; CATCHMENT; COMPACTION; TRANSPORT; FRESH; YIELD	Recent decades in the north of the East European Plain have been characterized by significant changes in climate and land use/cover, especially after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. At the same time, the hydrological consequences of these changes, especially changes in erosion processes and river sediment load, have been studied insufficiently. This paper partially covers this existing knowledge gap using the example of the Vyatka River basin. Draining an area of 129,000 km(2), the Vyatka River is among the largest rivers in the boreal forest zone of European Russia. Cultivated land occupies about one-fifth of the river basin area; about three-fourths is covered by taiga forest vegetation. The results of state long-term hydrometeorological monitoring and information on land use/cover made it possible to reveal contemporary (since the 1960s) hydrological and erosion-intensity trends and their drivers within the greater (96%) part of the river basin. There has been a statistically insignificant increase in water discharge in the Vyatka River basin during recent decades. This is due to a statistically insignificant increase (for the entire basin studied) in the spring snowmelt-induced floodwater flow and a statistically significant rise in the discharge in the year's warm and cold seasons. The main reason for the detected trends is increased precipitation, including heavy rainfall during the warm season. In contrast to this, the total annual suspended sediment load of the river (especially that which was snowmelt-induced) and, consequently, soil/gully erosion intensity have experienced a significant decrease in recent decades (up to 58% between 1960-1980 and 2010-2018). Land-use/-cover changes (a reduction of cultivated land area and agricultural machinery, a decline of livestock in pastures) following the collapse of the Soviet Union are considered the main reasons for this decrease. The most noticeable changes in water discharge, suspended sediment load, and erosion intensity were observed in the most agriculturally developed southwest and south parts of the Vyatka River basin. All the above trends may be considered with a high probability to be representative for the south sector of the taiga zone of the East European Plain.

Toward a mechanistic understanding of "peat collapse" and its potential contribution to coastal wetland loss	ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon balance; coastal peatland; coastal wetlands; mangrove; peat collapse; salt marsh; sea level rise; soil elevation loss; subsidence; wetland loss	SEA-LEVEL RISE; TIDAL FRESH-WATER; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; MANGROVE FORESTS; SALTWATER INTRUSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARSH; SALINITY; BAY; RESPONSES	Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

In the recent past, scientists and public organizations have built consid-erable work around this concept launched in 2013 by the United Nations as "the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability". In the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27), held in Sharm El-Sheikh (Egypt) in last November, water security was considered a priority in the climate agenda, especially in the adaption and loss and damage axes. This discussion paper represents the authors' opinion about how the conference coped with water security and what challenges remain to attend. As discussion paper, it had the purpose to stimulate further discussion in a broader scientific forum.

However, it is still a challenge to operationalise and quantify resilience. This study proposes a framework for assessing resilience to disasters based on the relationship between disaster intensity and damage rate. We use intense (short-term heavy) rainfall-induced urban flooding in Shenzhen city, one of the largest cities in China, as an example to explore the main features and transferability of the proposed resilience assessment framework. In addition, we demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework by using it to assess and compare the effectiveness of two resilience-building strategies: (1) permeable pavement transformation and (2) land vulnerability reduction. This research makes an innovative contribution through its effective disaster-damage-based approach for quantitatively evaluating urban resilience to disasters, which can support building resilience and mitigating the impact of climate change.

Many floods are caused by heavy rainfall with highly saturated soil; however, the relative importance of rainfall and antecedent soil moisture and how it changes from place to place has not been fully understood. Here we examined annual floods from more than 200 hydrological stations in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin. Our results indicate that the dominant factor in flood generation shifts from rainfall to antecedent soil moisture with the increase in watershed area. The ratio of the relative importance of antecedent soil moisture and daily rainfall (SPR) is positively correlated with topographic wetness index and has a negative correlation with the magnitude of annual floods. This linkage between watershed characteristics that are easy to measure and the dominant flood-generation mechanism provides a framework to quantitatively estimate potential flood risk in ungauged watersheds in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin.

Two months of significantly rich floods are observed at all gauging stations. The spatial distribution of floods presents three patterns: the north and northwest pattern, south and southeast pattern, and west/east pattern. It is observed that unimodal flood distribution is coherent in the northern and southern parts, as opposed to the bimodal flood distribution observed along the large band of the Equator from west to east of the basin. The time lag of flood indices suggests that the flood regime is not stationary. In addition, the time series show periods of high flooding, with POT frequencies and amplitudes higher during the 1960s and early 1970s than any other time period.

Besides the study of spatial and temporal variability of precipitation, this study created a water hazard risk map along the "Belt and Road" zone through combined flood and drought data from 1985. Our results showed that South-Eastern Asia, southern China and eastern Southern Asia are areas with the most abundant precipitations, while floods in these areas are also the most serious. Northwest China, Western Asia, Northern Africa and Southern Asia are areas highly vulnerable to drought. Furthermore, the potential influence of flood and drought were also analyzed by associating with population distribution and corridor map. It reveals that China, South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Western Asia and Northern Africa have the largest population number facing potential high water hazard risk. China-India-Burma Corridor and China-Indo-China Peninsula Corridor have the largest areas facing potential high water hazard risk.

Here, we investigate whether its signals are already detectable in reported river flood damages. We develop an empirical model to reconstruct observed damages and quantify the contributions of climate and socio-economic drivers to observed trends. We show that, on the level of nine world regions, trends in damages are dominated by increasing exposure and modulated by changes in vulnerability, while climate-induced trends are comparably small and mostly statistically insignificant, with the exception of South & Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Asia. However, when disaggregating the world regions into subregions based on river-basins with homogenous historical discharge trends, climate contributions to damages become statistically significant globally, in Asia and Latin America. In most regions, we find monotonous climate-induced damage trends but more years of observations would be needed to distinguish between the impacts of anthropogenic climate forcing and multidecadal oscillations. This study introduces an empirical modeling approach allowing to separate climate and socio-economic drivers of damages by fluvial floods. It shows that climate signals are clearly detectable in Asia and Latin America.

J	Hülssiep, M; Thaler, T; Fuchs, S				Huelssiep, Marina; Thaler, Thomas; Fuchs, Sven			The impact of humanitarian assistance on post-disaster social vulnerabilities: some early reflections on the Nepal earthquake in 2015	DISASTERS			English	Article						accountability; earthquake; humanitarian assistance; Nepal; Pressure and Release (PAR) model; social vulnerability	FLOOD RISK; DISASTER RESILIENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Every year, thousands of people around the world who face unequal access to political and social power and resources lose their lives and/or livelihoods in natural hazard events. As a result, the reduction of vulnerability has become a central concern of humanitarian actors. This paper analyses the impact of humanitarian assistance on vulnerabilities in Nepal following the Gorkha earthquake on 25 April 2015. The causes and manifestations of vulnerability before and after the disaster are determined through the application of the Pressure and Release model and the adoption of a mixed-methods research approach. The findings of the study reveal that 20 months after the earthquake, humanitarian assistance had not had any long-term positive influences on the root causes of the phenomenon, and that vulnerabilities at the micro level could be resolved in part. To diminish the extent of disasters in the future, however, the fundamental reasons for the vulnerability have to be addressed better.

In order to accomplish this goal, a number of research methods were applied, including techniques for the identification of closures within the road network, the determination of the catchment area, and modelling the distribution of traffic flows. The proposed methods can be applied in modelling and simulating traffic both in regular conditions and in the event of a non-typical occurrence as the study involved integrated methods of combined probability theory of spatial integration and the determination of the catchment market area, the application of which would not be possible without access to and availability of a wide spectrum of sources. The study showed that non-typical events have a statistically noticeable impact on accessibility to grocery products.

Non-structural measures, such as risk communication, can reduce vulnerability by improving flood risk awareness, but they require a deep understanding of which factors influence risk awareness, and how. We analysed and untangled the role of experience with, and knowledge of, floods by conducting a survey in a municipality in North-eastern Italy that was hit by a flash flood in 2018. The results show that previous experience with floods influences risk awareness not only directly, but also indirectly through the knowledge that was gained from that experience. In addition, specific (as opposed to generic) definitions of experience have been found to be better suited for exploring their effects on risk awareness. Based on the literature and on our results, we propose an experience-knowledge typology to help unravel the complex role that these two variables play in shaping flood risk awareness.

Experimental and Numerical Analysis of Two-Phase Flows in Plunge Pools	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							AIR-WATER FLOW; SKIMMING FLOW; MEAN FLOW; TURBULENCE; ENTRAINMENT; JET; DOWNSTREAM; REGION	The current capacity of many spillways may be insufficient due to the increase in flood flows as a result of climate change. In those cases, the dam may be overtopped, generating new loading scenarios downstream of the dam. To date, information regarding the behavior of air-water flows in the plunge pool of free-falling jets is scarce. This study combines experimental and numerical approaches to analyze the submerged hydraulic jump generated downstream of overflow nappe impinging jets. A back-flushing Pitot tube and an optical probe were used to measure the velocity field and air entrainment rate. The velocity field allows to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The choice of the turbulence model played a key role in the wall jet resolution. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, it was possible to estimate the Sauter mean air bubble diameter in the entire submerged hydraulic jump. The results are in agreement with recordings obtained with a high-speed camera.	[Carrillo, J. M.; Castillo, L. G.; Marco, F.; Garcia, J.

The Global Flood Protection Benefits of Mangroves	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SEA-LEVEL; COASTAL PROTECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REANALYSIS; VALUATION; EXPOSURE; FORESTS; FUTURE; SCALE	Coastal flood risks are rising rapidly. We provide high resolution estimates of the economic value of mangroves forests for flood risk reduction every 20 km worldwide. We develop a probabilistic, process-based valuation of the effects of mangroves on averting damages to people and property. We couple spatially-explicit 2-D hydrodynamic analyses with economic models, and find that mangroves provide flood protection benefits exceeding $US 65 billion per year. If mangroves were lost, 15 million more people would be flooded annually across the world. Some of the nations that receive the greatest economic benefits include the USA, China, India and Mexico. Vietnam, India and Bangladesh receive the greatest benefits in terms of people protected. Many (>45) 20-km coastal stretches particularly those near cities receive more than $US 250 million annually in flood protection benefits from mangroves. These results demonstrate the value of mangroves as natural coastal defenses at global, national and local scales, which can inform incentives for mangrove conservation and restoration in development, climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and insurance.

Culture and cognition: Understanding public perceptions of risk and (in)action	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEOPLE KNOW; DECISION; MORTALITY; JUDGMENT; VULNERABILITY; TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS	Much is known about the effects of risk on behavior and communication, yet little research has considered how these risks influence modes of cultural and cognitive processing dynamics that underlie public perceptions, communications, and social (in)action. This article presents a psychological model of risk communications that demonstrates how cognitive structure, cultural schema, and environment awareness could be combined to improve risk communication. We illustrate the explanatory value of the models usefulness on two qualitative case studies: one on decision-makers facing extreme heat, and another on homeowners facing flood events. Consistent with the model predictions, we find that cognitive structure, cultural schema, and environment awareness dynamics are not only necessary determinants to strengthen risk communications, but also important for understanding perceptions of risk and peoples (in)action to engage in mitigation and adoption efforts. This suggests that decision-makers hoping to reduce disaster risk or improve disaster resilience may wish to consider how these three dynamics exist and interact.

In this paper we describe and demonstrate swmm_mpc, software developed for simulating model predictive control (MPC) for urban drainage systems using open source software (Python and the EPA Stormwater Management Model version 5 (SWMM5)). Swmm_mpc uses an evolutionary algorithm as an optimizer and supports parallel processing. In the demonstration case for a hypothetical, tidally-influenced urban drainage system, the swmm_mpc control policies for two storage units achieved its objectives of 1) practically eliminating flooding and 2) maintaining the water level at the storage units close to a target level. Although the current swmm_mpc workflow was feasible for a simple model using a desktop PC, a high-performance computer or cloud-based computer with more computational cores would likely be needed for most real-world models.

Calculation of nonstationary flood return period considering historical extraordinary flood events	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ARX model; historical extraordinary flood; nonstationarity; return period	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; TIME-SERIES; CLIMATE; STATIONARITY; RISK; PEAK	With climate change and intensification of human activities, the flood generation mechanism has been influenced which results in the nonstationarity of flood time series. In this study, in order to use historical flood data for flood frequency analysis, a nonlinear AutoRegressive exogenous (ARX) model was employed to complement missing flood data between the historical and recorded data. The key statistics of the complemented time series agreed well with those of the documented record. Using EWT (the expected waiting time until an exceedance) and ENE (the expected number of events in m year is one), nonstationary flood return periods were estimated by the complemented and recorded annual maximum flood peak series, respectively. The results showed that the return levels under nonstationarity are smaller than those under stationarity due to the construction of small hydraulic structures and many check dams after 1980s. This study implies that it is necessary to refine the flood return levels and the corresponding flood control measures for nonstationary flood series due to environmental change.

Our literature review, however, indicates that fluvial aggradation does not always coincide with summer insolation maxima but may also occur during transitions between insolation maxima and minima or even during summer insolation minima. Tectonic uplift as a driver of fluvial incision has not been considered in the current terrace formation models, despite the Peruvian margin being located above an active subduction zone. We present new chronologic, stratigraphic and geomorphic data of the Canete River valley over the past 102 +/- 6 ka. We mapped its fluvial terraces (11.5 degrees-13 degrees southern latitude) along a 75-km long reach perpendicular to the strike of the Andes. Five fluvial terraces and one floodplain level were identified with relative elevations of up to 181.1 m above the floodplain. Thirty-three (pIR) IRSL ages of eight fluvial terraces and one alluvial fan sediment sample showed that their ages in part correspond to summer insolation maxima of the precession cycle, but that a better match exists with pluvial periods that coincided with Heinrich events of the northern hemisphere and rising lake levels in the Andes. The chronology of terraces of the Canete River agrees with those of previously studied fluvial systems between 7 degrees and 16 degrees southern latitude in Peru, suggesting a regional-scale fluvial response possibly to the Heinrich events. Reconstructed longitudinal profiles and terrace ages were utilised to calculate vertical incision rates. We calculated a mean rate of 1.8 +/- 0.10 mm a(-1) over the last 102 +/- 6 ka, but incision rates varied considerably within this time period possibly in response to changes in the Qs: Qw ratio as a consequence of increased sediment input during the wet Heinrich events. A set of 1338 GNSS measurements of daily, vertical crustal deformation of the years 2009-2015 showed a continuous and positive trend in interseismic, accumulative vertical crustal movements with a time-averaged, crustal uplift rate of 1.9 +/- 3.6 mm a(-1). The positive trend in vertical movements, together with data from literature suggest landscape rejuvenation along the forearc and western Cordillera in central Peru. It is proposed that maximally similar to 0.5 mm a(-1) of the total incision over the past 102 ka may possibly be related to nonrecoverable, interseismic deformation. Climate change-driven variations in the Qs:Qw ratio are superimposed on the long-term tectonic uplift trend, and both are considered the main drivers of fluvial incision.

A ten-thousand-year history of a Cretan landscape (Greece) reveals the dominant role of humans in making this Mediterranean ecosystem	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Paleoecology; Anthropisation; Human impacts; Olive grove; Holocene; Crete; Mediterranean; Socio-ecosystem; Land-use; Biodiversity	SEA-LEVEL CHANGES; LONG-TERM CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; FLOOD FREQUENCY; ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY; HOLOCENE VEGETATION; FIRE HISTORY; HUMAN IMPACT; FRENCH ALPS	The reconstruction of millennial-scale interactions between ecosystems and societies can provide unique and valuable references for understanding the creation of cultural landscapes and help elucidate their value, weaknesses and legacies. Among the most emblematic forms of Mediterranean land use, olive groves and pastoralism have occupied a prominent place. Therefore, it is vital to know when, how, and with what ecological consequences these practices were established and developed. Located in the southern part of the Aegean Sea, Crete is the largest island of Greece. The island is characterised by a long human history of land use, but our understanding of past environmental changes for the entire Holocene is fragmentary. This paper presents a new investigation of Lake Kournas in Crete, where recent coring provided a 15-m sequence covering ten millennia of land cover and land-use history. The study of this new core involves the analysis of the sediment dynamics, flood deposits, pollen, diatoms, fungal and algal remains, and microcharcoals. Results show that ecosystem development near Lake Kournas was not a linear process. They reveal linkages and feedbacks between vegetation, biodiversity, fire, human impact, erosion, and climate change. A possible human occupation and agro-pastoral activities around the lake may have been detected as early as 9500 cal BP, perhaps in a transitional phase between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. At 8500 cal BP, climatic conditions may have promoted the expansion of the evergreen oak woodland. However, human impact was probably the most important driver of ecosystem change with the establishment of an agro-system after 8000 years ago. Thereafter, the trajectory of Kournas' lake and catchment ecosystems from the Mid to Late Holocene follow the rhythm of land-use change. Among the traditional Mediterranean land uses, olive cultivation locally played a major role in the socio-ecosystem interactions, providing economic benefits but also destabilising soils. During the last six millennia, three main phases of olive cultivation occurred during the Final Neolithic-Minoan period, the Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine (HRB) period and Modern times. Along with the changing land use under the successive political and economic influences rules, the resilience capacities of vegetation permitted it to shift back to higher biodiversity again after decreasing phases. Forest vegetation was always able to recover until the onset of the Venetian period (13th century), when woodlands were dramatically reduced. Only during the past century has forest vegetation slightly recovered, while the flood regime had already been altered during previous centuries. During the past 100 years, biodiversity markedly declined, probably in response to the industrialization of agriculture. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Inventing a robust road-vehicle flood level monitoring device for disaster mitigation	HELIYON			English	Article						Flood; Flood level monitoring; Road flooding; Water sensor-probe; Road vehicle safety	PERFORMANCE; RISK; VULNERABILITY	Flooding impedes road utility and the frequency has increased across countries of the world owing to global climate change phenomena. Global road flooding casualties have risen from 371,800 in 2015 to 842,000 in 2017 resulting to economic losses valued at approximately US$71 billion. Existing devices that offer warning signals on safe threshold during flooding are predictive in nature and based on complex technologies that are cumbersome and rather expensive thereby affecting the attractiveness to low-economy societies of developing countries. There is therefore a dare need for better inventions towards greater mitigation. This paper presents an adaptive, affordable, robust, efficient and effective road vehicle flood level monitoring device for detecting rising flood on roads above a user defined safe threshold to mitigate road flooding disasters. The device operates on the principle of level conductivity sensor. The developed device offers interoperability with Google map enabling the level of flood on road to be accessed by road users online when fully commercialized. By this, road users are aware of the dangerous levels of flood to enable them use alternative routes. The study therefore recommends for adoption of mandatory inclusion of this invention on roads towards averting the usual road flooding hazard in Africa.

They organized coordinating services, developed emergent forms of SVs and thus hold the potential to improve existing flood managing capacities. This raises the need for in-depth knowledge about SVs and organization, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), social and individual aspects. This article analyzed results of an online survey (n = 2636) with the aim to discuss challenges and potentials to develop SVs as social innovations in flood risk management. As a result, SVs are strong value-based motivated, can be psychologically stressed and travel long distances, especially when they got aware of helping possibilities via social media. Disaster relief organizations rarely cooperate with or integrate SVs, but when they collaborate, SVs' satisfaction with authorities increases significantly. Based on the results, this article derives preplanning of useful concepts consider safety aspects, ICT utilization, foster mutual respect between SVs and authorities and supporting sense of community as key results for development of social innovations. Especially in light of pandemics, social crisis like refugee movements, and climate change-related disasters, the requirement rises for engaging SVs.

In this paper, a large-scale coupled hydrological-hydrodynamic-dam operation model is developed to comprehensively evaluate the hydrological effects of the river-type Three Gorges Reservoir. The results show that the coupled model is effective for hydrological, hydrodynamic regime and hydropower simulations in the reservoir area. Dam operation could have a notable positive effect on flood control and could reduce the maximum daily flood peak by up to 26.2%. It also contributes a large amount of hydropower, approximately 94.27 TWh/year, and a water supply increase for the downstream area of up to 22% during the dry season. In the flood season, the water level at Cuntan would increase under the condition that the water level of the dam is higher than approximately 158 m due to dam operation. In the dry season, attention should be paid to the low flow velocity near the dam in the reservoir area.

Vulnerability analysis in complex networks under a flood risk reduction point of view	FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS			English	Article						disasters; transportation; vulnerability; floods; graphs; complex networks; systematic literature mapping	ROAD TRANSPORT; ACCESSIBILITY; RESILIENCE; IMPACT	The measurement and mapping of transportation network vulnerability to natural hazards constitute subjects of global interest for a sustainable development agenda and as means of adaptation to climate change. During a flood, some elements of a transportation network can be affected, causing the loss of lives. Furthermore, impacts include damage to vehicles, streets/roads, and other logistics services - sometimes with severe economic consequences. The Network Science approach may offer a valuable perspective considering one type of vulnerability related to network-type critical infrastructures: the topological vulnerability. The topological vulnerability index associated with an element is defined as reducing the network's average efficiency due to removing the set of edges related to that element. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature overview and a case study applying the topological vulnerability index for the highways in Santa Catarina (Brazil). We produce a map considering that index and areas susceptible to urban floods and landslides. Risk knowledge, combining hazard and vulnerability, is the first pillar of an Early Warning System and represents an important tool for stakeholders of the transportation sector in a disaster risk reduction agenda.

Green roofs have significant potential for mitigating urban runoffs that have not been adequately utilized due to a lack of research offering appropriate guidelines. This review paper provides a holistic analysis of the application of green roofs for maximizing their runoff control capacity. These factors are discussed in six categories 1) design properties including the thickness of the layers, the surface area of the roof, and the slope of the roof; 2) substrate and growing media properties; 3) climatic factors including seasonal variability, weather temperature, and rain characteristics; 4) vegetation properties including type, phytoremediation potential, the need for fertilizers and pesticides, and plants diversity; 5) roof age, and 6) quality of maintenance. For each factor, research findings are reviewed, and the possible inconsistencies in them are discussed. The research also aims at highlighting the existing gaps in the research about the hydrologic performance of green roofs in urban areas.

The high population density and the multiplicity of land use, occupation and activities, makes it an area of great national strategic value. This transforms the coastal zone into a multi-hazard zone, where the occurrences related to coastal flooding and overtopping stand out. In the present work, a multidimensional methodology called Coastal Territorial Vulnerability Index (CTVI) was developed and applied in three selected areas with a historical record of coastal impacts, to analyze, evaluate and interpret the local vulnerability. The methodology considers four components of coastal territorial vulnerability: morphology, land value, buildings and public areas characteristics. These four components are combined to calculate the CTVI. The results highlight the differences for the analyzed areas, allowing the differentiation of natural and artificial areas. In the natural areas a moderate CTVI predominates, while in the latter, a high and very high CTVI stands out. The results contribute to the development of a comprehensive coastal flood risk assessment and forecasting the impacts.

Natural flood protection streamlining the planning of flood detention in natural landscapes for the reduction of urban flooding	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						flood management; integrated stormwater management; interdisciplinary collaboration; natural flood detention facilities; natural landscapes		A number of cost-effective and environmentally friendly flood reduction measures can provide detention of runoff from natural landscapes upstream of urban areas, with multiple added benefits. This study presents a methodology for assessing the needs for and feasibility of natural flood detention facilities. The candidate catchments for natural flood detention facilities were identified by GIS analysis and further assessed using data from maps and field inspections. Results for two case catchments show that a suitable topography and nature and biodiversity are key feasibility criteria for natural flood detention facilities. The study concluded that it is possible to streamline the process of selecting the location and type of natural flood detentions facilities. Map analyses, field inspections and interdisciplinary collaboration are all important when planning natural flood detention facilities. As a result of the study, the City of Oslo will construct several natural flood detention facilities upstream of the city to gain practical experience with such facilities. While it is not expected that natural flood detention will solve all flooding problems in urban areas, it is expected that natural flood detention can positively contribute to future resilient stormwater management and the implementation of the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change.

Methods We obtained data on hospitalisations and hydro-meteorological factors during 2011-2014 for seven MRD provinces. We classified each day into a flood-season exposure period: the 2011 extreme annual flood (EAF); 2012-2014 routine annual floods (RAF); dry season and non-flood wet season (reference period). We used province-specific Poisson regression models to calculate hospitalisation incidence rate ratios (IRRs). We pooled IRRs across provinces using random-effects meta-analysis. Results During the EAF, non-external cause hospitalisations increased 7.2% (95% CI 3.2% to 11.4%); infectious disease hospitalisations increased 16.4% (4.3% to 29.8%) and respiratory disease hospitalisations increased 25.5% (15.5% to 36.4%). During the RAF, respiratory disease hospitalisations increased 8.2% (3.2% to 13.5%). During the dry season, hospitalisations decreased for non-external causes and for each specific cause except injuries. Conclusions We observed a gradient of decreasing risk of hospitalisation from EAF to RAF/non-flood wet season to dry season. Adaptation measures should be strengthened to prepare for the increased probability of more frequent extreme floods in the future, driven by climate change.

It is important to carry out hazard studies at local scale to improve our understanding of natural and anthropogenic processes involved in episodes of coastal flooding. We reconstruct and characterize an extreme weather event in Tossa de Mar (northeastern Spain) and the subsequent urban flooding that occurred in 2008. Our results show flood heights up to 1.27 m, with the maximum occurring between 24 and 64 h after the start of the event. This is broadly consistent with the reconstructions obtained through interviews and photographs. Based on model simulations, we produce a hazard map for the town based on hydrodynamic scenarios for different return periods. We show that the southern part of the town is more susceptible to flooding, whereas the northern part is relatively resilient to extreme events. We recommend the adaption of a currently existing dune by adding vegetation and slightly increasing its height. This low economic cost action would significantly reduce flooding and increase resilience in this area.

In this context, the authors have developed a simulation model for managing the resilience of electricity distribution grids with respect to the main threats to which these infrastructures may be exposed (i.e., ice sleeves, heat waves, water bombs, floods, tree falls). The simulator identifies the more vulnerable network assets by means of probabilistic indexes, thus suggesting the best corrective actions to be implemented for resilience improvement. The fulfillment of grid constraints, i.e., loading limits for branches and voltage limits for buses, under actual operating conditions, is taken into account. Load scenarios extracted from available measurements are evaluated by means of load flow analyses in order to choose, among the best solutions identified, those compatible with the constraints. The proposed tool can assist Distribution System Operators (DSOs) in drawing up the Action Plan to improve, on one hand, the resilience of the network and, on the other hand, to remove any possible limitation for the adoption of the best solutions to ensure maximum operational continuity during extreme weather events.

Data about dams are crucial for practitioners, scientists, and policymakers for various purposes, such as seasonal forecasting of water availability or flood mitigation. However, detailed information on dams on the national level for Germany is so far not freely available. We present the most comprehensive open-access dam inventory for Germany (DIG) to date. We have collected and combined information on dams using books, state agency reports, engineering reports, and internet pages. We have applied a priority rule that ensures the highest level of reliability for the dam information. Our dam inventory comprises 530 dams in Germany with information on name, location, river, start year of construction and operation, crest length, dam height, lake area, lake volume, purpose, dam structure, and building characteristics. We have used a global, satellite-based water surface raster to evaluate the location of the dams. A significant proportion (63 %) of dams were built between 1950-2013. Our inventory shows that dams in Germany are mostly single-purpose (52 %), 53% can be used for flood control, and 25% are involved in energy production. The inventory is freely available through GFZ (GeoForschungsZentrum) Data Services (https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.4.4.2020.005) (Speckhann et al., 2020).

It lies within the Sahelian zone and faces several natural risks, one of which is flash flooding. Based on a questionnaire entitled Flash Flood Risk Perception in Cape Verde, applied to 203 subjects, influence the behavioural decision making adopted by people when confronted with this natural hazard. A multivariate technique was conducted on the main dimensions (categorical principal components analysis, CATPCA) to identify the primary factors associated with the perception of flash flood risk. Results of this analysis suggest that education level and gender explain more than 50% of the observed variance. Respondents with higher education show greater knowledge about this type of natural risk, although they ascribe its occurrence to divine punishment. Men and women have different perceptions about flash flooding, its causal attributions, and support from public entities regarding planning policies. Prior experience mainly influences the perception of the personal consequences of flash flood events. The results show the relevance of introducing risk education into schools to raise awareness about the causes and consequences of flash floods and improve readiness and responses to this risk manifestation.

This assumption is unrealistic for real flood events and may bias risk estimates for specific return periods. We investigate how three assumptions about the spatial dependence affect risk estimates: (i) spatially homogeneous scenarios (complete dependence), (ii) spatially heterogeneous scenarios (modelled dependence) and (iii) spatially heterogeneous but uncorrelated scenarios (complete independence). To this end, the model chain RFM (regional flood model) is applied to the Elbe catchment in Germany, accounting for the spatio-temporal dynamics of all flood generation processes, from the rainfall through catchment and river system processes to damage mechanisms. Different assumptions about the spatial dependence do not influence the expected annual damage (EAD); however, they bias the risk curve, i.e. the cumulative distribution function of damage. The widespread assumption of complete dependence strongly overestimates flood damage of the order of 100% for return periods larger than approximately 200 years. On the other hand, for small and medium floods with return periods smaller than approximately 50 years, damage is underestimated. The overestimation aggravates when risk is estimated for larger areas. This study demonstrates the importance of representing the spatial dependence of flood peaks and damage for risk assessments.

In the Asso Torrent endorheic basin (Salento peninsula, Southern Italy), a network of natural and artificial channels crossing urban and rural areas and flowing towards six swallow karst holes, several floods occurred in the last six years, after the end of extensive hydraulic works. In this paper, the results of an observational study on the meteorological and hydrological factors concurring to these floods are reported. It was inferred that soil saturation, cumulative precipitation anticipating the events, and clogging of the swallow holes are of relevance and must be considered in the definition of new criteria in decision-making procedure. The adoption of both innovative modeling techniques and real-time control should be an efficient solution to properly regulate the flow control devices before and during the precipitation events. With a view to providing solutions for a sustainable management of the water resources, easy-to-implement measures are suggested, such as the selection of flood-tolerant crops and construction of harvesting systems for alternative water uses.

Like other crops' farmers, rice growers are also facing multifarious challenges, including production and environmental risk. On the one hand, they are suffering from water shortage. On the other hand, if a flood occurs, there is no proper water reservation management, especially in developing countries. Global warming is another erotic topic for agriculture sustainability. To address the growers' perceptions and their attitudes toward such types of risks, a farm base survey was carried out, and rice farmers were investigated in Pakistan. Methods of equally likely certainty equivalent and risk matrix were applied to investigate the farmers' risk perceptions and attitude. A probit model was also used to estimate the factors that influence farmers' perceptions and attitudes toward risks. The outcomes of the study show that flood, input high prices, increasing temperature, and crop diseases are the perceiving risks among rice farmers. Different types of socio-economic factors are influencing farmers' risk perceptions and their attitudes, such as age, education level, a distance of farms from rivers, and non-farm income. This study provides valuable information to the policymakers and concerning authorities to apprehend agricultural risks among rice farmers and farming sustainability, especially in developing countries.

Intensive industrialization, fast urbanization, and prompt modernization have aggravated the water conflicts between different stakeholders. Furthermore, nearly 60% of Chinese population is agglomerated in urban area to exacerbate the water stress in cities, especially in megacities. In order to evaluate the performance of the integrated water resources management (IWRM) in major cities in China, and to reveal the key obstacles and challenges to the IWRM in these cities for future improvement, the modified City Blueprint (R) Approach, in combining with the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), were applied to examine the efficiency, effectiveness, and capability of the IWRM in 32 selected major cities in China, including 4 municipalities directly under the Central Government, 27 provincial capitals, and Shenzhen (a fast-emerging city located on the Pearl River Delta). The City Blueprint (R) Approach, consisting of three complementary frameworks, is a systematic analytic and diagnostic tool to assess the major challenges to cities (Trends and Pressures Framework, TPF), to appraise the management of urban water cycle (City Blueprint Framework, CBF), and to identify the paths of water governance improvement (Governance Capacity Framework, GCF). Significant differences have been observed between various districts and different cities. For TPF, in general, environmental pressures increase as the city scale expands, where river peak discharges and urban drainage flood are two common environmental challenges encountered by all cities. Social pressures decline and the financial pressures slightly decrease as city scale enlarged, where economic pressure and education rate are dominant indicators within each city category, respectively. For CBF, all cities have realized a great achievement in providing good basic water services, in addition to excellent performance of five indicators, drinking water quality, access to drinking water, access to sanitation, wastewater treatment, and management and action plans. In contrast, nutrient and energy recovery, public participation, and solid waste recycling, are the most critical issues to be resolved by all cities. For GCF, higher score in Enabling symbolizes the good performance of governance capacity to result in well management and action plans. Unfortunately, low score in Knowing, especially in the condition of useful knowledge, has caused the poor performance of public participation. Through HCA, the similarities and disparities between cities within diverse city categories were also revealed. In order to enhance the IWRM in major cities in China, various recommendations for future improvement were then provided, accordingly. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Index-based insurance to mitigate current and future extreme events financial losses for water utilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Adaptation measures; Water management; Extreme events	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK REDUCTION; SAO-PAULO; IMPACT; DEMAND	Mitigation and management strategies for extreme weather events become increasingly important for the development and maintenance of society as these events become more frequent and intense. Drought and flood management strategies have focused on structural measures; however, they are not sufficient to prevent water supply disruptions and economic losses. In this concept, adaptation plays the role of anticipating the adverse financial impacts of extreme weather events and taking appropriate measures to minimize them. Therefore, insurance is a valuable adaptation tool to offset unexpected losses and prevent financial damage from turning into long-term economic damage. We simulated multi-year and multi-risk index-based insurance for a Water Supply System, responsible for providing water to 7.2 million people. Our methodology comprises (1) characterizing the indexed variable, (2) calculating economic losses by Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) for current and future periods, and (3) estimating risk premiums based on expected losses of the low, medium, and high coverage levels. Our findings indicate a linear relationship between premium and coverage level, i.e, the higher the premium, the higher the insurance coverage level. We suggested a premium fee for each evaluated scenario, which would be introduced into the water bill as a novel way to pool risk among customers and protect them from surcharge fluctuations.

In the present study, we investigated an ADD outbreak caused by norovirus in several municipalities of Santa Catarina state during the summer season, southern Brazil in 2023. As of the 10th epidemiological week of 2023, approximately 87000 ADD cases were reported, with the capital, Florianopolis, recording the highest number of cases throughout the weeks. By using RT-qPCR and sequencing, we detected 10 different genotypes, from both genogroups (G) I and II. Some rare genotypes were also identified. Additionally, rotavirus and human adenovirus were sporadically detected among the ADD cases. Several features of the outbreak suggest that sewage-contaminated water could played a role in the surge of ADD cases. Storm events in Santa Catarina state that preceded the outbreak likely increased the discharge of contaminated wastewater and stormwater into water bodies, such as rivers and beaches during a high touristic season in the state. Climate change-induced extreme weather events, including intensified rainfall and frequent floods, can disturb healthcare and sanitation systems. Implementing public policies for effective sanitation, particularly during peak times, is crucial to maintain environmental equilibrium and counter marine pollution.

Climate-related experiences and harms in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a survey of 152,088 Mexican youth	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CHILDREN; IMPACTS	The dual crises of COVID-19 and climate change are impacting the lives of adolescents and young people as they transition to adulthood in an uncertain world, yet they are often excluded from research and political discourse. We surveyed young people about their needs and experiences, critical to engaging them and designing effective programs and policies to address these intersecting harms. The 2022 round of a national online survey through the Violence Outcomes in COVID-19 Epoch (VoCes) Study surveyed 152,088 Mexican youth (15-24 years). Logistic regressions were implemented to identify characteristics associated with four climate responses (economic, work-related, receiving government support, or social network support). Overall, 8.1% of participants experienced a recent climate hazard, with major impacts including housing damage from floods, and crop/livestock losses from drought. Participants who experienced a climate hazard were more likely to have experienced a pandemic-related harm, suggesting a dual impact. Poor youth were more likely to report economic losses from both the pandemic and a climate event but least likely to receive government support. Economic effects from the pandemic are exacerbating climate-related harms, unequally threatening the poorest youth. Engaging young people in decision-making and supporting the most vulnerable youth is critical for the next generation to thrive.

It plays an indisputable role in the economy and livelihoods of Vietnam and Cambodia, with repercussions at regional and global scales.

In this study, we first applied a full 2D numerical hydraulic model, TELEMAC-2D, to examine the effects of the complex channel and river networks on the spatial and temporal distribution of the flow in the 40,000 km2 of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Then, two scenarios of relative sea-level rise in 2050 and 2100 were implemented to simulate the future patterns of water fluxes in the delta. The results show that dykes and multi-channel networks would reduce the inundation area by 36% and lessen the peak water level by 15% and the discharge over the floodplains by 24%. Despite this protection, under a relative sea-level rise of 30 cm and 100 cm, the maximum flooded area could occupy about 69% and 85% of the whole delta in 2050 and 2100, respectively.

However, it remains unclear how climate warming changes ecosystem stability in facing extreme rainfall events.Here, we investigated the temporal stability of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) in an alpine meadow via a 5-year warming experiment, during which two flooding events occurred, in an alpine meadow.We first found that warming significantly increased the temporal stability of ANPP in facing flooding events by increasing resistance to and decreasing recovery from flooding events. Second, we found that warming shifted the plant community structure by increasing the dominance of grasses and reducing species richness and asynchrony. Last, we detected the higher temporal stability of ANPP under warming, which was mainly ascribed to the warming-induced increase in dominant species stability (Deschampsia caespitosa).Synthesis. These findings indicate that climate warming may mitigate the shock of flooding events on the temporal stability of community productivity via altering plant community structure in alpine grasslands. Our study highlights that to buffer ecosystems from climatic extremes, we should focus on promoting the maintenance or selection of dominant species rather than only focusing on increasing species richness.

Re-analysis of such data available in public domain supplemented with annotations across molecular hierarchy can be of immense help to the plant research community, particularly co-expression networks representing transcriptionally coordinated genes that are often part of the same biological process. With this objective, we have developed NetREx, a Network-based Rice Expression Analysis Server, that hosts ranked co-expression networks of Oryza sativa using publicly available messenger RNA sequencing data across uniform experimental conditions. It provides a range of interactable data viewers and modules for analysing user-queried genes across different stress conditions (drought, flood, cold and osmosis) and hormonal treatments (abscisic and jasmonic acid) and tissues (root and shoot). Subnetworks of user-defined genes can be queried in pre-constructed tissue-specific networks, allowing users to view the fold change, module memberships, gene annotations and analysis of their neighbourhood genes and associated pathways.The web server also allows querying of orthologous genes from Arabidopsis, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum. Here, we demonstrate that NetREx can be used to identify novel candidate genes and tissue-specific interactions under stress conditions and can aid in the analysis and understanding of complex phenotypes linked to stress response in rice.

Popular extreme sea level metrics can better communicate impacts	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Extreme sea level; Assessment reports; IPCC; Sea level rise; Impacts	CLIMATE; RISE; PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION; EXPOSURE; DATABASE; ORDER; MODEL; COAST	Estimates of changes in the frequency or height of contemporary extreme sea levels (ESLs) under various climate change scenarios are often used by climate and sea level scientists to help communicate the physical basis for societal concern regarding sea level rise. Changes in ESLs (i.e., the hazard) are often represented using various metrics and indicators that, when anchored to salient impacts on human systems and the natural environment, provide useful information to policy makers, stakeholders, and the general public. While changes in hazards are often anchored to impacts at local scales, aggregate global summary metrics generally lack the context of local exposure and vulnerability that facilitates translating hazards into impacts. Contextualizing changes in hazards is also needed when communicating the timing of when projected ESL frequencies cross critical thresholds, such as the year in which ESLs higher than the design height benchmark of protective infrastructure (e.g., the 100-year water level) are expected to occur within the lifetime of that infrastructure. We present specific examples demonstrating the need for such contextualization using a simple flood exposure model, local sea level rise projections, and population exposure estimates for 414 global cities. We suggest regional and global climate assessment reports integrate global, regional, and local perspectives on coastal risk to address hazard, vulnerability and exposure simultaneously.

Road inundation is one of the severe consequences leading to traffic issues and congestion. Green infrastructure (GI) offers further potential for stormwater management as an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution. However, sewer system behaviour has been overlooked in GI implementation. This study investigates sewer performance by measuring topological connectivity and hydraulic characteristics, and critical components are identified under different design storms. Three retrofit scenarios, including enlarged pipes (grey infrastructure, Grey I), rain gardens (GI), and the combination of enlarged pipes and increased rain gardens (GI + Grey I), are proposed according to the distribution of critical components. The results show that it is feasible to locate the vulnerable parts of the sewer system and GI site allocations based on the critical components that significantly impact the performance of the entire system. While all three scenarios can mitigate inundation, GI and GI + Grey I perform better than pipe enlargement, especially for runoff reduction during long-duration rainfall. Furthermore, the sewer behaviour and retrofit effect are dynamic under different rainfall patterns, leading to diverse combined effects. The discoveries reveal that the adaptation measures should combine with sewer behaviour and local rainfall characteristics to enhance stormwater management.

However, these systems are now facing several challenges, being sensitive to climate change and thus exposed to the resulting extreme events such as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and flash floods, also difficult terrain and access paths, male outmigration, limited technical capacity and a weak policy and governance system. Hence, exploring the potential options for overcoming the challenges and irrigating arable barren land could lead to economic prosperity and environmental gains. A literature review, stakeholder consultation and semi-structured questionnaire survey in two villages of the Hunza River basin was conducted to synthesize information in different domains. Information on the irrigation system and its sources, water distribution/allocation system, challenges and adaptation strategies were collected, and based on community preferences, an alternative irrigation technological package was established to overcome the challenges and irrigate barren land. A customized solar water lifting pump with an efficient micro-irrigation package was piloted which proved to be climate resilient. The system is simple to adopt, uses clean energy for operation and is economically feasible, with a benefit-cost ratio of 4.96 and a payback period of around 11 years.

Flooding usually causes submergence- or partial submergence stress in plants, which significantly has a negative influence on agricultural production, from seed germination to vegetative and reproductive growth. Flooding stress results in crop growth under low oxygen conditions and thus, negatively affects the developmental periods of plant lifecycle. The survival strategies of different plant species under this stressful condition are distinct, whereas the perception pathways associated with flooding stress are similar at the molecular level. Plants respond to flooding stress by mediating changes in their architecture, energy metabolism, photosynthesis, respiration and endogenous phytohormone biosynthesis/signaling, because aerobic respiration is inhibited under flooding stress, the decrease of energy metabolism further constrains plant development. Consequently, to acclimate under these unfavorable conditions, the anaerobic respiration cascade must be promoted. In this updated review, we primarily focus on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant responses to flooding stress. We summarize the functions of the flooding response factors involved in energy metabolism and phytohormone biosynthesis/signaling cascades. Finally, the current understanding of how plants circumvent flooding stress, and the potential challenges for future research, are discussed.

Changes in rainfall and the flood-pulse are likely to disrupt the processes that maintain these landscapes; further, landscape modification may dramatically alter wetlands and promote terrestrialization. The Pantanal, South America, is the world?s largest wetland due to flooding along the Upper Paraguay River. Predicting how water resources in the Pantanal may change is problematic due to a complex drainage network, resulting in the out-of-phase timing of rainfall and the flood pulse. We use remote sensing data of vegetation and climate to better understand the relationships among the rains, the flood pulse, and vegetation. Although rainfall is regionally synchronous, vegetation responses differ based on position relative to inundated areas. Away from rivers, vegetation greening occurs immediately following rainfall. Along channels, greening may lag rainfall by six months, responding closely to local flood stage. Interannual rainfall variability also impacts vegetation differently near flooded areas, with weaker, lagged responses to rainfall due to local water storage. This work suggests that the importance of flood pulse timing for vegetation productivity in inundated areas means that local conditions in wetlands may be the strongest controls on biogeochemical processes.

Flooding events are predicted to increase due to climate change; therefore, understanding traffic network's flood-caused disruption is critical to improving emergency planning and city resilience. This study reveals the anatomy of perturbed traffic networks by leveraging high-resolution traffic network data from a major flood event and advanced high-order network analysis. We evaluate travel times between every pairwise junction in the city and assess higher-order network geometry changes in the network to determine flood impacts. The findings show network wide persistent increased travel times could last for weeks after the flood water has receded, even after modest flood failure. A modest flooding of 1.3% road segments caused 8% temporal expansion of the entire traffic network. The results also show that distant trips would experience a greater percentage increase in travel time. Also, the extent of the increase in travel time does not decay with distance from inundated areas, suggesting that the spatial reach of flood impacts extends beyond flooded areas. The findings of this study provide an important novel understanding of floods' impacts on the functioning of traffic networks in terms of travel time and traffic network geometry.

Due to climate change, urban floods are frequently observed in many parts of the world. Flood events in Chennai city are a frequent scenario due to rapid increase in the density of population. Adyar river watershed and surrounding urban cover are focused in the present study. The present study aims at mapping flooded region using Sentinel 1A datasets over Adyar watershed. Series of Sentinel 1A image is collected before, during and after floods for mapping the extent of flood and mapping risk zones in Adyar watershed. Methodologies such as ISODATA Technique, Multi-Temporal Analysis, Thresholding Method, PCA and ICA Analysis and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix are adopted for the extraction of flooded extent from the SAR datasets. Analysis performed over the Adyar watershed provided promising results in the extraction of flooded extent with Thresholding Method and Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix being the dominant of all the methods. Though higher accuracy is obtained in the extraction of flooded extent, limitation of layover, foreshortening and shadow is experienced in the built up region for the extraction of flooded pixels.

Notably, most small and medium-sized urban rivers have a brief concentration period and are highly vulnerable to sudden heavy rains that lead to a rapid increase in water levels. Therefore, rapid flood forecasting must be performed through accurate flood occurrence and timing prediction. In this study, a flooding time nomograph (FTN) was proposed to predict the flood occurrence time according to rainfall conditions, such as intensity, time distribution, and duration. In addition, rainfall-runoff simulations were performed by establishing different virtual rainfall scenarios using Huff's quartile rainfall time distribution. The simulation results were used to formulate the relationship between the rainfall intensity and flood occurrence time to generate the FTN. The applicability of this tool was verified through a comparison with the observed flood occurrence time for an actual rainfall event, which was highly accurate in the target watershed, with a correlation coefficient >0.8 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >0.6. Therefore, the proposed FTN can be used to reasonably predict the occurrence of floods and the time of flood occurrence using only predicted rainfall information.

Although methanogens have been identified as critical regulators of methylated As concentrations in flooded soils, the mechanism of these microbial groups on As methylation in paddy soils with RS amendment remains unknown. In this study, paddy soil was incubated to test the response in As methylation and methanogenesis in flooded soil with RS amendment. Our results showed that RS amendment increased the accumulation of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) whether methanogenesis was inhibited or not. The methanogens in the genera of Methanocella probably played critical role in promoting As methylation in flooded soil with RS amendment. With the RS amendment, inhibition of methanogenesis led to the accumulation MMA and DMA by suppressing DMA demethylation. The demethylation of DMA was driven by methanogens possibly belonging to the genera of Methanobacterium. This study revealed a wealth of methanogens that dominate As methylation with RS amendment. It will provide guidance to RS amendment in As contaminated paddy soil and has important implications for rice quality and global climate change.

J	Liu, Y; Cai, WJ; Lin, XP; Li, ZG				Liu, Yi; Cai, Wenju; Lin, Xiaopei; Li, Ziguang			Increased extreme swings of Atlantic intertropical convergence zone in a warming climate	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SOUTH-AMERICA; CIRCULATION; RAINFALL; MECHANISMS; EVENTS; ENSO; GRADIENTS	Interannual variability of the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) affects hydrological cycles, extreme weather events, ecosystems, agriculture and livelihoods in Atlantic-rim countries. It can experience an interannual extreme swing, moving hundreds of kilometres northwards during boreal spring, causing severe droughts in central-eastern Amazon and floods in northern South America. How its interannual variability will respond to global warming remains unknown. Here using state-of-the-art climate models under a high-emission scenario, we project a more-than-doubling increase of extreme northward swings. This increase from one event per 20.4 years in the twentieth century to one per 9.3 years in the twenty-first century is underpinned by a mean state change of sea surface temperature, with faster warming north of the Equator. The warming differential facilitates the increased frequency of extreme swings, as the ITCZ follows the maximum sea surface temperature. Our finding suggests a substantial increase in ITCZ swing-induced severe droughts/floods in the Atlantic-rim countries. The Atlantic intertropical convergence zone can experience extreme northward shifts, with resultant precipitation changes. Model projections show the frequency of these extreme shifts will increase under climate change, driven by faster sea surface warming north of the Equator.

To effectively solve the urban water cycle issue, green infrastructure using urban green space has emerged to reduce runoff and increase evaporation. It has the advantage of restoring the water cycle system of urban areas by complementing the failure of conventional stormwater treatment systems. However, urban areas under high-density development have limited green space for stormwater treatment. Hence, it is necessary to efficiently utilize street trees and small green spaces to improve the urban water cycle through green space. In this study, we simulated different green space distribution scenarios in the virtual domain to find the optimal strategy of green space planning. Compared to clustered scenarios, dispersed green space distribution scenarios and placing green space downstream were more effective in reducing the runoff amount. The paper provides insights into the considerations for determining green space spatial plan and zoning regulations for stormwater treatment by green infrastructure.

Greater knowledge about plant ecophysiology, such as the effects of light/shading and water condition may help the production and implantation of seedlings in projects for the recovery of degraded areas. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the photosynthetic metabolism, growth and quality of Dipteryx alata Vogel seedlings under three shading levels: 0%-full sun, 30% and 70% with two water regimes: the control-75% of the water retention capacity in the substrate-and the flooding of seedlings for 60 days and 100 days of post-flooding, which this last period was called recovery phase. We verified that flooding was harmful to gas exchange, potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II, plant height, expansion of the specific leaf area and quality of seedlings. However, the species recovered most of characteristics evaluated at 100 days of post-flooding with the end of stress showing the best results under 30% shading. The combination of metabolic adjustments of this species indicates resilience and plasticity then it expresses tolerance in conditions of seasonal flooding.

Disruption of the balance between land for construction and water space, combined with global climate change, causes cities to face more uncertain flood risks. In this study, the one-dimensional hydrologic model was used to simulate the large-scale urban river flood scenarios in Lanzhou, a city in the interior of Northwest China. Flood intensity maps were drawn based on the simulation results to analyze the urban flood risk under the context of space competition between people and water. The study indicates that the topographic vulnerability of the built-up area that was transformed from water bodies and floodplains does not disappear. Rather, structural measures which limit water to flow within a given space and protect people from the flooding increase flood risk. Urban flood risk depends on the extent of water space being exploited and occupied. The theoretical and practical significance of these results for urban planning, flood protection, and early risk warning are discussed.

Through longitudinal interviews with 59 households in a middle-class suburb of Houston that flooded during Hurricane Harvey, we found that residential mobility decisions-whether to stay and rebuild or move-were guided by households' durable plans about the future. The majority of households decided to remain and rebuild their homes, despite the ability to move and pressure from friends and family to relocate to less vulnerable places with similar amenities. The households that stayed had long-term plans to remain in their homes before the flood, while the small number who decided to move generally had well-defined plans to do so in the near future before the storm hit. Our findings reveal the role of plans in the residential decision-making of middle-class households and have implications for understanding post-disaster immobility at a time when middle-class households are increasingly exposed to environmental disasters.

J	Kumasaki, M; King, M				Kumasaki, Mieko; King, Malcom			Three cases in Japan occurred by natural hazards and lessons for Natech disaster management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Natech; Case study; Flood; Explosion; Toxic gas release; Landslides; Natech under pandemic	RISK-ASSESSMENT; UNITED-STATES; EARTHQUAKE; IMPACT; FACILITIES; EVENTS; LAND; OIL	Due to recent climate change, highly-connected society, and the centralization of hazardous materials, Natech is a matter of the growing concern. As Natech disasters occur with low frequency, those in charge of facilities should learn lessons from past cases to prepare for situations in the future in which they may have to respond to a potentially catastrophic event for the first time. This paper describes three Natech cases triggered by the heavy rainfall in Japan in 2018. One resulted in violent explosions, one showed consequences half a year later, and the other managed to avoid a catastrophic situation by preparation based on prior analysis of possible damage. The lessons which can be learnt are as follows: Undertake measures based on the hazardous conditions of materials and possible reactions; Avoid normalcy bias for improved decision-making; Identify slow developing and lagging Natech consequences; Prepare and intensify safeguards to avoid possible damage based on risk analysis; Consider employees' safety in returning to their homes; Collect micro information and aggregate it; Provide current information about the situation to stakeholders; Plan resources required for recovery activities.

The method is demonstrated for Emergency Medical Service and Fire & Rescue Service in the city of Shanghai, China. Considering four representative traffic conditions, accessibility in terms of service area, response time, and population coverage within specified timeframes (8-, 12-, and 15-minute for Emergency Medical Service and 5-, 10-, and 15-minute for Fire & Rescue Service) is quantified and mapped under normal as well as pluvial flood scenarios of various magnitudes (5-, 20-, and 100-year return periods). Results show that the performance of operational responses largely depends on the functioning of transportation system, dramatically decreasing from unobstructed to congested traffic. Surface water flooding is found to result in limited (i.e. site-specific) but nonlinear impacts on the city-wide emergency service provisions. The results provide detailed information for optimizing the distribution of emergency stations and developing strategic contingency planning for vulnerable populations and facilities.

Decision-support systems, composed of a hydrological forecasting system and a reservoir model, can ensure that reservoir operation objectives are attained more effectively than by relying solely on expert judgment. In this study, a simple ensemble inflow forecasting system coupled with a reservoir model is developed and the proposed model-based operational water management decisions are compared with those based on expert judgment for the Shipshaw River in Quebec, Canada. Given that no natural streamflow records are available for the Shipshaw River, the HEC-HMS hydrological model is calibrated using a regionalization method based on physical similarity. The calibrated hydrological model is fed by ensemble meteorological forecasts that include 20 members, with a 10-day horizon and a 6-hour time step. The proposed decision-support system can help avoid small flooding events while potentially improving energy production by 2 to 60% for this case study. The proposed forecasting system also allows water-resource managers to anticipate events with a greater lead time.

Effects of an experimental increase in flow intermittency on an alpine stream	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Glacial; Macroinvertebrates; Stable isotopes; Drift; Biofilm; Benthic organic matter	ORGANIC-MATTER; VAL-ROSEG; ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; GLACIAL FLOODPLAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; DROUGHT; CARBON	Flow intermittency occurs naturally in alpine streams. However, changing rainfall patterns and glacier retreat are predicted to increase the occurrence of flow intermittency in alpine catchments, with largely unknown effects on ecosystem structure and function. We conducted a flow manipulation experiment within a headwater stream of Val Roseg, a glacierized alpine catchment, to determine the effects of increased flow intermittency on aquatic macroinvertebrates, periphyton, benthic organic matter, and trophic structure. Compared to an adjacent reference channel, an increase in flow intermittency reduced macroinvertebrate density, taxa richness, and the proportion of rheophilic taxa. Density and richness remained low in the manipulated channel after resumption of natural flow. Flow intermittency did not affect organic matter standing stocks, but increased assimilation of periphyton by aquatic macroinvertebrates. Predation on aquatic invertebrates by riparian spiders also increased. We attribute many of these patterns to the timing of drying, which likely excluded summer-growing cohorts of rheophilic, aerial dispersers. This study suggests that reductions in summer glacial melt and rainfall events might increase flow intermittency and lead to fundamental changes in diversity and function of alpine fluvial networks.

J	Kad, P; Ha, KJ				Kad, Pratik; Ha, Kyung-Ja			Recent Tangible Natural Variability of Monsoonal Orographic Rainfall in the Eastern Himalayas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						Himalayas; natural variability; extreme monsoons; orographic rainfall; Himalayan Rivers; climate dynamics	RIVER DISCHARGE; INDIAN MONSOON; ELEVATION; MODE	Himalayas hydroclimate is a lifeline for South Asia's most densely populated region. Every year, flooding in the Himalayan rivers is usual during summer monsoon, which impacts millions of inhabitants of the Himalayas and downstream regions. Recent studies demonstrate the role of melting glaciers and snow in the context of global warming, along with monsoonal rain causing recurrent floods. Here, we highlight the natural variability in the eastern Himalayan hydroclimate over the last 43 years (1979-2021). We found extreme monsoonal rainy years with six dry years and seven wet years after removing the climate change signal. Monsoon rainfall is a significant contributor, and melting snow is not a potential contributor to these anomalous extreme years. The variability of Himalayan monsoonal rainfall is strongly regulated by local monsoonal Hadley circulation associated with tropical sea surface temperature. Our findings demonstrate mechanisms associated with Himalayan wet and dry monsoon. Atmospheric dynamics are attributed as the primary modulating factor, influencing local thermodynamics through moist processes. The insights provided in this study underscore the impact of natural variability-driven challenging events that could be predictable. Thus, this mechanism could improve the predictability of the Himalayas floods. The monsoon rainfall in the Himalayan region is very important for the people living in South Asia. Every year, heavy rainfall during the monsoon season causes floods in the region. We found the strong Himalayan rainfall variability in the eastern side of the Himalayas during the monsoon season and examined the natural rainfall cycle over the past few decades. As a result, we have characterized that there are extreme rainy monsoons and dry monsoons. We also found that the main cause of the extreme flooding is the heavy rain during the monsoon as a part of natural variability rather than the melting snow. Our study supports atmospheric bridge as the primary driver for extreme monsoons over the Eastern Himalayan region. We looked at different factors that influence monsoon rainfall, such as the local landscape, the conditions in the atmosphere, and large-scale features. The eastern Himalayas region includes Bhutan, Nepal, India, and China. Understanding these rainfall patterns can help us predict floods in these countries and better prepare for their impact. Furthermore, as climate change continues to affect the climate system, there is growing concern about how it may influence the natural variability of the Himalayan monsoon. The study highlights the natural variability in the eastern Himalayan hydroclimate over the past 43 years, emphasizing its significance as a recurring natural hazard that affects the regionThe research identifies extreme monsoonal rainy years, with monsoon rainfall as a major contributor to river discharge. Notably, the study rules out the role of melting snow in these extreme eventsThis research underscores the dominant influence of atmospheric dynamics as the primary modulating factor in the Eastern Himalayan monsoon	[Kad, Pratik; Ha, Kyung-Ja] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Climate Syst, Busan, South Korea; [Ha, Kyung-Ja] Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea; [Ha, Kyung-Ja] Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Syst BK21, Busan, South Korea	Pusan National University; Institute for Basic Science - Korea (IBS); Pusan National University	Kad, P; Ha, KJ (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Climate Syst, Busan, South Korea.; Ha, KJ (corresponding author), Inst Basic Sci, Ctr Climate Phys, Busan, South Korea.; Ha, KJ (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Syst BK21, Busan, South Korea.	pratik@pusan.ac.kr; kjha@pusan.ac.kr	Kad, Pratik/G-5299-2018	Kad, Pratik/0000-0002-0010-0891	National Research Foundation of Korea [2020R1A2C2006860]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [IBS-R028-D1]; Institute for Basic Science; NCMRWF, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India; NCMRWF; Ministry of Earth Sciences, under the National Monsoon Mission programme	National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Institute for Basic Science; NCMRWF, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India; NCMRWF; Ministry of Earth Sciences, under the National Monsoon Mission programme	This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (Grant 2020R1A2C2006860).

While methods to quantify the direct impacts of ESL flooding on coastal areas are well established, the indirect impacts that extend beyond the directly affected population are less well understood. This study assesses the vulnerability of electricity, road, telecommunication, water supply, and wastewater infrastructure to service disruption from coastal flooding in South Dunedin, New Zealand. We quantified the population affected by single and multiple service losses caused by 100-year average recurrence interval (ARI) ESL flooding across 0.1 m sea-level rise (SLR) increments up to 1.5 m. The study identified an ESL "tipping-point" at 0.6 m SLR, where direct loss of road access and electricity services is extensive, and causes indirect loss of telecommunication services. This also impacted the functionality of a key wastewater pumpstation servicing the wider region. As sea levels in the area are projected to rise 0.60 m in the next similar to 60-90 years, this information can inform assessments of potential adaptation investments in long-term infrastructure management plans in the face of uncertainty.

Such estimation can inform the development of strategies to enhance the resilience of the global agricultural system against floods, particularly in the face of growing demand for food. To this end, a worldwide calculation of inundation areas' return periods was conducted using a global river and inundation model output. This information was then linked to a global historical yield map, allowing for the identification of flood-induced crop yield changes. The findings revealed that for return periods over ten years, global average yield losses were estimated to be 4% for soy, 3% for rice, 2% for wheat, and 1% for maize. These losses amounted to a total production loss of 5.5 billion United States dollars during the 1982-2016 period. This first global estimation of flood impacts on crop production contributes to the advancement of flood risk management in agriculture, although the limitations identified in this study need to be addressed in future research.

Global climate change has dramatically increased flooding events, which have a strong impact on crop production. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the most important cereals and its cultivation includes a broad range of different environments. We tested the capacity to germinate of a large barley panel after a short period of submergence followed by a period of recovery. We demonstrate that sensitive barley varieties activate underwater secondary dormancy because of a lower permeability to oxygen dissolved in water. In sensitive barley accessions, secondary dormancy is removed by nitric oxide donors. The results of a genome-wide association study uncovered a Laccase gene located in a region of significant marker-trait association that is differently regulated during grain development and plays a key role in this process. Our findings will help breeders to improve the genetics of barley, thereby increasing the capacity of seeds to germinate after a short period of flooding.

By constraining biases, the rainfall increase is 70% of the raw projection. The Afro-Asian summer monsoon (AfroASM) sustains billions of people living in many developing countries covering West Africa and Asia, vulnerable to climate change. Future increase in AfroASM precipitation has been projected by current state-of-the-art climate models, but large inter-model spread exists. Here we show that the projection spread is related to present-day interhemispheric thermal contrast (ITC). Based on 30 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we find models with a larger ITC trend during 1981-2014 tend to project a greater precipitation increase. Since most models overestimate present-day ITC trends, emergent constraint indicates precipitation increase in constrained projection is reduced to 70% of the raw projection, with the largest reduction in West Africa (49%). The land area experiencing significant increases of precipitation (runoff) is 57% (66%) of the raw projection. Smaller increases of precipitation will likely reduce flooding risk, while posing a challenge to future water resources management.

Due to climate change and anthropogenic activities, floods occur in high frequency all over the world. Therefore, mapping of the flood areas is of prime importance in disaster management. This research presents a novel framework for flood area mapping based on heterogeneous remote sensing (RS) datasets. The proposed framework fuses the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical, and altimetry datasets for mapping flood areas, and it is applied in three main steps: (1) preprocessing, (2) deep feature extraction based on multiscale residual kernel convolution and convolution neural network's (CNN) parameter optimization by fusing the datasets, and (3) flood detection based on the trained model. This research exploits two large-scale area datasets for mapping the flooded areas in Golestan and Khuzestan provinces, Iran. The results show that the proposed methodology has a high performance in flood area detection. The visual and numerical analyses verify the effectiveness and ability of the proposed method to detect the flood areas with an overall accuracy (OA) higher than 98% in both study areas. Finally, the efficiency of the designed architecture was verified by hybrid-CNN and 3D-CNN methods.

The unequal distribution of water risks and adaptation benefits in coastal Bangladesh	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-SALINITY; SECURITY; INFRASTRUCTURE; INTERVENTIONS; VULNERABILITY; DYNAMICS; POLDERS; DAMAGE; DELTA	Increasing flood risk, salinization and waterlogging threaten the lives and livelihoods of more than 35 million people in Bangladesh's coastal zone. While planning models have long been used to inform investments in water infrastructure, they frequently overlook interacting risks, impacts on the poor and local context. We address this gap by developing and applying a stochastic-optimization model to simulate the impact of flood embankment investments on the distribution of agricultural incomes across income groups for six diverse polders (embanked areas) in coastal Bangladesh. Results show that increasing salinity and waterlogging negate the benefits of embankment rehabilitation in improving agricultural production while improved drainage can alleviate these impacts. Outcomes vary across income groups, with risks of crop loss being greatest for the poor. We discuss the need for planning models to consider the interacting benefits and risks of infrastructure investments within a local political economy to better inform coastal adaptation decisions. People living in Bangladesh's coastal zone face multiple water-related risks. This modelling study finds that rising salinity and waterlogging negate the benefits of rehabilitating embankments for reducing crop loss, with impacts being greatest for the poor. Drainage was found to reduce negative impacts.

Therefore, much attention should be paid to the variation in the amplitude of the nodal cycle. In this paper, we utilize the enhanced harmonic analysis method and the independent point scheme to obtain the time-dependent amplitudes of the 8.85-year cycle of N-2 tide and the 4.42-year cycle of 2N(2) tide based on water level records of four tide gauges in the Gulf of Maine. Results indicate that the long-term trends of N-2 and 2N(2) tides vary spatially, which may be affected by the sea-level rise, coastal defenses, and other possible climate-related mechanisms. The comparison between Halifax and Eastport reveals that the topography greatly influences the amplitudes of those cycles. Moreover, a quasi 20-year oscillation is obvious in the 8.85-year cycle of N-2 tide. This oscillation probably relates to a 20-year mode in the North Atlantic Ocean.

J	Tomateo, C				Tomateo, Claudia			Indigenous land systems and emerging of Green Infrastructure planning in the Peruvian coastal desert: tensions and opportunities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING			English	Article						Decolonization; Green Infrastructure; Indigenous Knowledge; design; typologies; Peru	DECOLONIZATION	For many, Green Infrastructure (GI) is a modern ecological planning concept focusing on stormwater runoff. This paper argues for the importance of Indigenous Knowledge (IK) in GI planning and policy through the case study of the Tumbes Basin. The Basin serves as home to a diverse array of Pre-Hispanic Indigenous networked agro-ecological practices and landscape interventions guided by a worldview marrying humans and landscapes dating back to immemorial times of human habitation in the Americas (similar to 36,000 BP). By 900 BCE-1100 CE this planned regional network was actively managing landslides, stormwater runoff, and riverine flooding, all challenges are currently being exacerbated by climate change and urban development. Today, this landscape-level network is one of the biggest GI systems in Peru and yet remains unacknowledged in emergent GI policy and planning. By examining existing Peruvian scholarship on landscape practices, and visualizing Pre-Hispanic landscape networks in the Tumbes Basin, this study makes the case for Peruvian GI policy to be guided by Indigenous Knowledge and governance systems. Such a transformation requires a deeper integration of Indigenous conceptualizations of GI with other infrastructure systems and regional urban planning and design.

In this paper we deal with the meteorological aspects, which need to be adequately understood in order to understand the occurrence and development of floods. This holds the more as different meteorological environments and accompanying mechanisms can result in different types of heavy precipitation and so in different flood responses. In this paper, the meteorological aspects of floods are described from the perspective of a precipitation event. The characteristics, the categorisations and the ingredients of the storm systems are presented. The influences of global warming on heavy precipitation events will be discussed as well. The sequence of these aspects reads as a logical succession of the distinct topics of the meteorological aspects of a heavy precipitation event. Since floods commonly have a profound impact on environment and society, the understanding of the meteorological aspects is a first and necessary step in a challenge of dealing with floods. The ultimate goal of this step is to diminish the harmful consequences of floods as adequately as possible.	[Breugem, A. J.; Wesseling, J. G.; Oostindie, K.; Ritsema, C.

Thermokarst lakes (bodies of freshwater that collect in depressions formed by thawing permafrost) cover 20% of Arctic lowlands and are naturally prone to causing catastrophic flooding. Cumulative lake drainage over time has resulted in up to 60% landscape coverage by drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs). Although the impacts of lake drainage on ecosystems and infrastructure have long been considered a potential hazard, these occurrences are usually viewed as one-time events. However, recent observations in northern Alaska highlight a previously unrecognized threat: annually recurring snow-dam outburst floods from DTLBs. Each winter, blowing snow fills DTLB drainage gullies, impounding meltwater in the spring and - upon snow-dam failure - releasing downstream floods. Data collected from 14 DTLBs in Alaska reveal a wide range in flood peaks, many of which exceed river flood events, providing a missing link in Arctic ecosystem hydrology. Projected snowier winters may result in even larger snow-dam outbursts from DTLBs, adding uncertainty to future risk assessments. If climate change also drives enhanced lake drainage, we predict even more sporadic and higher magnitude floods, with implications for downstream ecosystems and human infrastructure as development pushes into the Arctic lowlands.

Previous studies focused on the drought or flood effects on summer maize growth. However, few studied the effects of drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) on the growth of summer maize. We explored the DFAA impacts on the roots, leaf area index (LAI), yield, and grain quality in field. The main results show that DFAA had different impacts on the summer maize growth in the seeding-jointing stage (SJS) and tasseling-grain filling stage (TGS). In general, the DFAA reduced the yield. Roots at the depth of 40 cm had obviously positive impacts on the yield. The DFAA reduced the LAI and promoted the maximum LAI achieving in advance. The grain crude protein augmented under DFAA. The drought had evidently negative impacts on the grain crude fat in the TGS, while it had no obvious influence in the SJS. DFAA had no apparent impact on the grain crude starch. These results could provide some references for the effects and adaptation-strategies study of extreme climate events and their impacts on growth of summer maize.

The traditional remote sensing water body extraction has the problems of low accuracy and being time-consuming and laborious, and the water body recognition technique based on deep learning is more efficient and accurate than the traditional threshold method; however, there is the problem that the basic model of semantic segmentation is not well-adapted to complex remote sensing images. Based on this, this study adopts an OCNet feature extraction network to modify the base model of semantic segmentation, and the resulting model achieves excellent performance on water body remote sensing images. Compared with the traditional water body extraction method and the base network, the OCNet modified model has obvious improvement, and is applicable to the extraction of water bodies in true-color remote sensing images such as high-score images and unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing images. The results show that the model in this study can realize automatic and fast extraction of water bodies from remote sensing images, and the predicted water body image accuracy (ACC) can reach 85%. This study can realize fast and accurate extraction of water bodies, which is of great significance for water resources acquisition and flood disaster prediction.

J	Le, T; Tran, T				Le, Trang; Tran, Tho			An Evaluation of Local Comprehensive Plans Regarding Green Infrastructure in 52 Cities across the US Gulf Coast Region	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						green infrastructure; plan quality evaluation; content analysis; public participation	HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; PLANNING POLICY; QUALITY; PROTECTION; PRINCIPLES	The utilization of green infrastructure (GI) showed promising results as a flood mitigation strategy and a viable solution for building community resilience and achieving sustainability, especially in light of the challenges posed by climate change and increasing climate-related hazards. Meanwhile, it remains uncertain how local governments incorporated the key principles of GI into their planning and regulatory frameworks, particularly their comprehensive plans. This study aimed to fill in the gaps by evaluating U.S. Gulf Coast cities' comprehensive plans regarding GI. Using the content analysis method, a sample of fifty-two city comprehensive plans was evaluated to determine how well local plans support GI and to examine the factors which influence the quality of local plans. Our results indicate that the sampled cities in the Gulf Coast region are likely to have low willingness to plan and implement GI. Moreover, results from statistical analysis implied that the sampled Gulf Coast cities are more likely to produce higher-quality plans in terms of GI when there are more opportunities for public participation and involvement in the planning process. Findings from our study can provide valuable information and direction for local authorities and planners to improve the performance of their comprehensive plans and support GI implementation in the future.

The study aims to identify the community perspectives on the socioeconomic impacts of floods in the Central Indus River (Punjab and Sindh), Pakistan. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted in three major biodiversity hotspot areas: Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary, Indus River Dolphin Reserve, and Central Indus Wetlands Complex. The questionnaire identified people's knowledge, practice, and attitude regarding floods in the area. The results were interesting as they depict that the community is fully aware of the causes and impacts of floods and migratory measures. Loss of agricultural land, displacement of the hu-man population, and animal structures were the most common impacts on people. Government departments issued flood warnings in the area to implement flood prevention plans (movement to the safe zone like protection bund). Still, due to lack of information resources, people needed more time to get information which caused significant losses. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the area played an important role in minimizing the after-effects of floods and rehabili-tating the area. This study will help to improve policies for disaster risk reduction.

They are not preventable but vulnerability assessments, hazard mitigation, and effective emergency management plans can reduce their impacts and facilitate recovery actions. Floods can have different impacts depending on the local physical conditions and on the social context represented by the economic and cultural patterns of a specific community. Social vulnerability is the susceptibility of social groups to the adverse impacts of natural hazards, including disproportionate death, injury, loss, or disruption of livelihood. Therefore, the social vulnerability analysis becomes of primary importance in understanding the main factors influencing the capacity of a specific community to anticipate, cope with, and recover from a flood event. In this context, this paper investigates the correlation between flood hazard and socio-economic factors across the Basilicata Region (southern Italy). The aim of this research is to evaluate flood hazard and social vulnerability index through a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach. Multivariate factor analysis was applied in this work to construct an overall social vulnerability index which was combined with the flood hazard distribution. Our results underline the presence of 107,587 people with a high level of both flood hazard and social vulnerability.

Nanotechnology as a tool for abiotic stress mitigation in horticultural crops	BIOLOGIA			English	Review						Nanomaterials; Agroecosystems; Abiotic stress; Horticultural crops	TOMATO SOLANUM-LYCOPERSICON; CERIUM OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; MAGNETIC IRON-OXIDE; SALT STRESS; ZNO NANOPARTICLES; FLAVANONE 3-HYDROXYLASE; PLANTS PHYTOTOXICITY; VEGETABLE PRODUCTION; INDUCED TOXICITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Horticultural crops are used for a variety of purposes, including nourishment and aesthetics. Human nutrition relies heavily on these plants for carbohydrates, proteins, organic acids, vitamins, and minerals. Drought, flood, nutrient inadequacy, heat, light, metal stress, and other abiotic stresses restrict crop plant development and output. A variety of tactics are used to improve abiotic stress tolerance, including the production of genetically modified cultivars by incorporating gene constructions to improve performance under stress. Nanotechnology is a multifaceted field that could be applied in every branch of research comprising medicine, industry and agriculture. Soil and water nanoremediation, plant nanoprotection and plant nanonutrition are some of the agricultural applications. To accomplish sustainable progress in horticultural plants challenged with various environmental challenges, numerous definitive directions have been developed to secure public acceptance and convenient utilization of nanoparticles. Even with the rapid increase in nanoparticle use in several applications, there is still a dearth of information on the actual outcomes of nanoparticle interaction with plants. This review assesses the role of nanomaterials in horticultural crops under abiotic stress, with a focus on recent research. In addition, this review focuses on explaining the broad roles of several nanoparticles in enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in horticulture plants.

Understanding pigment migration and preservation mechanisms under hydrological regulation will help explain past ecological changes in these lake systems. This study investigates phytoplankton community structure, chlorophyll distribution, and associated environmental factors throughout a hydrological cycle in Poyang Lake, China. In conjunction with pigment sediment characteristics, this study also compared pigment deposition and preservation mechanisms among three hydrological lake zones (i.e., sub-lakes, main lake, and water channel). Results show a critical loss in sediment pigment information in the main lake and the water channel resulting from the lake's strong hydrodynamic conditions. Moreover, oxygen and sunlight had a general inhibitory effect on pigment in the overlying water, while unfavourable pH environments could affect pigments in the sediment that devoid of protective cell mechanisms. Results also show that as a biological proxy index, sub-lakes sediment pigments accurately reflect phytoplankton community structure in overlying water. Additionally, due to the relative stability of the sub-lakes environment, it can be considered the preferential lake zone from which to obtain proxy indexes in floodplain environments.

A semi-distributed physically based Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) were used to simulate the flood events and maps, respectively, for climate scenarios. The bias-corrected data of four climate models were used for the baseline (1976-2005), mid-term (2041-2070) and long-term (2071-2100) cycles under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The 50- and 100-year return period flood events were generated from the baseline and future period streamflow data. The HEC-RAS model was used to simulate the inundation areas and depths from the flood events. The result exhibited that the average annual rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures of the catchment will increase in the future with an increase in annual runoff. The severity of annual floods would increase in the future under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Approximately, 193 ha of the study may be flooded with flood events having a return period of 100 years under the RCP8.5 scenario in the long-term period, which is an extreme case. The result is a benchmark to reduce the flood risk and management of floodplains in this watershed.

This paper presents a hybrid modeling approach to understand the complexity in LUCC. Fuzzy logic, equation-based systems, and expert systems are combined to predict LUCC as determined by water resources and other factors. The driving factors of LUCC in this study include climate change, ecological flooding, groundwater conditions, and human activities. The increase of natural flooding was found to be effective in preventing vegetation degradation. LUCCs are sensitive under different climate projections of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Simulation results indicate that the increase of precipitation is not able to compensate for the additional evaporation losses resulting from temperature increases. The results indicate that grassland, shrub, and riparian forest regions will shrink in this study area. The change in grasslands has a strong negative correlation with the change in groundwater salinity, whereas forest change had a strong positive correlation with ecological flooding. The application of artificial intelligence to study LUCC can guide land management policies and make predictions regarding land degradation.

Change detection based flood mapping using multi-temporal Earth Observation satellite images: 2018 flood event of Kerala, India	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Semi-automatic thresholding; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Backscatter; WorldView; Normalized Change Index (NCI)		The future projections of climate change envisage a global increase in extreme precipitation events and subsequent flooding. The reliable and rapid flood maps are the critical parameters in preparing the disaster management plans. This study demonstrated an effective flood mapping framework using freely available multi-temporal Earth Observation (EO) images, including C-band Sentinel-1A & 1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and optical WorldView-3 images, for analyzing the 2018 flood event of Kerala, India. Two Change Detection (CD) techniques, i.e. Ratio Index (RI) and Normalized Change Index (NCI) combined with semi-automatic thresholding are implemented on temporal descending pass SAR images for flood identification. For ascending pass SAR images, the statistical-based thresholding method is implemented. The results indicate that combined use of ascending and descending pass SAR images contributed to a better understanding of flood conditions. It is also inferred that the use of a pre-flood image can enhance flood area estimation and helps in minimizing the overestimation errors. The results also found that NCI outperforms RI for Kerala flood event. Flood area extracted from these techniques is plotted against the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets, which showed a similar trend. Field photographs and optical images are used for validation purposes.	[Vanama, V. S. K.] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Urban Sci & Engn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Rao, Y.

Extreme weather often causes population displacement that compromises human security. Environment-induced displacement is multifaceted because climate extremes, population, and socio-economic conditions, among other factors, converge to influence individuals' decisions to move. When large-scale, catastrophic floods occur, people tend to move both suddenly and rapidly for survival. Quantifying the patterns and mechanisms of such displacement at global scale is essential to support areas at high risk for climate-induced displacement. Here we present the global distribution of vulnerability to floods by mapping potential flood exposure and observed flood-induced displacement. We found that countries in Africa might be highly vulnerable to floods because they have high flood-induced displacement even at low- to mid-level flood exposure. Our results show that income levels (Gross National Income) substantial impact flood-induced displacement. Moreover, the relationship between income levels and displacement is nonlinear, and this nonlinearity indicates large gaps in flood-induced displacement between high- and low-income countries. We suggest that low-income countries, particularly in Africa, face a high likelihood of flood-induced displacement and need to develop adaptation measures to mitigate the potential for displacement and the associated risks.

However, research to provide insights and recommendations into whether and how such international resilience programs could enable the building of local institutional capacities remains scarce. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an analytical framework to study institutional capacity building by international resilience programs, focusing on intellectual, social and political capital. The central case is the development and implementation of the Water as Leverage (WaL) program in Semarang, Indonesia. Our main results show that this program was able to stimulate the integration of knowledge, building of local coalitions and creation of adaptation narratives, which contributed to developing six strategic climate resilience proposals. This paper reflects on institutional strengths and weaknesses, and concludes that although the WaL program introduced an innovative approach for collaboration between international experts, urban designers and local stakeholders, sustaining momentum for the reflexive learning process, involving city-based NGOs and establishing formal links with decision makers were key challenges that hindered the development of institutional capacities to implement the developed proposals.

Arctic riparian shrub expansion indicates a shift from streams gaining water to those that lose flow	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							PATTERNED-GROUND ECOSYSTEMS; PERMAFROST THAW; PLANT PRODUCTIVITY; FUNGAL COMMUNITY; TUNDRA SNOW; SOIL; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; BACTERIAL; DYNAMICS	Shrub expansion has been observed across the Arctic in recent decades along with warming air temperatures, but tundra shrub expansion has been most pronounced in protected landscape positions such as floodplains, streambanks, water tracks, and gullies. Here we show through field measurements and laboratory analyses how stream hydrology, permafrost, and soil microbial communities differed between streams in late summer with and without tall shrubs. Our goal was to assess the causes and consequences of tall shrub expansion in Arctic riparian ecosystems. Our results from Toolik Alaska, show greater canopy height and density, and distinctive plant and soil microbial communities along stream sections that lose water into unfrozen ground (talik) compared to gaining sections underlain by shallow permafrost. Leaf Area Index is linearly related to the change in streamflow per unit stream length, with the densest canopies coinciding with increasingly losing stream sections. Considering climate change and the circumpolar scale of riparian shrub expansion, we suggest that permafrost thaw and the resulting talik formation and shift in streamflow regime are occurring across the Low Arctic. Shrub canopy height and density is greater along Arctic streams that lose water into unfrozen ground than along gaining streams, suggest analyses of field measurements from Toolik, Alaska.

Much of the country is at risk of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and from severe weather-related events. The data analyzed were obtained in 2016 and 2018 from focus group discussions with local residents, individual interviews with local government officials, and field observations. Residents' and officials' reports reveal a number of consistent themes in both places and over time, with some important differences. Both locations were grappling with regular minor to moderate flooding in 2016, as well as with occasional severe flooding. Respondents reported serious economic, health, and safety threats associated with flooding events. Recent infrastructure improvements appear to have reduced routine flood risk in one location, but considerable risk from major storms remains in both places. While some housing has been abandoned because of flood damage, and while some better-off residents have moved away, most are not currently considering retreat as a near-term solution. Instead, most people are adapting in place and attempting to devise strategies to mitigate flood risk in their communities.

This study aims to investigate the trends of summer rainfall extremes over Nigeria with daily station datasets from 1975 to 2013. Using the rainfall extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Monitoring Indices (ETCCDMI), it is found that regionally averaged summer total wet-day rainfall amount (PRCPTOT), maximum consecutive 5-day rainfall amount (RX5day), and wet-day rainfall intensity (SDII) have increased in the three climatic regions of Nigeria namely Guinea coast, Sub-Sahel, and the Sahel regions. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall days (R20mm) increased significantly over the Guinea coast and sub-Sahel regions, while the wet-day frequency (RR1) only increased slightly. The increase in PRCPTOT over the two regions is mainly resulting from the increasing intensity and frequency of rainfall extremes. However, the Nigerian Sahel is characterized by a decreasing wet-day frequency, which demonstrates that a large proportion of the increasing PRCPTOT in the region is more associated with intense rainfall than its frequency. These characteristic increasing trends of rainfall extremes may explain the frequent flood events over Nigeria and as such this study may give guidance to stakeholders on how best to cope with it in the future.

In this context, the Mino River Flood Alert System (MIDAS) early warning system has been developed for the Mino River (Galicia, NW Spain), whose flood events have historically caused severe damage in urban areas and are expected to increase in intensity in the next decades. MIDAS is integrated by a hydrologic (HEC-HMS) and a hydraulic (Iber+) model using precipitation forecast as input data. The system runs automatically and is governed by a set of Python scripts. When any hazard is detected, an alert is issued by the system, including detailed hazards maps, to help decision makers to take precise and effective mitigation measures. Statistical analysis supports the accuracy of hydrologic and hydraulic modules implemented to forecast river flow and flooded critical areas during the analyzed period of time, including some of the most extreme events registered in the Mino River. In fact, MIDAS has proven to be capable of predicting most of the alert situations occurred during the study period, showing its capability to anticipate risk situations.

Effects of climate change events including increased atmospheric temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, drinking water scarcity, reduced agriculture productivity, declining fish catch, increased salinity and extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones and tidal surge, are likely to have profound adverse impacts on the estuarine biodiversity and livelihoods of inhabitants of the region. Tigers in Sundarbans stray into the neighbouring villages during low tide to prey upon cows and goats. Obviously, all these phenomenon leads to a daily survival battle for the inhabitants. To address these issues, Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) practices are essential and is being implemented in Sagar Island and Gosaba Island of Sundarbans through ICZM project, funded by the World Bank. The alternative livelihood programme for coastal fishermen community of the Sundarbans Islands, income generation activities, encouraging salt tolerant paddy cultivation, establishment of rainwater harvesting system, construction of multipurpose cyclone shelters, and strengthening of the nylon fencing in Tiger Reserve Forest etc. are recommended for the sustainable development of the Sundarbans. An area specific approach or regional plan for Sundarbans is essential, as they have specific problems such as Tiger straying, seawater intrusion, erosion of embankments etc.	[Pitchaikani, J.

This study proposes a methodology for assessing the vulnerability to sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of mainland Portugal. Some scenarios of extreme sea levels for different return periods and extreme flooding events were estimated for 2050 and 2100, as proposed by the European Directive 2007/60/EC. A set of physical parameters are considered for the multi-attribute analysis based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process, in order to define a Physical Vulnerability Index fundamental to assess coastal vulnerability. For each sea-level rise scenario, coastal vulnerability maps, with a spatial resolution of 20 m, are produced at a national scale to identify areas more vulnerable to sea-level rise, which are key elements for triggering adaptation plans for such vulnerable regions. For 2050 and 2100, it is estimated that there will be 903 and 1146 km(2) of vulnerable areas, respectively; the Lisbon district being identified as the most vulnerable in both scenarios. Results are available as a Web Map Service for the Portuguese public entities, and through a web map viewer for the public and communities in general.

The state's response to flooding followed a traditional cultural and hierarchical approach to justice within Thailand, stemming from Buddhist values, an informal caste system and monarchical order. This resulted in a spatially uneven outcome, with the 'preservation' of the central city and two-month-long floods in outer suburbs, exacerbated by inadequate management and coordination. Suburban communities sought a more egalitarian notion of disaster justice, with hazard burdens shared more equitably and people having adequate access to decision-making over the distribution of disaster risk and compensation for damage. Extensive damage, and reduced livelihoods, caused friction between the two views, and protests, contestations and conflicts during the floods, in four different community contexts in northern Bangkok. By generating alternative discourses, challenging the hierarchical notion of justice and taking direct action to removing floodwalls, protesters sought to reshape the spatiality of the floodwater and claim inclusive citizenship and their right to the city. Existing perceptions of disaster justice, usually focused on liberal state responses to understanding disasters as natural episodes, are alone inadequate to explain the outcomes of and responses to disasters in different cultural contexts.

We examined the spatial characteristics of pluvial flooding in Portland, OR (2010-2017) by using citizen-reported flooding data. We used a spatially dense network of 5-min interval rainfall measurement to examine the relationship between the size of 3-day storm events and the frequency of flooding reports that were normalized by the population density at the census block group scale. Seventy percent of flooding reports were generated at smaller storm sizes of 5 cm or less over a 3-day period due to these storm sizes occurring more frequently across the observed time period. The flood reports were mainly clustered in the hilly west side, lower far north, central, and southeast regions of the city regardless of the time of year reports were generated. The flood reports were highest at the beginning of the wet season and decreased throughout the wet season. Flood reports were negatively associated with elevation variables. We recommend future research to minimize the potential caveats of using citizen-reported flooding data by creating better methods for standardizing and categorizing them	[Michelson, Katelyn; Chang, Heejun] Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA	Portland State University	Chang, H (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Geog, 1721 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA.	changh@pdx.edu	Chang, Heejun/AGF-1404-2022	Chang, Heejun/0000-0002-5605-6500	Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network; NSF [AGS-1444755]; Institute for Sustainable Solutions at Portland State University	Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute for Sustainable Solutions at Portland State University	We appreciate Emma Brenneman who created maps in Fig. 4.

Modelling spatial variation of extreme precipitation over Ho Chi Minh City under nonstationary condition	ACTA GEOPHYSICA			English	Article						Ho Chi Minh City; Extreme rainfall; Nonlinear; Nonstationary; Spatial variation; GEV	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; NON-STATIONARITY; INTENSE PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; TRENDS; DURATION; PROJECTIONS; MONSOON	Understanding the magnitude and spatial variation of extreme rainfall events are required for decision making and adaptation strategies for flood risk. In Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), heavy rainfall, which is considered as a main cause of floods, witnessed an increase in frequency and magnitude in last few decades. Although nonstationarity in extreme rainfall has been proved in many places of the world, research into nonstationarity feature in extreme rainfall in HCMC has not been paid attention thoroughly. In this study, the spatial variation of extreme precipitation over Ho Chi Minh City is modelled under nonstationary condition. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with location made a nonlinear function of time is applied to annual maximum daily rainfall. The study results show that the nonstationary GEV model is found to be superior in capturing extreme precipitation events when compared to the stationary GEV model. The extreme rainfall estimates under the stationary condition are lower than those under the nonstationary condition in most stations. Besides, the spatial variation of extreme rainfall under nonstationary condition shows a significant difference in extreme estimates between the periods of 1980-1984 and 2010-2014 in study area.

Implementing a Flood Vulnerability Index in urban coastal areas with industrial activity	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Coastal City Flood Vulnerability Index (CCFVI); Risk management; Indicators; Coastal flooding; Industries; Urban areas	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The necessity of an effective risk management in urban coastal zone increases, while the climate change creates unpredictable natural hazards. It is therefore very important to develop and implement analytical tools able to assist decision-makers to reveal vulnerable areas and prioritize relevant mitigation and adaptation measures. This article focuses on the applicability of the Coastal City Flooding Vulnerability Index (CCFVI) in zones of coastal cities belonging to the same country and incorporating industrial activities. It targets at investigating the capacity of the CCFVI to adequately take account of the impact of the industrial characteristics that are developed in the study areas on their vulnerability to coastal flooding. The results reveal the reduced discriminative capacity of the "administrative and institutional" subsystem in a centrally planned governance model like the one followed in Greece. They furthermore indicate the need for adding a separate indicators' subsystem, which will be able to measure the special features of the case study. Specifically, the industrial activity in the urban domain could severely impact the vulnerability of the area and should therefore be considered in designing the risk management plans for these areas. Moreover, the importance of weighting the indicators used in the vulnerability index calculation is emphasized.

Effects of sea-level rise on physiological ecology of populations of a ground-dwelling ant	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FIRE ANT; SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WORKER SIZE; HYMENOPTERA; RESPONSES; INVASION; IMPACTS	Introduction Sea-level rise is a consequence of climate change that can impact the ecological and physiological changes of coastal, ground-dwelling species. Sea-level rise has a potential to inundate birds, rodents, spiders, and insects that live on the ground in coastal areas. Yet, there is still much to be learned concerning the specifics of these impacts. The red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta (Buren) excavates soil for its home and is capable of surviving flooding. Because of their ground-dwelling life history and rapid reproduction, fire ants make an ideal model for discovery and prediction of changes that may be due to sea-level rise. There are up to 500,000 individuals in a colony, and these invasive ants naturally have a painful sting. However, observations suggest that colonies of fire ants that dwell in tidally-influenced areas are more aggressive with more frequent stings and more venom injected per sting (behavioral and physiological changes) than those located inland. This may be an adaption to sea-level rise. Therefore, the objective of this study is to elucidate differences in inland and coastal defensiveness via micro-dissection and comparison of head width, head length, stinger length, and venom sac volume. But first because fire ants' ability to raft on brackish tidal water is unknown, it had to be determined if fire ants could indeed raft in brackish water and examine the behavior differences between those flooded with freshwater vs. saltwater. Methods To test the coastal-aggression hypothesis, inland colonies and coastal colonies, which experience relatively greater amounts of flooding, specifically regular tidal and windblown water and oscillations (i.e. El Nino Southern Oscillation) from the Gulf of Mexico, were collected. To mimic sea-level rise, the colonies were flooded in salinities that correspond to both their collection site and conditions found in a variety of locales and situations (such as storm surge from a tropical storm). Individual ants were immediately taken from each colony for dissection before flooding, 1-hour into flooding, and 24-hours into flooding. Results and discussion Fire ants use their venom to defend themselves and to communicate alarm or aggression. Dissections and measurement of heads, venom sacs, and stingers revealed both coastal and inland colonies experience an increase in venom sac volume after 24 hours; in fact coastal colonies increased their venom volume by 75% after 24 h of flooding Whether this venom sac enlargement is due to diffusion of water or venom sac production is unknown. These ground-dwelling ants exhibit physiological and behavioral adaptations to ongoing sea-level rise possibly indicating that they are responding to increased flooding. Fire ants will raft on high-salinity water; and sea-level rise may cause stings by flooded ants to be more severe because of increased venom volume.	[Hooper-Bul, L. M.; Strecker-Lau, R.

To mitigate and prevent the occurrence of further problems, the suggestion of sustainable urban development and construction based on the concept of porous concrete pavement has been put forth. Then, properties of pervious concrete such as compressive strength, porosity, and permeability, have been studied, with a focus on durability and resistance to the freeze-thaw cycle, and wear. Furthermore, the method of testing and the means of examining the performance of diverse properties of pervious concrete have been investigated. Also, clogging phenomena and methods to maintain and restore permeability were discussed. Subsequently, with the explication of sustainable development and the heat island effect, the correlation between the porous pavement and the sponge city has been scrutinized. Finally, an appropriate mix design has been presented based on the research findings, which is optimal in terms of mechanical and hydraulic resistance and meets the structural requirements and needed durability to be used as a pavement material in sponge city.

Analysis of the response of a roadway bridge under extreme flooding-related events: Scour and debris-loading	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						Scour; Debris; Flooding; Resilience; Soil -Structure Interaction; Bridges	FOUNDATION SCOUR; STIFFNESS; RADAR	Hydraulic actions on bridges are a leading cause of failure, especially due to the occurrence of scour erosion. Due to climate change, flooding and scour risks are exacerbating for bridges worldwide, leading to a significant stress burden on asset management agencies. Assessing structures for scour has received significant attention in recent years, however, there are few studies which investigate the influence of scour on the components of a bridge to understand how various elements interact. Moreover, the presence of debris loading, which can occur due to flooding causing debris to become lodged at structures, has not received significant attention. Debris can worsen scour conditions and increase hydraulic loading on a bridge. In this paper, an analysis of the response of various components of a roadway bridge when exposed to extreme flooding is conducted. The influence of scour and debris on hydraulic loading, internal forces, modal periods, and utilization ratios of various bridge components is ascertained. A numerical model is developed using OpenSees employing two different methods to model the soilstructure interaction. Results for several flooding scenarios show how the various bridge elements are influenced by variations in water height and velocity, scour depth, and presence of debris.

PLANT CELL			English	Editorial Material							OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT; NATURAL VARIATION; STRESS RESPONSES; STOMATAL CONTROL; ROOT-GROWTH; TURGOR; PHOSPHATASE; YIELD; FIELD; OSMOREGULATION	Drought stress is an increasing concern because of climate change and increasing demands on water for agriculture. There are still many unknowns about how plants sense and respond to water limitation, including which genes and cellular mechanisms are impactful for ecology and crop improvement in drought-prone environments. A better understanding of plant drought resistance will require integration of several research disciplines. A common set of parameters to describe plant water status and quantify drought severity can enhance data interpretation and research integration across the research disciplines involved in understanding drought resistance and would be especially useful in integrating the flood of genomic data being generated in drought studies. Water potential (psi(w)) is a physical measure of the free energy status of water that, along with related physiological measurements, allows unambiguous description of plant water status that can apply across various soil types and environmental conditions. psi(w) and related physiological parameters can be measured with relatively modest investment in equipment and effort. Thus, we propose that increased use of psi(w) as a fundamental descriptor of plant water status can enhance the insight gained from many drought-related experiments and facilitate data integration and sharing across laboratories and research disciplines.

Globally, millions of people will experience increased vulnerability in the coming decades due to climate change. The change in the coastline (1986-2020) over time was analyzed with remote sensors and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) in conjunction with GIS. A total of 16 indicators were selected to quantitatively evaluate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to construct a composite vulnerability index (COVI). The endpoint rate (EPR) of the change in the coastline was estimated. The results showed that 35% of the study area was stable, 18% of the coastline experienced erosion processes, and 47% experienced accretion. The COVI analysis revealed that coastal watersheds show great spatial heterogeneity; 31.4% of the area had moderate vulnerability levels, 26.5% had low vulnerability levels, and 41.9% had high vulnerability levels. This analysis revealed that the watersheds located in the northern (Malaga Bay) and central (Anchicaya, Cajambre, and Rapposo basins) parts of the coastal zone were more vulnerable than the other areas.

Modeling coho salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus kisutch</i>) population response to streamflow and water temperature extremes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						Life cycle; simulation modeling; pacific salmon; extreme events; thermal regime; flow regime	CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; PACIFIC SALMON; FRESH-WATER; FISH-HABITAT; VARIABILITY; EVENTS; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; STEELHEAD; MORTALITY	Models that assess the vulnerability of freshwater species to shifting environmental conditions do not always account for short-duration extremes, which are increasingly common. Life cycle models for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) generally focus on average conditions that fish experience during each life stage, yet many floods, low flows, and elevated water temperatures only last days to weeks. We developed a process-based life cycle model that links coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) abundance to daily streamflow and thermal regimes to assess: (1) "How does salmon abundance respond to short-duration floods, low flows, and high temperatures in glacier-, snow-, and rain-fed streams? " and (2) "How does the temporal resolution of flow and temperature data influence these responses? ". Our simulations indicate that short-duration extremes can reduce salmon abundance in some contexts. However, after daily flow and temperature data were aggregated into weekly and monthly averages, the impact of extreme events on populations declined. Our analysis demonstrates that novel modeling frameworks that capture daily variability in flow and temperature are needed to examine impacts of extreme events on Pacific salmon.

J	Mukhopadhyay, P				Mukhopadhyay, Prama			The `Fluid Landscape' of the Sundarbans: Critically Reviewing the `Managed Retreat' Discourse	CONSERVATION & SOCIETY			English	Article						conservation; Sundarbans; fluid ecology; policy recommendation; managed retreat; Indigenous Knowledge		The Sundarbans, spread across 10,200 sq. km in the lower deltaic region of Bengal, is the world's largest prograding delta. Most climatologists acknowledge that this fragile ecosystem, cutting across Bangladesh and India, will bear the brunt of climate change. It is estimated that the region, facing sea level rise and intensification of cyclonic activities, will experience the disastrous effects of global warming; and scientists have been expressing their concerns about the viability of human settlements there in the foreseeable future. In India, some researchers have floated the idea of `Managed Retreat' of people from certain areas of the deltaic floodplains in a bid to `conserve the mangroves and the ecosystem' of the Sundarbans. This postulation, first published as the Delta Vision: 2050 for the World-Wide-Fund for Nature India (WWF-India) in 2011, and discussed in the following years, in various platforms and research journals, has been advocating a `phased and systematic outmigration' (Ghosh 2012) from the region, citing the `Dutch Room for River' project as an exemplary ideal to be mirrored. This article will try to unpack the impact of this proposal on the local communities, living in tandem with the deltaic landscape for generations, if such a strategy is adopted.

Environmental Geography provides arguments to articulate the relationships between society and nature and the possibility of focusing on the environmental system as an object of study. The aim of this article is to provide theoretical, methodological and operational elements for the evaluation of the interrelationship between wetland ecosystems and urban localities in Uruguay based on three case studies and analysing them from the theoretical and conceptual context of Environmental Geography. The methodological strategy is based on a multi-scale analysis: at the national scale, studying the situation of the interrelationship between wetlands and urban areas, and at the basin scale, case studies are selected to address the specific conditions of the relationship. In Uruguay, 50% of urban localities are located in wetland territories, but no national strategy can be identified to solve the problem of flooding events in urban areas. Environmental Geography offers the possibility of making the interrelationships between urban spaces and the environments where they develop visible as it makes it possible to analyse the causes of the problem at the basin level in order to achieve sustainable management.

Maximum precipitation depths are used to estimate return periods and, thus, calculate the risk of this type of event. To improve these estimates in Southwest Europe, we studied the behavior of extreme rainfall using the historical records of San Fernando (Cadiz, southwest Spain), obtaining the maximum daily annual rainfall (period 1851-2021). Local risk levels for intense precipitation were established based on the mean values and standard deviation of daily precipitation. In this series, 38% of the years had some type of risk (>53.7 mm), of which 13% of these years had high risk (>73.2 mm) or disaster risk (>92.7 mm). In these risk thresholds, the maximum daily precipitation is mostly concentrated in the autumn months. The SQRT-ETMax model used fits well with the instrumental historical records for return periods of up to 25 years, although it may present appreciable deviations for longer return periods. Using a 170-year secular series, a more precise understanding of extreme periods and precipitation variability was obtained.

J	Quesada-Román, A				Quesada-Roman, Adolfo			Flood risk index development at the municipal level in Costa Rica: A methodological framework	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Flood risk management; Flood risk assessment; Costa Rica; Central America; Fluvial geomorphology; Disaster risk reduction	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CENTRAL-AMERICA; NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARD; GEOMORPHOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; WELFARE; EVENTS	Floods constitute one of the most damaging natural hazards in the world. Seasonal and extraordinary rainfall recurrently trigger different types of floods in Costa Rica. An integrated and efficient flood risk management requires comprehensive understanding on the flood driving variables. This study analyzes and classifies the 82 Costa Rican municipalities in terms of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to floods. Then, an index for flood risk is designed to comprehend the risk driver's role (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) at a local level. The present method provides a flood risk index on a municipal scale done through a statistical validation of different sources of municipal-level data. Higher flood risk values mostly occur in municipalities located in extensive flatlands, medium to large areas in both the Pacific and Caribbean basins, as well as borderlands and coastal regions. The results can promote flood risk assessment plans in developing countries or regions where baseline information is limited. This approach has been absent in most of the national flood risk policies, specifically the plans analyzing the likelihood of short, mid, and long-term decline of risk conditions influencing flood disasters.

J	Wiseman, J				Wiseman, John			Narrative Matters: Fighting not drowning - facing a harsh climate future with wisdom, hope and courage	CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Environmental health; environment; environmental influences		The most recent 2021 IPCC climate science update reminds us yet again that accelerating the transition to a just and resilient zero-carbon future clearly remains humanity's most urgent task. A great deal of hard work and a lot of luck may enable us to avoid some of the most dangerous climate change and ecological tipping points. Current and future generations are however on a journey into a world of more frequent and severe extreme weather events; more heatwaves, fires, floods and famines and more rapid extinctions of animals, birds and insects. Awareness, that this is going to be a very long emergency is a source of deep distress for many people passionately committed to decisive climate action. A rapidly expanding body of research highlights the extent to which this distress is experienced most acutely by children and young people with large numbers reporting deeply pessimistic views about the future. This article explores diverse sources of learning and wisdom - from climate scientists and activists; philosophers and social theorists; Indigenous cultures and ways of life; faith-based and spiritual traditions; artists and writers - which can strengthen our capacity to live courageous, compassionate and creative lives in a world of rapidly accelerating climatic and ecological risk.

Chaotic urban flooding prevention system management is the current governance bottleneck in many cities and exacerbates flooding events. Sustainable rainwater management strategies require flexible implementation considering local characteristics, space-time factors, governance, and economic and technological issues to address deficiencies in drainage pipeline maintenance, network capacity, geographic information system (GIS) information, and funding. Kunming City, China, has implemented the "One City, One Executor, and One Network" urban drainage management model since 2014. This study analyzed urban flooding prevention under this model, government and drainage department operation, and GIS system construction and application to underground infrastructure. Results showed that over five years, urban flooding reduced by 57.5% despite continuous construction. The flooding duration at North Station Tunnel decreased from 72 h on July 19, 2013, to 14 h on July 20, 2017; no flooding occurred on July 20, 2019. This study proves that the implemented model is sustainable and can weaken the spatial-temporal distribution and intensity of urban flooding.

While it has positive connotations and resonates with local urban agendas, it is not always clear what it means and what factors contribute to resilience. Additionally, critical literature observes that people's views on what resilience means can differ strongly and the many choices that are made in planning and implementing resilience are often left implicit. In this paper, we describe a diagnostic tool that tackles these issues by (1) distilling resilience principles and narratives that provide a comprehensive picture of the different pathways that resilience-building could take, and (2) making explicit and facilitating reflection on the choices embedded in planning for urban resilience. We illustrate the tool with an application on urban flood risk management in Rotterdam. We conclude that the Resilience Diagnostic Tool is useful to reflect on the local goals of resilience-building, to diagnose choices made in urban plans, and to reflect on their consequences. It supports policymakers in making deliberate, transparent and goal-oriented choices on urban resilience.

However, due to technological improvements, developers now build more high-rise and high-performance buildings, meaning that new approaches to estimating lifecycle costs are needed. Meanwhile, an accelerating process of industrialization around the world means that global warming is also accelerating, and the damage caused by natural disasters due to climate change is increasing. However, the costs of losses related to such hazards are rarely incorporated into lifecycle-cost estimation techniques. Accordingly, this study explored the relationship between, on the one hand, some known parameters of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, high winds, and/or flooding, and on the other hand, the data on exceptional maintenance costs, represented by gross loss costs, generated by a large international hotel chain from 2007 to 2017. The regression model used revealed a correlation between heavy rain and insurance-claim payouts. This and other results can usefully inform safety and design guidelines for policymakers, both in disaster management and real estate, as well as in insurance companies	[Yum, Sang-Guk] Columbia Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Engn Mech, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kim, Ji-Myong] Mokpo Natl Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Mokpo 58554, South Korea; [Son, Kiyoung] Ulsan Univ, Sch Architectural Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea	Columbia University; Mokpo National University; University of Ulsan	Son, K (corresponding author), Ulsan Univ, Sch Architectural Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea.	sy2509@columbia.edu; jimy@mokpo.ac.kr; sky9852111@ulsan.ac.kr		Kim, Ji-Myong/0000-0002-1907-4291; Yum, Sang Guk/0000-0002-7784-2957	Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2019R1F1A1058800]	Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education	This research was funded by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2019R1F1A1058800).		46	6	7	2	17	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2071-1050		SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL	Sustainability	JUN	2020	12	12							4994	10.3390/su12124994	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12124994			11	Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	ML3QN		Green Published, gold			2024-04-22	WOS:000549384800001

Creating a water risk index to improve community resilience	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							FLOOD VULNERABILITY INDEX; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; SCIENCE; COUNTY	Flood risk reduction is an existent discourse and agenda in policy and insurance. Existing approaches such as linking hydrological models to economic loss models may be highly inequitable between areas of different socio-economic vulnerability. To our knowledge, no one has tried to adapt the more advanced known heat risk theory by first informing flood risk with the socio-economic vulnerability, and then investigating the sensitivity of risk reduction policies to that flood risk. In this article, we demonstrate two methods to combine water hazard data with a derived water vulnerability index to characterize water risk. We then compare the costs of two potential government policies: buyout of the home versus funding for foundation elevation. We use the case study area of Pittsburgh, PA, which faces severe precipitation and riverine flooding hazards. We find that while small differences in characterizing flood risk can result in large differences between flood risk maps, the cost of the flood risk reduction policy is not sensitive to the method of representing the socio-economic vulnerability. This suggests that while validation of flood risk incorporating socioeconomic data is needed, for some policies, policymakers can prioritize environmental justice with little to no additional cost.

Some 146 events are identified, including 30 major disasters. Large downstream populations and major infrastructure are threatened. Risk factors differ from recent reports of other Himalayan GLOFs associated with glacier recession and global warming. Ice dams are largely or entirely active ice, put in place by advancing glaciers. Climate change is a factor, but the ice cover in the Karakoram has been sustained, and even some increase in mass. Surge-type glaciers comprise or affect similar to 70% of our inventory. The most frequent, large GLOFs come from local clusters of glaciers in five sub-basins, given special attention here. In four there were new ice dams formed since 2008 and two generated dangerous GLOFs. An urgent need arises to track short-term ice and lake behavior and how surge dynamics may be involved. Satellite images and DEMs are employed in cross-correlation feature tracking and elevation change respectively. The glaciers of interest all exhibit irregular movement, including recent advances, but with great variability and no clear relation to climatic fluctuations.

A sea dike to close Can Gio Bay has been proposed to regulate storage and control water levels in the drainage and sewer system of Ho Chi Minh City. However, this proposed sea dike and different gate operating modes could significantly change the hydrodynamic regime in Can Gio Bay. In this study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was developed to assess changes in the hydrodynamic regime after construction of the sea dike, including fluctuations in the inundated areas in Can Gio Bay mangrove forests. The results show that sea dike construction is an effective solution for controlling water levels and reducing inundation, especially considering a sea level rise scenario in the year 2050. Further, the gate operation mode also affects the effectiveness of inundation reduction, which is approximately 10% better than the same sea dike type without gate operation. However, the sea dike was less effective in a sea water level rise scenario in 2100 for all scenarios.

This study describes the developments and testing of a sub-catchment-based multi-index fuzzy evaluation approach that can provide adaptation guidance for municipal decision-makers at a local level. We first built a comprehensive flood risk assessment system considering three categories: hazard, urban system, and social environment. The proposed evaluation system includes hybrid uncertain information that involves random indicator sources and hesitant fuzzy judgments from experts. The storm weather management model combined with geographic information system tools was then applied to obtain random indicators. Subsequently, hesitant fuzzy linguistic sets and the Euclidean distance method were adopted to solve the problem of uncertainty and vagueness from subjective hesitant information. Therefore, the aggregation method provides a beneficial way to assess flood risk in a hybrid uncertain environment. In addition, the proposed approach was applied to the Jinjiang district in an inland city in the P. R. of China. This supports efforts to prioritize locally tailored policies and practical measures for higher-risk sub-catchments within large urban systems.

Under global warming, more intense precipitation extremes will pose severe risk to current infrastructure. The evaluation of where and by how much design standards need to change, is urgently needed to help maintain well-functioning drainage systems. In this study, we used climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Modeling (ICM) to simulate urban flooding. According to the latest design standard of urban drainage infrastructure, we assess the risk of future urban flooding, and evaluate the effect and benefit of drainage infrastructure adaptation measures. The results showed that, under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 5-8.5 scenario, a 35% increase in extreme rainfall would be expected. Under a 1-in-30-year precipitation event, the maximum depth would increase by 5.59%, and the withdrawal time would rise by 2.94% in the future period, relative to the baseline level. After the enlargement of drainage infrastructure in local areas, 10% pipe enlargement has a better effect to reduce risk and higher benefits than 5% pipe enlargement. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in enhancing the drainage system and adapting to climate change.

This paper reports results on this issue obtained within the framework of the DFG research group SPATE (Space-Time Dynam-ics of Extreme Floods). Important large-scale flood extremes in Central Europe are so-called Vb-precipitation events in summer and rain-on-snow events in winter. Here, the atmospheric causes of such flood events under climate change are investigated. The atmos-pheric datasets suitable for this study are generated using a state-of-the-art coupled regional climate model. In addition to an im-proved understanding of processes, results for a future climate indicate that convective precipitation peaks will become more frequent and intense during Vb-events, and thus Vb-floods will become more extreme. Large-scale rain-on-snow events show multi-decadal variability, which can be partially explained by cyclically varying climate drivers, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Scan-dinavian Pattern. For a future climate, because of reduced average snow amounts a decrease in frequency and mean intensity is observed.

Despite empirical relationships between human settlements, river dynamics and the corresponding landforms, the underlying mechanism remains speculative. Here, we present the first millennium-scale, quantitative tem-poral analysis of human population dynamics and its relationship with river location and landforms in imperial China across four dynasties (Han - 2 CE, Tang - 742 CE, Song - 1102 CE and Ming - 1522 CE) over the last 2000 years. Our results show less human reliance (measured by the number of people living close to a water course) on rivers for people living in lowland areas, which we interpret to be related to flood risk and the availability of groundwater from alluvial aquifers distant from rivers, used for agriculture. Conversely, people living in mountainous and hilly areas appear to have a stronger reliance on rivers in imperial China. Specifically, behind the strong variations of human-river relation across millennia, we infer a general principle highlighting the role of landforms in human-river interactions. These results shed light on how geomorphology shape settlement and urban patterns, with important implications for sustainable lifeways in riverine environments.

However, this is usually challenging when urban planning is supposed to be integrated with water management. Using the Chinese city of Guangzhou as a case study, this study explores the long-term disadvantaged conditions of urban planning in flood governance and how this situation is shaped. The findings show that, in comparison to the increasingly dominant position of water management in flood affairs, the urban planning system has had weak powers, limited legitimate opportunities, and insufficient fiscal incentives from the 2000s to the late 2010s. Those conditions have been shaped by organizational structures, institutional rules, and financial allocation in urban governance, whose changes did not bring benefits to urban planning. The emergence of the Sponge City Program in China in 2017 and its implementation at the municipal level is deemed to be a new start for urban planning, considering the encouragement of nature-based solutions and regulatory tools in land use for flood resilience. Even so, the future of this program is still full of challenges and more efforts are needed.

However, subway systems lack consideration of flood risk, and few studies have assessed risk during flood events from the view of subway travel. In this study, subway travel risk was evaluated by flood hazard, subway travel exposure and population vulnerability under three groups of rainfall scenarios. The degree of spatial exposure was calculated based on smart card data and a census, and the vulnerability of the population was assessed based on human stability in floodwaters. The results in the study area indicate that subway travel risk grows with an increase in the rainfall return period, and the highest subway travel risk occurs in the morning peak period. The return periods of rainfall, time-to-peak, and duration have an impact on the spatiotemporal trajectory of subway travel risk. Furthermore, the traditional census tends to underestimate subway transportation exposure due to subway travel. Subway travel risk increases significantly under the extreme rainfall scenario and requires further research. This study provides risk maps for making travel decisions before departures and support for subway operators to develop risk warnings.

The predicted inundation area was in good agreement with the flood area estimated by Sentinel-1A SAR. In addition, pseudo global warming (PGW) simulations using the SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socio-economic Pathway 5-8.5) scenario according to IPCC AR6 were conducted to evaluate the extreme rainfall and associated inundation area under warmer environmental conditions.New hydrological insights for the region: As a result of simulations, the average future rainfall intensity is likely to increase mainly due to higher relative humidity in the regional atmosphere. Associated with these changes, it is likely that the extent of the ensemble average future expected flooded area in the upper White Volta River could slightly increase by 1.04 times under the PGW conditions, compared with present climate conditions. The result of this study implies that floods in the upper White Volta River have the potential of becoming more severe under the most extreme future global warming scenarios.

There a large information gap on the spatial distribution and diversity of wetland types in South America. Aims. We focus on mapping the spatial distribution of broad wetland types in Argentina, based on the integration of open spatial data sources developed by national government agencies. Methods. We designed a two-tier process, as follows: we filtered broad wetland types described in the attributes of the spatial datasets and created a separate vector layer for each wetland class; we then ensembled the layers by populating a 25-m cell raster template. Key results. Our WetCarto_AR layer indicates that wetlands cover 13.5% of mainland Argentina, being distributed throughout the country with a greater concentration towards the north-east, but patchy in the rest of the country. Palustrine is the dominant wetlands class followed by Riparian and Lacustrine. Global datasets underestimated wetland coverage, although the same large wetlands are recognised in all. Conclusions. Our results make visible the known spatial extent of wetlands in Argentina and provide information to feed or validate global models.

However, the impact of precipitation regimes, rather than precipitation amount, on vegetation has seldom been revealed. This study characterised the precipitation regimes by both the amount and temporal distribution of precipitation and zoned the QTP as different precipitation regimes accordingly. The response of vegetation to such precipitation regimes was then investigated. The results indicate that the vegetation patterns are quite consistent with zoning, that is, there is a certain type or a few dominant types of vegetation in each sub-region divided by the precipitation regimes. The areas where the precipitation became more uniform within a year were concentrated in grassland and bare land, which benefits the restoration and improvement of the ecological environment of the plateau. The increase in precipitation variability in the south-eastern part of the plateau may lead to natural disasters such as floods and mudslides. This study provides a novel perspective to understand the distribution of vegetation patterns.

The centrality of engineering codes and risk-based design standards in climate adaptation strategies	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Engineering codes; 'No regrets' climate adaptation; Risk-based design standards; Risk tolerance; Safety factors	FLOOD FREQUENCY; MANAGEMENT; STATIONARITY; FRAMEWORK; OPTIONS; MODEL	Engineering codes, design standards and analytical criteria for hydraulic structures are the final determinative specifications for designing and constructing a water resources project. As such, they are the authoritative and legally accepted standards for project design and construction. Engineering codes and standards are developed to optimize public safety and performance by focusing on structural reliability, which includes a wide range of extreme conditions that encompass most contemporary climate uncertainties, and which are likely to overlap some portion of future climate non-stationary conditions. Current practices of risk-based planning and design standards have evolved incrementally, responding to each catastrophic natural disaster, whether it is geotechnical, floods, droughts or hurricanes. Design standards and building codes encompass an accumulation of changes that progressively reflect changing climate conditions, most notably because they focus on climate extremes. Design standards and embedded 'safety factors' that are based on extremes are likely to encompass a good deal of an anticipated non-stationary climate regime and its associated uncertainties. Modern risk analysis methods and risk-based standards, codes and methods comprise an important part of a progressive autonomous adaptation to climate change. They represent an essential component of 'no regrets' climate adaptation.

China has planted billions of trees over the past 20 years. However, little is known about the effectiveness of this artificial revegetation and its consequences on China's national conservation policies and changes in biophysical factors at the county level. Here we use satellite time series data and develop a new metric, the revegetation index (RVI), that quickly monitors revegetation and its long-term changes. We found that the number of regions where the Grain to Green Program (GTGP) was successfully implemented was only about 55.8% of the areas of GTGP implementation. Surprisingly, we provide observational evidence that the implementation of the GTGP can decrease soil erosion and drought, and increase water availability, but revegetation in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) in China has a limited impact on soil erosion, water, and drought. In particular, for revegetation between 1999 and 2016, indicating that a previous assessment by the Government revealed as official statistics may have overestimated the effects of the ecological restoration practices.

The runoff reconstruction, spanning 1601-2013 CE, was developed by calibrating tree-ring data with the instrumental runoff record. Runoff reconstruction accounted for 44.3% of the actual runoff variance during the common period 1958-2010 and provided a long-term perspective on hydrological change in the China north-south transition zone. In the past 413 years, high- and low-runoff years accounted for 15.50% and 15.98%, respectively. Of all the 17 extreme hydrological events, 14 of them are extremely high-flow years, and 17th century was the wettest period during the past 413 years. The preliminary analysis results show that there is a relationship between our runoff reconstruction and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation at multidecadal scale. Since the 1990s, runoff in the China north-south transition zone has also seen a significant decrease as a result of dry trends of the source region.

Distributed systems of reservoirs, natural flood management, and green infrastructure are practical examples of distributed attenuation. The effectiveness of attenuating features lies in their ability to work in concert, by reducing and slowing runoff in strategic parts of the catchment, and desynchronizing flows. The spatial distribution of attenuating features plays an essential role in the process. This article proposes a framework to place features in a hydrologic network, group them into spatially distributed systems, and analyze their flood attenuation effects. The framework is applied to study distributed systems of reservoirs in a rural watershed in Iowa, USA. The results show that distributed attenuation can be an effective alternative to a single centralized flood mitigation approach. The different flow peak attenuation of considered distributed systems suggest that the spatial distribution of features significantly influences flood magnitude at the catchment scale. The proposed framework can be applied to examine the effectiveness of distributed attenuation, and its viability as a widespread flood attenuation strategy in different landscapes and at multiple scales.

Hydrological stress adversely affects these parameters for species inhabiting floodplains; however, the relationship between M' and G' in hydrologically variable environments is poorly understood. We evaluated age-specific mortality for six species from a 20-year time series and growth curves from otolith length-at-age data. We assessed the effect of hydrology on the transitional age (age M'/G' = 1) at 21 sites representing a hydrological gradient. Disturbance intensity influenced age-specific mortality but had no effect on mass-specific growth. The transitional age was inversely correlated with annual density, but weakly associated with population biomass. Hydrological disturbance shifted the transitional age to older ages, reducing recruitment overall. We demonstrated that the M'/G' transition was affected adversely by hydrological stress and can be applied to a diverse group of taxa.

The role of these lakes as terrestrial storage for glacial meltwater is currently unknown and not accounted for in global sea level assessments. Here, we map glacier lakes around the world using 254,795 satellite images and use scaling relations to estimate that global glacier lake volume increased by around 48%, to 156.5 km(3), between 1990 and 2018. This methodology provides a near-global database and analysis of glacial lake extent, volume and change. Over the study period, lake numbers and total area increased by 53 and 51%, respectively. Median lake size has increased 3%; however, the 95th percentile has increased by around 9%. Currently, glacial lakes hold about 0.43 mm of sea level equivalent. As glaciers continue to retreat and feed glacial lakes, the implications for glacial lake outburst floods and water resources are of considerable societal and ecological importance. Warming is increasing glacial lakes, and scaling relations show a 48% increase in volume for 1990 to 2018. All measures-area, volume, number-increased, providing water storage but also representing a potential hazard with the risk of outburst floods.

A century of precipitation trends in forest lands of the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; SCENARIOS; DISCHARGE; DROUGHT; WATER	Variations in long-term precipitation trends due to climate forcings have been observed in many parts of the world, exacerbating hydrological uncertainties to predicting droughts, floods, water resource availability, and ecosystem services. The Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMRAV) is an important economic region of the midsouth USA, which is prone to natural disasters from extreme climate events and is known historically for cyclic flooding events and, within the last 20 years, for groundwater level declines. However, our knowledge of long-term precipitation trends in this region is fragmented. Using 100-year historic daily precipitation data from six stations of forest lands along with multivariate statistical analysis, we found that there were significant increasing trends (p <= 0.05) in annual precipitation near the south coastal area of the LMRAV and only marginally increasing trends in the northern area. Spatial variation in seasonality was observed at the decadal scale with increasing trends in fall near the coastal area and in spring around the north area. In addition to becoming wetter, the coastal area also experienced higher precipitation intensity with shorter return period over the past 100 years. These findings are useful to water resource managers for adapting to changing climate conditions in the LMRAV.

In addition, an ordered probit model was used to analyse the determinants of household's recovery from flood shocks. Fanners adopt on-farm and nonfarm activities as adaptation strategies. Estimation results indicate that farmers that employ on-farm and non-farm strategies had their food security situation improved and recovered faster from flood shocks. Age, education, access to extension, credit, farm size and information on flood occurrence drive the farmer's decision to adopt onfarm practices. Marital status, education, farm size and information on flood occurrence significantly influenced adaptation decisions related to non-farm activities. Other factors that influence household's recovery period from flood events were age, education, FBO and perceived severity of flood. Programs and policies that promote extension contacts, increase awareness on flood occurrences and provide non-farm work opportunities can be beneficial to reduce the adverse effects of floods.

Precipitation is one of the most significant climatic parameters and its variability and trends have great influences on environmental and socioeconomic development. We investigate the spatio-temporal variability of precipitation occurrence frequency, mean precipitation depth, PVI and total precipitation in China based on long-term precipitation series from 1961 to 2015. As China's topography is diverse and precipitation is affected by topography strongly, ANUSPLIN can model the effect of topography on precipitation effectively is adopted to generate the precipitation interpolation surface. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and simple linear regression was adopted to examine long-term trend for these indicators. The results indicate ANUSPLIN precipitation surface is reliable and the precipitation variation show different regional and seasonal trend. For example, there is a sporadic with decreasing frequency precipitation trend in spring and a uniform with increasing frequency trend in summer inYangtze Plain, which may affect spring ploughing and alteration of flood risk for this main rice-production areas of China. In northwestern China, there is a uniform with increasing precipitation frequency and intensity trend, which is beneficial for this arid region. Our study could be helpful for other counties with similar climate types.

This raises fundamental questions concerning how governing arrangements support or constrain climate hazard management. The paper assesses existing approaches to adapting to climate hazards in Calabar metropolis in Nigeria, where flooding is a major hazard. The governance systems adopted in the context of flood adaptation and their implication for practice is further investigated, and the strategies necessary for an improved implementation of climate hazard adaptation at the local governance level examined. Data for the study is collected from a stakeholder workshop and document analysis. Despite calls for decentralized governance and prevalence of a hierarchical system, other forms of governing coexist alongside these systems in Calabar. Five key strategies which should form the basis of urban climate hazard adaptation in practice, as identified by stakeholders, are synergy of activities among stakeholders; enforcement devoid of politics and bureaucracy, capacity building and information/data availability; increased focus on international cooperation and funding; and consideration of connections between flooding and other urban processes.

J	Im, J				Im, Joowon			Green Streets to Serve Urban Sustainability: Benefits and Typology	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						green street; green infrastructure; urban sustainability	INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM	Urbanization and climate change have impacted the ecosystems of the US cities. Impervious surfaces in the urbanized areas are a critical issue for both challenges and green infrastructure can be an alternative solution to achieve urban sustainability. Green infrastructure protects urban ecosystems by reducing imperviousness as treating stormwater runoff and providing other multifaceted benefits. However, even with the great potential, its adoption is still discouraged due to limited understanding and guidance especially for the cities with a growth-driven policy. This paper proposes that green infrastructure, particularly green streets in relation to impervious surfaces, can deliver urban sustainability by providing a better understanding to promote the acceptance and successful adoption of green streets through literature review and case studies in the US. Green streets are primarily implemented within the right-of-way and facilitate stormwater treatment along with diverse street designs providing multiple benefits such as flood management, wildlife habitat and natural pathway creation, neighborhood beautification, cost-effective solution, and more. The defined green street typology in this paper is an important tool for communicating among planners and the public by providing form-based standardized classification. Green streets can be utilized as a sustainable development approach, fulfilling a variety of environmental, social, and economic objectives.

The findings suggest that there are no unsurmountable technological, cost-benefit, financial and social limits to the progressive raising of these ports, at least for the magnitude of climate-induced sea-level rise expected during the 21(st) century. In Indonesia observed adaptation is a sequential process: only part of the port is raised at one time, allowing port operations to continue elsewhere and spreading costs in time. Jumps in unit costs are apparent as the elevation height increases. In addition, the possibility of sea-level rise triggering innovative changes in port design to lower costs (e.g., a move to floating ports) is being considered. For traditional ports to upgrade by up to 1 metre, unit costs are found to be somewhere between 50-360 USD/m(3) rise (not including the cost of piling). Nevertheless, such adaptation costs would represent a significant burden and adaptation is often reactive rather than proactive, leading to significant damage costs, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina's impact on Gulf Coast Ports.

J	Scuderi, R; Tesoriere, G; Fasone, V				Scuderi, Raffaele; Tesoriere, Giuseppe; Fasone, Vincenzo			Natural events and performance of micro firms: the impact of floods on shops in Uganda	ECONOMIA POLITICA			English	Article						Micro shops; Floods; Performance; Resilience; Uganda	SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFRASTRUCTURE; GROWTH; ADAPTATION; POVERTY; ENTERPRISES; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS	The impact of natural events on local economy is a key issue on the agenda of policymakers around the world and particularly in developing countries. This paper discusses the impact of floods on micro businesses development. We provide evidence on how the frequency of events is correlated with shops business performance in Uganda. We exploit a unique dataset from a direct survey on micro retail shops within a project launched by the Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development. Data come from a survey on 13 cities and villages where floods occur regularly and are a major problem for population. After controlling for both shop manager and business characteristics, expectedly we find that floods impact negatively on business performance. However business performance is likely to decrease less when events occur with more frequency. This may indicate a sort of adaptation behaviour by shop managers when floods occur regularly. Also, the significance of shop manager's individual characteristics suggests that policies for boosting micro business should improve human capital, with peculiar attention to women and young people. Our findings also suggest that encouraging some forms of network economies may positively impact business performance.

However, the effectiveness of LIDs on flood mitigation is still not well understood. This study assessed the mitigation extent of urban flooding by LIDs for retrofitting an urbanized area at a feasible level using a hydrological model. A range of storms with different rainfall durations and amounts from intensity-duration-frequency curves were used to evaluate the hydrological performances of LIDs. The results indicated that LIDs were effective alternatives to mitigate urban flooding in the urbanized area. Surface runoff and peak flow decreased by 18.6-59.2% and 8.0-71.4%, respectively. However, the flood mitigation performance decreased markedly with the increase of rainfall amount. Although LIDs were less effective in flood mitigation during shorter and heavier storms, the performance was better with the increase of rainfall duration. This research provides an insight into flood reduction capabilities of LIDs under different rainfall characteristics for retrofitting built up areas, which is useful for urban storm management.

Water quality mediates resilience on the Great Barrier Reef	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							RIVERINE FLOOD PLUMES; OF-THORNS STARFISH; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; CORAL RECOVERY; PHASE-SHIFTS; COMMUNITIES; PROJECTIONS; RESPONSES; OUTBREAKS	Threats from climate change and other human pressures have led to widespread concern for the future of Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Resilience of GBR reefs will be determined by their ability to resist disturbances and to recover from coral loss, generating intense interest in management actions that can moderate these processes. Here we quantify the effect of environmental and human drivers on the resilience of southern and central GBR reefs over the past two decades. Using a composite water quality index, we find that while reefs exposed to poor water quality are more resistant to coral bleaching, they recover from disturbance more slowly and are more susceptible to outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral disease-with a net negative impact on recovery and long-term hard coral cover. Given these conditions, we find that 6-17% improvement in water quality will be necessary to bring recovery rates in line with projected increases in coral bleaching among contemporary inshore and mid-shelf reefs. However, such reductions are unlikely to buffer projected bleaching effects among outer-shelf GBR reefs dominated by fast-growing, thermally sensitive corals, demonstrating practical limits to local management of the GBR against the effects of global warming.

Chipping in: functional morphology of the American beaver under range expansion	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						phenotypic adaptation; range expansion; functional morphology; cranial morphology; environmental condition; wood hardness; rodent; Castor canadensis	BITE FORCE; CASTOR-CANADENSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RODENTIA; SIZE; GENERALIST; VEGETATION	Climate warming combined with intensive human activities are modifying ecosystems globally, and the Arctic biota is shifting substantially faster than the global average, allowing many new species to expand their range poleward. One such species, is the American beaver (Castor canadensis), a highly specialized rodent capable of greatly modifying ecosystems by altering forest composition through selective foraging and by flooding the landscape through dam and channel building. As rodent cranial morphology is highly related to its functional requirements for foraging and feeding, the beaver provides an opportunity to evaluate the phenotypic response of species to changing environmental conditions. Here, we test the hypothesis that beaver skull morphology is optimized for its local environmental and habitat conditions across Canadian ecosystems. We found that temperature, precipitations, biomass, and local average tree hardness significantly affect the morphology of key masticatory functional traits of the skull, but not its size. Our results suggest that the beaver's phenotype is locally adapted to environmental conditions as a result of its selective foraging behavior. This work provides insight into the adaptive potential of newly established beaver populations in the sub-Arctic to inform management strategies for this keystone species. More generally, our work emphasizes the need to consider traits other than body size in research seeking to better understand the response of species to current global change.

These natural events negatively affect asphalt pavements, submerging their layers and reducing structural resistance. This work introduces a computational finite element model suitable for investigating the impact of floods on asphalt pavement response. Unlike previous works, which consider a multi-layer analysis, in this research, the resilient modulus varies locally as a function of moisture, which could be variable in the transverse direction of the cross-section. The moisture distribution in the pavement structure is found by solving the Richards' equation through non-linear finite element analysis. This moisture distribution is coupled to the three-dimensional elasticity problem to find the structural response to traffic loads. The structural problem was solved using the semi-analytical finite element method. Results show that the reduction of the resilient modulus in the unbound and subgrade layers is heterogeneous, with the areas near the edges of the pavement being the most affected. It was also found that the increase in elastic surface deflection depends on both the load position and time, which suggests the damage caused by vehicles could be different for each wheel path, depending on the time in which the vehicles circulate. This research presents a valuable tool for evaluating the impact of flooding on asphalt pavement structures.

J	Thanh, HV; Dashtgoli, DS; Zhang, HM; Min, B				Thanh, Hung Vo; Dashtgoli, Danial Sheini; Zhang, Hemeng; Min, Baehyun			Machine-learning-based prediction of oil recovery factor for experimental CO2-Foam chemical EOR: Implications for carbon utilization projects	ENERGY			English	Article						CO2-EOR; CO2-Foam experiments; GRNN; CFNN-LM; CFNN-BR; XGBoost	NEURAL-NETWORK; CO2 STORAGE; MODELS; GAS; PERFORMANCE; PRESSURE	Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) using CO2 injection is promising with economic and environmental benefits as an active climate-change mitigation approach. Nevertheless, the low sweep efficiency of CO2 injection remains a challenge. CO2-foam injection has been proposed as a remedy, but its laboratory screening for specific reservoirs is costly and time-consuming. In this study, machine-learning models are employed to predict oil recovery factor (ORF) during CO2-foam flooding cost-effectively and accurately. Four models, including general regression neural network (GRNN), cascade forward neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt optimization (CFNN-LM), cascade forward neural network with Bayesian regularization (CFNN-BR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), are evaluated based on experimental data from previous studies. Results demonstrate that the GRNN model outperforms the others, with an overall mean absolute error of 0.059 and an R2 of 0.9999. The GRNN model's applicability domain is verified using a Williams plot, and an uncertainty analysis for CO2-foam flooding projects is conducted. The novelty of this study lies in developing a machine-learning-based approach that provides an accurate and cost-effective prediction of ORF in CO2-foam experiments. This approach has the po-tential to significantly reduce screening costs and time required for CO2-foam injection, making it a more viable carbon utilization and EOR strategy.

Green infrastructure (GI) have proved to be effective measures to address urban floods. Whether the GI layout can yield significant benefits and low investment cost requires further exploration. Besides, the type, size, and location of GI needs to be optimized to achieve better performance. A life-cycle evaluation framework coupled with a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) and SWMM was proposed for GI layout optimization. The framework took investment cost, economic-environmentalsocial monetization benefit, and runoff control capacity into consideration. Tongzhou District in Beijing was selected for empirical analysis. Simulation results reveled that GIs performed good in runoff control and the optimal layout under 10-year return period was recommended. The total cost and benefit of the recommended layout is 6.34x109 RMB and 8.36x106 RMB/Design rainfall, respectively, which outperforms than other scenarios. Permeable pavement accounted for the highest proportion in the optimized layout scenario. For actual construction, decision-makers should select appropriate measures according to local conditions (e.g., precipitation, land use type, cost of GIs) and choose the optimal layout scheme according to their preference. Results displayed can provide a reproducible and dependable planning scheme for future Sponge City construction in China.

Held from 29 June to 1 July 2021, this workshop was co-organised by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Copernicus Emergency Management (CEMS) and Climate Change (C3S) Services, the Hydrological Ensemble Prediction EXperiment (HEPEX), and the Global Flood Partnership (GFP). This article aims to summarise the state-of-the-art presented at the workshop and provide an early career perspective. Recent advances in hydrological modelling and forecasting, reflections on the use of forecasts for decision-making across scales, and means to minimise new barriers to communication in the virtual format are also discussed. Thematic foci of the workshop included hydrological model development and skill assessment, uncertainty communication, forecasts for early action, co-production of services and incorporation of local knowledge, Earth observation, and data assimilation. Connecting hydrological services to societal needs and local decision-making through effective communication, capacity-building and co-production was identified as critical. Multidisciplinary collaborations emerged as crucial to effectively bring newly developed tools to practice.

US Gulf Coast tropical cyclone precipitation influenced by volcanism and the North Atlantic subtropical high	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							SUMMER RAINFALL; MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; UNITED-STATES; RECONSTRUCTION; REANALYSIS; ERUPTIONS; RESPONSES; DATABASE; RECORD	Tropical cyclone precipitation on the US Gulf Coast is greatly influenced by the behavior of the North Atlantic subtropical high and volcanic eruptions as well as by Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, suggests a 473-year-long tree-ring proxy record. Understanding the response of tropical cyclone precipitation to ongoing climate change is essential to determine associated flood risk. However, instrumental records are short-term and fail to capture the full range of variability in seasonal totals of precipitation from tropical cyclones. Here we present a 473-year-long tree-ring proxy record comprised of longleaf pine from excavated coffins, a historical house, remnant stumps, and living trees in southern Mississippi, USA. We use cross-dating dendrochronological analyses calibrated with instrumental records to reconstruct tropical cyclone precipitation stretching back to 1540 CE. We compare this record to potential climatic controls of interannual and multidecadal tropical cyclone precipitation variability along the Gulf Coast. We find that tropical cyclone precipitation declined significantly in the two years following large Northern Hemisphere volcanic eruptions and is influenced by the behavior of the North Atlantic subtropical high-pressure system. Additionally, we suggest that tropical cyclone precipitation variability is significantly, albeit weakly, related to Atlantic multidecadal variability. Finally, we suggest that we need to establish a network for reconstructing precipitation from tropical cyclones in the Southeast USA if we want to capture regional tropical cyclone behavior and associated flood risks.

J	Kumar, MS; Umamahesh, NV				Kumar, Sagar M.; Umamahesh, N., V			Simulation of flood hazard, prioritization of critical sub-catchments, and resilience study in an urban setting using PCSWMM: a case study	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Compromise programming; Hyderabad; PCSWMM; Prioritization; Resilience; Urban storm	DRAINAGE SYSTEM; RISK; SWMM; HYDERABAD; IMPACT; GREEN	Due to the dual pressure of rapid urbanization and climate change, urban flooding has become more common. Thus, for effective planning and mitigation strategies, it is of paramount interest to quantify the generated runoff and prioritize the urban critical sub-catchments. The present study investigates flood inundation in Hyderabad urban setting (zone-XII, zone-IV&V) using the Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) and prioritizes the critical sub-catchments using the compromise programming method (CPM) and PCSWMM. In addition, the system resilience is examined by integrating PCSWMM with GIS. The model simulation is performed for a 264 h (11 days) rainfall event that occurred in October 2020. The outcomes from the simulation are found to be satisfactory and in agreement with the field water logging points (WLPs). The inundation map results are validated with social media markers (SMMs). The critical sub-catchments are prioritized based on PCSWMM by runoff results and CPM by considering WLPs, slope and impervious percentage of sub-catchments as input criteria. The Integrated 1D-2D PCSWMM is used to examine the inundation velocity and depth. An urban flood hazard (UFH) map is generated to identify optimal low impact developments (LIDS). Subsequently, the present study showed how storage can improve the catchment capability and resilience of urban settings to tackle the excess stormwater.

The case of natural hazards and disaster research	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Review							CROSS-SCALE INTERACTIONS; FLOOD RISK; RIVER-BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; VULNERABILITY; SCIENCE; RESILIENCE; CHALLENGES; SYSTEMS	Given the recent developments in socio-hydrology and its potential contributions to disaster risk reduction (DRR), we conducted a systematic literature review of socio-hydrological studies aiming to identify persisting gaps and discuss tractable approaches for tackling them. A total of 44 articles that address natural hazards or disasters were reviewed in detail. Our results indicated that: (i) most of the studies addressed floods, whereas few applications were applied to droughts and compound or multi-hazard events; (ii) none of the reviewed articles investigated interactions across temporal and spatial scales; (iii) there is a wide range of understandings of what "social" means in sociohydrology; (iv) quantitative approaches were used more often in comparison with mixed and qualitative approaches; (v) monodisciplinary studies prevailed over multi- or interdisciplinary ones; and (vi) one-third of the articles involved stakeholder participation. In summary, we observed a fragmentation in the field, with a multitude of social and physical components, methods, and data sources being used. Based on these findings, we point out potential ways of tackling the identified challenges to advance socio-hydrology, including studying multiple hazards in a joint framework and exploiting new methods for integrating results from qualitative and quantitative analyses to leverage the strengths of different fields of knowledge. Addressing these challenges will improve our understanding of human-water interactions to support DRR.

Remote sensing of the mountain cryosphere: Current capabilities and future opportunities for research	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Earth observation; glacier; satellite; technology; snow; artificial intelligence	DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIERS; FROM-MOTION PHOTOGRAMMETRY; UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS; MAPPING SNOW DEPTH; MASS-LOSS; SATELLITE IMAGERY; ALPINE TERRAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HETEROGENEOUS CHANGES; CORDILLERA BLANCA	Remote sensing technologies are integral to monitoring the mountain cryosphere in a warming world. Satellite missions and field-based platforms have transformed understanding of the processes driving changes in mountain glacier dynamics, snow cover, lake evolution, and the associated emergence of hazards (e.g. avalanches, floods, landslides). Sensors and platforms are becoming more bespoke, with innovation being driven by the commercial sector, and image repositories are more frequently open access, leading to the democratisation of data analysis and interpretation. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are rapidly transforming our ability to handle this exponential increase in data. This review therefore provides a timely opportunity to synthesise current capabilities in remote sensing of the mountain cryosphere. Scientific and commercial applications were critically examined, recognising the technologies that have most advanced the discipline. Low-cost sensors can also be deployed in the field, using microprocessors and telecommunications equipment to connect mountain glaciers to stakeholders for real-time monitoring. The potential for novel automated pipelines that can process vast volumes of data is also discussed, from reimagining historical aerial imagery to produce elevation models, to automatically delineating glacier boundaries. Finally, the applications of these emerging techniques that will benefit scientific research avenues and real-world societal programmes are discussed.

Our aim was to assess the change characteristics of wetland soil bacterial community and metabolic potentials under drought and flood conditions. Methods Wetland soil was incubated under five different water environments (including constant moisture at 30%, natural air-dried, and 3 types of flooding depths) by conducting experimental microcosms. After 1, 21, and 132 days of incubation, the soil bacterial community structure and metabolic potential were examined by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Biolog-Ecoplates method, respectively. Results The results showed that Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were significantly enriched under drought and flooding treatments, respectively. Compared to flooding, drought decreased soil microbial biomass and carbon metabolism more severely. However, the depth of flooding did not significantly change bacterial community composition and carbon metabolism. In addition, the responses of soil metabolic functions to drought were more sensitive than the change of bacterial community composition. When the wetland soil faced water stress (drought and flooding), its metabolic functions showed close correlations with bacterial community composition and were negatively affected by most of environmental factors (such as pH, NO3-N, and NH4-N). Conclusions The results indicate that the drying condition is more severe and rapid than flooding in threatening soil microbial metabolic activity. In addition, the depth of flooding does not significantly change bacterial community composition and carbon metabolism.

The rainfall trend-NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) relationship was examined to assess the extent to which rainfall affects vegetation productivity within Nylsvley, Ramsar site in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Daily rainfall data measured from eight rainfall stations between 1950 and 2016 were used to generate seasonal and annual rainfall data. Mann-Kendall and quantile regression were applied to assess trends in rainfall data. NDVI was derived from satellite images from between 1984 and 2003 using Zonal statistics and correlated with rainfall of the same period to assess vegetation dynamics. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator showed only one station had a significant increasing rainfall trend annually and seasonally at p < 0.05, whereas all the other stations showed insignificant trends in both rainfall seasons. Quantile regression showed 50% and 62.5% of the stations had increasing annual and seasonal rainfall, respectively. Of the stations, 37.5% were statistically significant at p < 0.05, indicating increasing and decreasing rainfall trends. These rainfall trends show that the rainfall of Nylsvley decreased between 1995 and 2003. The R-2 between rainfall and NDVI of Nylsvley is 55% indicating the influence of rainfall variability on vegetation productivity. The results underscore the impact of decadal rainfall patterns on wetland ecosystem change.

Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that coupled modeling approaches based on event sampling (short-term observations) may cope with the lack of observed input data. This study evaluated the use of storm events and flood-survey reports to develop and validate a modeling framework for flash flood hazard assessment in data-scarce watersheds. Specifically, we coupled the hydrologic modeling system (HEC-HMS) and the Nays2Dflood hydrodynamic solver to simulate the system response to several storm events including one, equivalent in magnitude to a 500-year event, that flooded the City of Tena (Ecuador) on 2 September, 2017. Results from the coupled approach showed satisfactory model performance in simulating streamflow and water depths (0.40 <= Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient <= 0.95; -3.67% <= Percent Bias <= 23.4%) in six of the eight evaluated events, and a good agreement between simulated and surveyed flooded areas (Fit Index = 0.8) after the 500-year storm. The proposed methodology can be used by modelers and decision-makers for flood impact assessment in data-scarce watersheds and as a starting point for the establishment of flood forecasting systems to lessen the impacts of flood events at the local scale.

While extensive research has been devoted to seasonal and multiannual time scales, we examined water level changes at time scales of minutes to hours. By applying impulse response functions to Lake Biwa and its catchment, we demonstrated that it is possible to (1) identify the effects of natural oscillations governed by the shape of the lake, (2) determine the precipitation retention time at the surface (above the impermeable layer) of the catchment, and (3) estimate how long it takes precipitation falling in catchment areas to reach the lake. Between 2010 and 2012 we recorded water levels at high frequency in the South Basin of Lake Biwa and calculated response functions between precipitation and water levels. We categorized the delay time determined from the calculated response functions as direct precipitation on the lake, seiches, and river inflow (surface flow, return inflow). We then identified the runoff patterns of surface and return flows by considering the time scale of the delay. The method used in this study enables flood predictions in cases involving heavy rain and appropriate planning of preventive measures against flood damage. These results will be valuable for the development of management strategies to respond to climate change in lake catchment systems.

Glacier retreat changes diurnal variation intensity and frequency of hydrologic variables in Alpine and Andean streams	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Wavelet analysis; Space-for-time substitution; Hydrological parameters; Stream hydrology; Glacier retreat; Diurnal glacial flood	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; MASS CHANGES; TIME; TEMPERATURE; BASIN; VARIABILITY; CATCHMENTS; STORAGE	The impacts of glacier mass and area loss are assumed to affect stream hydrology and related ecosystems. We applied wavelet analysis to high frequency time series of discharge, conductivity, turbidity, air and water temperature in mountain streams influenced by a gradient of diverse glacier catchment coverages from 0 to 28%. All parameters were recorded during 200-250 day period in 24 mountain streams in Switzerland and Ecuador. We interpreted the range of glacier coverage as a proxy of glacier melt effect linked to modification in glacier cover based on a space-for-time substitution approach. We used the diurnal variation power and frequency as hydrological parameters to quantify the intensity and occurrence of significant diurnal variations in the different mountain catchments. Our results show that the reduction in glacier cover would reduce the intensity and occurrence of diurnal variations in discharge, turbidity and conductivity, and the intensity of diurnal variations in water temperature. Discharge and conductivity were affected in a similar way, while the impact on turbidity was less significant. Furthermore, due to their different climatic regimes, the diurnal discharge in the tropical Andes was more impacted than in the Alps, indicating that the impacts of global change on glacier streams would be stronger in the tropical Andes than in the Alps.

These are discussed in relation to hydrometeorological hazards that trigger natural disasters, such as flash floods, landslides, and droughts, that affect the population and local economies. A review of the most updated literature on rainfall and extremes in the MASP shows a significant increase in the total volume of rainy-season rainfall during the last seven decades. While there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, these days have been occurring two to five times a year in the last 10 years. This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of watercourses, leads to inundation, flooding, and landslides. Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanization. There is ample evidence of an increasing risk of rainfall-related hazards in the MASP. This is particularly so for landslides in vulnerable areas. Exposure will continue to lead to risk increases. This calls for significant improvement in climate and disaster risk reduction and management efforts in the MASP region.

Despite the development of private flood mitigation measures to reduce damage from future floods, many flood-prone residents have been hesitant to implement them. This article aimed to identify motivational factors to adopt resilienttype flood mitigation measures, i.e., elevation and wet flood-proofing, by flood-prone residents. To achieve the aforementioned objective, an extended framework of flood mitigation behaviour was proposed in this paper, which was then applied to data collected from household surveys conducted in flood-prone areas of Australia. The data were analysed using logistic regression with the AIC backward stepwise approach to identify the key incentive factors. The analysis showed that flood-coping appraisal (evaluating private mitigation measures based on their effectiveness, cost and capability to implement) and prior flood experience were the primary factors influencing decision-making by flood-prone residents to adopt resilient mitigation measures. These findings offer valuable insights into flood mitigation behaviour and the uptake of private mitigation measures. The research outcomes will inform the development of more effective floodplain management strategies by policymakers and practitioners.

Integrated systems for rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse: a systematic review of urban water management strategies	WATER SUPPLY			English	Review						greywater reuse; minimization of wastewater; stormwater management; sustainable urban water systems; rainwater capture; water conservation	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; POTABLE WATER; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; DECENTRALIZED RAINWATER; SAVINGS; QUALITY; HOUSES; RUNOFF; GREY	Combined, decentralized systems for rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse may enhance the water security of urban areas by reducing dependence on the main water supply, in particular during critical periods, such as the dry season. They can also minimize the risk of flooding during the rainy season. The present study assesses the accumulated knowledge of these combined systems based on a systematic review of the literature restricted to academic sources. The review revealed knowledge gaps that must be resolved to better assess the optimum combination of rainwater and greywater recovery, how this affects the need for the treatment of the recovered water, its final quality, potential options for reuse, water economy, and the environmental and economic performance of the system. Further empirical studies are required to determine the most adequate design configuration for these systems, considering their multiple objectives, technological perspectives, and in particular, their potential for improving environmental shortcomings. There is a clear need for widespread use of low-impact technologies to ensure the most effective possible results. Water recovery systems will become increasingly important as a means of tackling the challenges of water supplies in the urban landscape, which are being exacerbated by climate change.	[Rodrigues, A.

The present study conducts a data-driven model for hourly urban rainfall-inundation depth prediction, which is based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network and uses the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm for the hyperparameter optimization of GRU, namely the SA-GRU model. To verify the performance of the proposed model, backpropagation, long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks are set as benchmarks. Results show that the SA-GRU has high accuracy in the case of short-term inundation prediction, with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency from 0.999 to 0.596 for the 1-h-ahead to 8-h-ahead predictions. And further research reveals that the SA-GRU integrates the significant optimization of SA, with an average 20% reduction of the root mean square error within the first eight prediction periods, and the efficient training speed of GRU, with 23.7% faster than LSTM and 44.2% faster than BiLSTM. In conclusion, the SA-GRU excels in urban inundation prediction, demonstrating its value in flood management and decision-making.

In recent decades, the scale of floods has become larger due to climate change. Under these circumstances, on 12 October 2019, the largest typhoon in the history of observation in Japan struck the Japanese Archipelago. This typhoon caused heavy rainfall in various places, and the Chikuma-Shinano River System (Japan's largest) suffered great damage. Eight years before the large-scale disturbance in the river system, the population structure of the mayfly Isonychia japonica was studied in detail using quantitative sampling (population numbers and biomass) and by sequencing the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. To understand the impact of the flood on the population and genetic structures, we repeated the same research approximately 1 year after the flood. Direct comparison of sites before and after the flood revealed no significant changes between pre- and post-flood population genetic structure. This indicates high in situ resistance and/or resilience recovery of the populations to the disturbance. We hypothesize that this high resistance/resilience to flood disturbance is a result of strong selection for such traits in the rivers of the Japanese Archipelago, which are short, steep, flow rapidly and violently, and are strongly affected by floods.

The instability of precipitation is an important factor in limiting wheat production potential under climate change. Therefore, it is essential to characterise the precipitation associated with different crop developmental stages. Based on climate data from 1999 to 2020 in six representative meteorological stations, we characterised the historical precipitation relating to seven key growth stages in winter wheat. There is no clear trend of interannual variation of precipitation for wheat season, with an average of precipitation of 414.4 +/- 121.2 mm. In terms of the distribution of precipitation grade within a season, light rain was dominant. Continuous rain occurred frequently during the pre-winter seedling and overwintering stages. The critical period of water demand, such as jointing and booting, has less precipitation. The fluctuation range of precipitation in sowing, heading-filling and maturation stages is large, which means that there is flood and drought at times. In conclusion, these findings provide a foundation for instructing winter wheat cropping in confronting with waterlogging and drought risk due to uneven precipitation in 'Yanhuai' region, China.

In the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, this challenge is being addressed by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the "Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment Mechanism' (SDLAM), an offsetting program seeking to achieve environmental outcomes using less water.Aims: We provide a critique of the legislated method for evaluation of the SDLAM and the suitability of the process for evaluating whether equivalent environmental outcomes have been achieved.Methods: Four project case studies, project documentation, external reviews and relevant legislation were used to assess the implementation of the SDLAM and the evaluation method.Key results: The SDLAM evaluation method is not scientifically rigorous. It excludes residual risks, Basin-wide impacts and climate change. The evaluation timeline is biased towards measuring infrastructure outputs rather than environmental outcomes and impacts. Conclusions: Flaws in the SDLAM evaluation processes mean that environmental benefits are likely to be overstated, risking further reductions in allocations of water for the environment, contrary to the objectives of the Basin Plan. Implications: Improved evaluation, including empirical data on outputs, outcomes and impacts, is needed to ensure that conservation objectives can be met for wetlands subject to SDLAM projects.

This paper evaluates the potential for storing water in the Bananal sedimentary basin and proposes the construction of canals to reduce sediment obstructions in the river flow and harmful flood events. This would allow for better control of the water level. The water stored in the sedimentary basin can be used as a climate change adaptation measure to ensure that the level of the flood plain is maintained high during a drought or low during an intense flood event. Additionally, the flood plain will function as a water reservoir, regulate the river flow downstream from the flood plain, and enhance hydropower generation. A significantly smaller reservoir area is expected to store water, as the water will be stored as groundwater in the sedimentary basin. Results show that the Bananal basin has the potential to store up to 49 km(3) of water, which can add up to 11.7 TWh of energy storage to the Brazilian energy matrix for a CAPEX energy storage cost of 0.095 USD/kWh. This is an interesting solution for the Araguaia basin and several other basins worldwide.

Households living in flood-prone areas suffer perennially. However, little scientific evidence exists on the relationship between impacts of flooding and coping strategies in Nairobi's settlements. In this study, primary data was obtained through ground-truth surveys and administration of questionnaires to 310 households in Nairobi's crowded informal settlements of Mathare Kosovo and Kibera Mashimoni. Information captured included their bio-data, knowledge and perception of flooding, socio-economic, susceptibility and recovery indicators. Secondary data was mainly from literature review. The findings of the canonical correlation revealed that an insignificant relationship of 0.2964 and 0.2503 existed between flooding impacts and coping strategies adopted by households and communities respectively. Floods caused inaccessibility of houses, workplaces and schools, damages to settlements infrastructure, drowning, diseases and displacement of residents. The indirect impacts were loss of livelihoods, environmental degradation, loss of manhours in traffic jams and economic loss. This study is novel in that it provides empirical scientific evidence on the nexus between impacts of flooding and coping strategies in an urban settlement. It augments existing literature on flood risks in urban settlements. It also provides an entry point for policy and decision makers such as scientists, private sector leaders, urban planners and government technocrats to make informed policy guidelines and intervention strategies.

Large-scale connection to deadly Indian heatwaves	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Arctic amplification; heatwaves; planetary Rossby waves; quasi&#8208; resonant amplification (QRA)	PLANETARY WAVE RESONANCE; EXTREME WEATHER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT WAVES; PROPAGATION; ATMOSPHERE; AMPLIFICATION; CIRCULATION; NORTHERN; REGIMES	In the present study, we analyse large-scale connections to deadly heatwaves in India in spring. Deadly Indian heatwaves occur in the spring months of April and May, and are increasing in recent years. These events are associated with the amplification of planetary Rossby waves. This amplification is called quasi-resonant amplification (QRA). An increase of amplitude or resonance occurs when stationary and moving waves coincide in their size. Previous studies stressed QRA's role in summer because persistent extreme weather events such as the 2003 European heatwave, the 2010 Pakistan flood, Russian heatwave, the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma heat waves, and drought occurred in summer. QRA seems to be related to the amplification of Arctic warming in winter and summer, but observations show that Arctic warming occurs in spring also. The novel aspect of our study is that we found strong evidence for QRA in the boreal spring, the season of Indian heatwaves. Amplified Arctic warming or Arctic amplification thought to be responsible for QRA occurs in spring also. Our results confirm that maximum surface temperatures in spring over India show predictability with high statistical significance, about 4 days ahead. Maximum surface temperatures can be used to predict heatwaves, as shown earlier by some authors.	[Rao, V. Brahmananda] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Espaciais, INPE, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Rao, K.

A mixed-method participatory approach comprising questionnaires, workshops, interviews with key stakeholders, and a systematic literature review were employed. Existing problems, discourses, FRM practices, and opportunities to enhance flood resilience were identified. They provided the basis for outlining potential research directions into ways of tracking these challenges. The results show how different actors perceive FRM in Ghana. The stakeholders interviewed have different, and even contradictory perceptions of the effectiveness of FRM, which are embedded in their diverse storylines. The findings show that Ghana's FRM is still reactive rather than preventive and that research in the field of quantitative hazard and risk assessment is still rudimentary. FRM policies and flood early warning systems (FEWS) are in place, but efforts should be directed towards their implementation and monitoring, investigation of social and technical capacity aspects, and enhancement of institutions' mandates, and coordination. Moreover, the findings illustrate that FRM is moving toward a more constructive engagement of citizens and stakeholders. However, policies and action plans need to consider more inclusive community participation in planning and management to effectively improve their resilience and develop sustainable solutions.

We argue that the possibility of violent conflict over contested international borders is not the region's primary international challenge. Rather, slow violence inflicted by state-building and militarisation, intimately connected to geopolitical tensions, threaten the region's ecologies, cultures and languages. The Himalaya is home to three biodiversity hotspots and a mosaic of ethnic groups, many of whom speak threatened languages. Its ice-deposits feed most of Asia's large rivers. In recent years, India and China have pursued large-scale infrastructure development in the region, enabling greater militarisation and extraction, and a tourist rush. These threats are amplified by climate change, which is occurring in the Himalaya at twice global averages, contributing to landslides, flooding, and droughts. However, the region's complexity is not matched by IR's theorisations, which overwhelmingly focus on the possibility of violent conflict between state actors. We argue that IR's analysis of the region must go beyond a states-and-security, Delhi-Beijing-Islamabad centred approach, to look at the numerous interconnections between its geopolitics, cultures and ecologies. We suggest this can be accomplished through incorporating more interdisciplinary analysis, and through focusing on the interaction between the organisation of political authority and the region's environment.

Interannual variation in filling season affects zooplankton diversity in Mediterranean temporary ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Cladocerans; Copepods; Hydroperiod; Lentic systems; Microcrustaceans; Rotifers	DONANA-NATIONAL-PARK; GENERATION TIME; EGG BANKS; COMMUNITY; TEMPERATURE; HYDROPERIOD; ASSEMBLAGES; EVOLUTIONARY; CLADOCERA; PATTERNS	In Mediterranean temporary ponds, the timing of annual flooding is highly variable and depends on heavy seasonal rains. Ponds can flood in the autumn, winter, or spring, and thus the environmental conditions faced by emerging zooplankton can be very different. We performed an experiment in a climatic chamber where we simulated annual variation in natural temperature and light conditions to study how differences in pond-filling season affected zooplankton assemblage composition. We sampled sediments from a temporary pond and placed them in aquariums that were filled with water during three different seasons: autumn (October), winter (January), and spring (March). Zooplankton abundance, species richness, diversity, and assemblage composition differed significantly among treatments, and post-inundation temperature and pH appeared to be the main drivers of these differences. Diversity was highest in the winter treatment. It was lower in the autumn treatment and the spring treatment, and no indicator species were present in the latter. Our results suggest that interannual variability in initial inundation conditions favours the emergence of different species and thus contributes to high species richness in the egg bank. However, climate change and/or groundwater drawdown could delay pond flooding, impoverishing the zooplankton assemblage in the long term.

Current planning approaches and policies should effectively deal with environmental challenges, especially when looking at the sustainable storm-water management. Policies for SUDS can find a fertile ground in performance-based planning which aims at achieving a set of planning objectives without imposing specific binding indications, but allowing for flexible solutions. Starting from the identification of a set of "performance-based criteria", this paper discusses different approaches concerning the adoption of SUDS in cities by examining various policy tools. Exemplifying cases of these policies application across international cities are reviewed to evaluate their prevalent performance-based character. The introduced criteria are also used to analyse criticalities, challenges and general implications about the implementation of the different kind of policies in new and existing urban developments. Results suggest that policies cannot be considered purely performance-based but rather have a hybrid character and can be implemented also under mainly conformative planning systems.

Because of the maladaptive outcomes of engineering-based hard coastal protection infrastructure, policy makers are looking for alternative adaptation approaches to buffer against coastal flooding commonly known as nature-based coastal adaptation (NbCA). However, how to implement NbCA under an institutional structure demonstrating 'inertia' to alternative adaptation approaches is a question that seeks scientific attention. Building on a case study derived from a highly climate-vulnerable Canadian province, this study shows how the entrepreneurial use of scientific information and institutional opportunities helped institutional actors overcome the inertia. Drawing on secondary document analysis and primary qualitative data, this study offers five key lessons to institutional actors aiming at implementing NbCA: (i) develop knowledge networks to help avoid uncertainty; (ii) identify and utilize opportunities within existing institutions; (iii) distribute roles and responsibilities among actors based on their capacity to mobilize required resources; (iv) provide entrepreneurial actors with decision-making autonomy for developing agreed-upon rules and norms; and (v) facilitate repeated interactions among institutional actors to develop a collaborative network among them. This study, therefore, helps us to understand how to implement a relatively new adaptation option by building trust-based networks among diverse and relevant institutional actors.	[Rahman, H. M.

Normalisation estimates losses from historical events in a common year, here ?season? 2017 defined as the 12-month period from 1 July 2017. The number and nominal cost of new residential dwellings are key normalising factors and post-1974 improvements in construction standards in tropical cyclone-prone parts of the country are explicitly allowed for. 94% of the normalised losses arise from weather-related perils ? bushfires, tropical cyclones, floods and severe storms ? with the 1999 Sydney hailstorm the most costly single event (AUD5.6 billion). When aggregated by season, there is no trend in normalised losses from weather-related perils; in other words, after we normalise for changes we know to have taken place, no residual signal remains to be explained by changes in the occurrence of extreme weather events, regardless of cause. In sum, the rising cost of natural disasters is being driven by where and how we chose to live and with more people living in vulnerable locations with more to lose, natural disasters remain an important problem irrespective of a warming climate.

These interact in multiple ways and can have tremendous impacts on populations proximate to or downstream of these initial triggers. High Mountain Asia (HMA) is extremely vulnerable to cascading hazard processes given the tectonic, geomorphologic, and climatic setting of the region, particularly as it relates to glacial lakes. Given the limitations of in situ surveys in steep and often inaccessible terrain, remote sensing data are a valuable resource for better understanding and quantifying these processes. The present work provides a survey of cascading hazard processes impacting HMA and how these can be characterized using remote sensing sources. We discuss how remote sensing products can be used to address these process chains, citing several examples of cascading hazard scenarios across HMA. This work also provides a perspective on the current gaps and challenges, community needs, and view forward toward improved characterization of evolving hazards and risk across HMA.

However, there are conflicts between the ecological landscape and the existing benefits such as irrigation and flood control, so it is necessary to build a decision-making model for the comprehensive value of the ecological operation of reservoirs. Taking a reservoir project which needs to satisfy multi-objective requirements as an example, this paper proposes a set of decision-making methods for ecological operation of built reservoirs based on improved comprehensive fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and constructs a multi-objective decision-making model and optimization strategy combination. Through case analysis in this paper, the improved comprehensive fuzzy evaluation method has a good effect on multi-objective decision-making of ecological dispatching of built reservoirs. The research shows that the combination strategy of improving the reservoir's water storage capacity and the water-saving supporting transformation measures has a good effect, which can reduce the waste of the reservoir diversion project and large-scale high-efficiency water-saving transformation project construction. It embodies the idea of water-saving priorities and space balance and has broad application prospects in the optimization of reservoir ecological dispatch.

However, compared to gradual climate changes, the impacts of weather extremes have been much less studied. An extreme flood struck Poyang Lake, China, a globally important wintering ground for waterbirds, in the winter of 2015-2016. The effects of the flood on waterbird richness and abundance at Poyang Lake was assessed by comparing waterbird survey data at nine sub-lakes before (2014-2015), during (20152016) and after (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) the winter flood. Flooding greatly influenced waterbird abundance, with the abundance of all birds and each bird group declining by 19.7-75.5% during the flood winter relative to their values during the previous winter. Total waterbird abundance increased rapidly to pre-flood levels 1 year after the flood, suggesting that flooding mainly influenced waterbird distributions by causing waterbirds to escape to adjacent refugia. The negative impacts of extreme flooding shown here indicate that caution should be exercised in planning for a dam at the outlet of Poyang Lake. The proposed dam might have the potential to create the extreme high water levels that are unsuitable for many waterbirds.

Environmental control of the present-day sediment export along the extratropical Andes	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Erosion rate; Andes; Glacier erosion; Climate change; Sediment	SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; THRESHOLD HILLSLOPES; CENTRAL CHILE; EROSION; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; DENUDATION; CATCHMENT; LANDSCAPE; RIVER	Understanding how the environmental factors that determine erosion operate is essential to know the past and future evolution of the Earth and adequately manage natural resources. In this work, the main controlling factors of the current sediment export in the western side of the extratropical Andes (20 degrees-55 degrees S) are investigated using multidecadal series of specific suspended sediment yields from 42 rivers, as well as land cover, climatic, cryospheric, topographic, seismological and geological data. Through an automatic selection of Generalized Additive Models based on predictability and complexity, it was found that the combined effects of extreme runoff, glacier cover and channel steepness explain similar to 90 % of the spatial variability of sediment export. The runoff effect varies from positive for hyper-arid and semi-arid settings to slightly negative for moderate and wet settings, probably because of an associated increase in vegetation coupled with a recurrence and magnitude of floods that becomes greater than the time it takes for the basins to generate sediment. Cryosphere and channel steepness influences were also observed on the average suspended sediment concentration, which is less associated with water availability and more associated with erodibility and sediment availability.

Thus, it is fundamental and crucial to investigate the dominant influencing factors for the mitigation of urban flooding. However, knowledge about the influence of building patterns on urban flooding remains limited. Taking Beijing, a typical megacity, as a case study area, we quantified the importance of building patterns and their interaction effect at the subwatershed scale using the boosted regression tree and geographical detector model. The results indicated that (1) the landscape shape index, slope, green space ratio and waterbody ratio were the most important influencing factors determining urban flooding, with a total relative contribution of 67.23%; (2) building metrics had a certain impact on urban flooding, and the sum of the relative contribution reached 21.03%; (3) the landscape shape index, slope, and green space ratio exhibited a combination of negative and positive correlations with urban flooding density; and (4) an enhancement effect existed between building metrics, especially the building congestion degree and building density. These findings provide quantitative insights on rational urban morphology planning which could be applied to improve stormwater management and promote urban sustainability in megacities.

Whilst research is starting to reveal the mental health impacts of flooding, it stops short of understanding the experience of being flooded and what this means in terms of understanding the F-word, flooding. Yet for flood communities, the emotional impacts of flooding can prevail for years, if not a lifetime. For people who have been flooded, flooding seeps into every facet of life. It removes the security and safety of home creating instead places of fear, stress, and anxiety. Within this paper we lay bare the emotional impacts of flooding, demonstrating the effect that home unmaking and the cyclical need for home remaking, has on individuals, their quality of life, and revealing the long-term emotional impact of living at risk of flooding.We finish by seeking ways to support communities living at risk of flooding, challenging current flood risk management policy, and identifying how it could be strengthened through understanding these emotional impacts. We propose supporting communities through the emotional turmoil of flooding can help provide hope and restore quality of life to those who live at risk of flooding.

Increased uncertainties in precipitation and runoff predictions due to climate change make this phenomenon more complex and dangerous. Bridge scour countermeasures should thus be more focused on decreasing scour formation around bridge elements. In this study, abutment scour under clear-water conditions with constant flow intensity was conducted and collars were tested as scour countermeasures around semi-circular end bridge abutments. The experimental study was performed in a rectangular channel with an almost uniform cohesionless bed material for 3 h with and without collars. Collars of various lengths located at different elevations around the abutments were tested to investigate the effect of collars on scour development. The results of the study showed that the scour depth decreased with increasing collar width and when the collar was placed below the bed level for a given abutment length. The results were compared with those of similar earlier studies to show the effect of abutment shape, size of the bed sediment and test durations on the development of scour depth around abutments.

After a large land area was allocated for flood control projects, livelihood resilience of resettlers became a great challenge. In this paper, Puyang County, Taiqian County, and Fan County, Henan Province, China, are chosen for a household survey. An index system to assess farming households' livelihood resilience is constructed. After that, regression analysis and variance analysis are adopted to examine influencing factors of resettlers' livelihood resilience. Results suggest the following: (1) Livelihood resilience of resettled farming households is on the whole lower than that of non-resettled farming households; (2) Response to policies, family scale, livelihood strategy, and skill training are major influencing factors of resettled farming households' livelihood resilience; (3) Compared with other types of farming households, livelihood resilience of farming households with land expropriated is significantly different. In order to enhance resettlers' livelihood resilience, the government should expand the application scope of follow-up support policies of reservoir resettlement, enhance capability construction of resettlement management departments, strengthen support for resettlers' employment, combine resettlement with rural revitalization strategy, and improve the social security system for flood control project resettlers.

J	Fitton, S; Moncaster, A				Fitton, Sarah; Moncaster, Alice			Social value, infrastructure and stakeholder engagement: a complex triangle	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						floods & floodworks; infrastructure planning; social impact	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK	Infrastructure is critical for the economic and social prosperity of society. Some large infrastructure projects are also critical for the future of society due to their intergenerational nature and long lifespan. Understanding the social value of infrastructure is therefore important to deliver a socially successful as well as technically successful project. Stakeholder engagement, in turn, is critical in understanding and identifying social value; however, the strength of this relationship is often underestimated during project development. The impact of this underestimation can be detrimental to a project. Using the case study of the Didsbury Flood Storage Basin Improvements Scheme in Greater Manchester, UK, this paper demonstrates how the stakeholder engagement process is intrinsically linked to social value preservation, creation and enhancement on infrastructure projects. It is argued that by investing time, resources and money in the stakeholder engagement process, the social value creation and enhancement on a project can be significant. If this investment is missing on a project, the social value perceived to be received by stakeholders diminishes. Therefore, this paper calls for a greater understanding of the interdependency between the stakeholder engagement process and social value, and a need for an appreciation of this relationship within the infrastructure sector.

Moreover, the Pearson type-III (P-III) distribution, the mixed distribution (MD) and conditional probability distribution (CPD) models are employed to analyse frequency and to calculate the design flood process line. The results showed that the annual maximum peak discharge and the annual maximum flood volume are most likely to change in 1993. The MD model considering the non-stationarity of the flood sequence is more accurate than the CPD model and the traditional P-III distribution model. There are significant differences in the design flood process lines of the 1996 typical flood process obtained by the three methods using the same frequency scaling method. In addition, under different design standards, the design value of the MD model is 20-53% smaller than the design value approved in 2008 (approved by China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute) and 4-48% higher than the traditional P-III distribution design value. The results can provide a new reference for the management of non-stationary floods in Manas River.

In this study, the vegetation successions of coastal wetlands in southern Laizhou Bay and the factors influencing the successions were investigated by quadrat survey. The changes of relative surface elevation and soil salinity in coastal wetlands of the study region were caused by climate change, sea-level rise, coastal erosion, sedimentation, neotectonism, storm surge, seawater intrusion, invasion of Spatina alterniflora, and utilization of underground brine. The changes led to the regressive vegetation succession of coastal wetlands without the protection of sea embankment and the progressive vegetation succession of coastal wetlands with the protection of sea embankment. The invasion of S. alterniflora resulted in the regressive vegetation succession of wetlands in the riparian zone. The successions weakened the coastal wetlands' ecological capacities of carbon sequestration, pollutant purification, and resisting marine disasters, decreasing their species diversity. Some measures were proposed to resist the adverse impact of successions, such as introducing passenger water, storing water in flood season, digging 200 hm2 of ponds, and planting Salix matsudana and Tamarix chinensis around the ponds.

J	Yalcin, M				Yalcin, Mustafa			A GIS-Based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Model for Determining Glacier Vulnerability	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						glacier retreat; GIS; MCDA; vulnerability analysis	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOUNTAIN GLACIERS; FREQUENCY RATIO; ENTROPY MODELS; OUTBURST FLOOD; AUSTRIAN ALPS; TIEN-SHAN; LANDSAT; RETREAT; REGION	Investigating the causes of the spatial heterogeneity of glacial changes offers vital information about glacial behavior and provides forecasting ability to define where glacier retreat may occur in the future. This study was designed to determine the spatial distribution of Agri Mountain glacier vulnerability. The main goal of the current study was to assess the forecasting capabilities of Geographical Information System (GIS)-based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for determining the location of the mountain glacier retreat. To estimate the glacier retreat, the following criteria were selected: elevation, aspect, slope, direction, and glacier surface temperature anomaly (GSTA). The entropy method was used for weighting the criteria for the evaluation of the vulnerable areas of the glacier. The results of this method clearly indicate a strong relationship between GSTA, direction, and elevation criteria and glacier retreat. The glacier vulnerability map was created by synthesizing criteria layers with their weights. The vulnerability map provided a consistency of 77.8% in the short term and 92.1% in the long term. In the study, the priority melting zones were determined and glacial retreat locations were forecasted in 10-year periods.

Internal aeration and respiration of submerged tomato hypocotyls are enhanced by ethylene-mediated aerenchyma formation and hypertrophy	PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM			English	Article							PROGRAMMED CELL-DEATH; CHLOROPHYLL-A FLUORESCENCE; ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS; OXYGEN-TRANSPORT; PLANT; RICE; TOLERANCE; RESPONSES; TRAITS; STEM	With the impending threat that climate change is imposing on all terrestrial ecosystems, the ability of plants to adjust to changing environments is, more than ever, a very desirable trait. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants display a number of responses that allow them to survive under different abiotic stresses such as flooding. We focused on understanding the mechanism that facilitates oxygen diffusion to submerged tissues and the impact it has on sustaining respiration levels. We observed that, as flooding stress progresses, stems increase their diameter and internal porosity. Ethylene triggers stem hypertrophy by inducing cell wall loosening genes, and aerenchyma formation seems to involve programmed cell death mediated by hydrogen peroxide. We finally assessed whether these changes in stem morphology and anatomy are indeed effective to restore oxygen levels in submerged organs. We found that aerenchyma formation and hypertrophy not only increase oxygen diffusion toward the base of the plant, but also result in an augmented respiration rate. We consider that this response is crucial to maintain adventitious root development under such conditions and, therefore, making it possible for the plant to survive when the original roots die.

The proposed algorithm simulates the flood inundation of overland flows and in metro stations for each designed scenario. It involves the following stages: (i) determination of the grid location and spreading coefficient and (ii) an iterative calculation of the spreading process. In addition, an equation is proposed to calculate the inundation around a metro station and to predict the potential inundation risks of the metro system. The proposed method is applied to simulate the inundation risk of the metro system in the urban centre of Shanghai under 50-year, 100-year, and 500-year rainfall intensities. Both inundation extent and depth are obtained and the proposed method is validated with records of historical floods. The results demonstrate that in the case of a 500-year rainfall intensity, the inundated area with a water depth excess of 300 mm covers up to 5.16 km(2). In addition, four metro stations are inundated to a depth of over 300 mm.

In the Densu Delta, west of Accra, multiple phenomena of global environmental change interact together, making adaptation a key strategy for dealing with the increased risk of urban flooding. Implementation of existing policies, however, is scarce. Here we analyse policy arguments concerning strategies to reduce and adapt to urban flooding in key policy documents and contrast them with practitioners' experiences of implementation in the Densu Delta. Two general mismatches in argumentation are identified that reflect the implementation gap in adaptation to flooding in the Densu Delta. These are a disconnected presentation of the causes, consequences and strategies in policy arguments, and the concealing of undisclosed premises. Undisclosed premises are shown not to speak to the conditions of implementation practice. Consequences for overcoming the implementation gaps are sketched out. The paper contributes to understanding of the implementation gap in adaptation to urban flood risk by applying a lens of argument to environmental policy analysis in an African context.

They target the reproduction of large-scale weather patterns at multi-year time scales by both recognizing the long memory of some components of the climate system, and explicitly including the evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations as an external forcing. This study illustrates the use of decadal predictions to determine the near-future storminess at regional scales. Specifically, the evolution of extreme storm surges and sea levels along the Atlantic Iberian coast is assessed. Present (1980-2016) and near-future (2021-2024) storm surges are simulated over the northeast Atlantic, forced by atmospheric reanalyses (ERA-Interim) and decadal predictions (MiKlip), respectively. Results are then statistically analyzed to investigate the short-term effects of climate change and climate variability on extreme surges and extreme sea levels. Surges will increase mostly in early winter, while tides are largest in late winter. As a result, the impact of the increase in storminess on the extreme sea levels and coastal flooding will be modest, and the growth in extreme sea levels will be dominated by the contribution of mean sea level rise.

Incorporating ecosystem services into comparative vulnerability and risk assessments in the Pearl River and Yangtze River Deltas, China	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Natural hazards; Social-ecological systems (SES); Indicator-based approach; Ecosystem services; Risk reduction and management; Analytic hierarchy process (Ao)	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; NATURAL HAZARDS; FLOOD RISKS; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; DISASTER; PROVINCE; IMPACT; AHP	Coastal river deltas face high risks from multiple natural hazards due to the combined effects of human activities, natural processes, and climate change. Vulnerability and risk assessments are essential for reducing and managing risks and, in the process, contribute to sustainable development. Despite adopting a social-ecological and multi-hazard perspective, previous risk assessments failed to achieve balanced consideration of both social and ecological sub-systems. To address this gap, we used an integrated risk assessment framework which incorporates the role of ecosystem services (ES) as a core component. A modular indicator library of ES indicators relevant to coastal river deltas was used to characterize multi-risks in the Pearl and Yangtze River deltas. Results indicate a higher risk level in the Pearl River Delta, with the key drivers of vulnerability and risk varying with scales. Visualizing hazard-prone and highly vulnerable areas facilitates the implementation of targeted management measures and policies to reduce disaster risks from natural hazards. Ecosystem services have been identified as important factors of the risk profiles, and their inclusion in risk reduction strategies ensures that policies can be put in place that allow ecosystems to provide services sustainably to communities.

We contribute to the literature by examining the factors that enhance rural households' disaster recovery capacities. We distinguish two main recovery outcomes: an income (economic) recovery and a housing structure (structural) recovery out- come. A Generalized Ordered Logit Model (GOLM) is employed where the recovery is determined by socioeconomic characteristics and coping mechanisms available to the households. The find- ings reveal that rural agricultural households adopted several measures in response to the flood. Migratory labor -based strategies significantly increased the likelihood of economic recovery one year after the disaster. Selling productive assets reduced the likelihood of recovery. Community -level coping strategies were not effective , as floods caused devastating effects on a large part of the village community. Poorer households were more constrained in their capacities to recover from disaster shock. However , there was evidence of community -level support in terms of labor exchange between households in close neighborhoods. Finally , the study finds that post -disaster public assistance was mainly provided to land-owning farmers rather than poor , landless agricul- tural households.

Future changes in temperature, precipitation, and runoff from 2021 to 2050 in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River were analyzed using a distributed hydrological model, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), under a future climate scenario. Simultaneously, future variation characteristics of extreme climate hydrological elements in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River were analyzed using extreme climate and runoff indicators. The research shows that the frequency and intensity of the extreme temperature warming index will increase, while those of the extreme temperature cooling index will increase and then weaken in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River under a future climate scenario. The duration of precipitation, the intensity of continuous heavy precipitation, and the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase, whereas the intensity of short-term heavy precipitation and the frequency of heavy precipitation will decrease. However, spatial distribution of flood in the upper reaches is different, and thus flood risk in the upstream source area will still tend to increase. Particular attention should be given to the increase in autumn flood risk in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River.

The environmentally sustainable conventional systems are feasible and cost-effective alternatives for revitalizing India's degraded water resource management. The solution to India's chronic water distress may be to merge the infrastructure efficiently with up-to-date rainwater harvesting methods such as storage reservoirs, injection wells, and sub-surface barricades. Research emphasis on rain-water harvesting is required to boost its contribution to a sustainable environment for agricultural and food production. Rain-water harvesting system plays a major role in climate change, though it will have less impact in arid regions. It reduces the uncertainty of domestic water in arid areas, and improves internal water safety. For the proper application of a rain-water harvesting system, effective socio-political policies and community mass awareness should be put in place. rainwater pools in large storage tanks during the rainy period, which helps to reduce flooding in low soil areas. Low cost and quick depletion of artificial groundwater would help to raise the depleting layer of the water table. The world's highest groundwater withdrawal is India, with population growth leading to an increase in water necessities, good withdrawal among several carriages of stakeholders, a danger of significant reduction in numerous Indian zones.

Due to the geographical and climatic environment, floods frequently occur in China. Rapid socioeconomic growth and urban sprawl in the past decades have significantly changed both exposure and vulnerability dimensions of flood risk in China. In response to high risks of flood, the Chinese government has adopted a series of effective measures, such as the "Spongy City" Program and building many large dams and reservoirs, and some measures have achieved significant results. However, there is still a lack of studies with an integrated view on analyzing the causes, socioeconomic impact trends, and disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures of flood risk in China in the past decades. Accordingly, this paper aims to fill in the gap and provides some new insights into China's contributions in DRR over the period of 1950-2019. Our results show that annual flood-induced fatalities and socioeconomic vulnerability to floods have significantly decreased in China, owing to a range of structural and non-structural measures. Nevertheless, China still faces the complex coupling effects of climate change and urbanization, and thus threats from extreme floods. In addition, China needs to further improve its flood risk management system.

This study addresses this gap by exploring the probabilities of exposure to floods (10-, 20-, and 50-year) and examining the relationship between vulnerable groups and flooding in Nanjing, an important central city on the Yangtze River. Statistical analysis is based on multivariable generalised estimating equation (GEE) models that describe sociodemographic disparities at the census-tract level. The results revealed that (1) highly educated people in the urban centre are more likely to live in areas with high flood risk because of the abundance of education resources, and employment opportunities are concentrated in the urban centre. (2) Natives in suburban areas are more likely to live in flood-prone areas due to their favourable ecological environments near rivers and lakes. (3) Women in rural areas are more likely to live in high-flood-risk zones because most of the men are migrant workers. These findings highlight the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies to reduce flood exposure, especially in districts with high proportions of socially disadvantaged people. The linkages between rural and urban areas need to be strengthened in order to reduce flood exposure.

Spatial patterns of benthic biofilm diversity among streams draining proglacial floodplains	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						proglacial floodplains; benthic biofilms; microbial diversity; 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons; climate change	BACTERIAL PRODUCTION; WATER SOURCE; VAL-ROSEG; ALPINE; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; SEDIMENT; ECOLOGY; HABITAT; CHRONOSEQUENCE; HETEROGENEITY	Glacier shrinkage opens new proglacial terrain with pronounced environmental gradients along longitudinal and lateral chronosequences. Despite the environmental harshness of the streams that drain glacier forelands, their benthic biofilms can harbor astonishing biodiversity spanning all domains of life. Here, we studied the spatial dynamics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic photoautotroph diversity within braided glacier-fed streams and tributaries draining lateral terraces predominantly fed by groundwater and snowmelt across three proglacial floodplains in the Swiss Alps. Along the lateral chronosequence, we found that benthic biofilms in tributaries develop higher biomass than those in glacier-fed streams, and that their respective diversity and community composition differed markedly. We also found spatial turnover of bacterial communities in the glacier-fed streams along the longitudinal chronosequence. These patterns along the two chronosequences seem unexpected given the close spatial proximity and connectivity of the various streams, suggesting environmental filtering as an underlying mechanism. Furthermore, our results suggest that photoautotrophic communities shape bacterial communities across the various streams, which is understandable given that algae are the major source of organic matter in proglacial streams. Overall, our findings shed new light on benthic biofilms in proglacial streams now changing at rapid pace owing to climate-induced glacier shrinkage.

Using the value transfer method, we obtained the economic valuation that represents the loss of coastal ecosystem services caused by sea level rise in Mexico. Using the Bathtub method, digital elevation models and sea level data, we identified the areas in the country prone to flooding and the associated ecosystem impacts. In Mexico, the annual economic loss caused by the disappearance of coastal ecosystem services is estimated at $6,476,402,405 USD, where wetlands represent the greatest economic losses, since they represent the largest affected ecosystem by area. However, beaches and dunes are the most valued ecosystem due to the economic activities that occur in these areas. In the mangroves, the service as habitat, refuge and nursery is the most valued for its positive relationship with fisheries. The states with the most economic losses are Baja California Sur, Sinaloa and Campeche. The protection of the coastal zone in Mexico should be a priority in the development strategies in the country because its loss and/or rehabilitation imply high economic costs and compromises the wellbeing of society.

Due to global warming and frequent natural disasters, natural disaster shocks have seriously affected farmers' livelihoods and aggravated relative poverty. Based on 5,804 rural household samples from the China Family Panel Studies, the impact of natural disasters on farmers' relative poverty was investigated using the logit model. In addition, the interaction terms between the impact and intensity of natural disasters, non-agricultural employment and productive investment were included in the model. The results show that: 1) Natural disaster shocks and natural disaster intensities had a significant positive impact on farmers' relative poverty. 2) Migrating for work and stable employment effectively alleviated the positive impact of natural disaster shocks and natural disaster intensities on farmers' relative poverty, respectively. 3) Productive investment weakened the positive impact of natural disaster shocks on farmers' relative poverty. 4) Scale management effectively alleviated the positive impact of natural disaster shocks on farmers' relative poverty, but the moderating effect of scale management was not significant in areas with high disaster intensities.

However, despite several hazard-oriented strategies already in place, to date there is still a lack of integrated approaches to actually preventing negative consequences induced by heavy rainfall events. Furthermore, municipalities across the world are still learning from recent episodes and there is a general need to explore new techniques and guidelines that could help to reduce vulnerability, and enhance the resilience, adaptive capacity, and sustainability of urban environments, considering the already predicted future challenges associated with climate variability. To address this gap, this paper presents the outcomes of the research project "Heavy Rainfall Checklist for Sewer Operation " which was conducted by IKT Institute for Underground Infrastructure, to involve all the stakeholders affected by pluvial flooding within cities, and implement a series of documents that can be adopted by municipalities across the world to support organizations and their operational staff in preventing problems caused by heavy rainfall incidents. More in detail, three different rainfall scenarios have been deeply analysed, and for each of them a list of specific tasks and suggestions has been provided for aiding decision-making.

Currently, our understanding of how hydrology in subtropical rivers with intermittent flow affects the structure and dynamics of aquatic communities is poorly understood. Here, we investigated how fish alpha- and beta-diversity patterns in intermittent channels in the lower reaches of the Okavango Delta respond to seasonal flooding and drought. Under low-flow conditions, ephemeral habitat had higher alpha-diversity, and this was influenced by a combination of fish aggregation and apparent transient legacy effects as habitat patches became smaller and more isolated. Investigation of changes in fish assemblage structure across different hydrological periods and habitat types showed significant species turnover when water levels fell, suggesting a strong influence from species sorting. During high-water periods, species assemblages were homogenized both at local and regional scales, suggesting a greater influence of mass effects. Our findings support hydrology as a major factor regulating diversity patterns in intermittent rivers of a major wetland in a semiarid region of subtropical Africa. We infer from these findings that maintenance of a relatively natural flow regime will be necessary for conserving aquatic ecosystem structure and function in this system.

Human-River Encounter Sites: Looking for Harmony between Humans and Nature in Cities	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						urban river; socio-ecological system; river culture; human&#8211; river relationship; river restoration	MODEL-BASED EVALUATION; BLUE SPACE; FLOOD RISK; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; RESTORATION; WATER; PERCEPTION	Human welfare depends on the health of nature. Decades of ill-conceived management practices caused a decline in the quality of human life, as well as in biological and cultural diversity. Simultaneously, they increased social and ecological risks. For instance, mismanagement of urban rivers jeopardizes their ecological health and ability to provide ecosystem services. While demands for responsible urban riverscape design that fulfill both human and ecosystem needs are increasing, explicit recommendations to achieve these ambitious goals are still lacking. We present a first attempt of a conceptualization of Human-River Encounter Sites for urban rivers that targets reconciliation between humans and nature within urban river corridors. It builds upon the River Culture Concept with literature reviews and experiences from river restoration projects. We identify six tenets that are important to develop guidelines for Human-River Encounter Sites: health, safety, functionality, accessibility, collaboration, and awareness. This paper presents how these tenets can collectively help to harmonize the needs of citizens and biota, and to mitigate the current urban river crisis. This contribution feeds the debate on sustainable socio-ecological management of urban rivers and provides guidelines for the implementation of future urban river restorations and management efforts.

To address this issue, this paper reviews measures currently in place and identifies possible control measures that can be implemented to aid preservation of coastlines in the future. Breakwaters present a unique opportunity to proactively address the impact of coastal flooding. However, there is currently a lack of research into combined hard and soft engineering techniques. To address the global need for developing sustainable solutions, three specific breakwater configurations were designed and experimentally compared in the hydraulic laboratory at Coventry University to assess their performance in reducing overtopping and the impact of waves, quantifying the effectiveness of each. The investigation confirmed that stepped configurations work effectively in high amplitudes waves, especially with the presence of a slope angle to aid wave reflection. These results provide a very valuable preliminary investigation into novel sustainable solutions incorporating both artificial and natural based strategies that could be considered by local and national authorities for the planning of future mitigation strategies to defend coastal areas from flooding and erosion.

This article inquires into what types of tools local governments tend to adopt for managing coastal flood risk and the factors that may be influencing these choices; in particular, factors related to hazard vulnerability and institutional capacity. Focusing on 40 diverse coastal communities in a study region in Canada, the study utilised data from the communities' Official Community Plans to characterise their approaches to managing coastal flood risk in terms of land use regulations, construction specifications, and/or structural flood protection tools. The data revealed considerable diversity in the portfolio of tools that the communities have adopted. Tool adoption was found to correlate strongly with hazard vulnerability; that is, communities with similar physical and socio-economic vulnerability conditions tended to take similar adaptation actions. For example, established communities with highly urbanised coastlines tended to rely on structural flood protection while suburban communities with semi-developed coastlines predominantly utilised land use regulations. Institutional factors such as resource availability and local leadership, which were operationalised using survey data, exhibited surprisingly little correlation with the types of tools that communities adopted.

Repeated Hurricanes Reveal Risks and Opportunities for Social-Ecological Resilience to Flooding and Water Quality Problems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; GLOBAL SURFACE-WATER; WEATHER EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; EUTROPHICATION; FLOODPLAINS; ADAPTATION; COMMUNITY	Hurricanes that damage lives and property can also impact pollutant sources and trigger poor water quality. Yet, these water quality impacts that affect both human and natural communities are difficult to quantify. We developed an operational remote sensing-based hurricane flood extent mapping method, examined potential water quality implications of two "500-year" hurricanes in 2016 and 2018, and identified options to increase social-ecological resilience in North Carolina. Flooding detected with synthetic aperture radar (>91% accuracy) extended beyond state-mapped hazard zones. Furthermore, the legal floodplain underestimated impacts for communities with higher proportions of older adults, disabilities, unemployment, and mobile homes, as well as for headwater streams with restricted elevation gradients. Pollution sources were repeatedly affected, including similar to 55% of wastewater treatment plant capacity and swine operations that generate similar to 500 M tons/y manure. We identified similar to 4.8 million km(2) for possible forest and wetland conservation and similar to 1.7 million km(2) for restoration or altered management opportunities. The results suggest that current hazard mapping is inadequate for resilience planning; increased storm frequency and intensity necessitate modification of design standards, land-use policies, and infrastructure operation. Implementation of interventions can be guided by a greater understanding of social-ecological vulnerabilities within hazard and exposure areas.

The 2016 Wuhan flood in the center of China utilized observations of non-scientists' from Internet media to capture the spatial distribution of urban flooding. Various sources in online news, blogs, bbs, and governmental websites were included. Independent flood-related factors such as rainfall, wetlands degradation, elevation, land use and land cover, curvature, slope, and normalized difference vegetation index were integrated into a logistic regression model to produce a susceptibility map. The feasibility and accuracy of this model was evaluated via comparison with official inundation maps and shortcomings of previous drainage system design. The accuracy assessment by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis estimated a success rate of 95.4%. This result shows that the data from mainstream media and public observations provide accurate and comparable information on flood occurrence at the urban scale. The assessment can be used to plan and design preventative drainage strategies for decision-makers. Finally, the limitations of Internet media as a new data resource for flooding risk assessment and future directions are discussed.

An evidence based approach to evaluating flood adaptation effectiveness including climate change considerations for coastal cities: City of Port Phillip, Victoria, Australia	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate adaptation; coastal; flooding; GPU based modelling; hydrodynamic model; sea level rise; urban drainage		Coastal cities provide a modelling challenge as surface flow is strongly affected by urban drainage networks and there is interaction between coastal and inland flooding. We present a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based hydrodynamic model coupled to a hydraulic network that integrates adaptation analysis in the context of current and future flooding. The hydrodynamic model is based on a finite volume implementation of the shallow water equations formulated for overland flow. The hydraulic network is based on a pressure relaxation method, and uses a GPU-based sparse matrix solver for computational speed. The integrated model is used for modelling potential combined coastal and catchment inundation and climate adaptation analysis for the City of Port Phillip, Victoria, Australia. The key outcome from the adaptation study was that resources spent towards adaptation infrastructure should be investigated in the context of sea level rise (SLR) at least for the next 50 years. The adaptation analysis identified "a tipping point" beyond a SLR of around 0.4 m (expected in the next 30 years) where conventional adaptation approaches will fail. This outcome has resulted in the City realising that significant changes in infrastructure for the region will be necessary rather than just incremental adaptation approaches to deal with future flooding.

At many locations, these events influence estimates of extreme value statistics (e.g., 100-year event), thus have important bearing on the sizing of flood protection infrastructure and, in general, flood risk management and preparedness. Consequently, a characterization of location specific and regional patterns in precipitation extremes and changes therein has salience for both scientific and engineering concerns. To this end, analysis of seasonal and annual maximum daily precipitation at 667 long-term stations across the eastern United States was pursued to ascertain recent changes in the extreme events over the 1950-2011 period. Three key results from this study illuminate less understood facets of recent changes in precipitation extremes: (a) an overall increase in the fraction of seasonal and annual maximum precipitation events linked to TCs, (b) a dramatic increase in the correlation between Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index and the leading principal component of extreme precipitation, and (c) changes in the spatial patterns of regions with highest TC-related risk for heavy precipitation.

Measuring individual vulnerability to floods in the lower and middle Grijalva River Basin, Tabasco, Mexico	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Exposure; Sensitivity; Adaptive capacity; Hazards; Floods; Individual vulnerability; Households	ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; DOUBLE-EXPOSURE; RESILIENCE; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; INDEX; HAZARDS	We built an easy-to-interpret individual vulnerability index to floods that is amenable for empirical testing and may be adapted to any perceived hazard or ecological setting. An individual's vulnerability value (Vi) was estimated from characteristics unique to him/her, added to those he or she shared with people sleeping in the same building, then by all members of his or her household and finally by all community members. Vi was obtained for 994 individuals living in 129 domestic units in 14 rural populations from three subregions in the Grijalva River Basin, Tabasco, Mexico. The Vi means of Wetland subregion communities were significantly lower than those of Mountain and Coastal Plain regions. Bivariate correlations allowed us to identify those variables that had a greater influence on the estimation of Vi in general, and which correlated most with Vi per region. Knowing which variables increased vulnerability allowed us to make policy suggestions to target each region's specific needs. We argue that this bottom-up approach gives the index a value that reflects individual conditions and interactions that affect vulnerability that other indices derived from larger aggregation-level data are incapable of providing.

In this study, daily isotope data of rainfall and runoff, as well as continuously monitored conductivity data from June to October in 2019 in-Laoyeling(LYL) watershed located in permafrost region of northeastern China were used to separate streamflow components through the application of two independent methods: isotope-based hydrograph separations (IHS) and the conductivity mass balance (CMB) methods. The results showed that stream water in a boreal forest watershed with permafrost of the Daxing'an Mountains is mainly composed of pre-event water. Although the IHS method is more sensitive and provides more details than the CMB method, the results of both methods show a similar trend. The average value of the young water fractions (Fyw) for those aged less than 65 days is 5.6%, while the mean transit time (MTT) was calculated to be 3.33 years. These findings enhance our understanding of the fundamental characteristics of runoff generation mechanisms and changes in runoff components in permafrost regions. Such knowledge is crucial for effective regional water resource management under the context of climate change, such as construction of water conservancy facilities and prediction of flood and drought disasters.

J	Dotse, SQ				Dotse, Sam-Quarcoo			Deep learning-based long short-term memory recurrent neural networks for monthly rainfall forecasting in Ghana, West Africa	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							PREDICTION	Ghana has witnessed major flood and drought events as a result of unpredictable climate conditions, affecting numerous sectors of the economy such as agriculture, mining, hydroelectric power, and so on. Forecasting rainfall on monthly or seasonal timescales will be critical in averting or mitigating the consequences of these natural disasters, particularly given the present danger posed by climate change. The suitability of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for monthly rainfall forecasting in Ghana has been investigated in this study. Both univariate and multivariate LSTM models are examined. The numerical results showed that the proposed models performed well in forecasting monthly rainfall in the selected locations across the country. There was no significant difference in performance between the two LSTM models. The values of coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 0.604 to 0.894, 0.352 to 0.679, 50.21 to 75.89, and 36.53 to 44.56, respectively, for the univariate LSTM model, and 0.693 to 0.890, 0.357 to 0.655, 42.10 to 77.04, and 33.07 to 58.60, respectively, for the multivariate LSTM model. The LSTM models' performance was compared to two standard machine learning models: support vector machine and random forest. Overall, the proposed LSTM recurrent networks outperformed the standard SVR and RF forecasting models. However, all the models (LSTM, SVR, and RF) considered in this study can be used to forecast monthly rainfall across the country with reasonable accuracy.

Millions of people reside in critical zones potentially exposed to such catastrophes. Despite this, a comprehensive assessment of mass movement exposure is lacking at a regional scale. Here, we developed a novel method of determining mass movement trajectories and applied it to the Himalayan Mountain ranges for the first time to quantify the exposure of infrastructure, waterways, roadways, and population in six mountain ranges, including Hindu Kush, Karakoram, western Himalaya, eastern Himalaya, central Himalaya, and Hengduan Shan. Our results reveal that the exposure of buildings and roadways to mass movements is highest in Karakoram, whereas central Himalaya has the highest exposed waterways. The hotspots of exposed roadways are concentrated in Nepal, the North Indian states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, the Union Territory of Ladakh, and China's Sichuan Province. Our analysis shows that the population in the central Himalaya is currently at the highest exposure to mass movement impacts. Projected future populations based on Shared Socio-economic and Representative Concentration Pathways suggest that changing settlement patterns and emission scenarios will significantly influence the potential impact of these events on the human population. Assessment of anticipated secondary hazards (glacial lake outburst floods) shows an increase in probable headward impacts of mass movements on glacial lakes in the future. Our findings will support researchers, policymakers, stakeholders, and local governments in identifying critical areas that require detailed investigation for risk reduction and mitigation.

These locations are significant hot spots for connecting the past to the present regarding human history. Throughout history, settlements have been established around wetlands and shorelines. For this reason, the most significant danger threatening coastal archaeological and historical sites is the risk of inundation due to sea level rise. Creating an inundation risk map could be beneficial for planning and conservation studies due to reasons such as the long duration of archaeological studies, lack of a qualified workforce, and budget constraints. To this end, inundation risk maps were created for five different scenarios with risk classes varying from very high to very low, considering global and local sea level rise predictions. The study evaluated 464 historic areas located on the Eastern Mediterranean coasts of Turkiye and Greece. The findings indicate that a significant number of archaeological and historical sites, such as Knidos and Delos, will be inundated even in the lowest sea level rise scenarios. According to the inundation risk map, 34 sites are at very high risk, 21 at high risk, 25 at medium risk, 26 at low risk, and 41 at very low risk of inundation.

However, despite the study of the role of biodiversity in multiple facets of freshwater ecosystems, the linkages between macroinvertebrates diversity and ecosystem functioning have not yet been well-assessed in eutrophication gradients of lowland river-floodplain systems. In this study, we have examined the relationship between macroinvertebrates diversity (species diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity) and macroinvertebrates biomass across the three typically featured eutrophication gradients: "MACROPHYTE, " "TRANSITION, " and "PHYTOPLANKTON, " of floodplain lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (China). Our results suggest that macroinvertebrates diversity in three different lacustrine conditions, biomass, and the relationship between diversity and biomass varied along eutrophication gradients. Functional richness and variance (divergence in taxon community) were the two important macroinvertebrate diversity indices, which accounted for the largest amount of variation in the biomass (63% in PHYTOPLANKTON lakes and 57% in MACROPHYTE lakes, respectively). We also found that the macrophyte coverage is more important than the relative abundance in maintaining the macroinvertebrates diversity and biomass in lowland Yangtze floodplain lake systems, while the relative abundance of macrophyte would change the BEF relationship. Our results demonstrate the functional performance of Yangtze River lakes, which would change with increased nutrient loading and decreased macrophyte coverage and would highlight the significance of the restoration of macrophytes to reduce nutrient loads.

Invertebrate traces include Archaeonassa fossulata, Arenicolites isp., cf. Arenituba, Beaconites isp., cf. Camborygma, Cruziana problematica, Diplocraterion isp., Fuersichnus isp., Helminthoidichnites tenuis, Lockeia isp., Palaeophycus striatus, Palaeophycus tubularis, Planolites isp., Rusophycus carbonarius, Scoyenia gracilis, Skolithos isp., Spongeliomorpha carlsbergi, Taenidium isp. and Taenidium barretti. Additionally, rhizoliths were observed. Six ichnoassemblages were distinguished: overbank facies with (1) Rhizolith ichnoassemblage in a low-energy floodplain environment and (2) Scoyenia-Palaeophycus ichnoassemblage in crevasse splay deposits. The fluvial ichnoassociation is of moderate ichnodiversity consisting of the following assemblages: (3) Arenicolites, developed under higher flow velocities of active channels, (4) Taenidium-Scoyenia, formed by the colonisation of inactive channels, (5) Arenicolites-horizontal meniscate burrows, reflecting a rapid transition between active and abandoned channels and (6) Lockeia-vertebrate footprint, formed in littoral lakes. The Aglegal and Irohalene members indicate climatic shifts between arid dry, semiarid and subhumid in a dryland river environment. The sudden onset and the high frequency of lacustrine deposits in the lower Irohalene Member point to a rapid climate change from dry to intermittent wet and dry. This change is discussed in terms of the Carnian Pluvial Event.

Case Study on the Lower Danube River	WETLANDS			English	Article						Wetlands; Surface-water; Drought; Time series; Landsat; Danube	WATER INDEX NDWI; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROJECTS; FLOODPLAINS; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS; REGIME	To better understand the outcomes of river restoration, our paper analyzes the variability of the water content in a restored riparian wetland. We focused our demonstration on the case study of the Babina Islet located in the northern Danube Delta. This site was restored in 1994 by opening levees to regain the pristine hydrological regime with both flooding and dry phases depending on the water level of the Danube River. We monitored the wetland by using the Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI) estimated on Landsat scenes for the period 1984-2020. When compared to pre-restoration conditions, we found an increase of the surface-water area. The maximum surface-water area corresponded to the restoration works. Post-implementation of the restoration solution in 1994, the surface-water area is decreasing. The surface-water area pre-restoration is smaller than the surface-water area in present-day conditions, similar to the control site (Small Islet of Braila), thus confirming the role of hydrology in maintaining the effects of restoration works. Moreover, we detected the increase of drought area since 1984 on both the restored and the control site. This finding appears to be a new challenge for restoring the riparian wetlands of the Lower Danube River. Our paper recommends the use of standardized indicators via satellite remote sensing to understand riparian wetlands functioning at large scale, which could help to design a coherent strategy of river restoration.

More than half of global flood destruction and damages occur in the Asia region, which causes losses of life, damage infrastructure, and creates panic conditions among the communities. To provide a better understanding of flood hazard management, flood vulnerability assessment is the primary objective. In this case, vulnerability is the central construct in flood analysis and assessment. Many researchers have defined different approaches and methods to understand vulnerability assessment and how geographic in-formation systems assess the flood vulnerability and their associated risk. Geographic information systems track and predict the disaster trend and mitigate the risk and damages. This study systematically reviews the meth-odologies used to measure floods and their vulnerabilities by integrating geographic information system. Articles on flood vulnerability from 2010 to 2020 were selected and reviewed. Through the systematic review method-ology of five research engines, the researchers discovered a difference in flood vulnerability assessment tools and techniques that can be bridged by integrating high-resolution data with a multidimensional vulnerability meth-odology. The study reviewed several vulnerability components and directly examined the shortcomings in flood vulnerability approaches at different levels. The research contributed that the indicator-based approach gives a better understanding of vulnerability assessment. The geographic information system provides an effective environment for mapping and precise analysis to mitigate the flood disaster.

However, advancing global implementation is hampered by the lack of comprehensive understanding of GHGs and IRR reduction benefits without compromising rice yield. Here, we present the largest observational data set for such effects as of yet. By using Random Forest regression models based on 636 field trials at 105 globally georeferenced sites, we identified the key drivers of effects of non-continuous flooding practices and mapped maximum GHGs or IRR reduction benefits under optimal non-continuous flooding strategies. The results show that variation in effects of non-continuous flooding practices are primarily explained by the UnFlooded days Ratio (UFR, that is the ratio of the number of days without standing water in the field to total days of the growing period). Non-continuous flooding practices could be feasible to be adopted in 76% of global rice harvested areas. This would reduce the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2O combined from rice production by 47% or the total GWP by 7% and alleviate IRR by 25%, while maintaining yield levels. The identified UFR targets far exceed currently observed levels particularly in South and Southeast Asia, suggesting large opportunities for climate mitigation and water use conservation, associated with the rigorous implementation of non-continuous flooding practices in global rice cultivation.

To mitigate climate-induced production losses, various stress-tolerant varieties have been developed and adopted in many countries around the globe. We assess the impacts of adopting submergence-tolerant (Sub1) rice varieties on productivity, profit, and rice consumption in northwest Bangladesh, using Endogenous Switching Regression and cross-sectional data in 2016. The findings reveal that the adoption of Sub1 rice had a significant positive impact on yield (6.0% higher), profit (55.0% higher), and rice consumption (15.0% higher) vis-`a-vis the impact on nonadopters. Importantly, non-adopters could benefit if they adopted Sub1 rice-with about 8%, 48%, and 15% more rice yield, profit, and rice consumption, respectively. The findings further reveal that approximately 42% of the sampled farmers adopted Sub1 rice in northwest Bangladesh. The main drivers of this adoption are access to information on Sub1 rice through neighbors, farmer organizations, and training. Also, the application of pesticides and irrigation negatively affected the adoption of Sub1 rice. Finally, we find that rice production, profit, and rice consumption are location dependent. Therefore, we suggest implementing location-specific policies and developing social and institutional capacity to build trust in the new technology, which will increase the dissemination of Sub1 seeds by transferring agricultural knowledge and incentivizing farmers to adopt Sub1 rice in flood-prone areas in Bangladesh.

New geomorphological and archaeological evidence for drainage evolution in the Luangwa Valley (Zambia) during the Late Pleistocene	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Fan deposits; Landscape dissection; Stone Age archaeology; Late Quaternary; Luangwa Valley; Zambia	ALLUVIAL-FAN; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; LAKE MALAWI; STONE-AGE; CLIMATE; AFRICA; BASIN; NORTH; SEDIMENTS; CLASSIFICATION	This is the first systematic investigation of two distinctive geomorphological features recorded in the central Luangwa River valley, Zambia. A series of low hills was found to be capped by thin (-1 m) gravel deposits containing stratified Stone Age artefacts. More widespread gravels occur on the margins of the Luangwa River flood plain lacking stratified artefacts. The previously unreported hilltop deposits are interpreted as remnants of a dissected land-surface, and the valley floor gravels as redeposited clasts from c. 20 m of down-cutting. Clast analysis and drainage basin size analysis support a hypothesis of gravel deposition by unconstrained debris flows from the distant Muchinga escarpment, or from an intermediate zone. Excavation of a perched deposit revealed a coarsely stratified Stone Age record indicating periodic emplacement of artefact-bearing gravels over an extended period. Deposition of these perched gravels continued into the Late Pleistocene (-77 ka), based on OSL dating, after which the current dissected landscape formed. We hypothesize further, based on a regional record of landscape instability and core data from Lake Malawi, that fan formation in the valley was linked to periods of extended aridity and reduced vegetation cover followed by episodic erosional events on the return to wetter conditions. We argue that the subsequent dissection of the land-surface is the end state of a sequence of responses to base-level changes and climate change. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present study examines the spatiotemporal changes in rainfall pattern and its effect on the hydrological regime of a tropical monsoon dominated region in Western Ghats, India. New hydrological insights for the region: Weakening of monsoon rains was observed in the region, with decreasing trend in monsoon season, increasing trend in pre-monsoon season as well as an accelerated change in rainfall pattern during the recent decades. Monsoon droughts are becoming more prominent as evidenced the increasing trend in total number of dry and prolonged dry spells. Seasonality Index of rainfall consistently showed decreasing trend indicating that the rainfall distribution is becoming more symmetric over the years. No significant relationship was observed between ENSO events and rainfall characteristics indicating that ENSO episodes do not considerably affect the variability of rainfall in the region. Effect of changes in rainfall characteristics have a strong bearing on the hydrological regime of the region, which was evident in the declining trend of streamflow and groundwater level. The study calls for a revised plan for water management, adaptive cropping pattern and reservoir operations in the state of Kerala.

However, the EWF is biased and underdispersive, and therefore cannot be directly used to build ESP. The skillful forecast lead time of EWF in ESP needs to be determined, and the uncertainty of hydrological models is also nonnegligible. In this study, raw meteorological forecasts are corrected by the generator-based postprocessing method (GPP), the skillful forecast lead time of EWF is determined by comparison with a historical resampling method, and hydrological model uncertainty is investigated using Bayesian model average. The results indicate that GPP can significantly reduce bias and improve dispersion. With a superior postprocessing method, the skillful forecast lead times are 9 and 14 lead days for precipitation and temperature, respectively. With the synthetic effects of precipitation and temperature, the ESP has a skillful forecast lead time for around 10 lead days in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic metrics. However, the skillful lead time may be shortened to 5 days for flood season streamflow predictions. In addition, the hydrological model is an important source of uncertainty in ESPs, especially when evaluating ESPs in terms of probabilistic metrics. The ESP based on a combination of multiple hydrological models outperforms that based on a single model. Overall, this study indicates that the combination of postprocessed EWFs and multiple hydrological models is an effective approach for ESPs.

To tackle the growing threats, it is crucial to understand urban surface flood resilience, i.e., how urban drainage catchments can resist against and recover from flooding. This study proposes a grid cell based resilience metric to assess urban surface flood resilience at the urban drainage catchment scale. The new metric is defined as the ratio of the number of unflooded grid cells to the total grid cell number in an urban drainage catchment. A two-dimensional Cellular Automata based model CADDIES is used to simulate urban surface flooding. This methodology is demonstrated using a case study in Dalian, China, which is divided into 31 urban drainage catchments for flood resilience analysis. Results show the high resolution resilience assessment identifies vulnerable catchments and helps develop effective adaptation strategies to enhance urban surface flood resilience. Comparison of the new metric with an existing metric reveals that new metric has the advantage of fully reflecting the changing process of system performance. Effectiveness of adaptation strategies for enhancing urban surface flood resilience is discussed for different catchments. This study provides a new way to characterize urban flood resilience and an in-depth understanding of flood resilience for urban drainage catchments of different characteristics, and thus help develop effective intervention strategies for sustainable sponge city development.

Spatial climatic features in China spanning this time period suggest a generally cold-dry setting. This is evidenced by 130 well-dated geological records at 97 sites located in climatically and topographically diverse regions, with occurrences of some extreme hydrological events like severe floods in the Chinese Loess Plateau, and in basins of the lower Yellow River and the middle-to-lower Yangtze River. The weakening of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) since the mid-Holocene would have made Neolithic subsistence living unfavourable by decreasing the warmth and wetness in arid and semi-arid regions. However, it might not have been the sole factor that destroyed the Neolithic cultures in the vast territories of China ca. 4000 cal. yr BP. Environmental alterations in the major cultural territories of China reacted in response to precipitation anomalies caused by high variability of the ASM and the westerlies, which were modulated by centennial- to inter-annual- scale driving factors such as solar insolation, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO). This most likely accounted for the nearly synchronous Chinese Neolithic cultural collapses.

In a novel set of mobile bed laboratory experiments with variable discharge, we demonstrate that vegetation colonization affects bank erosion rates, channel shape, channel sinuosity, and bar pattern. Our analyses compared the morphological evolution of channels with initially steady bars considering the following three scenarios: (1) channel without vegetation, (2) channel with vegetation added to the floodplains, and (3) channel with vegetation added to both the floodplains and the bar surfaces that emerge at low flows. Absence of vegetation produced the widest and shallowest channel with the lowest sinuosity. Floodplain vegetation in the second scenario reduced bank erosion and resulted in a deeper and more sinuous channel with shorter bars. In the third scenario, vegetation establishment on emerging bar surfaces intensified erosion on the opposing bank, enlarging the amplitude of bends. Enhanced sedimentation on vegetated bar areas increased both bar elevation and bar length compared to the second scenario. The results show that the colonization of bar surfaces by plants creates the conditions for new floodplain and island formation, fostering channel meandering and anabranching. Finally, our experiments emphasize the role of alternating high and low flows on the morphological development of streams mediated by vegetation.

J	Khalafzai, MAK; McGee, TK; Parlee, B				Khalafzai, Muhammad-Arshad K.; McGee, Tara K.; Parlee, Brenda			Flooding in the James Bay region of Northern Ontario, Canada: Learning from traditional knowledge of Kashechewan First Nation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Kashechewan First Nation; Indigenous Peoples; Canada; Participatory techniques; Traditional knowledge; Climate change	DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; TRENDS; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK; BREAKUP; DEBATE; DATES	Traditional Knowledge has the potential to increase our understanding of many kinds of ecological phenomenon including floods. This article offers insights into the nature of spring flooding and its impacts in the southwestern James Bay region of northern Ontario, Canada from the perspectives of residents of Kashechewan First Nation. This article highlights the important contribution of Kashechewan First Nation's traditional knowledge to understanding and reducing disaster risks in this flood-prone region. Through a collaboration with Kashechewan First Nation, traditional knowledge was documented in 2016 during 17 in-depth interviews, participatory flood mapping workshops, on-site walks, and photography. The results of this study show that spring flooding has occurred seasonally over many generations in the region and has not increased significantly over time. However, the timing and extent of spring flooding has changed in recent years with warming temperatures in the region (i.e., earlier spring, snowmelt, and rapid runoff) and impacts are exacerbated by landscape and resource developments (e.g., inadequate infrastructure, substandard ring-shaped dyke wall, and downriver winter ice road) which have increased the frequency and scale of spring ice breakup and ice jams. These ecological changes have created the increased risk of flooding for the community of Kashechewan. The methodological approach which used participatory techniques may be useful for ongoing flood monitoring and disaster risk reduction activities in southwestern James Bay and elsewhere among the Canadian Indigenous communities.

Bivariate Flood Frequency Analysis of Nonstationary Flood Characteristics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bivariate frequency analysis; Flood characteristics; Nonstationarity; Physical covariate	NON-STATIONARITY; RETURN PERIOD; RESERVOIR INDEXES; EXTREME RAINFALL; RIVER; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; RISK; DESIGN; SERIES	Modeling the simultaneous behavior of flood characteristics, namely peak, volume, and duration, is essential for water resource planning and management. A multivariate probability approach, which provides a comprehensive understanding of flood characteristics and their relationship, may estimate flood magnitude more accurately than a univariate approach. Most previous studies related to the multivariate frequency analysis of extreme events assumed temporal stationarity. However, several recent studies show that flood characteristics exhibit nonstationary behavior due to climate change, urbanization, land-use change, or water resource structures. Therefore, it is necessary to perform multivariate frequency analysis in a nonstationary condition. In this study, nonstationary bivariate models, where the parameters of the marginal distribution vary with possible physical covariates (i.e., precipitation, urbanization, and deforestation), are developed to understand/model the nonstationary behavior of the flood characteristics of the Dongnai River in Vietnam. This study indicates that the assumption of temporal stationarity in flood characteristics leads to an underestimation of flood risk. For example, the flood characteristics' quantiles estimated for a 50-year return period in a stationary condition is nearly equal to flood characteristics' quantiles estimated for a 10-year return period in a nonstationary condition. Specifically, the volume and peak pair calculated for a nonstationary condition for the 10-year joint return period (OR) is (625.8, 147.8). The volume and peak pair calculated for a stationary condition for the 50-year joint return period (OR) is (620.1, 148.8). (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Dong, N. Dang; Jayakumar, K.

In the Brazilian Amazon, the most frequent extreme events are linked to droughts and floods. This study expanded the documentation on extreme events of floods, water crisis, fires and forest fires in the state of Acre, in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We analyzed extreme weather events in state and municipal state -of-emergency and public-calamity decrees, reports of people who faced the impacts of these events, scientific articles, and press reports. The results show that the state of Acre recorded 202 extreme events between 1987 and 2023, with an increasing trend in the number and occurrence of various types of extreme events in the same year since 2010. Twenty-one state-of-emergency and public-calamity decrees were issued, with flood events being the most frequent. The cities of Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul recorded 14 and 21 extreme events, respectively, or approximately one event every two years. These data show the urgency of implementing actions to adapt to climate extremes. Starting in 2005, the annual results indicate an increase in municipalities (counties) experiencing more than one type of extreme event, pointing to the need for effective public policies for adaptation and mitigation in the state of Acre.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda. on behalf of Associa??o Brasileira de Ci?ncia Ecol?gica e Conserva??o.

In this study, we examined the potential benefits of multi-zone riparian buffers with outer layers planted in perennial crops (i.e., partially harvested buffers). This was accomplished by developing a simplified regional modeling tool, BioVEST, which was applied in the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA. Our analysis revealed that a substantial por-tion of variable costs to produce biomass for energy can potentially be offset by values provided by ecosystem services from partially harvested riparian buffers. Ecosystem services were monetized and found to represent a substantial frac-tion (median =-42%) of variable crop production cost. Simulated water-quality improvements and carbon benefits generally occurred where buffer area was available, but hotspots occurred in different watersheds, suggesting potential trade-offs in decisions about buffer locations. A portion of buffers could be eligible for ecosystem service payments under US government incentive programs. Partially harvested buffers could represent a sustainable and climate -resilient part of multi-functional agricultural landscapes, and one that could become economically viable if farmers are able to reap the value of providing ecosystem services and if logistical challenges are resolved. Our results suggest that payments for ecosystem services can close the gap between what biorefineries are willing to pay and what land-owners are willing to accept to grow and harvest perennials along streams.

Analyzing historical development trends to predict future hurricane vulnerability in Tampa, Florida	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Urban vulnerability; GIS; Hazards; Planning; Flooding	DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; SEA-LEVEL RISE; URBAN VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME HEAT; RESILIENCE; HAZARD; ADAPTATION; GIS; INFRASTRUCTURES	There is a growing consensus that urban areas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of large-scale disasters. Not only are many urban areas located in high-risk regions (e.g., coastlines), but urbanity can exacerbate the negative impacts of many disasters. For example, high population densities expose more individuals to disaster impacts, and urban service provision relies on complex, interrelated systems prone to failure. It is possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities through urban planning, including regulations to limit high-density development in risky areas, but such decisions often run counter to local development efforts. Using Tampa, Florida, as a case study, we utilize a high-resolution methodological approach for tracking commercial and residential development related to potential hurricane strikes and storm surge flooding. Specifically, we use 16 consecutive years of parcel development data for the area alongside simulated hurricane storm surges to determine historical, present, and likely-future flooding vulnerability. Our findings indicate that the Tampa region continues to develop high-risk land which is likely to face significant damage from future hurricanes. This damage includes large tracts of commercial and residential land in high-risk areas along the coast and near inland bodies of water. The value of this study is providing a conceptual and operational framework for evaluating small (incremental) planning decisions made over space and time. When evaluated with a similar set of criteria, the results of this analysis suggest that unintended patterns of vulnerability emerge.	[Helderop, Edward; Grubesic, Tony H.

Parameter estimation for models of major rainfall induced floods in ungaged mountain basins of Colorado	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Colorado; Mountains; Hydrologic modeling; Ungaged basins; Parameter estimation; Soil moisture accounting; Extreme rainfall	SAN-JUAN MOUNTAINS; WATER REPELLENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RUNOFF; FLOW; PRECIPITATION; CALIBRATION; NEXRAD; RANGE; REGIONALIZATION	Study region: Rocky Mountains in Colorado including Front and San Juan ranges Study focus: Hydrologic modeling of ungaged mountain basins plays an important role in ensuring the safety of Colorado's dams. Recent research has shown that infiltration-excess runoff, saturation-excess runoff, and subsurface stormflow can all contribute to streamflow generated by extreme rainfall in Colorado's mountains, and the soil moisture accounting (SMA) method in HEC-HMS has been suggested as an appropriate approach to model these mechanisms. However, SMA requires estimation of parameters that have not been previously considered for large floods. The objective of this work is to develop methods to estimate SMA parameters for modeling the response to extreme rainfall in ungaged mountain basins of Colorado where calibration to observed discharges is not possible. New hydrological insights for the region: The proposed parameter estimation methods are tested for five basins in the Front Range and three basins in the San Juan Range that have streamflow data available for major flood events. For these historical events, the proposed uncalibrated models produce the same streamflow generation processes as calibrated models, and the predicted peak discharges from the uncalibrated models usually have 25% errors or smaller. For design storms, the peak discharges from the uncalibrated models can differ substantially from the peak discharges from calibrated models but are conservative relative to the envelope of observed peak discharges.

Beyond coastal protection: A robust approach to enhance environmental and social outcomes of coastal adaptation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Sustainable adaptation; SLR; Eco-engineering; Sustainability; Multi-use	SEA-LEVEL RISE; NATURAL ROCKY SHORES; ECOLOGICAL ENHANCEMENT; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; ARTIFICIAL REEF; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTERTIDAL HABITATS; ARMORED SHORELINES; INFRASTRUCTURE; EROSION	Hard coastal protective infrastructure, such as breakwaters, are a common adaptation strategy to protect assets, increase safety and improve navigation by reducing erosion and flood risks along coastlines globally. However, protective structures can have pervasive impacts on use patterns, aesthetics and associated ecosystems, threatening ecosystem goods and services upon which humans depend. Guided by a recent Australian state Government strategy that aims to plan for "a healthy coast and sea managed for the greatest wellbeing of the community, now and into the future", we present a decision-making support tool for practitioners to help achieve more sustainable solutions to coastal adaptation into the future. Sustainable coastal adaptation needs to consider the environmental and socio-economic consequences of hard protective infrastructure, as well as the increased vulnerability due to rising sea levels. To demonstrate our arguments, we introduce three different coastal scenarios. We also discuss alternatives to coastal protection and make scenario-specific recommendations to enhance environmental and socio-economic outcomes of coastal adaptation. In general, the implementation of hard protective infrastructure should probably be a last resort after retreat and soft approaches have been ruled out as viable options. Where protective infrastructure is the current best option, environmental and socioeconomic outcomes can be enhanced using eco-engineering and multi-use features. In the long term, however, retreat from some coastal areas may be necessary and existing infrastructure might be removed or abandoned.

J	Rudge, K				Rudge, Kieren			Participatory climate adaptation planning in New York City: Analyzing the role of community-based organizations	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Climate adaptation planning; Climate justice; Coastal resilience; Local climate policy; Participatory planning	SEA-LEVEL RISE; IMPACTS; EQUITY; GOVERNANCE; JUSTICE; PLANS; PANEL; US	In recognition of the importance of equitable climate adaptation, municipalities have increasingly utilized participatory planning processes that engage communities. However, while climate adaptation planning has become more open to public input, these processes still do not ensure equitable outcomes. This study examined equity concerning climate adaptation planning processes in New York City with a focus on the relationship between community-based organizations and participatory planning. The two planning processes studied here were the OneNYC comprehensive resilience plan and the Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency policy. 57 organizations responded to a survey investigating awareness of, participation in, and barriers to engagement with planning. These variables were compared to characteristics of each organization such as the issues they work on and the demographics of their local community boards. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrating the roles that community-based organizations have played in climate adaptation planning in New York City. The results of the study demonstrated the existence of multiple barriers to engagement such as the absence of clarity about ongoing processes and a low understanding of how a climate adaptation plan may help an organization achieve its goals. This study has demonstrated that climate change adaptation planning processes should be revised in multiple ways to increase climate justice. The proposed changes are urgently needed because without equitable processes, there will be significant gaps in any cities' climate resilience.

High pressure on these natural resources, mostly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change, tend to increase environmental degradation and water ecosystem deterioration. Various possible efforts need to be considered in order to overcome water related problems in the future. Ecohydrology application will be a use-ful tool in regulating water circulation, eroded soil transportation, water quality, quantity and availability , floods and drought risk. Implementation of ecohydrological concept at demonstration site scale in a tributary of the Saguling reservoir catchment, the upper Citarum watershed, Indonesia aims to facilitate different part of stakeholders to have best practices tools and field experiences in dealing with daily water ecosystem and environ-mental challenges. This study showed a very high erosion at internal demonstration site area, closely related to increase of river water turbidity. Meanwhile, developed modelling system may predict water and sediment yields, soil erosion and deposition sources in good performance, either within the demonstration site or the entire area of upper Citarum wa-tershed. Phytoremediation ponds constructed in the demosite demonstrated their ability to improve water quality through turbidity reduction up to 64%, 76%, 68%, 92%, and 88%, for Lemna, Landoltia, Salvinia, Pistia, Eichhornia respectively. Understanding and taking into account community characteristics will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implemen-tation around ecohydrology demonstration site in Saguling catchment area.

Unfortunately, these estimates are susceptible to different sources of uncertainties including climate change, which could have high implications on the cost and design of hydraulic structures. This study adopts a systematic literature review to ascertain the disregard of credibility assessment of rainfall estimates in Nigeria. Thereafter, a simple framework for informing the practice of reliability check of rainfall estimates was proposed using freely available open-source tools and applied to the north central region of Nigeria. The study revealed through a synthesis matrix that in the last decade, both empirical and theoretical methods have been applied in predicting design rainfall intensities or depths for different frequencies across Nigeria, but none of the selected studies assessed the credibility of the design estimates. This study has established through the application of the proposed framework that drainage infrastructure designed in the study area using 100-1000-year return periods are more susceptible to error. And that the extent of the credibility of quantitative estimates of extreme rains leading to flooding is not equal for each variability indicator across a large spatial region. Hence, to optimize informed decision-making regarding flood risk reduction by risk assessor, variability and uncertainty of rainfall estimates should be assessed spatially to minimize erroneous deductions.

Increased precipitation and flooding events are the cause of important yield losses due to waterlogging or (partial) submergence of crops in the field. Our ability to screen efficiently and quickly for varieties that have increased tolerance to waterlogging or (partial) submergence is important. Barley, a staple crop worldwide, is particularly sensitive to waterlogging. Screening for waterlogging tolerant barley varieties has been ongoing for many years, but methods used to screen vary greatly, from the type of soil used to the time at which the treatment is applied. This variation makes it difficult to cross-compare results. Results Here, we have devised a scoring system to assess barley tolerance to waterlogging and compare two different methods when partial submergence is applied with either water or a starch solution at an early developmental stage, which is particularly sensitive to waterlogging or partial submergence. The use of a starch solution has been previously shown to result in more reducing soil conditions and has been used to screen for waterlogging tolerance. Conclusions Our results show that the two methods provide similar results to qualitatively rank varieties as tolerant or sensitive, while also affecting plants differently, in that application of a starch solution results in stronger and earlier symptoms than applying partial submergence with water.

Affected by different factors, such as abundant rainfall and increased impervious surface, the Taihu basin becomes more vulnerable to floods. As a result, a future flood risk analysis is of great significance. This paper simulated the land-use expansion and analyzed the surface change from 2020 to 2050 using the neural network Cellular Automata Markov (CA-Markov) model. Moreover, the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset was corrected for deviation and used to analyze the climate trend. Second, the verified SWAT model was applied to simulate future runoff and to analyze the future flood risk. The results show that (1) land use is dominated by cultivated land and forests. In the future, the area of cultivated land will decrease and construction land will expand to 1.5 times its present size. (2) The average annual precipitation and temperature will increase by 1.2% and 1.5 degrees from 2020 to 2050, respectively. During the verified period, the NSE and r-square values of the SWAT model are greater than 0.7. (3) Compared with the historical extreme runoff, the extreme runoff in the return period will increase 10%similar to 25% under the eight climate models in 2050. In general, the flood risk will increase further under the climate scenarios.

Two smaller hydropower structures, Nina and Laxiwa Dams, were constructed between Longyangxia Dam and Guide in 2003 and 2009 respectively, but they had a minor influence on the flow regime. This study uses the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration model, satellite imagery and field analyses to assess how the magnitude and duration of changes to the flow regime impacted upon geomorphic adjustments and riparian vegetation succession from 1987 to 2015. Flow impoundment resulted in near instantaneous reduction in the width of the active channel zone. Human activities have manipulated the additional floodplain areas created by these changes. Aggregation of mid-channel bars into larger compound features decreased channel multiplicity. Negligible bed incision likely reflects local supply of sediment from tributary sources downstream of the dam. Significant correlations are shown between changes to the balance between channel depositional and erosional processes induced by flow regulation and the functional composition of vegetation succession patterns. Maintenance of a higher water table for longer periods of time is inferred to have altered mutual interactions between hydrogeomorphic processes and riparian vegetation in this semi-arid setting.

This research proposed a combinatorial mutation test method to study the interannual variation trends and change points of runoff and sediment flowing into and out of Hongze Lake during the period 1975-2015. It is concluded that the annual variation trend of the inflow and outflow runoff time series is consistent, with no obvious decreasing trend and change point, while the inflow and outflow sediment time series showed a decreasing trend, and the change point was 1991. Then, the runoff and sediment time series were analyzed by the wavelet method. The results showed that the time series has multi-time scale characteristics. The annual inflow runoff and sediment would enter into the dry period in a short time after 2015, and both would be in the valley floor stage. Among the influencing factors, the variation of rainfall in the basin was the main factor affecting the runoff variation. Changes in heavy rainfalls pattern, the construction of hydraulic engineering projects, and land use/cover change (LUCC) are the main reasons for the significant decrease and mutation variation of inflow sediment.

A standardised approach to calculating floodplain tree condition to support environmental watering decisions	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tree crown condition; Murray-Darling basin; River red gum; Black box; Environmental watering	RIVER RED GUM; MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; SALINE GROUNDWATER; BLACK-BOX; AUSTRALIA; MANAGEMENT; REQUIREMENTS; BIODIVERSITY	Ground-based visual assessment of crown condition is a cornerstone of tree condition assessment globally, and numerous condition assessment approaches have evolved to address the needs and perspectives of different users. In Australia's iconic Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), stands of floodplain eucalypts are increasingly vulnerable to a range of interacting stressors related to climate change and over-extraction of water for consumptive and agricultural use. A standardised approach developed in 2008 for assessing floodplain trees within the MDB provides extensive guidance to ensure field data is collected consistently. However, there is minimal instruction on how to interpret data, and consequently a range of evaluation approaches have evolved. The lack of a standardised reporting framework generated by these different approaches makes it difficult for floodplain managers and environmental water holders to make repeatable, robust decisions for prioritising water allocations across competing locations. To provide improved lines of evidence to support decision making, this paper describes a 'best-practise' approach to calculating a tree condition score from field data. Within, we document existing approaches in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, and recommend a method that meets the needs of floodplain managers as a pragmatic reporting, communication and decision support tool that does not require statistical analysis. Case studies and a revised conceptual model of tree decline and recovery are provided to demonstrate the validity of the recommended approach.

In this kind of analysis, purely qualitative approaches have been gradually replaced by quantitative approaches aimed at reconstructing the temporal variations in parameters (e.g., channel width and depth) to investigate not only the evolutionary trend of the river but also the possible cause-effect connections. This paper investigates the channel dynamics in the Basento River (Basilicata Region, Italy) over the past 150 years, when the river was heavily affected by human activities (e.g., hydraulic interventions and gravel mining) and climate changes. Channel adjustments were analysed with historical maps, aerial photos, and geomorphological surveys. The results show that the channel underwent a strong narrowing during the twentieth century, similar to many rivers in Italy, with the most intense phase from the 1950s to the 1990s (with the width varying from -30% to -80%). The morphology pattern remained almost completely unchanged, apart from a few reaches located in the hilly area that were affected by intense modifications before the 1940s. The causes of channel adjustments were identified as human disturbances (land use variations, channel interventions at the reach scale, sediment mining) from the end of the 1800s to present, as well as natural factors (changes in frequency, duration, and intensity of flood events), whose effects have intensified since the late 1990s.

In particular, wind-generated waves cause fluctuations of the sea level at the coast over timescales from a few seconds (individual wave runup) to a few hours (wave-induced setup). These wave-induced processes are of major importance for coastal management as they add up to tides and atmospheric surges during storm events and enhance coastal flooding and erosion. Changes in the atmospheric circulation associated with natural climate cycles or caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions affect the wave conditions worldwide, which may drive significant changes in the wave-induced coastal hydrodynamics. Since sea-level rise represents a major challenge for sustainable coastal management, particularly in low-lying coastal areas and/or along densely urbanized coastlines, understanding the contribution of wind-generated waves to the long-term budget of coastal sea-level changes is therefore of major importance. In this review, we describe the physical processes by which sea states may affect coastal sea level at several timescales, we present the methods currently used to estimate the wave contribution to coastal sea-level changes, we describe past and future wave climate variability, we discuss the contribution of wave to coastal sea-level changes, and we discuss the limitations and perspectives of this research field.

Here, we present seven sedimentary profiles in the Xunhua Basin and Jishixia Gorges. The lithological, sedimentary and chronological results, including optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and AMS C-14 ages, indicate that there were two separate landslide-dammed lakes rather than one during the Holocene in the Jishixia Gorges. The first lake relates to the Maerpo landslide that occurred at ca. 8.30 ka BP. This lake gradually shallowed and then disappeared by ca. 6.30 ka BP as the landslide dam was slowly incised by the Yellow River. The second Gelongbu landslide occurred at ca. 6.10 ka BP. The consequent lake also gradually shallowed and then disappeared at ca. 5.60 ka BP as the landslide dam was cut through by the Yellow River. Both landslides and their associated lakes preceded The Great Flood in the middle-lower Yellow River by at least 1400 years and preceded the beginning of Xia Dynasty by at least 1600 years.

In this paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China. First, we review published results (including our own works) on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades - floods on large rivers, urban floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications. Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in China, focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness, by both structural ("hard") defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and diversions, as well as non-structural ("soft") measures: spatial planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.	[Kundzewicz, Z.

However, global drought risk and pattern remain to be revealed below 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming levels. Here we used multi-model simulations to estimate global drought trend based on multiple drought indicators. The frequency and duration of meteorological drought may increase much faster than surface soil moisture drought and root zone soil moisture drought under anthropogenic warming, with a probable similar to 36% (62%) increase in frequency and a similar to 15% (20%) increase in duration at 1.5 degrees C (2 degrees C) level relative to the reference period over the globe. A 5% (14%) increase of drought frequency is expected at 1.5 degrees C (2 degrees C) warming in the surface soil moisture, and a 5% (2%) increase of duration is also likely in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Unprecedented increased drought risk is anticipated at 2 degrees C level, with potential drought hot spots in North America, South America, southern Africa, Australia and Europe. Drought condition under future warming may be much worse in local areas. The drought frequency in the drylands is much less (> 34%) than the humid areas, but the duration is much higher (> 40%). The 2 degrees C relative to 1.5 degrees C warming is expected to bring higher drought risk than the 1.5 degrees C relative to 1 degrees C period with regard to the frequency.

A framework for testing dynamic classification of vulnerable scenarios in ensemble water supply projections	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; ROBUST; MODEL; RISK; UNCERTAINTY; SNOWPACK	Recent water resources planning studies have proposed climate adaptation strategies in which infrastructure and policy actions are triggered by observed thresholds or signposts. However, the success of such strategies depends on whether thresholds can be accurately linked to future vulnerabilities. This study presents a framework for testing the ability of adaptation thresholds to dynamically identify vulnerable scenarios within ensemble projections. Streamflow projections for 91 river sites predominantly in the western USA are used as a case study in which vulnerability is determined by the ensemble members with the lowest 10% of end-of-century mean annual flow. Illustrative planning thresholds are defined through time for each site based on the mean streamflow below which a specified fraction of scenarios is vulnerable. We perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to compute the frequency of incorrectly identifying or failing to identify a vulnerable scenario (false positives and false negatives, respectively). Results show that in general, this method of defining thresholds can identify vulnerable scenarios with low false positive rates (<10%), but with false negative rates for many rivers remaining higher than random chance until roughly 2060. This finding highlights the tradeoff between frequently triggering unnecessary action and failing to identify potential vulnerabilities until later in the century, and suggests room for improvement in the threshold-setting technique that could be benchmarked with this approach. This testing framework could extend to thresholds defined with multivariate statistics, or to any application using thresholds and ensemble projections, such as long-term flood and drought risk, or sea level rise.

Rice plants manifest a variety of physiological and morphological changes to cope with submergence and hypoxia, including lowering carbohydrate consumption, inhibiting shoot elongation, and forming a thicker leaf gas film during submergence. Functional studies have revealed that submergence tolerance in rice is mainly determined by an ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factor-encoding gene, namely SUBMERGENCE 1A-1 (SUB1A-1) located in the SUB1 quantitative trait locus. The SUB1A-1-dependent submergence tolerance is manifested through hormonal signaling involving ethylene, gibberellic acid, brassinosteroid, auxin and jasmonic acid. Considerable progress has been made toward the introduction of SUB1A-1 into rice varieties through a conventional marker-assisted backcrossing approach. Here, we review the recent advances in the physiological, biochemical and molecular dynamics of rice submergence tolerance mediated by the 'quiescence strategy'. Thus, the present review aims to provide researchers with insights into the genetics of rice submergence tolerance and future perspectives for designing submergence-resilient plants for sustainable agriculture under the uncertainties of climate change.

Methods for flood assessments have been actively improved to help mitigate the impact of flooding, thus reducing the risk. The emergence of social media has provided crowdsourced data that can potentially provide immediate and valuable information on flood situations. Therefore, this study uses crowdsourced data from social network sites (SNS) to assess a 2020 flood event in Kuala Lumpur. An exploratory data analysis method has been applied to reveal the statistical pattern of Twitter data to assess flood risk. Relevant tweets were analysed further by retrospective analysis in reviewing the text and media (image and video) contents against official flood reports for validation. The result shows that news channel accounts played a crucial role in disseminating information during a flood event, while tweets with images and videos can show accurate flood levels and locations of flooding. A multi-weighted index system was applied to generate a flood zone heat map. Therefore, it can be concluded that social network services are an effective means of disseminating valuable and nearly real-time information, which can assist both the general public and authorities during emergency response efforts.

The resilient city approach provides new ideas for urban flood prevention research, and currently, enhancing urban flood resilience is an effective means for alleviating urban flooding pressure. This study proposes a method to quantify the resilience value of urban flooding based on the '4R' theory of resilience, by coupling the urban rainfall and flooding model to simulate urban flooding, and the simulation results are used for calculating index weights and assessing the spatial distribution of urban flood resilience in the study area. The results indicate that (1) the high level of flood resilience in the study area is positively correlated with the points prone to waterlogging; the more an area is prone to waterlogging, the lower the flood resilience value. (2) The flood resilience index in most areas shows a significant local spatial clustering effect, with the number of areas with nonsignificant local spatial clustering accounting for 46% of the total. The urban flood resilience assessment system constructed in this study provides a reference for assessing the urban flood resilience of other cities, thus facilitating the decision-making process of urban planning and disaster mitigation.

In the USA, governments have traditionally relocated households using two mechanisms: buyout programs and eminent domain. Although both programs acquire private properties for public ownership and use, buyout programs are defined as voluntary by government entities, whereas eminent domain is compulsory. For decades, Harris County, Texas, has used both voluntary buyouts and eminent domain to relocate households out of flood-prone areas for different uses; buyouts produce open space, whereas eminent domain is used for flood risk reduction projects Although the literature on buyouts continues to grow, especially related to managed retreat, little research considers mandated relocation in response to hazard in the USA despite the increasing potential and calls for mandated relocations due to sea level rise and other climate-induced hazards. To address this gap in the literature, we analyze county records spanning approximately 100 years to examine the geographic patterns related to Harris County's use of eminent domain and buyouts programs to mitigate flood hazards. Integrating these records into a Geographic Information System, this novel study is the first to compare these two programs and consider the implications for future managed retreat.

Understanding how to improve the farmers' flood adaption is important to reduce flood effects. Protection motivation theory (PMT) has been widely used to examine flood adaptation behavior, but there is still debate regarding the quantitative effect of PMT factors on flood adaption behavior, particularly in a geographically vulnerable context. This study integrates psychological aspects based on PMT to assess farmers' flood adaptability. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data from 359 farmers. We employed structural equation modeling to test a PMT model with mediation analysis. The results showed that farmers who perceive a higher flood risk and feel more fear of floods are more likely to implement flood adaptation measures. Similarly, farmers adopt more adaptive actions if they have higher self-efficacy and response efficacy. However, they are less likely to take adaptive actions if they are subject to maladaptation. Maladaptation plays a significant role as a mediating variable. These findings will act as recommendations for government agencies to design policy measures to strengthen flood risk management. The study supports the theory of protection motivation to understand farmers' flood adaptation behavior. However, further study is required to enhance and generalize the existing model.

Due to urban growth, the hydrological dynamics in entire basins and the hydromorphology of rivers are changing. This situation increases flooding, decreases the availability of water for human use, and disconnects the rivers from the dynamics of the city. Agroforestry is the integration of cultural, wild, and domesticated diversity with use, conservation, and restoration objectives. These practices in cities can contribute to addressing the problems mentioned. We analyze agroforestry practices and the socio-ecological contributions to urban river rehabilitation. We review 37 experiences worldwide. Agroforestry practices included in the review are trees and hedgerows; wetland agroforestry; aquatic, botanical, edible, educational, and rain gardens; bioswales; green parking lots; food forestry; vegetation in alleys and streets; vertical terrace walls, among others. Agroforestry contributes to efforts to solve urban river problems, improve water quality and access, restore riparian habitats, enhance river hydromorphology, support local economies, and create a river culture. We emphasize promoting multi-relational people-river interactions based on theoretical and practical frameworks that integrate diverse disciplines, perspectives, and experiences.

In recent years, extreme rainfall events caused by global climate change have increased, and flash flood disasters are becoming the main types of natural disasters in the world. Due to the characteristics of strong suddenness, complex disaster-causing factors, great difficulty in prediction and forecast, and the lack of historical data, it is difficult to effectively prevent and control flash flood disaster. The early identification technology of flash floods is not only the basis of flash flood disaster prediction and early warning, but also an effective means of flash flood prevention and control. The paper makes a meta-analysis and visual analysis of 475 documents collected by the Web of Science Document Platform in the past 31 years by comprehensively using Citespace, Vosviewer, Origin, etc. We systematically summarize the research progress and development trend of early identification technology of flash flood disasters from five key research subfields: (1) precipitation, (2) sediment, (3) sensitivity analysis, (4) risk assessment, (5) uncertainty analysis. In addition, we analyze and discuss the main problems encountered in the current research of several subfields and put forward some suggestions to provide references for the prevention and control of flash flood disasters.

In this work, an integrally-coupled tide-surge wave model was developed to simulate storm tides and waves around the coastal area of Qingdao. The model was validated with observed data under historical typhoon events. The simulated results illustrate that tides change obviously at most representative stations within Jiaozhou Bay. Meanwhile, the effect of SLR on astronomical tide in the flood and the ebb period is more significant than that of the peak tide period. Further investigations reveal that SLR and TI affect storm tides and waves in different ways and the influences are different within Jiaozhou Bay and along the open coast. Besides, the combined effects of SLR and TI on peak storm tides and wave heights are remarkable, which are not a simply linear superposition and present a spatially nonuniform and non-liner pattern. Therefore, it is essential to adopt the coupled model to estimate the possible maximum risk of storm surges and waves around the coastal area of Qingdao. Taking SLR and TI into consideration, the peak of elevation near shore could experience a significant amplification in the future.

Assessing Flood Indirect Impacts on Road Transport Networks Applying Mesoscopic Traffic Modelling: The Case Study of Santarem, Portugal	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						road network disruption; flood indirect impacts; mesoscopic simulation; static and dynamic traffic modelling	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LINKS	The key aspect for the quantification of indirect impacts of flooding is the assessment of the disruption of the transportation service considering social and economic consequences. To investigate how flooding can affect road transportation, it is essential to analyze interaction during the flood event itself, as well as on the following days. In this work, two static and dynamic traffic models are applied to a study zone for quantification of the performance and functionality of the network during the flood and after the failure of infrastructure components. A mesoscopic simulation was applied to identify the traffic disruption in the face of flood events. This simulation is capable of considering the road network model, assigning trip paths with the impact of road closures and speed reductions, and evaluating travel time and vehicle volume redistribution in a given disruption scenario. By comparing the traffic analysis results (travel time, travelled distance and street speed changes) in normal and flooded situations, the impact of flooding on a transportation network could be examined. Moreover, modelling outputs from a case study in the Santarem region (Portugal) indicated that in analyzing the flood impacts on a traffic network, even non-flooded infrastructures must be taken into account because of their service disruption.

Mere Nuisance or Growing Threat? The Physical and Economic Impact of High Tide Flooding on US Road Networks	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; COSTS; DAMAGES; SURGE	High tide flooding (HTF) already affects traffic in many US coastal areas, but the issue will worsen significantly in the future. While studies show that large storm surge events threaten to be ever more costly, less damaging, but more frequent HTF events remain understudied and potentially carry a comparable economic impact. This study advances our understanding of the risks and impacts of HTF on vulnerable traffic corridors using hourly tide gauge water levels, sea-level rise projections, and link-level spatial analysis. It is the first study to estimate HTF economic impacts for varying levels of intervention, including reasonably anticipated driver-initiated rerouting and ancillary protection of adjacent property. The 2020 annual national-level costs of $1.3 to $1.5 billion will increase to $28 to $37 billion in 2050 and $220 to $260 billion in 2100 for medium to high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios, respectively. Total costs over the century are $1.0 to $1.3 trillion (discounted 3%). Additional cost-effective protection by building sea walls or raising road surfaces could significantly reduce 2100 costs to $61 to $78 billion, but there remain many barriers to adopting least-cost adaptation decisions, and these gains may only be realized with careful planning and information sharing.

The decision to modernize a sewer system should be based on appropriate criteria. In engineering practice, the above is commonly achieved using a hydrodynamic model of the catchment and the simulation of various rainfall events. The article presents a methodology to analyze the effect of rainfall characteristics parametrized with intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves in regard to performance measures of sewerage networks (flood volume per unit impervious surface and share of overfilled manholes in the sewerage network) accounting for the model uncertainty determined via the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method. An urban catchment was modeled with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Analyses showed that the model uncertainty exerts a large impact on certain measures of sewage network operation. Therefore, these measures should be analyzed in similar studies. This is very important at the stage of decision making in regard to the modernization and sustainable development of catchments. It was found that among the model parameters, the Manning roughness coefficient of sewer channels yields a key impact on the specific flood volume, while the area of impervious surfaces yields the greatest impact on the share of overflowed manholes.

Without an adequate and appropriate stormwater system, the storms and associated floods will continue to cause significant damage to infrastructure and loss of life. Low Impact Development (LID) has become an emerging alternative to the traditional stormwater system for stormwater management. This study evaluates and optimizes applications of different combinations of LIDs to minimize flows from a catchment under past and future storm conditions. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), forced by observed and downscaled precipitation from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), was used to simulate the runoff and apply the LIDs in the Renton City, WA. The final results show that the performance of LIDs in reducing total runoff volume varies with the types and combinations of LIDs utilized. A 30% to 75% runoff reduction was achieved for the past and future 50 year and 100 year storms.

A WiFi-Based Sensor Network for Flood Irrigation Control in Agriculture	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); agriculture; wireless sensor network (WSN); flood irrigation; monitoring; cloud server; mobile app		The role of agriculture in society is vital due to factors such as providing food for the population, is a major source of employment worldwide, and one of the most important sources of revenue for countries. Furthermore, in recent years, the interest in optimizing the use of water resources has increased due to aspects such as climate change. This has led to the introduction of technology in the fields by means of sensor networks that allow remote monitoring and control of cultivated lands. In this paper, we present a system for flood irrigation in agriculture comprised of a sensor network based on WiFi communication. Different sensors measure atmospheric parameters such as temperature, humidity, and rain, soil parameters such as humidity, and water parameters such as water temperature, salinity, and water height to decide on the need of activating the floodgates for irrigation. The user application displays the data gathered by the sensors, shows a graphical representation of the state of irrigation of each ditch, and allows farmers to manage the irrigation of their fields. Finally, different tests were performed on a plot of vegetables to evaluate the correct performance of the system and the coverage of the sensor network on a vegetated area with different deployment options.</p>	[Lloret, Jaime; Sendra, Sandra; Garcia, Laura; Jimenez, Jose M.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Invest Gest Integrada Zonas Costeras IGIC, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Garcia-Fernandez, Julia] Univ Granada, Dept Teoria Senal Telemat & Comunicac TSTC, C Periodista Daniel Saucedo Aranda S-N, Granada 18014, Spain	Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University of Granada	Lloret, J (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Invest Gest Integrada Zonas Costeras IGIC, Camino Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.	jlloret@dcom.upv.es; sansenco@upv.es; juliagf18@correo.ugr.es; laugarg2@teleco.upv.es; jojiher@dcom.upv.es	Compte, Sandra Sendra/ABE-1368-2021; García, Laura/GON-5590-2022; Jimenez, Jose Miguel/AAA-3627-2021; Lloret, Jaime/H-3994-2013; Sendra, Sandra/M-6553-2018	García, Laura/0000-0003-2902-5757; Jimenez, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-3688-7235; Lloret, Jaime/0000-0002-0862-0533; Sendra, Sandra/0000-0001-9556-9088	European Union through the ERANETMED (Euromediterranean Cooperation through ERANET joint activities and beyond) project [ERANETMED3-227 SMARTWATIR]; Programa Estatal de I+D+i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, en el marco del Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion [PID2020-114467RR-C33]; proyectos de innovacion de interes general por grupos operativos de la Asociacion Europea para la Innovacion en materia de productividad y sostenibilidad agricolas (AEI-Agri); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia	European Union through the ERANETMED (Euromediterranean Cooperation through ERANET joint activities and beyond) project; Programa Estatal de I+D+i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, en el marco del Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion; proyectos de innovacion de interes general por grupos operativos de la Asociacion Europea para la Innovacion en materia de productividad y sostenibilidad agricolas (AEI-Agri); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia	This work was partially supported by the European Union through the ERANETMED (Euromediterranean Cooperation through ERANET joint activities and beyond) project ERANETMED3-227 SMARTWATIR, by the Programa Estatal de I+D+i Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad, en el marco del Plan Estatal de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnica y de Innovacion 2017-2020 (Project code: PID2020-114467RR-C33), and by proyectos de innovacion de interes general por grupos operativos de la Asociacion Europea para la Innovacion en materia de productividad y sostenibilidad agricolas (AEI-Agri) in the framework Programa Nacional de Desarrollo Rural 2014-2020, GO TECNOGAR.

The flooding situation in coastal cities gets accentuated further due to climate-induced natural disasters such as cyclones and climate change-induced sea-level rise that adversely impact the city's natural drainage potential. This study developed a composite urban flood risk index consisting of three sub-indices and 20 key natural, physical, social, and economic influencing variables for a coastal city (i.e., Cuttack) in eastern India, the intensity of storm run-off being one among the many. The intensity-duration-frequency curve developed shows that the city can experience floods with a peak discharge of 1320 cubic metre per second every alternate year for a rainfall intensity of 2-h duration. The urban flood risk index computed for all the city wards shows that out of the 59 wards, only one ward has low flood risk (index value < 0.40) and 20 wards are at high risk (index value 0.55 and above) from the urban flood. Thereafter, factors leading to high risk due to urban floods were identified and the institutional capacities available with the urban utility for fighting floods analysed.	[Kumar, M.

Natural and anthropogenic factors have been highlighted as key drivers and the physical setting of the coastline, including elevation in relation to mean sea level influence the degree of vulnerability. In this review paper, we investigated the possibilities, advantages and limitations to using bioshields for coastal protection in Vietnam. Special attention has been given to mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, nearshore-coral reefs and marshes. Hard structures such as seawalls and breakwaters can be used for immediate relief from coastal vulner-abilities whereas ecosystem-based adaptation using bioshield is highly effective for long-term coastal protection. However, the applicability of bioshields depends on a number of factors, such as coastal geomorphology, degree of vulnerability and biodiversity. Northeastern and southern coast of Vietnam are highly suitable for mangrove vegetation and can be used as a bioshield in these areas. Central and northern Vietnamese coasts are rich in seagrasses and coral reefs and in these areas and these can be a suitable coastal bioshield. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sharma, A; Hettiarachchi, S; Wasko, C				Sharma, Ashish; Hettiarachchi, Suresh; Wasko, Conrad			Estimating design hydrologic extremes in a warming climate: alternatives, uncertainties and the way forward	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						design storm; design flood; hydrologic design; climate change; antecedent conditions		It is now well established that our warming planet is experiencing changes in extreme storms and floods, resulting in a need to better specify hydrologic design guidelines that can be projected into the future. This paper attempts to summarize the nature of changes occurring and the impact they are having on the design flood magnitude, with a focus on the urban catchments that we will increasingly reside in as time goes on. Two lines of reasoning are used to assess and model changes in design hydrology. The first of these involves using observed storms and soil moisture conditions and projecting how these may change into the future. The second involves using climate model simulations of the future and using them as inputs into hydrologic models to assess the changed design estimates. We discuss here the limitations in both and suggest that the two are, in fact, linked, as climate model projections for the future are needed in the first approach to form meaningful projections for the future. Based on the author's experience with both lines of reasoning, this invited commentary presents a theoretical narrative linking these two and identifying factors and assumptions that need to be validated before implementation in practice.

The effect of depth-duration-frequency model recalibration on rainfall return period estimates	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; extreme events; mapping of hazard and risk; risk perception		In November 2009 and December 2015, two record-breaking 24-hr rainfalls occurred in Cumbria, UK, significantly changing the perception of flood risk for local communities. FEH13, the current UK rainfall depth-duration-frequency (DDF) model, estimated return periods of around 1,000 years for both events. The previous model, FEH99, received criticism from panel engineers responsible for making technical safety decisions relating to reservoirs for appearing to estimate relatively short return periods for extreme events. Although FEH13 is more consistent with current probable maximum precipitation (PMP) estimates, there is high uncertainty in both models due to the limited number of extremes captured by UK rain gauges. Furthermore, neither model included the 2009 or 2015 event in its calibration. Here, we re-calibrate FEH13 using additional gauged rainfall data collected in Cumbria during 2006-2016, including the record-breaking 2009 and 2015 storms. Using the updated calibration data set reduces the estimated return periods of the 2009 and 2015 events to approximately 140 years each. This case study illustrates the considerable uncertainty in short-sample records, demonstrates the importance of maximising the quantity of relevant calibration data, shows that perception of risk depends upon the method and data used, and illustrates the difficulty of separating trends and natural variability.

This study analyzed the changes in the timing of extreme precipitation in the Poyang Lake basin and projected its future changes for the period 2020-2099. The study also quantified the influences of changes in the timing of peak flows on lake floods based on a hydrodynamic model. The results showed that peak rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin had occurred on later dates during the period 1960-2012, and it is this change that caused a delay in peak streamflows from five rivers in the lake basin. Moreover, the effects of these changes are expected to be more prominent during 2020-2099; for example, the rate of delay will be about 2.0 days per 10 years both for peak rainfall and for streamflow in the Poyang Lake basin. The hydrodynamic simulation further showed that a delay of peak streamflows from five rivers would significantly increase the flood level and outflow of the lake and also prolong the duration of floods. These results indicate that the risk of floods in Poyang Lake is likely to increase in the future, therefore making flood control in this region more challenging.

Reliable information on the drivers, patterns and dynamics of flood risk is crucial for the identification, prioritization and planning of risk reduction and adaptation measures. Here, we present a systematic review of existing flood risk assessments in Vietnam. We evaluate the current status, persisting gaps, and challenges regarding the understanding and assessment of flood risk in the country. The literature review revealed that: (i) 65 % of the reviewed papers did not provide a clear definition of flood risk, (ii) assessments had a tendency to prioritize physical and environmental drivers of risk over social, economic or governance-related drivers, (iii) future-oriented assessments tended to focus on hazard and exposure trends, while vulnerability scenarios were often lacking, (iv) large and middle-sized cities were assessed more frequently than others, (v) only few studies engaged with relevant local stakeholders for the assessment of risk and the development of potential solutions, and (vi) ecosystem-based adaptation and flood risk insurance solutions were rarely considered. Based on these findings, we point out several directions for future research on flood risk in Vietnam.

Experts are divided over the advantages and disadvantages of land reclamation, though this process continues unabated, exposing settlements to coastal hazards. The Bataan Shipping and Engineering Company (BASECO) compound is an informal settlement on reclaimed land in Manila, the Philippines. How informal coastal settlements view disaster risk and their more pressing socioeconomic needs is crucial to understanding the potentials and repercussions of land reclamation. Using a topographic survey, a questionnaire survey, and the protective action decision model, this study explored the perception of disasters and land reclamation of informal settlers who are living on reclaimed land. The study found that people are aware of disaster risks, but are more concerned with everyday needs. They are divided on the issue of further land reclamation. Residents on the original non-reclaimed land view it as a coastal defense, while those on reclaimed land fear potential eviction. Despite this, all locations in the community are concerned with the loss of jobs, economic opportunities, and eviction, rather than potential disasters.

Dry sediment loading of headwater channels fuels post-wildfire debris flows in bedrock landscapes	GEOLOGY			English	Article							SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; TRANSVERSE RANGES; TRANSPORT; STORAGE; STEEP; VEGETATION; INITIATION; RUNOFF; SLOPE	Landscapes following wildfire commonly have significant increases in sediment yield and debris flows that pose major hazards and are difficult to predict. Ultimately, post-wildfire sediment yield is governed by processes that deliver sediment from hillslopes to channels, but it is commonly unclear the degree to which hillslope sediment delivery is driven by wet versus dry processes, which limits the ability to predict debris-flow occurrence and response to climate change. Here we use repeat airborne lidar topography to track sediment movement following the 2009 CE Station Fire in southern California, USA, and show that post-wildfire debris flows initiated in channels filled by dry sediment transport, rather than on hillsides during rainfall as typically assumed. We found widespread patterns of 1-3 m of dry sediment loading in headwater channels immediately following wildfire and before rainfall, followed by sediment excavation during subsequent storms. In catchments where post-wildfire dry sediment loading was absent, possibly due to differences in lithology, channel scour during storms did not occur. Our results support a fire-flood model in bedrock landscapes whereby debris-flow occurrence depends on dry sediment loading rather than hillslope-runoff erosion, shallow landslides, or burn severity, indicating that sediment supply can limit debris-flow occurrence in bedrock landscapes with more-frequent fires.

J	Shih, SS; Kuo, PH; Lai, JS				Shih, Shang-Shu; Kuo, Pin-Han; Lai, Jihn-Sung			A nonstructural flood prevention measure for mitigating urban inundation impacts along with river flooding effects	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Pluvial; Fluvial; Inundation maps; Warning water levels	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; PRECIPITATION; OPTIMIZATION; TAIWAN; SYSTEM; TRENDS; DAMAGE; MODEL	In recent decades, urban developments along rivers have experienced high flooding risks, elevated by increasing urbanization. Due to the expansion of urban areas, flood mitigation strategies must rely on nonstructural flood management policies. This study evaluated the impacts of pluvial floods considering fluvial flooding effects through field surveys and numerical model simulations. Nonstructural flood protection measures are provided by establishing warning water levels based on variant scenario simulations. The results reveal that the aggravated drainage system overflow induced by elevated river water is significant when considering river flooding effects. As a result, current drainage systems have failed to meet the designed flood protection standards, indicating the need to produce potential inundation maps and to establish warning water levels. To prevent the main evacuation route of each settlement from being blocked due to flooding, the proposed warning water levels support timely and effective evacuations. Public community centers and schools in noninundation areas near settlements were identified as possible shelters based on the proposed warning water levels and inundation maps. We conclude that although the riverside areas without dike protection could sustain natural environments and landscapes, they must incorporate nonstructural flood protection measures. At the same time, it must be considered that river flood levels may reduce urban drainage capacity.

J	Ganguli, P; Merz, B				Ganguli, Poulomi; Merz, Bruno			Extreme Coastal Water Levels Exacerbate Fluvial Flood Hazards in Northwestern Europe	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STORM-SURGE; RIVER FLOW; TAIL-DEPENDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA LEVELS; RISK; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; SCENARIOS; DYNAMICS	Compound flooding, such as the co-occurrence of fluvial floods and extreme coastal water levels (CWL), may lead to significant impacts in densely-populated Low Elevation Coastal Zones. They may overstrain disaster management owing to the co-occurrence of inundation from rivers and the sea. Recent studies are limited by analyzing joint dependence between river discharge and either CWL or storm surges, and little is known about return levels of compound flooding, accounting for the covariance between drivers. Here, we assess the compound flood severity and identify hotspots for northwestern Europe during 1970-2014, using a newly developed Compound Hazard Ratio (CHR) that compares the severity of compound flooding associated with extreme CWL with the unconditional T-year fluvial peak discharge. We show that extreme CWL and stronger storms greatly amplify fluvial flood hazards. Our results, based on frequency analyses of observational records during 2013/2014's winter storm Xaver, reveal that the river discharge of the 50-year compound flood is up to 70% larger, conditioned on the occurrence of extreme CWL, than that of the at-site peak discharge. For this event, nearly half of the stream gauges show increased flood hazards, demonstrating the importance of including the compounding effect of extreme CWL in river flood risk management.

Participatory flood modelling for negotiation and planning in urban informal settlements	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						design methods & aids; floods & floodworks; river engineering	RISK-MANAGEMENT; AFRICAN CITIES; FRAMEWORK; VULNERABILITY; STAKEHOLDER; COOPERATION; EXPERTISE; KNOWLEDGE	Participatory modelling in water resource management - involving diverse actors in what is traditionally a purely analytical process - is thought to broaden stakeholder engagement and improve outcomes. Further research and case studies are required to explore the practicalities of integrating meaningful participation within modelling processes in the water sector. Participatory modelling may be of particular interest within the context of urban informal areas, where the confluence of climate change, urbanisation and contested land requires new methods for engagement and planning. This paper develops new case-based knowledge to inform the application of participatory modelling and planning for informal urban areas. A flood-modelling project in the large informal neighbourhood of Kibera in central Nairobi, Kenya, is analysed using a newly established framework for the classification of participatory modelling approaches developed by Basco-Carrera et al. in 2017. Conclusions suggest that the further upstream more diverse stakeholders can be involved, the better the chance of co-producing new knowledge and of creating implementable plans and policies. At the same time, delivering 'co-design' of modelling processes in areas of limited co-operation requires a strong vision for participation, a tolerance for contention, a willingness to learn between actors and a budget to support additional time inputs.

Compared to the observation, the interannual variability of EASR during 1979-2005 is underestimated by the CMIP5 with a range of 0.86 similar to 16.08%. Based on bias correction of CMIP5 simulations with historical data, the reliability of future projections will be enhanced. The corrected EASR under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 increases by 5.6 and 7.5% during 2081-2100 relative to the baseline of 1986-2005, respectively. After correction, the areas with both negative and positive anomalies decrease, which are mainly located in the South China Sea and central China, and southern China and west of the Philippines, separately. In comparison to the baseline, the interannual variability of EASR increases by 20.8% under RCP4.5 but 26.2% under RCP8.5 in 2006-2100, which is underestimated by 10.7 and 11.1% under both RCPs in the original CMIP5 simulation. Compared with the mean precipitation, the interannual variability of EASR is notably larger under global warming. Thus, the probabilities of floods and droughts may increase in the future.

Here, we utilize the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to construct an indicator system for assessing water security in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB). This study also delves into the level of development in the coupling coordination between the economic and social systems and the water resources systems in the basin. The findings reveal that the overall water security situation in the LMRB is satisfactory, with three countries (China, Laos, and Vietnam) surpassing the "safe" threshold and three countries (Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar) "Basically safe". However, water security issues persist, particularly in relation to water pollution and scarcity. Seasonal water shortages and water-related disasters arise due to uneven rainfall distribution throughout the year and inadequate regulating facilities such as wetlands and reservoirs. In addition, the overall coupling coordination level in the LMRB is low, ranging between 0.3 and 0.4, corresponding to a moderate imbalance level in the assessment criteria system. Specifically, Laos and China exhibit the highest coupling coordination level, with a degree of 0.36, whereas Thailand and Myanmar demonstrate the lowest level, with degrees of 0.33 and 0.31, respectively. Overall, our results offer a scientific foundation for the sustainable development of countries within the LMRB.

J	Lu, M; Kang, CX; Yu, ZH; Zhang, XH				Lu, Miao; Kang, Congxuan; Yu, Zhihui; Zhang, Xiuhong			Coordination of Flood Control under Urbanization on the Taihu Plain: Basin, City and Region Perspectives	WATER			English	Article						flood control coordination; optimal scheduling; basin; region; city; urbanization	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; TOPSIS; MODEL; RISK	Floods have become increasingly frequent and pose more significant risks in delta plains due to rapid urbanization. While previous studies have primarily focused on urban flood management, there has been a limited exploration of coordinated flood control strategies that encompass cities, regions, and basins holistically. In response to this gap, our research aims to quantitatively assess flood control coordination under various scheduling rules and propose optimized strategies to enhance this coordination. Using the Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu region as our case study, we observed that flood characteristics under different flood control coordination schemes varied slightly, especially the FI. Moreover, the effectiveness of different scheduling optimization schemes varied across different levels. Specifically, at the basin-region, basin-city, and region-city levels, Schemes S8, S7, and S5 demonstrated the highest coordination coefficients, with values of 0.80, 0.67, and 0.68, respectively. In comparison to the current scheduling Scheme (S0), these schemes resulted in significant improvements in flood coordination, with enhancements of 0.68, 0.37, and 0.22, respectively. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the most effective approach to strengthening flood control coordination involves implementing scheduling measures that reduce urban drainage while simultaneously improving the discharge capacity of the basin. Our results could help to alleviate the contradictions of flood control at different levels and provide a solid guarantee for water security.

Despite the sizable quantum of research encompassing various facets of urban resilience, the physical form of cities has received limited attention from researchers. One of the challenges encountered involves the generalization of these studies across diverse settings and heterogeneous contexts. This study investigates different tools and frameworks proposed for the assessment of urban form resilience. Furthermore, it explores the applicability of these frameworks within the specific context of the Global South. The literature analysis is based on attribute selection, study context, methodology, and resilience perspective. The findings reveal a degree of fragmentation in the selection of attributes, approaches, and perspectives within the literature concerning the assessment of urban form resilience. Divergent arguments exist concerning the impact of urban form attributes on urban resilience, notably regarding factors like density and city size. Furthermore, the research underscores the complexities associated with integrating these assessment frameworks into the unique urban morphology of cities in the Global South, characterized by the prevalence of informal development. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for researchers and planners in comprehending the relationship between resilience and urban morphology, enabling the application of these concepts for the assessment of urban form resilience, particularly in the context of the Global South.

However, coastal groundwater and associated ecosystems are under threat from groundwater exploitation and depletion, as well as climate change impacts from sea-level rise and extreme flood and drought events. Despite many well-intentioned policies focused on sustainable groundwater use and species protection, coastal GDEs are falling through gaps generated by siloed policies and as a result, are declining in extent and ecological function. This study summarized then examined policies related to the management of coastal groundwater and connected ecosystems in two key case study areas: Queensland (Australia) and California (USA). Despite both areas being regarded as having progressive groundwater policy, our analysis revealed three universal policy gaps, including (1) a lack of recognition of the underlying groundwater system, (2) fragmented policies and complex governance structures that limit coordination, and (3) inadequate guidance for coastal GDE management. Overall, our analysis revealed that coastal GDE conservation relied heavily on inclusion within protected areas or was motivated by species recovery, meaning supporting groundwater systems remained underprotected and outside the remit of conservation efforts. To close these gaps, we consider the adoption of ecosystem-based management principles to foster integrated governance between disparate agencies and consider management tools that bridge traditional conservation realms. Our findings advocate for comprehensive policy frameworks that holistically address the complexities of coastal GDEs across the land-sea continuum to foster their long-term sustainability and conservation.

Multi-temporal downscaling of daily to sub-daily streamflow for flash flood watersheds at ungauged stations using a hybrid framework	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Temporal downscaling; Machine learning; Hydroclimatology; Hybrid models; Flash floods	LAND-USE CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SWAT MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; CATCHMENTS; UNCERTAINTY; RAINFALL; BASIN; RISK	Unprecedented flash floods (FFs) in urban regions have been rising due to the increasing intensity and magnitude of heavy rainfall resulting from human-induced climate and land-use changes. Modelling of FF along different spatiotemporal scales is extremely complex since FF models require multi-resolution forcing and observed information. In the absence of sub-daily, and multi-site streamflow data, multi-temporal downscaling (MTD) plays a crucial role for FF modeling. While a wide range of methods are available for the spatio-temporal downscaling of climate data, the applicability of the MTD strategy for streamflow has not been investigated yet. The current study proposed a MTD methodology for yielding the daily to sub-daily streamflow of gauged and ungauged stations using adaptive emulator modelling concepts. The proposed MTD framework for ungauged stations is a hybrid model that draws on conceptual and machine learning-based approaches to analyze catchment behavior. The study selected the Peachtree Creek watershed (United States) since it frequently experiences FFs. Results suggest that model-derived sub-daily streamflow had minimal uncertainty in capturing hydrological signatures and nearly 95% accuracy in predicting flow attributes over ungauged stations. The proposed framework can be useful for planning, mitigation, and management, where the fine resolution data is required.

The improvement of the resilience levels of rural systems under changing environments is an important sustainable development. The objective of this study is to provide a basis for the construction of rural emergency disaster prevention in flood storage areas and provide a reference for sustainable rural low-carbon development of village system. The results show that (1) from the perspective of spatial patterns of rural networks, there are obvious spatial differences in Mengwa rural network, showing a spindle-shaped spatial structure with dense middle and sparse on both sides. (2) From the perspective of structural resilience characteristics, the network has significant hierarchy and agglomeration, high local transmission and no obvious characteristics of homogeneity or heterogeneity. Amongst them, the core node has a prominent position, strong control ability and significant correlation effect. (3) The results of scenario simulations on rural network resilience show deliberate disturbance can significantly reduce network resilience compared with random disturbance. A large number of high-energy consumption and low-efficiency phenomena occur earlier in the network, leading to the collapse of the network.

Hence, this study aims to evaluate the capabilities of three global precipitation measurement (GPM) integrated multisatellite retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products in tropical flood hazard mapping in the Kelantan River Basin (KRB), Malaysia, using the GIS-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. In addition to the precipitation factor, another eleven factors that contribute to flooding in the KRB were included in the AHP method. The findings demonstrated that the spatial pattern and percentage area affected by floods simulated under the IMERG-Early (IMERG-E), IMERG-Late (IMERG-L), and IMERG-Final (IMERG-F) products did not differ significantly. The receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed that all three IMERG products performed well in generating flood hazard maps, with area under the curve values greater than 0.8. Almost all the recorded historical floods were placed in the moderate-to-very-high flood hazard areas, with only 1-2% found in the low flood hazard areas. The middle and lower parts of the KRB were identified as regions of "very high" and "high" hazard levels that require particular attention from local stakeholders.

I show that emotions matter as part of devising community-based and formal educational strategies for disaster risk reduction and preparedness. Focus is on exploring young people's everyday emotional experiences in situations of recurrent disaster risk, such as flooding and landslides. The article draws on lessons learned from participatory and community-based research with 30 young people in the urban periphery of Sao Paulo, Brazil, as well as educational approaches on dealing with climate anxiety and ecological distress. Results indicate that participants tended to 'normalise' risk while using hu-mour to engage with difficult emotions. Results however also show that with the tools at hand to acknowledge, validate and engage with the emotions of disaster risk, youth can develop and cultivate hope, improve individual coping behaviours, and recognise their agency without min-imising or denying their experience. To guide interdisciplinary disaster risk scholars and practi-tioners in developing a process of reflective participation and collaborative peer-and intergenerational learning about disaster risk, I developed the EMPOWER framework. I suggest that by openly engaging with and sharing emotions across the researcher/practitioner and participant divide, we can develop critical reflexivity and collective hope as part of a praxis for improved wellbeing and disaster preparedness.

This study highlights the important contribution of vegetation belowground biomass to marsh stability and identifies loss of vegetation as a critical driver of marsh collapse. We investigated the shear strength of salt marshes and unvegetated interior ponds using a modified cone penetrometer along a chronosequence of wetland marsh collapse (0 to 21 + years following pond formation) to characterize changes in the structural integrity of the marsh soil. Following conversion from vegetated marsh to open water pond, the surficial soils experienced a dramatic loss in shear strength resulting from the loss of vegetation and compaction of soil pore space. The Cone Penetrometer Testing (CPT) data indicate that higher shear strength in the surficial layers of the vegetated marsh sites were never recovered, up to 21 + years following marsh collapse. Coupled with significant elevation loss from marsh collapse, additional sea-level rise, deep subsidence, and reduced sedimentation may contribute to conditions that can exceed critical flooding thresholds, making recovery from marsh collapse difficult or impossible. Therefore, characterizing mechanisms and thresholds of marsh collapse are critical for identifying those coastal marshes that are vulnerable to collapse before conversion from vegetated marsh to open water occurs.

We investigated deadwood, widely recognized as an indicator for forest biodiversity, in riparian forests of the Mura-DravaDanube Transboundary Biosphere Reserve. The Biosphere Reserve is a conservation area that spans five countries and three rivers located in south-eastern Europe. In detail, we analyzed the drivers of lying deadwood volume, occurrence and decay related to floodplain type, silvicultural management, and climatic conditions using regression models. Lying deadwood occurrence and volume significantly decreased as distance from the river edge increased, indicating that river dynamics likely play a role in deadwood accumulation in riparian forests. Deadwood volume was also positively influenced by stand basal area, a parameter that can be directly addressed by silvicultural management. Deadwood decay was affected positively by temperature and negatively by precipitation, highlighting the importance of climatic conditions on decay progression. However, in order to draw more accurate conclusions about the drivers and dynamics of deadwood in riparian forests, further monitoring efforts that consider river flooding and flow regime, deadwood transport and saproxylic organism activity in addition to forest management and site conditions, are needed.

J	Hettiarachchi, S; Wasko, C; Sharma, A				Hettiarachchi, Suresh; Wasko, Conrad; Sharma, Ashish			Rethinking urban storm water management through resilience - The case for using green infrastructure in our warming world	CITIES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RESILIENCE; INCREASE; DESIGN; IMPACT; INDEX; RISK	Urban flooding is one of the greatest threats to life and property, further exacerbated by the impacts of a warming climate. Balancing the increasing demand for liveable space with infrastructure for urban stormwater management presents a planning conundrum. Traditional thinking and design in urban stormwater is reaching limits in adequacy, or have foreboding implementation costs. We argue that a shift in design philosophy from resisting flooding to resilience can reframe this challenge towards viable solutions. We also propose that a simpler way of assessing urban flood resilience is needed to make the shift away from a single event design approach. To that end a Simple Urban Flood Resilience Index (SUFRI) is developed as the basis and the tool for rethinking urban flood management in a future climate. SUFRI offers a "simple " framework for urban flood management as it is based only on hydrologic and hydraulic modelling. We use SUFRI to evaluate the use of green infrastructure in combatting the threat of urban flooding in warmer climatic conditions. Results show that green infrastructure remains effective during more frequent storms (~80th percentile) that can occur in warmer climatic conditions and retrofitting or converting a smaller than expected percentage of the urban landscape (up to 5 %) can yield appreciable benefits. Overall, we show that the flexibility and adaptability needed to address the highly variable urban flood response in warmer climates is implicit within resilience based flood management approaches.

Assessing placement bias of the global river gauge network	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							FRESH-WATER; HEADWATER STREAMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; TRACKING; MODEL; SCALE	Hydrologic data collected from river gauges inform critical decisions for allocating water resources, conserving ecosystems and predicting the occurrence of droughts and floods. The current global river gauge network is biased towards large, perennial rivers, and strategic adaptations are needed to capture the full scope of rivers on Earth. Knowing where and when rivers flow is paramount to managing freshwater ecosystems. Yet stream gauging stations are distributed sparsely across rivers globally and may not capture the diversity of fluvial network properties and anthropogenic influences. Here we evaluate the placement bias of a global stream gauge dataset on its representation of socioecological, hydrologic, climatic and physiographic diversity of rivers. We find that gauges are located disproportionally in large, perennial rivers draining more human-occupied watersheds. Gauges are sparsely distributed in protected areas and rivers characterized by non-perennial flow regimes, both of which are critical to freshwater conservation and water security concerns. Disparities between the geography of the global gauging network and the broad diversity of streams and rivers weakens our ability to understand critical hydrologic processes and make informed water-management and policy decisions. Our findings underscore the need to address current gauge placement biases by investing in and prioritizing the installation of new gauging stations, embracing alternative water-monitoring strategies, advancing innovation in hydrologic modelling, and increasing accessibility of local and regional gauging data to support human responses to water challenges, both today and in the future.

The Chinese government introduced the concept of Sponge City to improve the urban water ecological security, which is a systematic project. Taking the urban community as our research object, we studied the combination application of LID (low-impact development) measures and retention ponds in the community and then discussed the practicability of the systematic application of Sponge City facilities in the construction of community drainage systems. There are four simulation scenarios in SWMM (stormwater management model): traditional drainage scenario, LID scenario, retention pond scenario, and LID-retention pond scenario. By comparing the effects of different facilities on runoff and outflow under the six return periods of 1a, 2a, 5a, 10a, 20a, and 50a, we find that LID measures have evident effects on runoff and outflow reduction. Still, they are greatly affected by the return period. The retention pond has no noticeable impact on runoff, but it reduces the peak value of outflow and is less affected by the return period. The combination of LID and retention pond can combine their advantages, reduce the peak flow rate of the site stably and relieve the pressure of the urban drainage system. This study provides a basis for the graded implementation of Sponge City, especially for community-scale rainwater regulation.

Measuring the Supply of Ecosystem Services from Alternative Soil and Nutrient Management Practices: A Transdisciplinary, Field-Scale Approach	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						agroecology; agriculture; decisions; tradeoffs; social-ecological systems; water quality; climate regulation; soil health; aerator; manure injection	UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES; MANURE APPLICATION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; CARBON STOCKS; AGRICULTURE; FLUXES; AGROECOLOGY; FOOD	Farmers and policy makers pursue management practices that enhance water quality, increase landscape flood resiliency, and mitigate agriculture's contribution to climate change, all while remaining economically viable. This study presents a holistic assessment of how two practices influence the supply of these ecosystem services-the use of an aerator prior to manure application in haylands, and the stacked use of manure injection, cover crops, and reduced tillage in corn silage production. Field data are contextualized by semi-structured interviews that identify influences on adoption. Causal loop diagrams then illustrate feedbacks from ecosystem services onto decision making. In our study, unseen nutrient pathways are the least understood, but potentially the most important in determining the impact of a practice on ecosystem services supply. Subsurface runoff accounted for 64% to 92% of measured hydrologic phosphorus export. Average soil surface greenhouse gas flux constituted 38% to 73% of all contributions to the equivalent CO2 footprint of practices, sometimes outweighing carbon sequestration. Farmers identified interest in better understanding unseen nutrient pathways, expressed intrinsic stewardship motivations, but highlighted financial considerations as dominating decision making. Our analysis elevates the importance of financial supports for conservation, and the need for comprehensive understandings of agroecosystem performance that include hard-to-measure pathways.

How will hydrological connectivity between freshwater bodies be altered by future human alterations to the hydrological cycle? Where does water go when it rains? Or what is the future space-time variability of flood and drought events? However, the answers to these questions will vary with location due to the specific and often poorly understood local boundary conditions and system properties that control the functional behaviour of a catchment or any other hydrologic control volume. We suggest that an open, shared and evolving perceptual model of a region's hydrology is critical to tailor our science questions, as it would be for any other study domain from the plot to the continental scale. In this opinion piece, we begin to discuss the elements of and point out some knowledge gaps in the perceptual model of the terrestrial water cycle of Great Britain. We discuss six major knowledge gaps and propose four key ways to reduce them. While the specific knowledge gaps in our perceptual model do not necessarily transfer to other places, we believe that the development of such perceptual models should be at the core of the debate for all hydrologic communities, and we encourage others to have a similar debate for their hydrologic domain.

Simulations focus on orographic precipitation produced when an atmospheric river interacts with topography. MCMC-based analysis reveals that different combinations of parameter values produce a similar precipitation distribution, with the most influential parameters being relative humidity (RH), horizontal wind speed (U), surface potential temperature (theta (sfc)), and the snow fall speed coefficient (A(s)). RH, U, and A(s) exhibit interdependence: changes in one or more of these factors can be mitigated by compensating changes in the other(s) to produce similar orographic precipitation rates. The results also indicate that the parameter sensitivities and relationships can vary for spatial subregions and given different environmental conditions. In particular, high theta (sfc) values are more likely to produce the target precipitation rate and spatial distribution, and thus the ensemble of simulations shows a preference for liquid precipitation at the surface. The results presented here highlight the complexity of orographic precipitation controls, and have implications for flood and water management, observational efforts, and climate change.

These have resulted in the transformation, upgrade and provision of new health facilities across the country. Despite these efforts, the sector still faces challenges of inadequate infrastructure. Furthermore, the existing facilities may be threatened by the occurrences of disasters in the country. The Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), which contains the most advanced health facilities in the country is one area perceived to be most vulnerable to disasters. Hence, this study uses a multiple approach to identify and assess health facilities highly exposed to hazards and may be vulnerable should disaster occur. It samples 60 health facilities from twelve municipalities in the GAMA area for the assessment. The study reveals flooding as a key threat to health facilities in the entire GAMA area but identifies Accra metropolitan area as a locality with most exposed health facilities. Furthermore, the study discovers that, many of the health facilities in GAMA are clustered in a highly vulnerable enclave of about 20 km radius and estimates that, occurrence of any \disaster within this area could affect more than twenty facilities and deny healthcare services to over two hundred thousand people. It suggests collective efforts from all stakeholders to secure and protect these facilities as priority for resilience.

How do heat and flood risk drive residential green infrastructure implementation in Phoenix, Arizona?	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Green infrastructure; Heat; Flooding; Ecosystem services; Climate change; Risk perceptions	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; URBAN; IMPACTS; CITIES; ISLAND; PARTICIPATION; MICROCLIMATES; VULNERABILITY; TEMPERATURES; ADAPTATION	Green infrastructure is an increasingly popular strategy to simultaneously address challenges associated with urbanization and global environmental change, including increased flooding and rising temperatures. While many cities aim to expand green infrastructure to deliver ecosystem services, their impacts will be limited without significant uptake on private property. Most studies and programs to date focus on public land, so little is known about what would motivate private residents to implement green infrastructure. This study addresses this gap, combining household survey and spatial data from the Phoenix metropolitan region in Arizona by examining what factors predict green infrastructure implementation, with a particular focus on flooding and heat risks. The results suggest that residents are generally aware of their relative exposure to these hazards, but their risk perceptions do not translate into increased implementation of green infrastructure. Prior experience of flood damage is a predictor of stormwater infrastructure implementation, but experience with heat did not impact planting vegetation to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures. Instead, the decision to implement green infrastructure is likely constrained by limited capacity based on income and homeownership, which can impede people's ability to make management decisions on private residential property. More research is needed to unpack the seemingly complex factors that shape residents' decisions to implement green infrastructure on their property.

Return Level Analysis of the Hanumante River Using Structured Expert Judgment: A Reconstruction of Historical Water Levels	WATER			English	Article						Structured Expert Judgment; water levels; flood risk; return level analysis; Hanumante River; Kathmandu		Like other cities in the Kathmandu Valley, Bhaktapur faces rapid urbanisation and population growth. Rivers are negatively impacted by uncontrolled settlements in flood-prone areas, lowering permeability, decreasing channels widths, and waste blockage. All these issues, along with more extreme rain events during the monsoon due to climate change, have led to increased flooding in Bhaktapur, especially by the Hanumante River. For a better understanding of flood risk, the first step is a return level analysis. For this, historical data are essential. Unfortunately, historical records of water levels are non-existent for the Hanumante River. We measured water levels and discharge on a regular basis starting from the 2019 monsoon (i.e., June). To reconstruct the missing historical data needed for a return level analysis, this research introduces the Classical Model for Structured Expert Judgment (SEJ). By employing SEJ, we were able to reconstruct historical water level data. Expert assessments were validated using the limited data available. Based on the reconstructed data, it was possible to estimate the return periods of extreme water levels of the Hanumante River by fitting a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Using this distribution, we estimated that a water level of about 3.5 m has a return period of ten years. This research showed that, despite considerable uncertainty in the results, the SEJ method has potential for return level analyses.

Impact of Relative Sea-Level Rise on Low-Lying Coastal Areas of Catalonia, NW Mediterranean, Spain	WATER			English	Article						inundation; sea-level rise; coastal habitats; deltas; wetlands; adaptation; accommodation space; high-impact scenario	EBRO DELTA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CARRYING-CAPACITY; SOIL-SALINITY; SALT MARSHES; COSTA BRAVA; FLOOD RISK; WETLANDS	Low-lying coastal areas are high-risk areas regarding sea-level rise (SLR) due to the combination of low elevation, subsidence and currently low sediment supply, on the one hand, and their high natural and socio-economic values, on the other. Because of this, there is a growing need to assess the integrated impact of SLR taking into account the interactions between physical and ecological factors to make more informed decisions for the design of adaptation strategies. This study presents a methodology for improved SLR-induced flood-damage assessments in natural areas which is composed of (i) a pseudo-dynamic method coupling equilibrium-based coastal response and classical bathtub modeling approaches and (ii) a simple method to account for habitat conversion following inundation. This methodology is applied to low-lying coastal areas of Catalonia under different SLR scenarios, which show very different sensitivities depending on the configuration of the water-land border, topography, geomorphology, and degree of human impact on the floodplain. In terms of potential impact, natural habitats will be the most benefited from the likely conversion at the expense of agriculture lands. This can help coastal managers to adopt adaptation strategies where considering the inherent capacity of some coastal landscapes to adapt opens up new alternatives.

In this study, we examined long-term trends in groundwater levels across the DMR from 1996 to 2018. Station level data collected by the Central Groundwater Board for 258 stations at the seasonal scale were visualized and interpreted using geospatial analysis. The spatial patterns of the trends in groundwater levels revealed increasing depths of groundwater levels, except the Yamuna River floodplains. The main cause for the decline is related to the rapid growth in population accompanied with high-density impervious urban land uses, leading to lower levels of recharge vs unlimited withdrawal of groundwater for daily needs. In addition, the local geology in the form of clayey soils in northwest DMR also contributed to the lower levels of recharge. The results of the analysis enabled us to establish the trend and delineate the zones of differential recharge. Furthermore, the level of contaminants were analyzed at the district level for fluorides and nitrates. The presence of fluoride contamination was mostly concentrated in the northwestern district, while the nitrate exceedance was more widespread. These findings will help in achieving the 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of United Nations by 2030 as well as goals identified in Delhi's master plan of 2041.

Different indexes may provide differing results in terms of the detection and estimation of the temporal and spatial extent of droughts. In this study, the temporal and spatial characteristics of rainfall and drought at 53 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2016 across the Xinjiang region of China were analyzed. Four precipitation-related indexes (precipitation concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP), standardized precipitation index (SPI), and long-cycle drought-flood abrupt alternation index (LDFAI)) were used to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of drought and flood. In addition, the Bayesian method and Pettitt test were used as detection tools to identify changing points in precipitation time series. The study indicated the following: (1) a wetting tendency was evident in recent years and was supported by the upward trend in SPI and inter-decadal variation in summer precipitation; (2) the spatial patterns and tendencies of PCD, PCP, and SPI were markedly different in southern and northern Xinjiang; (3) compared with the Pettitt test, use of the Bayesian method provided data closer to the real drought events; (4) it is suggested that multiple indices be used for detecting precipitation and drought characteristics as use of the SPI may lead to other indexes related to flood and drought risks being ignored.

The simplified mathematical model Cellular Automata is combined with Motion Cost fields, which score the difficulty to traverse an area, to the urban inundation model CAMC. It is implemented with simple matrix and logic operations to achieve high computational efficiency. The development concentrated on an application in dense urban built-up areas with numerous buildings. CAMC is efficient and flexible enough to be used in a "live" urban flood warning system with current weather conditions. A case study is conducted in the German city of Wuppertal with about 12,000 buildings. The water depth estimation of every time step are visualized in a web-interface on the basis of the virtual globe NASA WorldWind. CAMC is compared with the shallow water equations-based model ANUGA. CAMC is approximatively 5 times faster than ANUGA at high spatial resolution and able to maintain numerical stability. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (0.61), Root Mean Square Error (0.39 m) and Index of Agreement (0.65) indicate acceptable agreement for water depth estimation but identify different areas where important deviations occur. The estimation of velocity performs considerably less well (0.34 for Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, 0.13 ms-1for Root Mean Square Error, and 0.39 for Index of Agreement) because CA ignores momentum conservation.

Riparian Ulmus minor Mill. populations have been massively reduced by Dutch Elm disease (DED). However, resistant genotypes were selected to restore lost populations. To understand the acclimation mechanisms to the succession of abiotic stresses, ramets of five DED-tolerant U. minor genotypes were subjected to flood and subsequently to drought. Physiological and biochemical responses were evaluated together with shifts in root-fungal assemblages. During both stresses, plants exhibited a decline in leaf net photosynthesis and an increase in percentage loss of stem hydraulic conductivity and in leaf and root proline content. Stomatal closure was produced by chemical signals during flood and hydraulic signals during drought. Despite broad similarities in plant response to both stresses, root-mycobiome shifts were markedly different. The five genotypes were similarly tolerant to moderate drought, however, flood tolerance varied between genotypes. In general, flood did not enhance drought susceptibility due to fast flood recovery, nevertheless, different responses to drought after flood were observed between genotypes. Associations were found between some fungal taxonomic groups and plant functional traits varying with flood and drought (e.g. proline, chlorophyll and starch content) indicating that the thriving of certain taxa depends on host responses to abiotic stress.

J	Gralepois, M				Gralepois, Mathilde			What Can We Learn from Planning Instruments in Flood Prevention? Comparative Illustration to Highlight the Challenges of Governance in Europe	WATER			English	Article						flood prevention; policy instruments; spatial planning; governance; resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; POLICY; INITIATIVES; NETHERLANDS; STABILITY; FRANCE	Studying the selection of planning instruments in flood prevention can be critical to gain a better understanding of governance. This choice is underestimated in the flood management literature. This paper fills a knowledge gap in flood management governance by examining the rationales for the choice of instruments. The study is grounded on a comparative illustration of planning instruments in flood prevention in three European countries: England, France and the Netherlands. Flood prevention through spatial planning is a specific example, as the implementation of the Floods Directive has reactivated the role of spatial planning in urban agglomerations. The choice of instruments is never neutral. In the field of flood management, alignment among strategies is supposed to lead to resilience. Instruments should be aligned and coherent. Is that the case? The article explains the challenges of governance configured by a conflict between the spatial planning policy steered by local authorities and the risk prevention policy led by national authorities. This model is further complicated by the tension between the preference for legal, technical or scientific instruments, and the difference in professional culture between planning and prevention. The selection of instrument shows that if their conflicts are exacerbated to debates on variables or parameters, it is because there is no political agreement on the balance between development and security.

Quick and effective management of flood risk relies on planning and preparedness to ensure the availability of supplies, shelters and emergency response personnel. The mandated government agency Department of Disaster Management (DDM) as well as local and international organizations play roles in producing, disseminating, and using accurate and timely information on flood risk. Currently, systematic flood risk maps are lacking, which leaves DDM to rely on inconsistent historic reports and local knowledge to inform their emergency planning. Although these types of knowledge are critical, they can be complemented to reduce bias and human error to planning processes and decisions. As such, the present situation has led to ineffective distribution of emergency response resources prior to flooding, leaving vulnerable populations less-than-prepared for inevitable flood events. Given these issues, we have developed a flood risk decision-support tool in collaboration with DDM. The tool uses surface water maps developed by the Joint Research Center (JRC), which were derived from more than 30 years of Landsat imagery. We have also incorporated population data, land cover data, and other information on flood exposure and vulnerability to create the first scalable and replicable Flood Risk Index (FRI) for flood risk reduction in Myanmar.

The method is based on the application of specific vulnerability matrices, accurately defined for each coastal zone (i.e. the backshore, foreshore, nearshore and offshore) where archaeological sites are actually located. Results allow identifying the vulnerability level of each specific site and the index therefore represents an operative tool for the definition of most suitable management actions for the protection and conservation of the archaeological heritage. In order to provide a first application of the proposed methodology, all coastal archaeological sites located in the Gulf of Naples (Southern Italy) have been investigated. The results are presented as a vulnerability map and highlight as seven archaeological sites present a high vulnerability level, four of which are located in two submerged archaeological parks (Underwater Archaeological parks of Baia and Gaiola). The other three sites (Terma Ginnasio, Pezzolo and Tiberio villas, 1st century BC) have no legal protection and therefore they require priority monitoring programs and preservation actions.

Genetic and phenotypic analyses indicate that resistance to flooding stress is uncoupled from performance in cultivated sunflower	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						abiotic stress; crop; flooding; genome-wide association mapping; sunflower (Helianthus annuus); trade-offs	TRADE-OFF; ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS; HELIANTHUS-ANNUUS; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; GROWTH; PLANT; REGULATOR; EVOLUTION; DEFENSE; TRAITS	Given the rising risk of extreme weather caused by climate change, enhancement of abiotic stress resistance in crops is increasingly urgent. But will the development of stress-resistant cultivars come at the cost of yield under ideal conditions? We hypothesize that this need not be inevitable, because resistance alleles with minimal pleiotropic costs may evade artificial selection and be retained in crop germplasm. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses for variation in plant performance and flooding response were conducted in cultivated sunflower, a globally important oilseed. We observed broad variation in flooding responses among genotypes. Flooding resistance was not strongly correlated with performance in control conditions, suggesting no inherent trade-offs. Consistent with this finding, we identified a subset of loci conferring flooding resistance, but lacking antagonistic effects on growth. Genetic diversity loss at candidate genes underlying these loci was significantly less than for other resistance genes during cultivated sunflower evolution. Despite bottlenecks associated with domestication and improvement, low-cost resistance alleles remain within the cultivated sunflower gene pool. Thus, development of cultivars that are both flooding-tolerant and highly productive should be straightforward.

Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis (ProNEVA) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). ProNEVA builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. ProNEVA is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peakover-threshold approach. ProNEVA is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance its implementation.

Chronology of Terra Firme formation in Amazonian lowlands reveals a dynamic Quaternary landscape	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Amazonia; Amazon river; Paleogeography; Fluvial evolution; Quaternary geochronology	WESTERN AMAZONIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEOGENE; RIVER; DIVERSIFICATION; SEDIMENTARY; EVOLUTION; HISTORY; SPECIATION; PATTERNS	In the Amazonian lowlands, the shift from a large wetland dominated by flooded forests (Varzea) to the modern incised valleys bounded by extensive areas of non-flooded forests (Terra Firme) is considered a key driver of the Amazonian mega-biodiversity. Dating the sedimentary beds covered by Terra Firme forest is crucial to constrain the timing of such landscape change. Here we determined the formation ages of widespread regions of Terra Firme substrates in central Amazonian lowlands combining optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, magnetostratigraphy and palinostratigraphy. Our data suggest a very dynamic fluvial system leading to a recent expansion of Terra Firme forests and retraction of Varzea forests during the late Pleistocene. The shift from an extensively flooded to non-flooded surface resulted from river incision around 45-35 ka, which potentially influenced the distribution of taxa by expanding available habitat, creating new barriers to dispersal, or changing the permeability of previous barriers. Transitions between flooded and non-flooded landscapes may have driven diversification and caused changes to species distributions, contributing to the high species diversity and biogeographic patterns currently found in the region. The late Quaternary evolution of Terra Firme substrates reveals that physical landscape changes play a major role in shaping biotic habitats even in the 10(4)-10(5) years time-scales.

A hydrological and water temperature modelling framework to simulate the timing of river freeze-up and ice-cover breakup in large-scale catchments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Stream temperature; Simulation; Freeze-up; Breakup; Athabasca river basin	LAND-SURFACE SCHEME; ATHABASCA RIVER; HISTORICAL TRENDS; FORT-MCMURRAY; VARIABILITY; LAKE; STREAMFLOW; IMPACTS; DROUGHT; EVENTS	Ice phenology, defined as the timing of freeze-up and ice-cover breakup, plays a key role in streamflow regimes in cold-region river catchments. River freeze-up and ice-cover breakup events are controlled by meteorological and hydrological variables. In this study, we present a modelling framework consisting of a physically-based semi-distributed hydrological model and the integration of a 1D stream temperature model that can predict the ice duration in cold region rivers. The hydrological model provides streamflow and hydraulic parameters for the stream temperature model to obtain instream water temperature. The model was successfully applied in the Athabasca River basin in western Canada. Calibration was carried out using the water temperature recorded in the stations at the towns of Hinton, Athabasca and Fort McMurray. Model results show consistent correspondence between simulated freeze-up and breakup dates and the hydrometric station data. In the main tributaries of the basin, freeze-up timing spans from the last week of September to the second week of November and ice-cover breakup occurs from the second week of March to the last week of May. The model presents an application of water temperature and ice phenology simulation which can be incorporated in ice-jam flood forecasting and future climate change studies.	[Morales-Marin, L.

Does the Nature of Floods Matter in the Risk Perception of Households? A Comparative Assessment among the Rural Households Prone to Flash and Riverine Floods in Pakistan	WATER			English	Article						climatic extremes; disasters; nature of floods; floods' damages; Pakistan	KHYBER PUKHTHUNKHWA PROVINCE; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; DISASTER; LEVEE; COMMUNICATION; COMMUNITIES; RESILIENCE	Floods have caused major losses and damages to people, infrastructure, and the environment. This study aims to assess the risk perception of households prone to riverine and flash floods and the perceived damages to infrastructure and livelihoods. Data were collected from 382 households through a questionnaire survey and analyzed using chi-squared and t-tests. Overall, risk perception was higher for riverine floods. Similarly, 'flood coping capacities', 'livelihood disruption', 'change in lifestyle/adjusting to floods', and 'change in the relationship' were also high for riverine floods and statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). The 'likelihood of future flood damages' perception was higher for flash floods (mean values: 0.913 vs. 0.779), while the 'infrastructural damages' showed the same results. The perceptions of 'livelihoods' and perceived 'economic loss' were greater for riverine floods (p-value < 0.05). The perceptions of 'livestock damages' and 'household damages' were higher for flash floods.

We use the quasi-random flooding generated by Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston in August 2017, to understand the implications of flood losses for households with differing access to insurance and credit. Outside the floodplain, credit-constrained homeowners experience a 20% increase in bankruptcies and a 13% increase in the share of debt in severe delinquency in flooded blocks relative to non-flooded areas. Treatment effects are universally insignificant inside the floodplain, implying that flood insurance mitigates the financial impact of flooding across the credit distribution. Disaster assistance, on the other hand, does not appear to counteract the role of initial inequalities on post-disaster credit outcomes. We find SBA disaster loans and, more surprisingly, FEMA grants to both be regressive in allocation. Our results highlight that averages mask important heterogeneity after disasters, which challenges existing narratives of how effectively Federal disaster programs mitigate the financial burden of natural disasters.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The study was aimed to assess flood danger and map inundation areas in Ethiopia's Teji watershed, which is prone to flooding. The basic flood-producing factors in this study were derived from soil, slope, elevation, drainage-density and land use land cover data. The opinions of public institutions and expert decisions were gathered to determine the weight of the factors in the analytic hierarchy process. The collected data were processed using the ArcGIS environment and the analytic hierarchy method to produce a flood danger map. According to the findings of this study, approximately 43.28 and 13.09% of the area were vulnerable to high and very high flood risk zones, respectively. As a result, flood prediction, early warning and management practices could be implemented on a regular and sustainable basis.

J	Salman, A; Hurlbert, M				Salman, Alida; Hurlbert, Margot			Social Learning Resulting from Three Consecutive Flood Events in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada	WATER			English	Article						social learning; flood; climate change; flood risk management	RISK GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; KNOWLEDGE	This paper explores the social learning, and its drivers and outcomes, in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada, following flooding events that occurred in 2010, 2014, and 2016. The data for this study came from 15 semi-structured interviews and 110 newspaper articles concerning the flood events and infrastructure upgrades. Research demonstrates that the flood experience and the interactions and communications between the City, Council, and the public have produced social learning. However, this learning has been single- and double-loop learning. While the data revealed no explicit barriers to social learning, the perception that the public cannot contribute to stormwater management issues may have inhibited the degree of social learning that was achieved. As a result of social learning, Yorkton is now more prepared to deal with future flood events, both in terms of prevention and emergency response. However, social learning is diminishing as a result of the passage of time and the false sense of safety that the infrastructure upgrades create. Diminishing social learning has policy implications for Yorkton as the city has not yet implemented all the proposed flood upgrades.

A Predictive Human Health Risk Assessment of Non-Choleraic <i>Vibrio</i> spp. during Hurricane-Driven Flooding Events in Coastal South Carolina, USA	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						sea level rise (SLR); storm surge; health vulnerability; septicemia; relative risk model (RRM)	UNITED-STATES; VULNIFICUS; INFECTIONS; CLIMATE; IMPACT; PARAHAEMOLYTICUS	Densely populated, low-lying coastal areas are most at-risk for negative impacts from increasing intensity of storm-induced flooding. Due to the effects of global warming and subsequent climate change, coastal temperatures and the magnitude of storm-induced flooding are projected to increase, creating a hospitable environment for the aquatic Vibrio spp. bacteria. A relative risk model analysis was used to determine which census block groups in coastal South Carolina have the highest risk of Vibrio spp. exposure using storm surge flooding as a proxy. Coastal block groups with dense vulnerable sub-populations exposed to storm surge have the highest relative risk, while inland block groups away from riverine-mediated storm surge have the lowest relative risk. As Vibriosis infections may be extremely severe or even deadly, the best methods of infection control will be regular standardized coastal and estuarine water monitoring for Vibrio spp. to enable more informed and timely public health advisories and help prevent future exposure.

The purpose of this study is to propose an approach for reducing urban flood damage and improving urban resilience. Urban flooding vulnerability analysis used land use and building characteristics as evaluation indicators. Disaster resilience analysis of urban planning facilities focused on urban and spatial aspects. The results of these analyses were overlapped to analyze whether urban planning facilities were properly located in areas vulnerable to urban flooding. The result of mapping the two results showed that there are some urban planning facilities with low resilience in the Red Zone, the central commercial area of Changwon, which has the highest vulnerability. This zone should have the appropriate placement of high-resilience facilities, such as disaster prevention facilities and space facilities. This study proposes a method to minimize flood damage in urban space. This system can cope with and systematically manage flood damage by increasing disaster resilience through appropriate land use planning and site selection for urban planning facilities.

The research method applied was firstly to create a timeline of each disaster process with disaster responses by referring to newspapers, literature, and others, then the facts were categorized with similar social conditions and government responses to establish a hypothesis. Field surveys were conducted to verify the hypothesis. The research outcome shows the human suffering exacerbation processes of these three large-scale disasters can be seen that the pattern of the process is the same; however, the duration and content of each disaster are quite different. These differences mainly depend on social backgrounds, disaster subculture, and disaster management by local and national governments. Based on the above research findings, a useful view for disaster investigation and disaster management is clarified, along with the possible contributions of disaster countermeasures' timeline development, especially for the disaster management in metropolitan areas.

The initiative, while following the U.S. low impact development with a concept also similar to the U.K. sustainable drainage systems and Australian water sensitive cities, is subject to a major design issue in practice with infrastructure projects of similar types adopted unanimously across regions despite spatially diverse and heterogeneous hydrological and biophysical conditions. The ecosystem services framework as applied to the urban setting, particularly its holistic consideration of ecosystem structure and management intervention in relation to services or benefits delivery, can and should guide the planning, design, development, and evaluation of relevant projects or nature-based practices for carrying out the policy initiative, a perspective of practical value with foreseeable transformative impact that has received little recognition in China's current green urban movement toward water resilience and sustainability.

In the Palmarin peninsula, in the Saloum estuary, previous studies showed shoreline retreat rates of 1.20 m/yr in 1982 and 2.20 m in 1954-2002; our results show an increase to 2.45 m/yr in 2005-2010, 2.60 m/yr in 2010-2014 and 3.05 m/yr in 2014-2018. The main cause seems to be sea level rise, as there are not significant human factors. Short-term estimates show probable damages in two villages (Ngallou and Djiffer), where buildings are already being destroyed, tourist camps near the beaches and on the road that crosses the peninsula. There is also a significant risk that coastal erosion would connect the sea and the intertidal mud flat areas of the Saloum estuary, fragmenting the peninsula in several islands, changing the evolution of erosive processes and producing a decline of the mangroves, and with them of fishing. It is urgent to develop an adaptation plan for this area, to address the possible consequences of coastal erosion on the assets and activities of the population.

A concept is developed for integrating aspects of disaster risk, hazard, vulnerability and resilience with critical infrastructure analytic components such as redundancy, rapidity or resourcefulness. These components are expressed for each phase of an unfolding flood event and cascading effects are indicated, too. This contribution discusses the implications of such a conceptual frame for the advancement of existing flood risk management concepts. Current international guiding strategies such as the United Nations Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the "Making Cities Resilient" campaigns in field of urban disaster resilience, Climate Change Adaptation processes such as the Paris Agreement of the IPCC process, or urban planning in the field of UN HABITAT are all interconnected to the topic of (critical) infrastructure.

They are an important part of atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle. Changes in convective clouds in changing climate remain one of the most challenging aspects of forecasting future climate change. The present research focuses on identification of convective clouds using multispectral measurements at split window channels (near 10.5 mu m and 12.5 mu m) and water vapour absorption channels (near 6.7 mu m) from Meteosat 7 observations. Variability of convective clouds has been examined in warming climate using observations from Meteosat First Generation (MFG). It has been reported that convective clouds show high density over Western, Central, North Eastern Indian region, and the Western Ghats during the monsoon period. This observation is consistent with measurement from Precipitation Radar (PR) (reflectivity-based threshold) on-board Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and rain gauge-based product. The present technique fails to detect shallow convective clouds over the Western Ghats. An increase of about 32.68% +/- 5.81% per degree increase in temperature has been reported in convective clouds over India.

For several decades, various water conserving technologies have been studied in order to significantly increase water use efficiency (WUE). The objective of this paper is to review the main technologies and approaches for assessing the water requirements of rice crop in order to contribute to water saving in irrigated rice production, after clarifying the performance indicators of the irrigated systems. Several scientific articles from previous studies were consulted and analyzed. These studies showed that irrigation water conservation includes a wide range of practices, staring from the crop irrigation water requirements assessment to the implementation of the water saving practices on the field. In addition, irrigation water conservation technologies could be categorized into three groups, namely water-conserving irrigation systems, water-saving irrigation methods, and water-conserving agronomic practices. The influence of the individual and combined irrigation water use efficiency tools was highlighted. This paper will enable researchers to acquire knowledge on water-saving methods for estimating the rice crop water requirements and thus allow them to effectively contribute to improve the performance of irrigated rice cultivation systems using various water conservation technologies.

We used regression models to estimate the association between facility flood risk and social vulnerability indicators in low-lying block groups in California. We applied dasymetric mapping techniques to refine facility boundaries and population estimates and probabilistic SLR projections to estimate facilities' future flood risk. We estimate that 423 facilities are at risk of flooding in 2100 under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). One unit standard deviation increases in nonvoters, poverty rate, renters, residents of color, and linguistically isolated households were associated with a 1.5-2.2 times higher odds of the presence of an at-risk site within 1 km (ORs [95% CIs]: 2.2 [1.8, 2.8], 1.9 [1.5, 2.3], 1.7 [1.4, 1.9], 1.5 [1.2, 1.9], and 1.5 [1.2, 1.9], respectively). Among block groups near at least one at-risk site, the number of sites increased with poverty, proportion of renters and residents of color, and lower voter turnout. These results underscore the need for further research and disaster planning that addresses the differential hazards and health risks of SLR.

Using historical data from the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the temporal and spatial relationships between the changes in the aquatic environment and the locust dynamics in the downstream areas of the Yellow River were investigated via quantitative statistics, and other factors affecting locust outbreaks were also studied. This study demonstrated that locust, drought and flood outbreaks were spatiotemporally correlated. Locusts and droughts were synchronous for long-term series, but locust outbreaks were weakly correlated with floods. In drought years, the probability of a locust outbreak occurring in the same month as a drought was higher than that in other years and months. The probability of a locust outbreak was higher in the one to two years following a flood than in other years, but locusts were not easily triggered by extreme flooding. In the waterlogged and riverine locust breeding areas, locust outbreaks were more closely related to flooding and drought than in other breeding areas. Affected by the diversion of the Yellow River, the areas of frequent locust outbreaks were around riverine areas. In addition, climate change affects the hydrothermal conditions in which locusts occur, and human activities influence the occurrence of locusts by changing their habitats. Analyzing the relationship between historical locust outbreaks and water system changes provides valuable information for formulating and implementing disaster prevention and mitigation policies in this region.

The Elephant Marsh, Malawi - Part 2: two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling in support of an eco-social assessment	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; DRIFT; flood attenuation; sedimentation; Shire River; RMA2	DISCHARGE RATING CURVES; UNCERTAINTY; BASIN	The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and a wetland, characterised by a complex mosaic of meandering channels, marshland and shallow lakes. In 2016, the Marsh was granted RAMSAR status based on a series of supporting studies, including the modelling of eco-social options for managing its ecological condition. This paper describes two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic modelling using RMA2, in support of this eco-social assessment. The hydraulic model was parameterised using mostly existing data but augmented with bathymetric channel and lake surveys. Calibration and verification used water level data from the hydrometric network for the period 1999 to 2009. Generally, observed water level time-series are well replicated in the model, but there are large discrepancies prior to this period. These are due to temporal changes in hydraulic controls, mainly sedimentation, but also breaching of an embankment at the downstream end of the Marsh. Selected hydraulic-habitat variables (based on daily hydrological time-series 1976 to 2009) provide the indictors of hydrological and hydraulic change used to inform a DRIFT eco-social assessment. The Marsh displays moderate flood attenuation characteristics, but the importance of this will likely increase under continued sedimentation and predicted climate futures, which include more severe storms. The 2-D modelling contributes to an improved understanding of the Marsh's hydraulic behaviour, particularly regarding anthropogenic influences since the early 1900s.	[Birkhead, A.

Within the Delta, several key junctions route smolts either towards more direct paths to the ocean or towards the interior Delta, an area associated with decreased survival. Movements within these junctions that determine route choice can be influenced by numerous behavioral and environmental factors, including the complex interplay between tidal and riverine hydraulics. Here, we apply continuous time multistate Markov models to examine the influence of tidal and riverine hydraulics, behavioral factors, and management actions on smolt movements. These models incorporate more information from acoustic telemetry data compared with previous approaches to modeling smolt movements in the Delta. By decomposing modeled flows into tidal and net flow signals we elucidate how each component influences movements into and out of distributary channels. Increasing net flows generally increased movement rates, while flood tides decreased seaward movement rates. Similarly, ebb tides increased downstream movements as fish go with the flow. We found less support for diel movement behaviors compared to flow metrics. Additionally, we quantify the effects of a large management action, the placement of a physical barrier, which was effective at decreasing entrainment into the interior Delta. Together, these results help inform management of Chinook Salmon and increase our understanding of the major factors driving smolt movements within these key junctions.

The annual damage distribution is used to analyze the impact on the macro-scale agglomeration described with the unified damage function in the case study of the river Kupa, Croatia. The agglomeration damage function is derived through the unit damage function and estimated distribution of building thresholds within the studied agglomeration. The unit damage is described with the shape function, which can easily accommodate different forms of damage assessment depending on the available information. The estimated distribution of annual maximum flood levels is propagated through the agglomeration damage function into the annual damage distribution derived using higher-order statistical moments and presented with the exceedance probability, indicating the likelihood that a certain annual maximum damage can be exceeded. Besides the aleatory uncertainty of annual maximum flood levels, we analyzed the impact of the uncertainty in estimating the unit damage function upon the annual damage distribution. This uncertainty shows a significant impact on the shape of the annual damage distribution, particularly in the region of extreme flood events. Analyzing the annual damage distribution range, resulting from the uncertainty in damage functions, provides more information to policymakers in assessing the potential consequences on the future spatial planning programs, particularly from the strategic environmental assessment point of view.

"Late-stage" deforestation enhances storm trends in coastal West Africa	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						deforestation; West Africa; convective storms; rainfall; sea breeze	MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMAZON BASIN; RAINFALL; IMPACT; LAND; FREQUENCY; SOILS	Deforestation affects local and regional hydroclimate through changes in heating and moistening of the atmosphere. In the tropics, deforestation leads to warming, but its impact on rainfall is more complex, as it depends on spatial scale and synoptic forcing. Most studies have focused on Amazonia, highlighting that forest edges locally enhance convective rainfall, whereas rainfall decreases over drier, more extensive, deforested regions. Here, we examine Southern West Africa (SWA), an example of "late-stage" deforestation, ongoing since 1900 within a 300-km coastal belt. From three decades of satellite data, we demonstrate that the upward trend in convective activity is strongly modulated by deforestation patterns. The frequency of afternoon storms is enhanced over and downstream of deforested patches on length scales from 16 to 196 km, with greater increases for larger patches. The results are consistent with the triggering of storms by mesoscale circulations due to landscape heterogeneity. Near the coast, where sea breeze convection dominates the diurnal cycle, storm frequency has doubled in deforested areas, attributable to enhanced land-sea thermal contrast. These areas include fastgrowing cities such as Freetown and Monrovia, where enhanced storm frequency coincides with high vulnerability to flash flood-ing. The proximity of the ocean likely explains why ongoing deforestation across SWA continues to increase storminess, as it favors the impact of mesoscale dynamics over moisture availability.

Characterization of a glacial paleo-outburst flood using high-resolution 3-D seismic data: Bjornelva River Valley, SW Barents Sea	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						Arctic glaciology; climate change; fluvial transport; glacier hydrology; Jokulhlaups (GLOFs)	ICE-STREAM; MELTWATER FEATURES; DRAINAGE SYSTEM; PLEISTOCENE; GEOMORPHOLOGY; CHANNEL; BJORNOYRENNA; DYNAMICS; MISSOULA; GERMANY	Proglacial braided river systems discharge large volumes of meltwater from ice sheets and transport coarse-grained sediments from the glaciated areas to the oceans. Here, we test the hypothesis if high-energy hydrological events can leave distinctive signatures in the sedimentary record of braided river systems. We characterize the morphology and infer a mode of formation of a 25 km long and 1-3 km wide Early Pleistocene incised valley recently imaged in 3-D seismic data in the Hoop area, SW Barents Sea. The fluvial system, named Bjornelva River Valley, carved 20 m deep channels into Lower Cretaceous bedrock at a glacial paleo-surface and deposited 28 channel bars along a paleo-slope gradient of similar to 0.64 m km(-1). The landform morphologies and position relative to the paleo-surface support that Bjornelva River Valley was formed in the proglacial domain of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet. Based on valley width and valley depth, we suggest that Bjornelva River Valley represents a braided river system fed by violent outburst floods from a glacial lake, with estimated outburst discharges of similar to 160 000 m 3 s(-1). The morphological configuration of Bjornelva River Valley can inform geohazard assessments in areas at risk of outburst flooding today and is an analogue for landscapes evolving in areas currently covered by the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

J	Speight, LJ; Cranston, MD; White, CJ; Kelly, L				Speight, Linda J.; Cranston, Michael D.; White, Christopher J.; Kelly, Laura			Operational and emerging capabilities for surface water flood forecasting	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						decision making; flood forecasting; operational; pluvial; surface water		Surface water (or pluvial) flooding is caused by intense rainfall before it enters rivers or drainage systems. As the climate changes and urban populations grow, the number of people around the world at risk of surface water flooding is increasing. Although it may not be possible to prevent such flooding, reliable and timely flood forecasts can help improve preparedness and recovery. Unlike riverine and coastal flooding where forecasting methods are well established, surface water flood forecasting presents a unique challenge due to the high uncertainties around predicting the location, timing, and impact of what are typically localized events. Over the past 5 years, there has been rapid development of convection-permitting numerical weather prediction models, ensemble forecasting, and computational ability. It is now theoretically feasible to develop operational surface water forecasting systems. This paper identifies three approaches to surface water forecasting utilizing state-of-the-art meteorological forecasts: empirical-based scenarios, hydrological forecasts linked to presimulated impact scenarios, and real-time hydrodynamic simulation. Reviewing operational examples of each approach provides an opportunity to learn from international best practice to develop targeted, impact-based, surface water forecasts to support informed decision-making. Although the emergence of new meteorological and hydrological forecasting capabilities is promising, there remains a scientific limit to the predictability of convective rainfall. To overcome this challenge, we suggest that a rethink of the established role of flood forecasting is needed, alongside the development of interdisciplinary solutions for communicating uncertainty and making the best use of all available data to increase preparedness.

In this study, we intend to balance the comprehensiveness and objectivity in the performance assessment of SUDS development through a combination of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis and mathematical quantification. We proposed an MCDM framework with eight quantifiable indicators, including flood mitigation capacity, pollution control capacity from technical criteria, life-cycle cost, damage cost, recreational function from socioeconomic criteria, biotope area ratio from ecological criteria, and spatial consistency from political criteria. A city-scale model based on engineering datasets and satellite images was created to implement gray and green infrastructure strategies in the studied area. Results revealed that gray strategies performed better in hydraulic improvements, mitigating approximately 17% of flood magnitude and decreasing over 20% of flood-induced damage. Green strategies were more eco-friendly, removing approximately 60% of non-point pollution and improving at most 15% of the ecological level. Integrated assessment demonstrated that the combine-used strategy showed the overall best performance, with a sustainability index of 0.676. Therefore, the methods and results in this study could provide additional improvements in the decision-making process of SUDS development. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Natural hazards and livestock damage in Bangladesh	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Cyclone; Flood; Drought; Waterlogging; Hailstorm; Tornado; Hotspots; Economy		Natural hazards are very common in Bangladesh that take place every year and damage crops, livestock and settlements. Data on livestock, flood, drought, cyclone, tide, thunderstorm, hailstorm, waterlogging, tornado and economic damages were collected from the existing literature for 2009-2014. Hotspots of natural hazards and damaged area coverage were determined based on total score, and IDRISI3.2 was used to prepare maps. About 10-32% areas in Bangladesh are moderate to very high natural hazard-prone. Moderate and high drought vulnerabilities were observed in about 14% areas for livestock production. Low and very low flood hazards for livestock could be found in about 22-44% areas. Hotspots for cyclones covered about 17% areas, high and very high storm/tides in about 22% areas and no safe zone against thunderstorm. Hailstorm damages more livestock in north and northwest part of the country covering about 23.8% areas. Moderate damages by tornado are distributed in 84% areas. Waterlogging hotspots are in southern part of Bangladesh that covers about 7% areas and livestock in about 52% areas suffered from low to moderate waterlogging problems. As a whole, natural hazards mentioned above are responsible for economic loss of < 1-35 million US$ and < 1-11.8 million US$ in livestock and poultry sectors depending on locations. Such loss in livestock sector is like to be increased in future because of climate change impacts, indicating that proper shelter and early warning systems must be in place to minimize damages in livestock sector from natural hazards.

Soil moisture behaviour in most models is constrained by hydraulic parameters that do not change. Here we argue that biological feedbacks from plants, macro-fauna and the microbiome influence soil structure, and thus the soil hydraulic parameters and the soil water content signals we observe. Incorporating biological feedbacks into soil hydrological models is therefore important for understanding environmental change and its impacts on ecosystems. We anticipate that environmental change will accelerate and modify soil hydraulic function. Increasingly, we understand the vital role that soil moisture exerts on the carbon cycle and other environmental threats such as heatwaves, droughts and floods, wildfires, regional precipitation patterns, disease regulation and infrastructure stability, in addition to agricultural production. Biological feedbacks may result in changes to soil hydraulic function that could be irreversible, resulting in alternative stable states (ASS) of soil moisture. To explore this, we need models that consider all the major feedbacks between soil properties and soil-plant-faunal-microbial-atmospheric processes, which is something we currently do not have. Therefore, a new direction is required to incorporate a dynamic description of soil structure and hydraulic property evolution into soil-plant-atmosphere, or land surface, models that consider feedbacks from land use and climate drivers of change, so as to better model ecosystem dynamics.

In this study, elements of stormwater processes - short-duration heavy rainfall, rainstorm intensity, drainage networks, surface temperature, the scouring process and the cumulative process of pollutants (SS, COD, TP and NH3_N), and, finally, the low impact development (LID) facilities at different recurrence periods-are simulated using the rainstorm intensity model, the scoured exponential model and the split-window algorithm. Land-use types and LID facilities in sponge cities greatly influence the spatial distribution of ecological stormwater processes. Rainstorm intensity, cumulative volume, flow rate and drainage capacity all increase in the initial stage of rainfall and decrease in the later stage, with an increase in rainfall duration. Rainfall, infiltration amount, runoff and rainstorm intensity all increase; however, the runoff coefficient and infiltration proportion decrease with an increase in the rainfall recurrence period. LID facilities can increase rainfall, peak flood delay time, area of low temperature zone, annual runoff control rate and runoff pollutant reduction rate at the recurrence periods of 1 a, 3 a, 5 a, 10 a, 20 a, 30 a and 50 a, especially during short-duration rainfall. The paper concludes LID facilities of sponge cities play an important role in weakening the effects of rain-, heat- and pollution-islands.

As precipitation variability increases due to climate change, the occurrence and magnitude of DFAA events are expected to increase. Using daily precipitation data for 1966-2018, we calculated the daily standardized precipitation index for middle-sized watersheds and evaluated the severity of DFAA events in South Korea. The severity of DFAA events was evaluated in two ways: the severity of whole period (SWP) represents the total magnitude of DFAA event, and the severity of transition period (STP) indicates the instantaneous severity of DFAA event during the transition from drought to flood. The severities were also graded by the quantiles to identify risk regions, and we used precipitation concentration degree (PCD) and precipitation concentration period (PCP) to analyze the relationship between DFAA events and precipitation trends in South Korea. The results showed that the STP in the Yeongsan River basin and SWP in the Han River and the Nakdong River basin were higher than in the other basins. In addition, considering patterns and trends of the PCF and PCP in South Korea, this study found that the frequency and severity of DFAA events were high during flood seasons when precipitation was concentrated.

Discussing the so far poorly constrained amplitude and mechanisms of sea-level changes during the PETM is the principal goal of the present study from the epicontinental Tarim seaway. A negative carbon isotope excursion precisely constrains the stratigraphic position of the PETM event within the Qimugen Formation. Microfacies data show that tidal and lagoonal carbonates or sandstone characterizing the Tarim seaway in the pre-PETM stage were gradually replaced by open-marine to middle-ramp marlstones at PETM onset, by outer-ramp mudrocks in the syn-PETM stage, and eventually by middle-ramp carbonates in the post-PETM stage. A deepening paleo-water depth trend documents a transgressive sequence leading to maximum flooding during PETM peak. The content of planktonic foraminifera in Qimugen Formation sediments deposited below storm wave base indicates a minimum paleo-water depth of 20-50 m. Regional and global comparisons of sea-level curves suggest that this sea level rise documented in the Tarim epicontinental seaway during the PETM is a largely eustatic consequence of global warming, inducing extensive melting of highmountain glaciers and thermal expansion of sea water.

Uttarakhand in the NW Himalaya has witnessed 2 major flood events in the last decade that killed more than 6000 people. This study is an attempt to explore the impact of potential flood on a riverbank slope in Uttarakhand, NW Himalaya. The response of this riverbank slope during extreme rainfall is also explored in terms of stability and debris flow runout. Therefore, we evaluated the riverbank slope stability and the runout extent of its material to understand the slope response during extreme rainfall. Flood simulation was also performed to determine the potential flood impact on the riverbank slope. Results revealed that the slope material at the exposed fluvial sequence and slope toe might displace forward similar to 0.12-0.4 m. The potential debris flow from the slope may impact the retaining wall supporting the slope with a pressure up to 150 k Pa. The potential flood may strike the riverbank with a velocity and stream power of 10 +/- 2 m/s and 0.2 +/- 0.1 M N/m-s, respectively, which is about three times higher than the approximated resistance of the retaining wall.

Before this date, demand and house prices in this area were rising faster than anywhere else in the country. What did homeowners in southwest Florida believe about flood risk to their own homes, and what did real estate agents believe about the role of flood risk in the residential housing market? The survey research summarized in this article shows that not only did residents feel that they were not particularly at risk from flooding, but also that damaging floods would not affect future home values in their neighborhoods or for their own homes. We found that political party affiliation was strongly correlated with the direction and strength of these beliefs. Real estate agents also reported strong demand for low-elevation coastal housing, noting that coastal lifestyle outweighed the prospect of flooding in residential decision-making. They also observed that the detailed maps of flood risk that are now available at realtor.com for anyone browsing for houses for sale had no effect on homebuyers, and that most of their customers were generally unconcerned with flood risk.

This research aims to construct an ecological security pattern (ESP) that is adaptive to floods to enhance urban resilience in the hope that it will help cities cope with floods better. In this research, the main urban area of Wuhan (WUH) represents the study area. The lakes were selected as the ecological sources and the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) model was used to calculate the runoff volume corresponding to each land type and, based on this, assign resistance values to the land types; as such, the land type surface is referred to as the runoff resistance surface, and the runoff resistance surface is then modified by ecosystem service capabilities. The Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) model was used to extract the connecting corridors between the sources. This research plan includes 18 ecological sources, 10 key ecological corridors, and 22 potential ecological corridors, with a total length of about 344.21 km. Finally, it provides a two-axis and three-core urban ecological resilience optimization strategy for decision makers and a new approach for controlling floods in urban areas from the perspective of ecological resilience.

The impacts caused by them are extensive, and efficient flood adaptation will play a key role in the current century. The present work proposes a new approach to decision-making in flood adaptation aimed at achieving robust adaptation decisions. It consists in evaluating decisions on a triaxial basis that considers expectation, probability quantile and investment in a so-called expectation-quantile-investment (EQI) evaluation. With such approach it is possible to understand the influence of uncertainties in the probabilistic response of adaptation. While adaptation should minimise expected total costs, it needs also to be robust for competitive levels of investment. Transfer curves that relate events with outcomes are used to infer on the probabilistic character of decisions in a case study of a vulnerable location. Results show that EQI-informed decisions can distinguish optimality in apparently competitive measures. It is shown that decisions based on one-dimensional or two-dimensional aspects of this triaxial rationale may fail to identify important probabilistic outcomes of adaptation, such as, the possibility of large losses with relevant probability of occurrence; and that are of high relevance when uncertainty considerations need to be enclosed in the analysis of adaptation.

Structural measures against floods have an upper limit on their function; thus, when the magnitude of floods exceeds this upper limit, few functions can prevent damage. Non-structural measures such as ecosystem-based strategies for disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) are attracting growing interest. In this study, I test the effectiveness of flood mitigation on agricultural land, which is a semi-natural ecosystem, using both municipality and watershed data from 9 years of statistical records on flood damage to test the relationship be-tween flood frequency and land use patterns with terrain conditions in both municipalities and watersheds. I also conduct a simulation in which agricultural land use is reduced to compare the effectiveness of flood mitigation between the two scales. The results indicate that both paddy fields and dry farmland located in a water storage zone are effective in reducing flood frequency. In addition, this function is greater for watersheds than for municipalities. Thus, the conservation of agricultural land in which water storage zones are located could enhance Eco-DRR for flood-ing, especially in watersheds. I conclude that combining structural and non-structural mea-sures-namely, Eco-DRR-is the most effective flood mitigation strategy for watersheds.

In Korea, devastating typhoons and overflows account for approximately 90% of the country's natural disasters, and the many man-made features of urban environments exacerbate the detrimental effects whenever flooding occurs. Many regression analysis methods exist for assessing geographical flood risk; furthermore, a handful of machine learning methods have been created for mitigation and estimation purposes-there are none for prevention. Therefore, in this study, we developed a machine learning flood assessment model that leverages several machine learning models for the Busan Metropolitan City. Each was applied to a test dataset, and their performances were evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve; thereafter, the model determined to be the most reliable was used to create a flood risk assessment map. The model was then used to assess the areas of highest probability of flooding. Upon its completion, we discovered that flooding may now occur with less rainfall than that of the 10-year return period. The derived map is expected to be used as a basic source for the development of preventive countermeasures against urban flooding, thus contributing to the enhancement of flood control and response capacities in applicable regions.

Three Landsat images, acquired in 1986, 2002, and 2019, were used to map land cover classification in the study area. Classification kappa coefficients were 85.2, 94.1, and 94.7 for three images, respectively. Focusing on the class level, the results show that between 1986 and 2002, the primary cause of forest loss in the study area was the conversion of 7.8 thousand ha of oak forests to agricultural land. Since 2002, 0.8 thousand ha of oak forest cover have been changed to barrenlands. The decrease of Zagros forests is a main threat to the rich biodiversity found in the West of Iran. To avoid worsening soil erosion, restoration programs should prioritize planting patterns on rainfall and hill slopes, texturally dissimilar soils, and regeneration in forest gaps, particularly at high elevations and steep slopes. It is recommended that future research should use higher resolution datasets and encompass more expansive landscape units, such as the whole Zagros Mountain forests.

We conducted a case study in a major grain-producing region in China-Anhui Province-and studied the spatial patterns of heavy precipitation using 11 precipitation indices. We also assessed the relationship between the key heavy precipitation index and grain yield. The results showed that the frequency, continuity, and extreme value of heavy precipitation decreased gradually from the southern to northern regions of Anhui Province, whereas the precipitation concentration gradually increased from the central to northern and southwestern regions. The total precipitation of extreme rainy days (P95) was one of the most effective indices for detecting flood-affected agricultural areas. Based on different temporal variations of P95, the entire study region was divided into six sub-regions: south-central, north-central, southern, northwest, northeast, and northern. The climate-driven yield was the most sensitive to the interannual fluctuations in P95 in the north-central region. Furthermore, the area and intensity of the Asian polar vortex in summer may be important for P95 evolution in this region. The results of this study will help understand the changes and impacts of heavy precipitation in Anhui Province.

This paper has integrated available knowledge from literature on the limnology of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The current near-natural solute concentrations in the inflow waters can be attributed to low chemical weathering of the quartz basin substrate and nearly absent anthropogenic nutrient sources within the Okavango Delta. The concentration of solutes in endorheic ecosystems is a natural phenomenon. In the Okavango Delta, this concentration is offset by the accumulation of solutes in groundwater beneath numerous treed-islands, due to evapotranspiration by evergreen trees. The freshwater environment has fostered high abundance and diversity of flora and fauna in a semi-arid environment. However, there are several aspects of the Okavango Delta that need more rigorous researched for management purposes. Some of the important knowledge gaps include the role of atmospheric deposition and animal excretion as sources of nutrients and trace elements into the system, and the influence of hydro-period on the distribution of trace elements especially in floodplain sediments, flora and fauna across the Okavango Delta. The issue of bioaccumulation of trace elements is also an important knowledge gap for the Okavango Delta particularly for wildlife and human health.

Effective strategies to mitigate flood risks require a better understanding of the watershed dynamics and space to reverse the negative impacts. However, often cities do not have proper data sets to feed mathematical models that would be helpful in mapping water dynamics. Attempts to reduce flood risks have been made for decades by means of structural interventions but were frequently designed within the logic of a local scale, using limited available spaces and often merely shifting flooding downstream. Therefore, assessing urban floods requires a modeling approach capable of reflecting the watershed scale, considering interactions between hydraulic structures and urban landscape, where best practices and non-structural measures aim to improve community flood resilience through the reduction of social and financial costs in the long run. This paper proposes an integrated approach to analyze low impact development (LID) practices complemented by non-structural measures in a case study in southern Italy, supported by mathematical modeling in a strategy to overcome a context of almost no available data and limited urban open spaces.

The objective of this paper is to attend to these differences by investigating self-stated flood recovery across genders in Vietnam as a conceptual replication of earlier results from Germany. This study employs a regression-based analysis of 1,010 respondents divided between a rural coastal and an urban community in Thua Thien-Hue province. The results highlight an important set of recovery process-related variables. The set of relevant variables is similar across genders in terms of inclusion and influence, and includes age, social capital, internal and external support after a flood, perceived severity of previous flood impacts, and the perception of stress-resilience. However, women were affected more heavily by flooding in terms of longer recovery times, which should be accounted for in risk management. Overall, the studied variables perform similarly in Vietnam and Germany. This study, therefore, conceptually replicates previous results suggesting that women display slightly slower recovery levels as well as that psychological variables influence recovery rates more than adverse flood impacts. This provides an indication of the results' potentially robust nature due to the different socio-environmental contexts in Germany and Vietnam.

However, some of the most destructive flash floods are related to dam breaches or complete collapses, that release the large amounts of water, affecting inhabited areas. Worldwide, numerous dams have almost reached or surpassed the estimated construction life span, and pose an increasing risk to structure stability. Considering their continuous degrading state, increasing rainfall aggressiveness, due to climatic changes, technical error, or even human error, there are numerous, potential causes, for which dams could develop breaches and completely fail. This study aims to portray a comparative perspective of flood impact, with real-life consequences, measured by quantifiable parameters, generated from computer simulations of different breach sizes. These parameters include the total flooded surface, water velocity, maximum water depth, number of affected buildings, etc. The analysis was undergone by means of HEC-RAS based 2D hydraulic modeling and GIS, depending on high-accuracy Lidar terrain data and historical hydrological data. As a case study, Dracani Lake with the associated Sulita earthfill embankment dam was chosen, being one of the largest and oldest artificial lakes in Romania.

A lysimeter trial was conducted to investigate the responses of various cotton yield indices under water-stress treatments including, flood (five-day, eight-day), drought (10-day, 15-day), and five-day flood followed by 10-day drought, during the flowering and boll-forming stage. The results showed that the seed cotton yield was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced under all water-stress treatments, while the harvest index was not affected under any treatment. Significant decreases in dry matter yield, boll number, and boll hull mass were detected under flood treatments but not under drought treatments. The percentage cotton yield losses per day induced by flood and drought were 6.22% and 2.48%, respectively. Under water stress, the associations between seed cotton yield and relevant yield indices were weakened, but yield losses were still strongly related to the decreases in dry matter yield and boll number. Flood followed by drought caused significant reductions in all yield indices except harvest index; however, the reduction was much lower than the additive reductions induced by flood and drought. These results provide bases for scheduling irrigation and drainage under climate change.

Validation against tidal gauge data shows an average RMSE of 0.10 m, and RMSE below 0.12 m in 75% of the tidal gauges. Comparisons with satellite altimetry data show average RMSE of 0.07 m. SSL trends are estimated as an example of a potential application case of the dataset. The results indicate an overall latitudinal gradient in the trend of the extreme storm surge magnitude for the period 1979-2016. SSLs appear to increase in areas with latitudes > 50 degrees N and to decrease in the lower latitudes. Additionally, a seasonal variation of the extreme SSL, particularly strong in the northern areas, has been observed. The dataset is publicly available and aspires to provide the scientific community with an important data source for the study of storm surge phenomena and consequential impacts, either on large or local scales.

Regression analysis is employed to model the relationship between the frequency of flood alarming events observed by hydrological stations and hazard-causing factors from 2005 to 2012. Eight factors, including elevation (ELE), slope (SLO), elevation standard deviation (ESD), river density (DEN), distance to mainstream (DIST), NDVI, annual mean rainfall (RAIN), mean annual maximum of three-day accumulated precipitation (ACC) and frequency of extreme rainfall (EXE) are selected and integrated into a GIS environment for the identification of flood-prone basins. ESF-based Poisson regression (ESFPS) can filter out the spatial autocorrelation. The methodology includes construction of a spatial weight matrix, testing of spatial autocorrelation, decomposition of eigenvectors, stepwise selection of eigenvectors and calculation of regression coefficients. Compared with the pseudo R squared obtained by PS (0.56), ESFPS exhibits better fitness with a value of 0.78, which increases by approximately 39.3%. ESFPS identifies six significant factors including ELE, DEN, EXE, DIST, ACC and NDVI, in which ACC and NDVI are the first two main factors. The method can provide decision support for flood risk relief and hydrologic station planning.

In this study, 124 urban WMPs across the United States were reviewed to characterize historic approaches and identify emerging trends in watershed planning. Planning methods and tools were qualitatively evaluated, followed by statistical analyses of a subset of 63 WMPs to identify relationships between planning factors. Plans developed by a municipality or consultant were associated with more occurrences of hydrologic modeling and site-specific recommendations, and fewer occurrences of characterizing social watershed factors, than plans authored by agencies, organizations, or universities. WMPs in the past decade exhibited greater frequency in the use of pollutant load models and spatially explicit hydrologic and hydraulic models. Project prioritization was found to increasingly focus on feasibility to implement proposed strategies. More recent plans additionally exhibited greater consideration for water quality, ecological health, and public participation. Innovation in planning methods and consideration of future watershed conditions are primary areas that were found to be deficient in the study WMPs, although analysis methods and tools continue to improve in the wake of advancing technology and data availability.

Fishers' ability and willingness to adapt to environmental change in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaption; Cambodia; fisheries; livelihood; migration; Tonle Sap Lake	SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVELIHOODS APPROACH; MIGRATION; WATER; CONSERVATION; STRATEGIES; SUSTAINABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; RESILIENCE	The livelihoods of people dependent on the Tonle Sap floodplain ecosystem in Cambodia are expected to be affected by changes in economic conditions, social circumstances, environmental perturbations, demographic shifts and political climates. This study assesses how small-scale fisheries' livelihoods are changing in response to social and environmental conditions using the opinions of fishers collected through an intensive family survey of 514 households from Pursat and Battambang Provinces in Cambodia. Probit modelling approach was used to assess whether a fisher would continue fishing or not in the future when subjected to a variety of shifting conditions and identify the factors associated with their response. It was found that in any future condition about 50% of fishers would likely continue to fish, which suggests how much they love their traditional livelihood of fishing. The remaining 50% considered to diversify their livelihood strategy by shifting towards a combination of fishing, farming, and off-farm jobs. Furthermore, the analysis found that the fishers will change their fishing practices depending on how other sectors in the region develop. The model showed increasing access to agricultural activities decreased the likelihood of continuing to fish, whereas finding an off-farm job corresponded to increased likelihood of continuing to fish.

The impact of cascade reservoir operation on the runoff of the Yalong River Basin is assessed, providing a theoretical reference for the construction and joint operation of reservoirs. In this paper, eight scenarios were set up, by changing the reservoir capacity, operating location, and relative location in the case of two reservoirs. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of the capacity and location of a single reservoir on runoff processes, and the effect of the relative location in the case of joint operation of reservoirs. The results show that: (1) the reservoir has a delay and reduction effect on the flood during the flood season, and has a replenishment effect on the runoff during the dry season; (2) the impact of the reservoir on runoff processes and changes in runoff distribution during the year increases with the reservoir capacity; (3) the mitigation of flooding is more obvious at the river basin outlet control station when the reservoir is further downstream; (4) an arrangement with the smaller reservoir located upstream and the larger reservoir located downstream can maximize the benefits of the reservoirs in flood control.

A spatial analysis of climate gentrification in Orleans Parish, Louisiana post-Hurricane Katrina	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Environmental gentrification; Extreme weather; Sea level rise; Elevation	NEW-YORK-CITY; RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY; TROPICAL CYCLONES; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; VULNERABILITY; DISPLACEMENT; DISPARITIES; MIGRATION; DISASTER	Background: Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans, Louisiana as a Category 3 storm in August 2005. Storm surges, levee failures, and the low-lying nature of New Orleans led to widespread flooding, damage to over 70% of occupied housing, and evacuation of 80-90% of city residents. Only 57% of the city's black population has returned. Many residents complain of gentrification following rebuilding efforts. Climate gentrification is a recently described phenomenon whereby the effects of climate change, most notably rising sea levels and more frequent flooding and storm surges, alter housing values in a way that leads to gentrification. Objective: To examine the climate gentrification following hurricane Katrina by (1) estimating the associations between flooding severity, ground elevation, and gentrification and (2) whether these relationships are modified by neighborhood level pre- and post-storm sociodemographic factors. Methods: Lidar data collected in 2002 were used to determine elevation. Water gauge height of Lake Ponchartrain was used to estimate flood depth. Using census tracts as a proxy for neighborhoods, demographic, housing, and economic data from the 2000 decennial census and the 2010 and 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates US Census records were used to determine census tracts considered eligible for gentrification (median income < 2000 Orleans Parish median income). A gentrification index was created using tract changes in education level, population above the poverty limit, and median household income. Proportional odds ordinal logistic regression was used with product terms to test for effect measure modification by sociodemographic factors. Results: Census tracts eligible for gentrification in 2000 were 80.2% black. Median census tract flood depth was significantly lower in areas eligible to undergo gentrification (0.70 m vs. 1.03 m). Residents of gentrification-eligible tracts in 2000 were significantly more likely to be black, less educated, lower income, unemployed, and rent their home rather than own. In 2015 in these same eligible tracts, areas that underwent gentrification became significantly whiter, more educated, higher income, less unemployed, and more likely to live in a multi-unit dwelling. Gentrification was inversely associated with flood depth and directly associated with ground elevation in eligible tracts. Marginal effect modification was detected by the effect of pre-storm black race on the relationships of flood depth and elevation with gentrification. Conclusions: Gentrification was strongly associated with higher ground elevation in New Orleans. These results provide evidence to support the idea of climate gentrification described in other low-elevation major metropolitan areas like Miami, FL. High elevation, low-income, demographically transitional areas in particular that is areas that more closely resemble high-income area demographics, may be vulnerable to future climate gentrification.

Although this nation has made promising improvements in aquaculture, several existing and imminent challenges can disrupt further development. Until now, no studies have extensively reviewed the existing aquaculture practices of this nation. Thus, this article elucidates the prospects, production, and problems of common aquaculture practices for the establishment of sustainable aquaculture in Bangladesh. The culture units are mainly natural bodies of water including earthen ponds, seasonal floodplains, baor, and gher. Although pond farming is the oldest and most dominant practice in this nation, the use of pen and cage cultures has also been intensified in the last decade. Regarding farmed fish species, indigenous major carps, exotic carps, tilapia, pangas catfish, and climbing perch are the major runners. Among crustaceans, giant freshwater prawns and tiger shrimp are the leading farmed species. Mud crab, biofloc, and seaweed farming are a growing focus that can evolve as artisanal and commercial-scale farming practices in the near future. Major challenges that are potent enough to impede the establishment of viable aquaculture practices in Bangladesh are inadequate seed production, disease outbreaks, climate change, mediocre management practices, and limited mariculture propagations.

These transitions are of high relevance in several aspects of our life, e.g., in the industry, energy sector, transports, environmental management and our daily life. Digital technologies are particularly emerging also as multi-benefit solution in the water sector, as water is becoming more and more vulnerable to climate change (e.g., droughts and floods) and human activities (e.g., pollution and depletion). Within this context, in this study we assessed some of the several economic benefits that digital solutions can bring to the water sector, with a focus on leakage reduction in water distribution networks, reduction of combined sewer overflows and improvement of hydropower generation and operation. The benefits are calculated for each EU Member State and the UK, and then aggregated at the EU scale. Benefits were quantified in EUR 5.0, 0.14 and 1.7 billion per year (EUR 13.2 per person per year, on average), respectively, excluding environmental and social benefits, which may play a non-negligible role.

J	Gokhale, CS; Sharma, N				Gokhale, Chaitanya S.; Sharma, Nikhil			Optimizing crop rotations via Parrondo's paradox for sustainable agriculture	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						crop rotation; Parrondo's paradox; fluctuating selection; crop yield; soil quality; fertilizers	PERSISTENCE; STRATEGIES; SYSTEMS	Crop rotation, a sustainable agricultural technique, has been at humanity's disposal since time immemorial and is practised globally. Switching between cover crops and cash crops helps avoid the adverse effects of intensive farming. Determining the optimum cash-cover rotation schedule for maximizing yield has been tackled on multiple fronts by agricultural scientists, economists, biologists and computer scientists, to name a few. However, considering the uncertainty due to diseases, pests, droughts, floods and impending effects of climate change is essential when designing rotation strategies. Analysing this time-tested technique of crop rotations with a new lens of Parrondo's paradox allows us to optimally use the rotation technique in synchrony with uncertainty. While previous approaches are reactive to the diversity of crop types and environmental uncertainties, we make use of the said uncertainties to enhance crop rotation schedules. We calculate optimum switching probabilities in a randomized cropping sequence and suggest optimum deterministic sequences and judicious use of fertilizers.

J	Falchi, L; Corradini, M; Balliana, E; Zendri, E				Falchi, Laura; Corradini, Martina; Balliana, Eleonora; Zendri, Elisabetta			Urban Scale Monitoring Approach for the Assessment of Rising Damp Effects in Venice	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						rising damp effects; monitoring methodology; Venice	SEA-LEVEL RISE; BUILDINGS; HERITAGE	In coastal areas, the rising damp of salty water is a well-known degradation factor of historical masonries, leading to visible features such as crusts, masonry erosion, and plaster loss. Venetian masonries are strongly affected by decay caused by rising damp exacerbated by direct contact with salty water. Recurrent flooding due to high tides and an increase in the frequency of flooding events, also related to climate change, raises concern about the impacts. Although several studies have been carried out on probable future scenarios, a valuation of the decay risk due to rising damp at the urban level still needs to be implemented. This paper proposes a non-invasive and economically sustainable approach for evaluating rising damp effects at an urban scale. The approach includes a collection of archive images of masonries affected by rising damp dating back to the 1990s; a visual survey of the actual conservation state of masonries; a classification based on significant descriptors; and a discussion on exposure conditions and conservation states. The descriptors chosen are rising damp levels, biological growth, plaster loss, efflorescence, and brick erosion. The evaluation was implemented in a georeferenced system suitable for future comparisons, thus providing a management tool for the city's preservation.

This kind of prediction of the flow, size, and intensity of rivers in the alluvial aquifers is, in most cases, a challenging task due to climate change, as well as anthropogenic impacts on river flows. The presented methodology allows for organizing and preparing measures for flood protection, the operational work of hydropower plants, and many other usages. The methodology consists of correlation, cross-correlation, and a rescaled adjusted partial sums (RAPS) method. Although all methods are known, they have not been used in a methodology like the one presented. Research is conducted on a real case study of the river Bednja, on five consecutive hydrological measurement stations in the northwestern part of Croatia, for an available time series of the average daily flows from 2007-2018. High correlations were observed between the five stations along the Bednja River, with values of the correlation coefficient between 0.85 and 0.97 for the average daily flows, and between 0.88 and 0.99 for the RAPS values. The presented analysis gives information about similarities and connections between all five hydrological stations, which is significant and can be used to predict flow intensity.

In this present paper, the main controllable factors of the self-designed and constructed riparian wetland, namely hydrological conditions and additional carbon sources, were artificially regulated, and then methane fluxes were measured. The results proved that the methane emissions were significantly positively correlated with the water level heights, and the methane emissions increased exponentially with the rise of water level when the water level was between -20 cm and +20 cm. According to the -20-0 cm water level, a small number of methane emissions was significantly different from the 10 cm and 20 cm water levels, which indicated that higher water level could significantly promote methane emission. When the water level reached above 0 cm, the methane emission gradually increased as the flooding time became longer; it reached the peak value after more than 20 days of flooding after which it decreased, which provided a scientific basis for optimal design and effective management of restored and constructed riparian wetlands, minimizing the methane emissions of riparian wetlands.

Survey of Societal Benefits, Stewardship and Surroundings	POTATO RESEARCH			English	Article						Community; Consumers; Farmers; Market flow; PESTEL approach; Processors; Storage; Sustainability; Upcoming markets	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Wheat, the most important food crop, can be stored for a much longer time than potato. It is ground and made into flour or pasta that can be turned into bread or a dish at any time. Potato is only storable for a limited period, so it floods the market at harvest. Major benefits of processing for growers include regulating the availability of markets and price through contracts, and the decrease in the number of consumers buying fresh tubers is compensated by processors buying raw material. Processors add value and employment and consumers are offered a wide array of affordable and convenient products. Large potato processing companies produce annual sustainability reports advocating measures for growers to spare the habitat, more efficient processes in factories, newer and healthier products and supporting communities. These are recorded and viewed in a theoretical triangulation from the angles of processors, and those trying to bend the rules. The industry, especially when expanding to new (developing) markets, faces political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal (PESTEL) issues that fluctuate according to the presence of a raw material base, competition and buying power and culture of the consumers.

Anomalously strong winter storms preceding spring of 2010 and 2018 increased annual nutrient inputs above the long-term average annual values for the year, causing a large phytoplankton bloom in spring 2010 and a massive winter-spring bloom in 2018. Flooding from the stronger storm in 2010 caused a smaller increase in primary productivity than the smaller storms prior to spring 2018, probably due to increased flushing rates during the 2010 storm. Neither storm enhanced hypoxia the following summer. During both summers, hypoxia was typical of minimal-hypoxia years, indicating that managed nitrogen reduction which is strongest during summer, remained adequate even in the aftermath of organic inputs from large storms during the colder months. Additionally, some commercially fished species appeared to increase after the storm events. Storm nutrient impacts on commercial species suggest that increasing nitrogen inputs from treatment facilities in colder months might enhance Bay fisheries for squid and hard clam without diminishing summer water quality.

This study proposes a new analytical framework for modeling the BIR of businesses in different economic sectors in earthquake-struck regions. The proposed framework assesses and integrates the impacts of (1) the sector-specific dependence of the businesses on different operation factors, (2) the recovery of operation factors during business closure in the aftermath of earthquakes, and (3) the earthquake-induced changes in final demand for the products or services provided by the businesses. A case study in Mianzhu, China, a county greatly impacted by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, was conducted. The results showed that the proposed framework reflected the impacts of the aforementioned factors on BIR and yielded promising BIR estimation accuracies. The findings are expected to advance the existing knowledge about the determinants of BIR and support the development of informed recovery strategies and measures to effectively reduce the business interruption losses in earthquake-struck regions.

The proposed study was carried out through an evaluation of the following components: people characteristics, emergency plan elements, operational structures of civil protection, and road infrastructure. A methodological approach was implemented to analyse the inhabitants, workers and other users' vulnerabilities, combining these with road network vulnerability. The application of a GIS-based model was used to capture, analyse, and manage the spatial data recorded on different scales and to visualise vulnerability results. A case study was proposed regarding a municipal area in Southern Italy that is frequently affected by floods and landslides which cause damage to the road network, limiting access to structures and resources. Results show how strategies and responses to emergency management will be different in each community and need to be reviewed as part of regular planning and prevention activities. The proposed study aims to create a tool that can be adjusted to user-specific needs to support decision-making, to reduce risk, and for disaster management at the local levels.

Our study was conducted in the upper reaches of the basin, where the Selenge river and its tributaries flow through the Mongolian forest-steppe. Monthly and maximum runoff, precipitation, and air temperature data from 12 gauging stations collected between 1978 and 2015 were analyzed to characterize the hydrological regime response to climate change. Concomitant with rising temperatures and increased potential evaporation, river runoff in the Mongolian part of the Selenge basin has decreased from the first interval (1978-1995) of our study period compared with the consecutive interval from 1996 to 2015. The decrease in runoff throughout the study area was most likely caused by an increase in potential evapotranspiration (and not reduced precipitation or land use changes) for both summer rainfall- and snowmelt-dominated rivers. Annual maximum runoff has also strongly decreased suggesting that reduced flooding is a contemporary threat for Mongolia's riverine ecosystems, probably causing the replacement of wetland and mesic habitats.

These risks are exacerbated in rapidly expanding urban areas due to the loss and degradation of green and blue spaces with their regulating ecosystem services. The potential of nature-based solutions (NBSs) to mitigate hydro-meteorological risks such as floods is increasingly recognised in Europe. However, its application in urban areas of SSA still needs to be systematically explored to inform and promote its uptake in this region. We conducted a multidisciplinary systematic review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) protocol to establish the general patterns in the literature on NBSs and hydro-meteorological risk mitigation in SSA. We searched scientific journal databases, websites of 12 key institutions and 11 NBS databases and identified 45 papers for analysis. We found at least 1 reported NBS in 71 % of urban areas of SSA across 83 locations. Of the papers, 62 % were clustered in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria only, while the most studied cities were Dar es Salaam and Kampala. Moreover, 66 NBS practices were identified, most of which (n=44) were for flood mitigation. With only Mozambique (n=2) among the most at-risk countries reporting NBSs, we found that NBSs are implemented where risks occur but not where they are most severe. Mangrove restoration (n=10) and wetland restoration (n=7), reforestation (n=10) and urban forests (n=8), and agroforestry (n=3) and conservation agriculture (n=2) were the most common NBS practices identified for floods, extreme-heat and drought mitigation, respectively. Traditional practices that fit the definition of NBSs, such as grass strips and stone bunds, and practices that are more popular in the Global North, such as green roofs and green facades, were also identified. These NBSs also provided ecosystem services, including 15 regulatory, 5 provisioning and 4 cultural ecosystem services, while 4 out of every 5 NBSs created livelihood opportunities. We conclude that the reported uptake of NBSs for hydro-meteorological risks in SSA is low. However, there could be more NBSs, especially at the local level, that are unreported. NBSs can help SSA address major development challenges such as water and food insecurity and unemployment and help the sub-region progress towards climate-resilient development. Therefore, we recommend that NBSs be mainstreamed into urban planning and knowledge exchange opportunities between SSA and Europe and that other regions be explored to promote uptake.	[Enu, Kirk B.

This research evaluates the predicted effects that the coastal spine will have across four different storm scenarios, including a Hurricane Ike scenario and 10-year, 100-year, and 500-year storm events with and without a 2.4 ft. sea level rise (SLR). To achieve this, we develop a 1:1 ratio, 3-dimensional urban model and ran real-time flood projections using ADCIRC model data with and without the coastal barrier in place. Findings show that inundated area and property damages due to flooding will both significantly decrease if the coastal spine is implemented, with a 36% decrease in the inundated area and $4 billion less in property damage across all storm scenarios, on average. When including SLR, the amount of protection of the Ike Dike diminishes due to flooding from the bay side of the island. While the Ike Dike does appear to offer substantial protection from flooding in the short term, integrating the coastal barrier with other non-structural mechanisms would facilitate more long-term protection when considering SLR.

This re-distributed the surface water in the basin and caused rapid expansion of the tail lake (Salt Lake). To avoid potential overflow of the expanding Salt Lake, a channel was excavated to drain the lake water into a downstream river. In this study, to investigate the permafrost thermal regime and the surface deformation around the expanding Salt Lake and the channel, in-situ monitoring sections were settled from Salt Lake to the downstream of the channel to obtain the permafrost temperature. Additionally, using small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR), the surface deformation around Salt Lake and the channel was measured. The data showed that the ground temperature at the channel was 0.6 degrees C higher than the natural field and the mean subsidence rate around the channel was 1.5 mm/yr higher than that at Salt Lake. These results show that the permafrost temperature in the study area changed considerably with variations in the distance from the lake/channel, and the deformation in the study area was dominated by subsidence.

Determining the response of riparian vegetation and river morphology to drought using Google Earth Engine and machine learning	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Riparian vegetation; River morphology; Remote sensing; Random forest; Rio Grande; Drought	CHANNEL EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE; ISLAND	Riparian vegetation composition and channel morphology are susceptible to long-term alterations caused by external stressors, including climate-change-induced droughts and engineered infrastructures. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify trends in riparian vegetation and channel/floodplain morphology over large spatial (-290 km) and temporal scales (-30 years) and (2) investigate the relationships between hydroclimatic drivers and changes in riparian vegetation and channel morphology. We implemented a random forest classifier via a machine learning technique in Google Earth Engine. The study area was a 290 km reach of the Rio Grande located in New Mexico, USA. We used the combination of remotely sensed data and products (e.g., Landsat imagery, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and land cover) to characterize vegetation, vegetation cover changes, and river morphology shifts from 1984 to 2020. The trend analysis revealed increased vegetated areas and NDVI (0.0004/yr) during long-term drought. The channel experienced a reduction in width associated with vegetation encroachment and the formation of stable vegetated islands. The streamflow hydrograph characteristics were positively correlated with vegetation cover and channel morphology. Our study contributes novel insights into the long-term riparian ecosystem dynamics under drought stress, informing drought impact mitigation and ecosystem management in arid and semi-arid regions.

Their associated impacts have detrimental and often prolonged implications for humankind, especially communities heavily reliant on the natural environment. The development and implementation of effective flood early warning systems (FEWSs) can serve to enhance coping strategies and strengthen the adaptive capacities of target communities while simultaneously minimising flood risks. However, shortcomings related to the lack of information on the operationalisation of these systems, the technical and financial requirements, the challenges faced and the directives related to their implementation have persisted, subverting risk reduction efforts at the grassroots level. Using data from key informant interviews and focus group discussions, this study employed a systematic analysis of the official Namibian flood early warning system based on the system's implementation in Kabbe, Namibia. The study results revealed a need for significant changes across all system components as the FEWS follows a top-down, disintegrated and response-driven approach. Roles are undefined among institutions; funding is inadequate; and community risk perceptions, coping capacities and participation are disregarded. Based on the study findings, the researchers recommend significant changes in the design and application of the system, urging practitioners to recognise FEWSs as the continuous and integrated tools that they are.

The release criteria of the hedging rule (HR) and standard operating policy (SOP) were investigated in this study. The results showed that the patterns of the new optimal rule curves from the MPA technique considering sedimentation and using HR were practically useful in this study, as were the patterns of the new optimal rule curves using SOP and those of the existing rule curves. Furthermore, the new optimal rule curves using HR criteria were able to alleviate both water scarcity and excess water situations better than both existing rule curves and optimal rule curves using SOP in terms of minimal average water shortage. The new curves reduced minimal average water shortage by 53% and excess release water deficit by 19%, whereas the frequency of water shortage term was increased by 3%. The results of rule curves efficiency from MPA were higher than GA and FPA techniques in terms of providing solutions. There was a significant difference in the efficiency of water problem alleviation between considering and not considering sedimentation. It can be concluded that the MPA linked with reservoir simulation using HR criteria and considering sedimentation can be used to find optimal rule curve solutions effectively.

Quantifying the impacts of land cover change on catchment-scale urban flooding by classifying aerial images	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Urban flooding simulation; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Rainfall nonstationarity; Impacts analysis	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; RUNOFF; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; MODEL	Stormwater urban drainage systems are historically designed to mitigate certain recurrence interval flooding events. However, increases in impervious land cover due to urban redevelopment enhance the surface imperviousness and then magnifies urban floods over the design criteria by elevating flooding peaks and volumes. In this paper, the object-based image classification was developed to evaluate the impervious land cover impacts on system peak flooding rate and total flooding volume. The object-based aerial image classification quantified the spatiotemporal changes in impervious surfaces with an average accuracy of 92%. A drainage model, based on a stormwater drainage system in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, was calibrated and validated under four storm events with an average of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.69 and 0.46 for calibration and validation outcomes. Results show that impervious areas increased up to 32% under impacts induced by urban redevelopment from 1950 to 2018. The land cover imperviousness resulted in a maximum of 575% and 753% growth in flooding peak and volume, respectively, under storm events from 10-year to 100-year return periods. Implications of this research seek to inform homeowners and engineers of the flooding risks in human-altered landscapes based on remote sensing image classification.

Controls on carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from a low-center polygonal peatland in the Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories	ARCTIC SCIENCE			English	Article						carbon dioxide; methane; river delta; permafrost; peatland	NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; NEURAL-NETWORK; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS; PERMAFROST CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CLOSED-PATH; GAS; CO2; TUNDRA; SCALE	Growing season surface-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide and methane were quantified at Fish Island, a wetland site in the lower northeast Mackenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada. The terrain consists of low-center polygonal tundra and is subject to infrequent flooding in high water years. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes were continuously measured using eddy covariance and the relevance of different environmental controls were identified using neural networks. Net daily carbon dioxide uptake peaked in mid-July before gradually decreasing and transitioning to net daily emissions by September. Variations in light level and temperature were the main controls over diurnal net carbon dioxide uptake, whereas thaw depth and phenology were the main seasonal controls. Methane emissions measured at Fish Island were higher than comparable studies on river delta sites in the Arctic and were influenced by the interaction of a large number of factors including thaw and water table depth, soil temperatures, and net radiation. Spikes in methane emissions were associated with strong winds and turbulence. The Fish Island tundra was a net sink for carbon during the growing season and methane emissions only slightly reduced the overall sink strength.	[Skeeter, June; Henry, Greg H.

J	Yan, XY; Xu, K; Feng, WQ; Chen, J				Yan, Xingyu; Xu, Kui; Feng, Wenqiang; Chen, Jing			A Rapid Prediction Model of Urban Flood Inundation in a High-Risk Area Coupling Machine Learning and Numerical Simulation Approaches	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Flood inundation; Neural networks; Numerical simulations; Rapid prediction; Spatiotemporal prediction; China	RAINFALL; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEMS	Climate change has led to increasing frequency of sudden extreme heavy rainfall events in cities, resulting in great disaster losses. Therefore, in emergency management, we need to be timely in predicting urban floods. Although the existing machine learning models can quickly predict the depth of stagnant water, these models only target single points and require large amounts of measured data, which are currently lacking. Although numerical models can accurately simulate and predict such events, it takes a long time to perform the associated calculations, especially two-dimensional large-scale calculations, which cannot meet the needs of emergency management. Therefore, this article proposes a method of coupling neural networks and numerical models that can simulate and identify areas at high risk from urban floods and quickly predict the depth of water accumulation in these areas. Taking a drainage area in Tianjin Municipality, China, as an example, the results show that the simulation accuracy of this method is high, the Nash coefficient is 0.876, and the calculation time is 20 seconds.

However, comprehensive assessment of the hydrological resilience of such a coupled-system is challenging, and this limits planning and implementation. In this paper the authors developed an innovative approach to measure and optimise life cycle costs for layouts with different levels of decentralisation under the constraint of hydrological reliability, and assess their technology-based and operational resilience. The authors found that coupled solutions implemented in a high-density catchment are economically competitive compared with conventional GREI. Based on the findings of risk scenario modeling, the coupled-systems show better technology-based resilience to extreme weather, except during extreme storms (rainfall of 50-year recurrence interval with 24-hr storm duration). Regarding operational resilience (versus structural failure), coupled-systems incorporating source control and pathway drainage with higher redundancy are more robust than GREI-only system. Decentralisation with optimised layouts does not significantly improve system resilience. This methodology could be a helpful decision-making tool in developing strategies to manage stormwater runoff for better hydrological resilience in high-density urban catchments.

Stormwater flooding is widely recognised as a significant and worsening natural hazard across the globe; however, current management approaches aimed at the site scale do not adequately explore opportunities for integrated management at the regional scale at which decisions are made. This research addresses this gap through supporting the development of stormwater management strategies, including green infrastructure, at a regional scale. This is achieved through upscaling a modelling approach using a spatially explicit inundation model (CADDIES) coupled with an economic model of inundation loss (OpenProFIA) to support widescale evaluation of green infrastructure during the informative early-stage development of stormwater management strategies. This novel regional scale approach is demonstrated across a case study of the San Francisco Bay Area, spanning 8300 sq km. The main opportunity from this regional approach is to identify spatial and temporal trends which are used to inform regional planning and direct future detailed modelling efforts. The study highlights several limitations of the new method, suggesting it should be applied as part of a suite of landscape management approaches; however, highlights that it has the potential to complement existing stormwater management toolkits.

Exposure to Hurricane Harvey flooding for subsidized housing residents of Harris County, Texas	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Disaster; Social vulnerability; Subsidized housing; Hurricane Harvey; Houston		This article contributes to research on social vulnerability to natural hazards by analyzing the relationship between spatial patterns of flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey and subsidized rental housing residents. Our study area is Harris County, the most populous county in Texas, which includes the city of Houston and was severely impacted by Harvey-induced flooding. We sought to determine whether: (1) federally subsidized housing units and residents were disproportionately located in areas with greater flood extent and (2) areal extent of flooding around subsidized housing developments was greater for developments where higher proportions of socially vulnerable households reside. We integrated information from the US Federal Emergency Management Agency's Harvey flood depths grid with US Department of Housing and Urban Development data on relevant rental assistance programs. Results from multivariable generalized estimating equations indicated significantly higher percentages of subsidized housing units and residents in neighborhoods with greater flood extent, after accounting for pertinent spatial and social factors. We also found subsidized housing developments with more extensive flooding nearby to contain significantly higher percentages of extremely low income, female-headed and older (62 + years) households. Findings have important implications for future research and policy, since these socio-spatial inequalities are likely to be reproduced through climate change-related disasters projected to affect many cities within and outside Texas.

Place-Based Citizen Science for Assessing Risk Perception and Coping Capacity of Households Affected by Multiple Hazards	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						disaster; multiple hazards; risk perception; coping capacity; flooding; water shortage	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES	Since hazards act upon vulnerability and exposure to become disasters, the understanding of societal challenges is key for disaster risk reduction. This condition is even more critical when more than one hazard is in place. Taking the case of flooding and water shortage, this study is built upon the premise that disasters are a social phenomenon; therefore, it is essential to comprehend the social context in which they occur. Particularly, this study aims to evaluate the similarities and differences in risk perception and the coping capacity of residents in the multiple-hazard context. For this, a place-based citizen science approach was developed in this study in Campina Grande, a semiarid region of Brazil, with the collaboration of 199 participants. Risk perception and coping capacity were analysed through the citizens' participation, while combining subjective and objective methods. The results indicate that even though residents have experienced severe flooding and water shortages in the past, they still have low coping capacity. The findings highlight the need to combine a triad of societal challenges, namely information, trust, and incentives, to improve coping capacity in the future and increase resilience. This study underlines the need to understand multiple hazards according to social, spatial, and temporal scales in a socio-spatial perspective.

Empirical evidence for floods in India	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Floods; Human development; Income; Indian states; Loss and damage; Resilience	NATURAL DISASTERS; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; INCOME; ADAPTATION; FATALITIES; IMPACTS	Using a dataset on reported loss and damage (L&D) from flood-affected Indian states between 1953 and 2011, this paper inquires whether development makes states become flood resilient. Although the disaster-specific and the generic adaptation measures have been largely researched, there are limited empirical studies, particularly those that conducted an analysis at the sub-national level and used a dataset of more than 50 years. Considering human development and different loss and damage indicators is another advantage. Employing zero-inflated negative binomial and fixed effects models, this study produces three major findings. First, an increasing trend is observed for the reported loss and damage indicators across the states. Second, both human development and income are mostly found as statistically insignificant, indicating that the states are not becoming flood-resilient with respect to the present development. Third, there is a lack of evidence of learning effect, however, disaster risk management programme mitigates risk. Therefore, the paper suggests that the ongoing development strategies must take into account climate risk and address the persistent adaptation deficit. These findings could have larger policy implications since Indian states are likely to encounter such events frequently, and they also provide inputs to several states' action plans on climate change.

The results from a five-year study have taken into account droughts, continuous precipitation, and storm precipitation causing flash floods. Extreme hydro-meteorological events has a different impact on the physical and chemical parameters of water. It was found that the largest change in water quality occurs on the 2nd day after the rainfall and changed concentration of some chemical parameters persists for a long time. The majority but, what's important, not all of them are diluted after floods and concentrated after droughts. Flash flooding results in a large increase concentrations of DOC and selected forms of phosphorus. Higher values of EC, Eh, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SiO32-, NO3-N, TN were observed during drought compared to the average values from 2014-2018. A high degree of naturalness of the river valley and increased water retention results in a decreased concentration of NH4+-N, DOC and phosphorus forms. The buffer zone plays an important role in limiting the inflow of pollutants and nutrients from the catchment area. That is why it is worth undertaking restoration of river valleys in urban areas.

Most of the earlier studies focused on overland flooding caused by intense rainfall, with little attention given to floods caused by failures of the drainage system. However, the drainage system contributions to flood vulnerability have increased over time as they aged and became inadequate to handle the design floods. Adaption of the drainages for such vulnerability requires a quantitative assessment of their contribution to flood levels and spatial extent during and after flooding events. Here, we couple the one-dimensional Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) to a new flood inundation and recession model (namely FIRM) to characterize the spatial extent and depth of manhole flooding and recession. The manhole overflow from the SWMM model and a fine-resolution elevation map are applied as inputs in FIRM to delineate the spatial extent and depth of flooding during and aftermath of a storm event. The model is tested for two manhole flooding events in the City of Edmonds in Washington, USA. Our two case studies show reasonable match between the observed and modeled flood spatial extents and highlight the importance of considering manholes in urban flood simulations.

Decision makers and the types of FRM policy decisions they make play a key role in implementing FRM policies and strategies that progress flood resilience. This paper explores how policy preferences held by FRM decision makers relate to the characteristics of resilient FRM policy. The research was conducted in three flood-prone provinces in western Canada using a multi-criteria analytical approach. The results show that while decision maker FRM priorities are similar across the Canadian Prairies, their preferred FRM policies differ. Further, preferred FRM policies were largely resistance-based and influenced at least as much by flood experiences and perceptions of flood risk as by more obvious administrative pressures such as cost, public acceptability, and environmental protection. Several observations emerge from these results for advancing a coordinated, diversified approach to FRM which is required for resilience, both for western Canada and for FRM more broadly.

In the first scheme of its kind in the Thames basin, this paper describes how natural flood management (NFM) is being piloted in the Littlestock Brook tributary of the Evenlode catchment. This 5-year scheme (2016-2021) explores the delivery mechanisms and assesses the effectiveness of NFM measures to reduce flood risk in Milton-under-Wychwood, improve water quality and create habitat. It has secured 640 pound 000 from Environment Agency programmes, the Thames Regional Flood and Coastal Committee, other partners and landowners. In 2018, ten field corner bunds were created with a combined storage capacity of 26 000 m(3). Woody dams in the brook divert high flows into these flood storage areas. Critical to success is integrated delivery through the Evenlode Catchment Partnership and engagement of the local community. Catchment partnerships deliver a range of environmental, social and economic benefits, and directly support many of the ambitions under the government's 25-Year Environment Plan and the Water Framework Directive. Collaborative working with Thames Water, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, consultants and academics has enabled the project to utilise existing delivery mechanisms and to model and monitor the effectiveness of NFM.

J	Trumble, R				Trumble, Ruth			A proposal for unpacking the politics of knowledge production in disaster reduction education	GEOGRAPHY COMPASS			English	Article							RISK REDUCTION; FLOOD-RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; ADAPTATION; SCHOOL; GEOGRAPHIES; GOVERNMENTALITY; CONSTRUCTION; GOVERNANCE	The Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (2015-2030) states that education is an important way to build resilience of people and communities. Further, reducing inequality should be a goal of disaster risk reduction (DRR) politics. Disaster reduction education (DRE), like the ideas resilience and DRR from which it stems, is not an innocent notion. The production of knowledge and its implementation via DRE are inherently political. With this in mind, I discuss recent work in DRE and suggest that science and technology studies (STS) is a helpful ally in examining the significance of DRE for communities. I first discuss the relationship between resilience, DRR, and DRE. I then review recent case studies from the growing field of scholarship in DRE; each of which brings into question (a) the politics of knowledge production and (b) uneven relationships across scales that shape the ways in which education for disaster risk is implemented. Next, I explore how scholarship from STS is useful to think through ways to further unpack the politics of expertise woven into DRE. I conclude by stating that if we are to consider possibilities for DRE practices that increase equality, we must first explore the power relations that shape DRE. STS engagements with expertise will help in the process.

The aim of the paper was to indicate which specific solutions can be used in the city in multi-dimensional and multi-functional systems. As a result of the research, the concept of a '5-scales' diffusion of blue-green infrastructure elements was presented. Elements of this system are based on multi-scale blue-green infrastructure, creating a patchwork of 'blue connections' that fit into the city 'green' natural system and have a connection with urban rainwater drainage. These five elements together allow for the infiltration and retention of rainwater, and can be used in the design of ecologically sustainable water-oriented cities in the future.

Populated regions close to riverbeds are the sectors most affected by these disasters, which requires modelling studies to generate different scenarios. The work focuses on the bibliometric analysis of the search for topics such as flood modelling focused on the research, risk, and assessment of these catastrophes, aiming to determine new trends and tools for their application in the prevention of these natural disasters. The methodology consists of: (i) search criteria and database selection, (ii) pre-processing of the selected data and software, and (iii) analysis and interpretation of the results. The results show a wide range of studies for dimensional analysis in different flood scenarios, which greatly benefit the development of flood prevention and risk strategies. In addition, this work provides insight into the different types of software and modelling for flood analysis and simulation and the various trends and applications for future modelling.

In the context of global climate change, urban flooding is occurring more frequently and has more severe consequences. Risk assessment has a certain effect on flood management and risk reduction. To facilitate the formulation of better flood prevention and disaster reduction strategies, a new urban flooding risk assessment model was proposed, in which six evaluation indicators were selected from flood hazard and vulnerability. The model was established based on the combination weighting method of game theory, and the risk map was generated based on the GIS platform. The model was validated by comparing the evaluation result with the disaster information in Zhengzhou city. The result showed that AHP-CRITIC.game theory combination weighting was more reasonable than the AHP and AHP-EWM weighting methods to determine the weight. The high-risk and the very high-risk areas are mainly distributed in the Jinshui district with lower elevation and highest economic development. The model framework proposed in this paper can be applied to the rapid assessment of urban flooding risk.

In the present study, we analysed the long-term monsoon rainfall for the Ganga River basin to investigate its spatio-temporal variability. A statistically increasing (10 to 17 mm/year; p < 0.05) trend has been observed in ISM rainfall for the mountainous region since 1980, accompanied by increased temperature. We further note that high, very high and extreme rainfall events are also increasing, enhancing the flash flood risk in the mountainous region. In contrast, the ISM rainfall in the alluvial region is observed to be statistically decreasing (-5 to -20 mm/year; p < 0.05) with the combined influence of reduced vegetation. These findings provide valuable insights into the variations in regional hydrology of the Ganga River basin caused by natural and anthropogenic factors.

This paper considers the influence that social networks have on knowledge exchange and adaptive governance for improving the ability of local governments to build resilience to floods. Using two local government case studies in South Africa, this paper found that the structure of social networks had an effect on the ability of local governments to transform flood vulnerabilities in informal settlements. In the Nelson Mandela Bay metropolitan municipality, poor connections among actors resulted in the formation of institutional silos, limited knowledge-exchange processes and inhibited flood risk governance. In the Mossel Bay local municipality, strong social ties facilitated cohesion amongst actors, supported knowledge sharing and benefited flood risk governance. This paper demonstrates how effective social network structures in local governments can stimulate adaptive risk governance, and contribute to the development of coping, adaptive and transformative capacities.

This study investigates changes in temporal trends of precipitation at Jinan City, Shandong Province over the last six decades. It first constructs a long series of measured daily precipitation data (1951-2017) and then exploits the relative variability, Mann-Kendall, and rescaled range analysis (R/S analysis) methods to update precipitation characteristics. Results indicate that: (1) annual precipitation varies over 116%, with 74.1% of total precipitation concentrated from June to September, especially for heavy rains and storm days; (2) at the 95% confidence level, the annual rainfall does not increase significantly (U = 1.15), but there is a significant upward trend in the spring (U = 2.08), whereas there is no significant downward trend in the fall (U = -1.03); (3) precipitation sequence mutates in 1990, consistent with spring precipitation series, while there are two to four mutations in summer, autumn, and winter. The above results will provide the theoretical basis and data support for the rational development of water resources in Jinan; meanwhile, studying the law of precipitation changes in Jinan City has important practical significance for flood disaster prevention.

This study assessed knowledge of emergency preparedness and HCF management professionals regarding locations of floodplains in relation to HCFs. A Web-based interactive map of floodplains and HCF was developed and users of the map were asked to evaluate it. Methods: An online survey was completed by administrators of HCFs and public health emergency preparedness professionals in Illinois, before and after an interactive online map of floodplains and HCFs was provided. Results: Forty Illinois HCFs located in floodplains were identified, including 12 long-term care facilities. Preparedness professionals have limited knowledge of whether local HCFs were in floodplains, and few reported availability of geographic information system (GIS) resources at baseline. Respondents intended to use the interactive map for planning and stakeholder communications. Conclusions: Given that HCFs are located in floodplains, this first assessment of using interactive maps of floodplains and HCFs may promote a shift to reliable data sources of floodplain locations in relation to HCFs. Similar approaches may be useful in other settings.

In hydrological analysis, it has been a topic of interest to establish a suitable probabilistic approach for extreme rainfall. Monthly extreme rainfall of five meteorological stations of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) from 1971-2010 have been used. The percentile deviation and probabilistic models have been applied to calculate variation and return levels of seasonal extreme rainfall. The outcome of this study shows that the preferred stations of GB (Gilgit, Skardu, Bunji, Gupis and Astore) will receive rainfall greater than 107.76 mm, 140.64 mm, 69.23 mm, 85.34 mm and 153.44 mm, respectively for the incoming 50-year return period, which are more than the extreme rainfall of 2010. The analysis also predicts that on average, Gilgit-Baltistan will receive 111.28 mm return level against the 50year return period in the summer season. These results are useful for agriculture, environmental researchers, planners and decision makers to get precautionary measures in Gilgit-Baltistan.

These events often lead to loss of productivity in ecosystem-based livelihoods, biodiversity, ecosystem goods and services. Communities directly dependent on socio-ecological systems for primary livelihood need to strengthen their resilience for early recovery and prepare for the impacts of future hazards. Current policies often assume that households are equally vulnerable to hazards. However, there is no robust empirical study available on the level and distribution of vulnerability amongst marginalised households. This study compared the levels of vulnerability amongst 500 households in five villages situated in the Mangrove ecosystem of the Indian Sundarban using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVIs). The results uncover significant variations in levels and distribution of vulnerability between the villages. These findings could be used to tailor need-based bespoke adaptation and mitigation interventions to combat climate-induced variability or hazard events in the future. In order to optimise the benefits of policy or program for strengthening resilience of these households - this article recommends that policymakers consider micro-level differences in levels and distribution of vulnerability.

J	Sofia, G; Nikolopoulos, EI				Sofia, G.; Nikolopoulos, E., I			Floods and rivers: a circular causality perspective	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HYDRAULIC GEOMETRY RELATIONSHIPS; DAILY PRECIPITATION CONCENTRATION; SEDIMENT CONNECTIVITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHANNEL GEOMETRY; RISK-ASSESSMENT; DRAINAGE-BASIN; WATER; DISCHARGE; VARIABILITY	An improved understanding of changes in flood hazard and the underlying driving mechanisms is critical for predicting future changes for better adaptation strategies. While recent increases in flooding across the world have been partly attributed to a range of atmospheric or landscape drivers, one often-forgotten driver of changes in flood properties is the variability of river conveyance capacity. This paper proposes a new framework for connecting flood changes to longitudinal variability in river conveyance, precipitation climatology, flows and sediment connectivity. We present a first step, based on a regional analysis, towards a longer-term research effort that is required to decipher the circular causality between floods and rivers. The results show how this system of interacting units in the atmospheric, hydrologic and geomorphological realm function as a nonlinear filter that fundamentally alters the frequency of flood events. To revise and refine our estimation of future flood risk, this work highlights that multidriver attribution studies are needed, that include boundary conditions such as underlying climate, water and sediment connectivity, and explicit estimations of river conveyance properties.

This will require improved understanding of the linkages between biophysical and social aspects in order to better anticipate the possible future co-evolution of water systems and society. We also present a call to enhance the dialogue and foster the actions of governments, the international scientific community, research funding agencies and additional stakeholders in order to develop effective solutions to support water resources systems adaptation. Finally, we call the scientific community to a renewed and unified effort to deliver an innovative message to stakeholders. Water science is essential to resolve the water crisis, but the effectiveness of solutions depends, inter alia, on the capability of scientists to deliver a new, coherent and technical vision for the future development of water systems.

This study quantifies the sensitivity of flood peaks to forest coverage and roughness changes. With this objective, a framework is first introduced that includes a variance-based sensitivity analysis approach and a water and energy budget-based distributed hydrological model with a vegetation module. The influence of forest coverage changes is simulated by altering land-use types that are based on physical parameters. A variance decomposition approach is used to quantify the contribution of influential factors, i.e. event size, forest coverage and roughness changes, to extreme flood peak variations. The results in a medium-sized river basin show forest coverage changes have little influence: variations in canopy interception, ground surface water retention, soil moisture and groundwater table resulting from changing forest coverage did not alter flood peaks considerably. In contrast, it is found that flood peaks are more sensitive to roughness variations.

J	Oladokun, VO; Montz, BE				Oladokun, Victor O.; Montz, Burrell E.			Towards measuring resilience of flood-prone communities: a conceptual framework	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							COPING STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT	Community resilience has become an important policy and research concept for understanding and addressing the challenges associated with the interplay of climate change, urbanization, population growth, land use, sustainability, vulnerability and increased frequency of extreme flooding. Although measuring resilience has been identified as a fundamental step toward its understanding and effective management, there is, however, lack of an operational measurement framework due to the difficulty of systematically integrating socioeconomic and techno-ecological factors. The study examines the challenges, constraints and construct ramifications that have complicated the development of an operational framework for measuring resilience of flood-prone communities. Among others, the study highlights the issues of proliferation of definitions and conceptual frameworks of resilience, challenges of data availability, data variability and data compatibility. Adopting the National Academies' definition of resilience, a conceptual and mathematical model was developed using the dimensions, quantities and relationships established by the definition. A fuzzy logic equivalent of the model was implemented to generate resilience indices for three flood-prone communities in the United States. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers a viable approach for measuring community flood resilience, even when there is a limitation on data availability and compatibility.

Severe rainstorms tend to be more frequent under a changing climate. Hence, it is essential to simulate rainfall-runoff processes in the urban area and evaluate flood coping strategies. This paper presents a model that is capable of simulating the overland flow process and underground drainage hydraulics simultaneously, based on detailed topographic, rainfall, and drainage network information about the northern Hong Kong Island. The model was calibrated with a flood-extent map and further validated with a flood event in June 2008. Using the model, the flood hazards associated with flood coping projects in three phases were simulated. Although these flooding control measures were intended to meet a major societal need for alleviating flooding problems and are shown to be effective in alleviating local flooding, the densely urbanized area may still suffer flooding when severe storm events occur.

In this work, we introduce an automated method to detect potential reservoir or retention area locations in digital terrain models. In this context, a potential reservoir is a larger terrain form that can be turned into an actual reservoir by constructing a dam. Based on contour lines derived from terrain models, potential reservoirs are found within a predefined range of dam lengths, and the locally optimal ones are then extracted. Our method is to be applied in the very early stages of project planning and for area-wide potential analysis. Tests in a 100 km(2) study area bring promising results, but also show a certain sensitivity regarding terrain model quality and resolution. In total, 250-300 candidate polygons with a total volume of more than 6 million m(3) were found. In order to facilitate further processing, these are stored as a GIS vector dataset.

Secondary Geomorphic Processes and Their Influence on Alluvial Fan Morphology, Channel Behavior and Flood Hazards	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article							FROM-MOTION PHOTOGRAMMETRY; DEBRIS-FLOW; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; AVULSION FREQUENCY; DISCHARGE; DYNAMICS; RIVER; AGGRADATION; EVOLUTION; DELTAS	Alluvial fans form through primary and secondary geomorphic processes. Primary processes comprise major geomorphic events that build the fan by transporting sediment from the watershed to the fan; these events occur at decadal time scales. Secondary processes include the smaller flood events which recruit little sediment from the watershed but can re-mobilize and rework sediment already delivered to the fan. The experiments described herein study the effects of secondary processes on alluvial fan morphology and channel behavior. We conducted four experiments, in which alluvial fans were built by alternating between primary events, with high flows and high sediment supply, and secondary events, with moderate flows and no sediment supply. In our experiments, primary events are best described as debris floods and secondary events correspond to smaller floods with much lower sediment concentrations. The duration of the secondary events varied between experiments, but the number and duration of the primary events was held constant keeping the total volume of sediment delivered to the fan the same. We monitored fan gradient, area, channel patterns and avulsions. Experiments with longer secondary events generated larger fans with gentler gradients. In addition, longer secondary events led to increased flow channelization and centralization between primary events. These morphologic changes resulted in fewer avulsions during primary events, which occurred later during the event. These results indicate that changes to the relative duration of primary and secondary events caused by climate change can affect fan morphology, wet fraction, and avulsion frequency, with implications for potential flood hazard. Plain Language Summary Alluvial fans are triangular shaped deposits of water-borne sediment at the mouth of steep creeks. As development in mountainous areas increases, infrastructure built on alluvial fans continues to be at risk from flooding. Alluvial fans are formed through competing processes which act to both add sediment to the fan surface and remove and rework existing sediment on the fan surface. Major fan-building floods add sediment to the fan; we refer to these flood events as "primary events". They encompass relatively rare floods with unusually high sediment concentrations. Secondary events are minor floods that rework the sediment on fans. In this paper, we examine how secondary events can alter the shape and size of the fan, the position of channels on the fan surface, and the behavior of the fan during subsequent fan-building floods. Our results indicate that the duration of secondary events has important effects on both the fan dimensions and their response to flood events. Fan channels formed under longer secondary events better contain flow during subsequent primary events, thereby reducing flood hazard. Climate change will alter the timing and frequency of primary and secondary events, which could have substantial impacts on how some fans evolve in the future.	[Vincent, L. T.; Eaton, B.

Effects of drought on the physicochemical, nutrient, and carbon metrics of flows in the Savannah River, Georgia, USA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						aquatic ecosystem; freshwater; large river; low flows; nitrogen; phosphorus	WATER-QUALITY; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; ORGANIC-CARBON; NITRATE; BASIN; PATTERNS; REGIME	Hydrological drought has wide-ranging impacts on water quality, nutrient and carbon metrics, and given the uncertainty of climate change and the predicted increased frequency and intensity of drought in the future, investigations into changes induced by drought become increasingly important. This study compared physicochemical parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH and DO), nutrients (TN, NOX [NO2 + NO3], NH3 and TP) and carbon (TOC and DOC) between hydrological drought conditions (2006-2008) and hydrological normal conditions (2016-2019) at five sites along the lower Savannah River (Georgia, USA). Although we had predicted that water temperatures would increase from drought, we instead found temperature was significantly lower during drought conditions. Levels of pH and DO were significantly higher during drought. Further, TN, TOC and DOC concentrations were significantly lower during drought, but NOX concentrations were significantly higher during drought. Conductivity varied at the lower river sites, being significantly higher during drought at sites located below the city of Augusta, GA. These complex changes could be attributed to volume reductions coupled with an increase in the percentage of total flow originating from groundwater as well as limnetic reservoir inputs, persistent point source pollution, reduced natural catchment inputs and/or reduced floodplain interactions. The changes that occurred during drought may be disruptive to aquatic life, not only from reduced water quantity but also due to a scarcity of some biologically essential materials and lower food resources, combined with artificially high levels of some other potentially stressful materials.

Inadequate corporate strategic stormwater management or maintenance plans make the issue even worse. Therefore, efforts have been consolidated to confront flood hazards by incorporating precautious and proactive strategies toward better forecasting and preventing flood disasters or even mitigating the damage if it occurs. Further, there is inadequacy in incorporating computational intelligence techniques to detect flood susceptibility in road networks. This paper proposes a data-driven flood risk areas detection model incorporating various ensemble and generic machine learning techniques as well as autoML tools. A systematic and iterative approach is followed to examine different solutions to tackle the data balancing problem, including oversampling and undersampling techniques. Also, hyperparameter optimisation is undertaken using both grid search and genetic algorithms, and the models' performance using each designated strategy is reported and assessed. The empirical results from the experiments indicate that the optimised ensembled Extremely Randomized Trees classifier proves an ability to perform well on the given dataset with an averaged ROC AUC value of 90% and outperforms several state-of-the-art generic, ensembled, and autoML classifiers in all evaluation measures. The proposed framework could be possibly generalised to other road networks in similar topographical and geological regional areas.

These systems are among the most affected by human impact through urbanization and port activities, industrial and tourism activities. They are directly affected by the impact of climate change on sea level, storm surges frequency and strength, as well as recurrence of coastal river floods. A sustainable future for coastal zones depends on our capacity to implement systematic monitoring with focus on: (1) forcings affecting coastal zones at different spatio-temporal scales (sea level rise, winds and waves, offshore and coastal currents, tides, storm surges, river runoff in estuaries and deltas, sediment supply and transport, vertical land motions and land use); (2) morphological response (e.g., shoreline migration, topographical changes). Over the last decades, remote sensing observations have contributed to major advances in our understanding of coastal dynamics. This paper provides an overview of these major advances to measure the main physical parameters for monitoring the coastal, estuarine and delta environments and their evolution, such as the water level and hydrodynamics near the shoreline, water/sediment contact (i.e., shoreline), shoreline position, topography, bathymetry, vertical land motion, bio-physical characteristics of sediments, water content, suspended sediment, vegetation, and land use and land cover.

This study analyzed trends and years of change in seasonal and annual average, maximum, minimum temperature, maximum precipitation, average relative humidity, average wind speed, and sunshine duration values in Bursa. Innovative-Sen trend analysis was used to determine the trends, and the sequential Mann-Kendall method, standard normal homogeneity test, and Pettitt test were used to determine the year of change. In addition, meteorological variables were divided into three ranges as low, medium, and high, and the trends in these ranges were analyzed graphically with the ITA approach. The ITA tests showed statistically significant increases in average, minimum, and maximum temperatures and average wind speed in seasonal and annual periods. On the other hand, statistically significant decreasing trends were observed in the mean relative humidity and sum sunshine duration values in seasonal and annual periods. In addition, significant decreasing trends were observed in the 95% confidence interval in the summer and annual periods in the maximum precipitation values. According to the sequential Mann-Kendall method, there were changes in temperature values in 1995 and 2015, wind speed values in 1946, relative humidity values in 1975 and 1977, and sunshine duration values around 1996. This study's outputs significantly contribute to planners and decision-makers in terms of managing water resources, drought, and flood risk, developing adaptation strategies against climate change and agricultural irrigation and crop production.

The deserted harbour evolved into a swamp surrounded by a floodplain that has recorded the anthropogenic, environmental and climatic pressures that have occurred during the last 1500 years in the northern Adriatic. Focusing on the period since 500 AD, we here reconstruct the area's long-term ecosystem dynamics. We show that ecosystem dynamics mainly mirror the climate phases of the pre-industrial era. After the Roman era, anthropogenic activities (agriculture, pasture and fire activity) declined in scope and amplitude and are chronologically limited (from the late 7th to the early 13th centuries AD), acting as a background pressure on ecosystems. The main non-human impacts recorded by ecosystems correspond to the Late Antique Little Ice Age, defined by an average temperature anomaly of -2.04 ?? 0.17 ??C, exceeding the Pre-industrial Little Ice Age by -1.26 ?? 0.16 ??C in severity. The temperatures reconstructed for the Medieval Climate Anomaly are close to those recorded for the 20th century AD (average anomaly of 0.08 ?? 0.15 ??C) but they differ from the 21st century AD, according to the CRUTEM4 data. Aquileia shows that ancient harbours are key areas to understand how climate and human societies have shaped northern Adriatic environments since the post-Roman period.

Given the need for a land-use plan for the C??rdoba mountains, we decided to: make a vegetation map of these mountains; describe the vegetation of the mapped classes; interpret their distribution along the elevation gradient, and discuss the implications for land use planning. M&M: We elaborated a preliminary map from satellite images and field information, where we discriminated 14 vegetation units. Then, after a field control, we performed the final map, grouping the vegetation units into seven classes. Results: In the final map we identified: native forests, exotic forests, native scrublands, grasslands, lawns, grasslands with rock and/or bare soil and rocky areas. These classes were discriminated with an overall 82.6% precision. In addition, we separated water bodies, flood areas, crops and urban areas. The scrublands were the most widespread class, covering 37% of the landscape, followed by crops, covering 23% of the territory. Native forests only occupied 5.5% of the area. Scrublands and forests decreased along the elevation gradient, while grasslands and rocky areas increased. Conclusions: We suggest that land use planning should promote the restoration of native forests to occupy 20-40% of the landscape, the control of the advance of urban areas and crops, and the management of invasive alien species to limit their expansion.

First, a nonstationary copula model was constructed to analyze the temporal variation in the bivariate joint distribution. Second, the equivalent reliability method was used to calculate the design value of the dominant variable for a return period and the design lifespan length under non-stationarity. Third, the design value of the secondary variable that was conditioned on the design value of the dominant variable, was calculated using the conditional most likely combination and conditional expectation combination strategies. Through the above three steps, the typical design value combination of the nonstationary bivariate was obtained for a specific design standard. A case study, based on the nonstationary annual maximum 1-day (AM1) and 15-day (AM15) flood volume at the Yichang station, was conducted to illustrate the framework. The results indicate that the joint distribution of the AM1 and AM15 flood volumes varied over time. For a specific design standard, the design values of the AM15 and AM1 flood volumes decreased with an increase in the design lifespan length. Moreover, the conditional most likely estimation of the design value for the AM1 flood volume that was conditioned on the design value for the AM15 flood volume was greater than its conditional expectation estimation.

Insect herbivory on <i>Catula gettyi</i> gen. et sp. nov. (Lauraceae) from the Kaiparowits Formation (Late Cretaceous, Utah, USA)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS; LEAF MINES; ENDOPHYTIC OVIPOSITION; ARTHROPOD ASSOCIATIONS; TERTIARY BOUNDARY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTHERN UTAH; FOSSIL RECORD; LEAVES; EOCENE	The Upper Cretaceous (Campanian Stage) Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah, USA, preserves abundant plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossil taxa. Taken together, these fossils indicate that the ecosystems preserved in the Kaiparowits Formation were characterized by high biodiversity. Hundreds of vertebrate and invertebrate species and over 80 plant morphotypes are recognized from the formation, but insects and their associations with plants are largely undocumented. Here, we describe a new fossil leaf taxon, Catula gettyi gen et. sp. nov. in the family Lauraceae from the Kaiparowits Formation. Catula gettyi occurs at numerous localities in this deposit that represent ponded and distal floodplain environments. The type locality for C. gettyi has yielded 1,564 fossil leaf specimens of this species, which provides the opportunity to circumscribe this new plant species. By erecting this new genus and species, we are able to describe ecological associations on C. gettyi and place these interactions within a taxonomic context. We describe an extensive archive of feeding damage on C. gettyi caused by herbivorous insects, including more than 800 occurrences of insect damage belonging to five functional feeding groups indicating that insect-mediated damage on this taxon is both rich and abundant. Catula gettyi is one of the best-sampled host plant taxa from the Mesozoic Era, a poorly sampled time interval, and its insect damage is comparable to other Lauraceae taxa from the younger Late Cretaceous Hell Creek Flora of North Dakota, USA.

Water resources and flooding risk in Kumamoto based on observed hydrologic data analysis	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						annual precipitation; ENSO; Kumamoto; maximum daily precipitation; typhoon; water resources	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; TROPICAL CYCLONE CLIMATOLOGY; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; RIVER DISCHARGE; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; JAPAN; BASIN	Variability and change of precipitation were investigated in Kumamoto on Kyushu Island in southwestern Japan, to assess water resources and flooding risk. Annual precipitation, annual maximum daily precipitation, and annual maximum hourly precipitation have increased over the period from 1891 to 2018 (128 years). Trends are 26.2 mm per decade, 6.07 mm/day per decade, and 2.17 mm/h/decade, respectively. Precipitation in the rainy season (June and July) is on average 37% (ranging from 12 to 59%) of annual precipitation for the 128-year period. Maximum daily precipitation in a year occurred at Kumamoto in the rainy season in 92/128 (72%) of the years of observation from 1891 to 2018, in the typhoon (August to November) season in 23/128 (18%), and in the March to May season in 12/128 (10%). This indicates that the rainy monsoon season poses the largest daily flooding risk. A wavelet analysis revealed that from 1891 to 2018 annual precipitation and daily maximum precipitation fluctuate with 2 and 4 years periods, which may be related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is likely that air temperature rises, ENSO and topographical characteristics contributed to an increase in precipitation in the period. The analysis also showed that typhoons hitting or approaching Kumamoto have significantly affected annual precipitation and annual maximum daily precipitation, while the interval between typhoons affecting Kumamoto has been getting longer since the 1970s.

Three main facies are recognised in the investigated succession: a barnacle-dominated facies, which formed along a shallow (<15 m deep) nearshore environment, a foraminifera-dominated facies from relatively deeper waters (40-100 m), and an intermediate facies forming at the boundary of the other two. These facies and their relationships suggest deposition in a flooded valley a kind of setting that was common in the Mediterranean after the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Differing from other rias, the Pairola basin was exposed to strong waves, resulting in conditions favourable to barnacles. Sedimentological and stratigraphic observations indicate that the Pairola succession formed within a timespan covering both cold and warm phases. This is relevant because the sub-tropical foraminifer Amphistegina is ubiquitous throughout the succession. Amphistegina occurs in the Pliocene and lower Pleistocene (Gelasian) of Northern Italy, but not in the remainder of the Pleistocene, not even its warm portions. This genus is currently recolonizing the Mediterranean and is projected to reach the northern coast of the basin soon, foretelling that Anthropocene temperatures are going to overcome those of the late Pleistocene warm periods and reach those of the Pliocene.

J	Kruse, PM; Schmitt, HC; Greiving, S				Kruse, Philip M.; Schmitt, Hanna C.; Greiving, Stefan			Systemic criticality-a new assessment concept improving the evidence basis for CI protection	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Critical infrastructure; Systemic criticality; Hydro-meteorological hazard; Flood protection; Risk assessment; System-of-systems	CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES; VULNERABILITY; RISK	With high certainty, extreme weather events will intensify in their impact within the next 10 years due to climate change-induced increases in hazard probability of occurrence and simultaneous increases in socio-economic vulnerability. Data from previous mega-disasters show that losses from disruptions of critical services surpass the value of direct damages in the exposed areas because critical infrastructures [CI] are increasingly (inter-) dependent. Local events may have global impacts. Systemic criticality, which describes the relevance of a critical infrastructure due to its positioning within the system, needs to be addressed to reduce the likelihood of cascading effects. This paper presents novel approaches to operationalise and assess systemic criticality. Firstly, the paper introduces systemic cascade potential as a measurement of systemic criticality. It takes the relevance of a sector and the relevance of its interdependencies into account to generate a relative value of systemic importance for a CI sector. Secondly, an exemplary sectoral assessment of the road network allows reflecting the spatial manifestation of the first level of cascading effects. It analyses the impact of traffic interruptions on the accessibility of critical facilities to point out the systemically most critical segments of the municipal road network. To further operationalise the spatial dimension of criticality, a normative assertion determining the worthiness of protection of system components is required. A nationwide spatial flood protection plan incorporates this aspect in Germany for the first time. Its formal approval process was initiated in February 2020.

The build-up of deep P stocks is not yet understood. Hence, their contribution to water quality impairment cannot be mitigated effectively. We conducted a field study with soil sampling and P fractionation in the laboratory to assess five scenarios how deep P stocks might develop. Our data show that deep P stocks result neither from primary bedrock/substratum features (geogenic loading) nor from primary pedological characteristics. Instead, they seem to originate from secondary processes, i.e., underground P translocation. The build-up of deep P stocks is indicated to be specifically driven by downslope translocation of P in the interflow, which leads to P enrichment of toeslope subsoils. Moreover, under low flow conditions, floodplain subsoils might become enriched with P by increased sorption of P from groundwater which is hydrologically connected with surface waters with high P concentrations. Gleysol groundwater dynamics did not prove to be a systematic driver of the build-up of deep P stocks. However, on certain sites, intensive groundwater dynamics might foster vertical P translocation and could hence contribute to deep P enrichment. Thus, enrichment of phosphorus in floodplain subsoils probably results interactively from several subsurface P translocation processes which might be weighted site-specifically.

Study focus: This study shows new confirmative data that the Cell Distributed Runoff Model version 3.1.1 (CDRM) calibrated by the Shuffled Complex Evolution optimization method developed at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) can accurately forecast real-time river discharges induced by extreme typhoon Hagibis. Furthermore, we discuss reasons for the equifinality of three calibrated parameter sets, relative importance of typhoon features for calibration and quantify the relationship of distances between the trajectories of three typhoons and associated river basins. New hydrological insights: As a result of climate change impacts, record-breaking disasters with unprecedented heavy rainfalls, typhoon intensities and associated extreme river discharges are increasing, making it important to develop the real-time forecasting tools for extreme river discharges during floods. The CDRM accurately projected river mouth discharges from three Japanese typhoons (Hagibis-2019, Roke-2011 and Chataan-2002) using calibrated parameter sets from each typhoon. We found the equifinality issue among the calibrated parameter sets but they showed satisfactory cross-validation results with respect to river mouth hydrographs; that similar typhoon trajectories were more important for calibration than rainfall intensities and central pressures; that this methodology was accurate for typhoons passing within distances lower than 130 km from associated river basins. These findings contribute to developing the real-time forecasting tools for extreme river discharges during unprecedented heavy rainfall floods.

It becomes increasingly important to understand how local governments can design effective flood risk management policies to address flood risks. In this article, we study whether high flood exposure and flood risk perception correlate with the demand for a specific design of flood risk management policies. We take the ideal case of Switzerland and analyze flood risk management portfolios in 18 flood-prone municipalities along the Aare River. We introduce a novel combination of risk analysis and public policy data: we analyze correlations between recorded flood exposure data and survey data on flood risk perception and policy preferences for selected flood risk management measures. Our results indicate that local governments with high flood risk perception tend to prefer non-structural measures, such as spatial planning and ecological river restoration, to infrastructure measures. In contrast, flood exposure is neither linked to flood risk perception nor to policy preferences. We conclude that flood risk perception is key: it can decisively affect local governments' preferences to implement specific diversified policy portfolios including more preventive or integrated flood risk management measures. These findings imply that local governments in flood-prone areas should invest in raising their population's awareness capacity of flood risks and keep it high during periods without flooding.

Holocene extreme paleofloods and their climatological context, Upper Colorado River Basin, USA	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Paleofloods; meta-analysis; extreme floods; climate change; Holocene; Upper Colorado River Basin	SOUTHWESTERN UNITED-STATES; HYDRO-CLIMATIC EVENTS; WATER-RESOURCES; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; YR BP; FLOODS; RECORD; VARIABILITY; MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION	Given its singular importance for water resources in the southwestern USA, the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) is remarkable for the paucity of its conventional hydrological record of extreme flooding. Short-term record-based flood frequency analyses lead to very great aleatory uncertainties about infrequent extreme flood events and their climate-driven causal associations. This study uses paleoflood hydrology to examine a small portion of the underutilized, but very extensive natural record of Holocene extreme floods in the UCRB. We perform a meta-analysis of 82 extreme paleofloods from 18 slack water deposit sites in the UCRB to show linkages between Holocene climate patterns and extreme floods. The analysis demonstrates several clusters of extreme flood activity: 8040-7960, 4400-4300, 3600-3460, 2900-2740, 2390-1980, 1810-720, and 600-0 years BP. The extreme paleofloods were found to occur during both dry and wet periods in the paleoclimate record. When compared with independent paleoclimatic records across the Rocky Mountains and the southwestern USA, the observed temporal clustering pattern of UCRB extreme paleofloods shows associations with periods of abruptly intensified North Pacific-derived storms connected with enhanced variability of El Nino. This approach demonstrates the value of creating paleohydrological databases and comparing them with hydro-climatic proxies in order to identify natural patterns and to discover possible linkages to fundamental processes such as changes in climate.

Palaeohydrological investigations were carried out in the Danjiang River valley. A set of palaeoflood slackwater deposit (SWD) beds was identified embedded in Holocene loess soil sequences within riverbank cliffs based on sedimentary criteria and analytical results. These palaeoflood SWDs were deposited from the suspended sediment load of overbank flooding. These extreme palaeoflood events were dated to between 9000 and 8500 a BP from optically simulated luminescence (OSL) dating and pedostratigraphical correlation. The palaeoflood peak stages were calculated between 404.4 and 412.5 m using the slackwater flow depth method. The palaeoflood peak discharges were calculated between 8570 and 23,350 m(3)/s using the HEC-RAS model. These results have extended the flood data sequence of the Danjiang River to a 10,000-year time-scale. The ages of the palaeoflood events coincide well with the contemporaneous global climatic events at 8500 a BP, a time that the monsoonal climate shifted from the early Holocene dry conditions to the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. These findings will play an important role in flood risk estimation, the development of water resources, and will be significant in understanding the effects global climatic variations on hydrological systems in catchment of the Danjiangkou Reservoir.

The 70 km long kanamaluka(1)/Tamar Estuary, Australia, provides the setting for a simplified approach to explore the effects of SLR on tidal regime together with evolving estuary morphology. Scenarios of SLR, estuary infill, nodal tide modulation at the mouth, and increased wind speed are applied within a hydrodynamic model. The potential for amplified tidal range with SLR versus the damping potential of significant but plausible levels of estuary infill are explored. For this estuary, the simulated infilling had a strong effect on tidal distortion, up to a 57% reduction in tidal range at the estuary head. However, this reduction translates to just a 16% effective reduction in mean high water due to the elevation of mean tide level. Comparatively, SLR had a contrasting effect on tidal distortion, reducing flood tide dominant asymmetry by up to 40% without driving a significant change to the tidal range. The same 57% reduction in tidal range at the estuary head would limit projected SLR by 2100 to current (2018) levels, suggesting potential for mitigating SLR with engineered solutions. The efficient and effective design of mitigation strategies depends on the improved availability and quality of observational data. Data-driven modelling approaches will be essential for managing future coastal flood risk with SLR and ensure long term resilience.

In this context, we consider the hydro-social contract (HSC) as a framework to understand the formal and informal societal constructs that aid or impede effectiveness in managing flood risk. Specifically, we used Q-methodology to understand different perspectives of flood risk governance and identify points of friction in executing the HSC. We interviewed 62 flood risk management actors from small municipalities (intra-watershed) to regional State agencies (inter-basin) in the Isere River basin of France, from which three perspectives emerged. Most participants correlated to a perspective reaffirming a commitment to integrated and holistic approaches in flood risk management. However, the second and third perspectives illustrate a governance gap due to an upward transfer of risk management responsibilities to a broader watershed approach. At the same time, municipalities remain responsible for crisis management in the advent of flooding. Our findings bring into question the right balance of scale in flood risk governance, particularly regarding hydrological boundaries that are incongruous with political jurisdictions at multiple scales.

However, over the past few decades, the region has been severely affected by the consequences of climate change, such as flooding and drought, along with long-standing socio-political conflicts that threaten livelihood security. This article analyzes the interplay between livelihood security, climate fragility, and state fragility to foster a more meaningful understanding of the impacts arising from historical fragilities and conflicts. The study findings reveal five significant effects of these fragilities on security: persistent flooding, changes in land use, river siltation, drought impact, and uncertainties stemming from violent conflicts. Through a detailed analysis, the article elucidates how the frequent exposure to these events has compelled communities to adapt by perceiving threats to their livelihoods as uncontrollable, thereby normalizing fragilities as an inherent aspect of everyday life. The study underscores the importance of temporal awareness and cultural understanding to comprehend the complexities of fragilities and conflicts. Integrating such awareness and experience makes refining approaches to strengthen livelihoods and mitigate community vulnerabilities possible.

However, the capacity and efficiency of different types of wetlands vary considerably depending upon the nature of the wetland, hydrology, biogeochemistry, climatic condition, and many other factors. In the present paper, we have studied the carbon accumulation and sequestration in three different wetlands, one sewage fed, and two floodplain oxbow lakes in the West Bengal state of India. The selected wetlands vary in terms of ecological regimes such as water volume, depth, link channel, agricultural runoffs, primary productivity, macrophyte coverage, and fishery. The carbon accumulation in the wetlands, which varied from 48.53 to 143.17 Mg/ha up to 30-cm depth of soil, was much higher than that in the corresponding upland sites. The difference was much higher in the floodplain wetlands. So the study revealed that wetlands are better carbon sinks than the corresponding reference sites and the carbon sequestration potential varies according to the type of wetlands. A positive correlation was also observed between macrophyte coverage and the amount of C stored in the wetlands.

Based on existing research results, this paper focuses on searching for the formation mechanism of SIRDs, classifies their types and spatiotemporal scales, and reveals the integrated impacts of the SIRD and its future situation on global high-hazard areas. On land, SIRDs mainly occur in the high mountainous areas of middle-low latitude and the permafrost regions of high latitude, in the behaviors of increasing frequency of glacier/snow/glacier lake outburst flood-related disasters and an expanding range of freeze-thaw disasters. The recorded frost events show a decreasing trend but the hail hazard distributions are greatly heterogenous. Overall, the frequency of rain-on-snow events is projected to increase on land in the future. In the ocean, SIRDs are mainly distributed in the Arctic coastal areas and global low-lying islands or areas, with great potential risk. Among them, coastal freeze-thaw, icebergs, and sea-level rise and its impacts are likely or expected to continue increasing in the next few decades.

J	Altami, SA; Salman, B				Altami, Sulaiman Ahmed; Salman, Baris			Implementation of IoT-Based Sensor Systems for Smart Stormwater Management	JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Smart infrastructure; Infrastructure management; Stormwater management; Internet of things (IoT); Sensor networks	REAL-TIME CONTROL; URBAN DRAINAGE SYSTEMS; TRENDS; RISK; DESIGN	Climate change has been linked to the occurrence of rainfall events with higher frequencies and intensities in various urban areas around the world. Existing stormwater systems in many areas are more frequently experiencing overloading beyond their design capacities, leading to more frequent flooding events. Recent technological advances surrounding the Internet of Things (IoT) have made it possible to retrofit existing stormwater infrastructure systems with cyber-physical technologies at lower costs. This paper presents the design and prototype implementation of an automated stormwater management system that uses inexpensive microcontroller units coupled with smart sensors and valves to minimize flooding events. The system design comprises a sensing layer to collect, control, and transfer real-time data; a gateway layer to receive, store, and process data; and an application layer to define interactions between system components. As such, the system aims to go beyond simple monitoring of stormwater levels and allow actions to be taken automatically. This paper demonstrates the testing of the system at a small lab scale experiment. It is anticipated that future versions of the proposed system will offer the potential to provide an automated and cost-effective solution to managing entire urban stormwater systems.

A noteworthy case-study is represented by the Sahelian site of Mahal Teglinos (Kassala, Eastern Sudan), a secluded valley hosting rich Late Quaternary archaeological and sedimentary records that are undergoing irreversible damage. Here, we present the valley's geomorphological evolution, understanding the timing and effects of surface processes that are altering its topography and archaeological record. Today, hydric erosion is the main driver of soil displacement and loss, with the formation of rills, badlands and gullies being triggered, in turn, by hillside-channelled flash-floods and ground destabilization induced by human and animal agency. Stratigraphic analyses suggest the onset of the erosion may have started during the middle 1st millennium BCE. Nevertheless, contemporary plastic objects found within ancient-looking relict gullies spotlight a seemingly increasing erosional pace that may soon critically endanger the remaining archaeological record. Our geomorphological assessment of Mahal Teglinos represents a call for caution in regard to archaeological interpretations in geomorphologically active locations, as well as a warning of the threats faced by other known and still undiscovered Sahelian sites that are enduring similar climatic, geomorphological and anthropogenic constraints.

In a context of climate change, increased risks in urban areas and growing uncertainties, urban managers are forced to innovate in order to design appropriate new risk management strategies. Among these strategies, making cities resilient has become an imperative. However, resilience remains complex to integrate into the practices of urban planners and territorial actors. Its multitude of definitions and approaches has contributed to its abstraction and lack of operationalization. This review highlights the multitude of approaches and methodologies to address the bias of the lack of integration of the concept of resilience in climate risk management. The limit is the multiplication of these strategies which lead to conceptual vagueness and a lack of tangible application at the level of local actors. The challenge would then be to design a toolbox to concentrate the various existing tools, conceptual models and decision support systems in order to facilitate the autonomy and responsibility of local stakeholders in integrating the concept of resilience into risk management strategies.

Due to the limited relief capacity of a government, it is desirable to develop a risk-sharing mechanism involving both private sector providers (e.g., insurers, for-profit disaster agencies, and firms that provide resources for risk mitigation and recovery) and the public. In this article, we take catastrophe insurance as an example to examine ways of providing incentives for multilateral risk sharing, especially when it involves socially connected communities. We consider a sequential game with three sets of players, the government, a private insurer, and a community of households. The government determines an optimal subsidy portfolio (includingex anteinsurance premium subsidy andex postrelief subsidy) for a community with particular levels of social network influence and risk perception. We characterize the equilibrium purchase rate within the community by positive and negative herding behaviors and identify the government's optimal subsidy strategy dependent on the available budget and the emphasis onex postsocial responsibility. We also extend the game to account for multi-community coverage and multi-year insurance contracts to demonstrate the benefits of spatial and inter-temporal risk pooling.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of flood EWS from the perspectives of local experts/institutions and communities. Interviews and consultations with the local experts (13 officials from government and other concerned departments) were carried out to understand the institutional challenges in communicating early warnings, whereas three flood-prone communities from different-sized cities (Rawalpindi, Sialkot and Muzaffargarh) were surveyed. A total of 210 samples were collected through household questionnaire surveys to assess their understanding of the local warning system. The analysis revealed that almost half of the community respondents did not receive a warning last time when the flood occurred. Variations were also observed regarding the main source of early warning in the three communities. This study identifies institutional challenges, such as lack of (1) resources to keep an EWS equipment operational; (2) community trust; and (3) proper guidelines to communicate warnings. The study calls for an immediate revision of strategies to communicate early warnings to the end-users and to incorporate their feedback in designing/redesigning the early warning mechanisms.

This paper aims at choosing the LID for urban storm management by comparing the efficiency in the south urban district in the Taiyuan Basin. Firstly, we set up a 1D-2D model to simulate the hydrological and hydraulic process of the area. Then the efficiency of different LID scenarios was analyzed by ratio of surcharging pipeline, percentage of ponding road, external outflow, infiltration, surface runoff, facility storage, and LID area ratio. It was found that the continuous porous pavement and rain garden are beneficial for use in residential and commercial settings in urban areas, and the rain garden performs more effectively and efficiently than the continuous porous pavement. The area occupied by LID might be under 20% of the impervious building area, because the LID performance was not improved significantly with the LID area when the ratio exceeded 20%. The LIDs could be more useful for small return periods and short duration storms, and could not replace conventional runoff management practices and drainage systems.

Root exudates from growing rice plants are an important substrate for methane-producing microorganisms. Therefore, breeding efforts optimizing rice plant photosynthate allocation to grains, i.e., increasing harvest index (HI), are widely expected to reduce CH4 emissions with higher yield. Here we show, by combining a series of experiments, meta-analyses and an expert survey, that the potential of CH4 mitigation from rice paddies through HI improvement is in fact small. Whereas HI improvement reduced CH4 emissions under continuously flooded (CF) irrigation, it did not affect CH4 emissions in systems with intermittent irrigation (II). We estimate that future plant breeding efforts aimed at HI improvement to the theoretical maximum value will reduce CH4 emissions in CF systems by 4.4%. However, CF systems currently make up only a small fraction of the total rice growing area (i.e., 27% of the Chinese rice paddy area). Thus, to achieve substantial CH4 mitigation from rice agriculture, alternative plant breeding strategies may be needed, along with alternative management.

Unprecedented High Northern Australian Streamflow Linked to an Intensification of the Indo-Australian Monsoon	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SUPERPOSED EPOCH ANALYSIS; SUMMER MONSOON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARNHEM-LAND; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; PACIFIC; ENSO; RECONSTRUCTION; TEMPERATURE	Streamflow in Australia's northern rivers has been steadily increasing since the 1970s, most likely due to increased intensity in the Indo-Australian monsoon. However, because of limited data availability, it is hard to assess this recent trend and therefore contextualize potential future climatic changes. In this study, we used a network of 63 precipitation-sensitive tree-ring chronologies from the Indo-Australian and Asian monsoon regions to reconstruct streamflow in the Daly catchment in the Northern Territory of Australia from 1413 to 2005 CE. We used a novel wavelet-based method to transform the variance structure of the tree-ring chronologies to better match the hydroclimate prior to reconstruction with a hierarchical Bayesian regression model. Our streamflow reconstruction accounts for 72%-78% of the variance in the instrumental period and closely matches both historical flood events and independent proxy records, increasing confidence in its validity. We find that while streamflow has been increasing since the 1800s, the most recent 40-year period is unprecedented in the last similar to 600 years. Comparison to an independent coral-based streamflow record shows regional coherency in this trend. Extreme high flows were found to be linked to La Nina events, but we found no significant relationship between streamflow and El Nino events, or streamflow and other regional climatic drivers. More work is therefore needed to understand the drivers of the recent streamflow increase, but, regardless of the cause, water managers should be aware of the paleoclimatic context before making decisions on water allocations. Plain Language Summary Large-scale agricultural development has been proposed for the Daly catchment in the Northern Territory of Australia. Since the start of record keeping in the Daly catchment in the 1970s, streamflow has been steadily increasing, most likely due to increases in Australian monsoon rainfall. However, because of the limited amount of data, it is hard to assess whether this recent increase in streamflow is unusual, part of a longer trend, or a natural cycle in monsoon rainfall. In this study, we used rainfall-sensitive tree growth and a statistical model to reconstruct Daly River streamflow over the past 592 years. Our streamflow reconstruction closely matches known past flood events, increasing confidence in its validity. We find that streamflow has increased since the 1800s but that the most recent 40-year period is unprecedented in the last 600 years. More work is needed to understand the drivers of this increased streamflow but regardless of the cause, water managers should be aware of the Daly River's history before making decisions on allocating water to agriculture or other large users.

The vulnerability index was calculated using the following parametric maps: lithology, geomorphology, slope, elevation, distance, coastline change, significant wave height, sea level, and extreme tidal range. This vulnerability index was validated through the results obtained from the flood risk analysis, developed for different temporal and extreme scenarios (Xa-present, Xb-100 years, Xc-500 years, Xd-1000 years, Xe-storm, and Xf-tsunami). These analyses were performed using Geographic Information System and remote sensing techniques, spatial analysis, interpolation processes, and geostatistical analysis. The results of the analysis show the vulnerable areas and areas at high risk of coastal flooding, with the urbanized area exposed to a risk of 7.45 km2. Thus, this study contributes to designing appropriate management for the coastline of the southern margin of the Ria of Arosa in the event of a flood.

As an effective approach, the stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) has been well-accepted in river flow prediction but still encounters difficulties to acquire accurate predictions in sample-sparse regimes. This study proposes a new ensemble model by incorporating the bagging method with the SCA. The proposed Bagged Stepwise Cluster Analysis (BSCA) is applied to predict daily river flow in the Upper Min River, China. The results show that BSCA effectively improves the prediction accuracy of SCA. Particularly, it addresses the limited end clusters problem of SCA and thus enhances the extreme-value prediction. It also has a better overall prediction performance over the classical random forest and decision tree models. In addition, BSCA is capable of quantifying uncertainties through a probabilistic prediction, which can be used to assess risks of extreme flows and provide reliable river flow predictions. The proposed new model can be applied to other water systems and environmental engineering problems.

For gauged catchments, at-site flood frequency analysis is used for this purpose; however, for ungauged catchments, regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) is the preferred method. RFFA attempts to transfer flood characteristics from gauged to ungauged catchments based on the assumption of regional homogeneity. A bibliometric analysis on RFFA is presented here using Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. A total of 626 articles were selected from these databases. From the bibliometric analysis, it has been found that Journal of Hydrology and Water Resources Research are the two leading journals reporting RFFA research. In RFFA research, leading countries include Canada, USA, UK, Italy and Australia. In terms of citations, the top performing researchers are Ouarda T, Burn D, Rahman A, Haddad K and Chebana F. Future research should be directed towards the identification of homogeneous regions, application of efficient artificial intelligence (AI)-based RFFA models, incorporation of climate change impacts and uncertainty analysis.

Appropriate modeling can be a useful tool to prevent and reduce such flood risks. It is currently important to use hydrological models to assess and predict the water availability of river basins due to climate change to develop a strategy to cope with the changing environment. The study used an integrated approach combining a geographic information system (GIS) and hydrological modeling to assess the impact of urbanization on flash floods in peri-urban developing areas. The modeling was carried out for two spatial aspects relating to 1990 and 2018. The model allowed simulation of the river water flow that can occur under different rainfall probabilities. The study showed that rapid urbanization adversely affects hydrological processes. Reduced infiltration capacity increases water runoff, thereby increasing the risk of flooding or waterlogging. Therefore, it is extremely important to properly manage rainwater in the area.

Hurricane risk perceptions and housing market responses: the pricing effects of risk-perception factors and hurricane characteristics	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Hurricane; Risk perception; Housing price; Difference-in-differences; Miami-Dade County	FLOOD RISK; PROPERTY-VALUES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; HAZARDS; INFORMATION; ADAPTATION; AMENITIES; DISASTER; OUTCOMES	This paper uses the difference-in-differences method to assess how home prices change in the periods after major hurricanes in Miami-Dade County and links these changes to risk-perception determinants that affect market participants' determination of the prices they are willing to accept or pay. The empirical results shed light on the effects of how risk-perception determinants, affected by different heuristics, can be important contributors to housing market dynamics caused by the physical effects of extreme weather events. We find that perception determinants related to hurricane intensity have a larger effect on housing prices than those related to hurricane frequency. More recent and stronger hurricane experiences also have a strong association with decreased housing prices. We find no evidence of a perception factor leading to underestimating chronic risks. The findings identify important nuances related to the housing market and contribute to enhancing coastal housing market stability from uncertainty about extreme weather by suggesting sensitive post-disaster policy reactions based on the effects of risk-perception factors.

Using Miami, Florida as a case study, we combine tide gauge, elevation, road network, and worker location data with a route optimization algorithm to model how tidal flooding affected commute times between 2002-2004 and 2015-2017. Results suggest tidal flooding increases annual commutes by 15 min on average and 274 min among the most heavily impacted areas. Additionally, approximately 14 000 commuters may be unable to reach their workplace due to tidal flooding at least once per year. Accommodation via dynamic adjustments in residential and work locations may reduce tidal commuting delays by as much as 70%, particularly among the highest earners. Many of the most affected areas do not experience flooding directly, expanding the purview of vulnerability beyond simple residential risk. Using 2060 extreme sea-level rise scenarios without accommodating behavior, mean annual commute delays are expected to reach 220 min with over 55 000 commuters potentially unable to reach their destinations.

J	Lucas, CH; Booth, KI; Garcia, C				Lucas, Chloe H.; Booth, Kate I.; Garcia, Carolina			Insuring homes against extreme weather events: a systematic review of the research	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Review						Climate change; Insurance; Disaster; Extreme weather; Systematic review	FLOOD INSURANCE DEMAND; NATURAL DISASTER; RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES; POSTDISASTER RECOVERY; RISK PERCEPTIONS; TAKE-UP; VULNERABILITY; PREFERENCES; ADAPTATION; PRONE	Home insurance for extreme weather events is a significant security mechanism not only for individual households but for global finance. As extreme weather events become more frequent and intense, home insurance has been identified by governments as a critical tool for climate adaptation and disaster resilience. However, the growing research literature on the interactions between household insurance and extreme climatic events has not previously been systematically reviewed. In this paper, we analyse 175 original peer-reviewed empirical research papers on this subject, published between 2009 and 2018. We identify areas of research focus, themes, spatial and temporal patterns, and knowledge gaps, and examine policy implications of these findings. We find that an overall focus on flood insurance leaves unanswered questions about the different insurantial challenges posed by storms and wildfire. We suggest existing technocratic and calculative insurance narratives obscure the political and moral assumptions embedded within them, and that these assumptions warrant further investigation in the context of socially legitimate insurance against the impact of extreme weather events.

Research on the advantages and disadvantages of grey infrastructure, such as deep tunnels and pipe networks, is necessary to apply hybrid green-grey infrastructure scientifically and effi-ciently. A novel urban flood model was applied in a highly urbanized region to evaluate the grey infrastructure. Green-grey approaches were also compared. The results showed that deep tunnels decreased the peak flood volume and shortened the time of peak flow. Pipe network improvements decreased the peak flood volume but did not affect the time of peak flow. However, the deep tunnels could not mitigate local inundations caused by insufficient sewer pipe capacity, whereas pipe network improvements could not mitigate inundations caused by backwater flooding. Moreover, pipe network improvements tended to generate new downstream inundation hot-spots. Green-grey infrastructures performed better than grey infrastructures for urban flood reduction. A hybrid green-grey approach was recommended. Suitable combinations of green-grey infrastructures improve the sta-bility and effectiveness of urban flood management.

Single-family residential buildings are of particular interest because they are difficult to insure and often highlight wealth discrepancies in society in the wake of natural disasters. Calculating building replacement cost based on a specific natural disaster is of interest to municipalities and city planners who are working to prepare their cities for potential future costs of recovery. There are models designed by flood modellers, and there are models designed by city planners. This paper presents a novel Indicator Modelling Framework (IMF) by bringing together a model from the flooding domain (HAZUS) and a model from the geospatial application domain (e.g. CityGML) and weaving them together. The weaving process automatically calculates the building replacement cost for buildings based on a flood scenario as well as generates domain-specific metadata. The weaving process capitalizes on the strengths of both models, and future work will focus on weaving between models in other domains.

Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted on a nationally representative sample of Korean adults after the moderate earthquake in Pohang in 2017. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for seismic retrofitting and earthquake insurance. Findings The results show that risk perception, housing ownership, earthquake experience and income level significantly influenced WTP for seismic retrofitting and earthquake insurance. The results also indicate that a greater number of damage-free earthquake experiences reduced the WTP that could be explained by normalcy bias. Finally, people who believed that the Pohang earthquake might be an example of induced seismicity (i.e. triggered by the geothermal power plant) tended to have a lower WTP for seismic retrofitting. Originality/value This study offers valuable findings on public attitudes about enhancing earthquake preparedness policies in moderate earthquake zones, regions that few studies have examined despite their high vulnerability due to a lack of preparedness.

Owing to the scarcity of high-quality water in the soil and the environment's spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, ranging from extreme flooding to drought, roots have evolutionarily acquired tremendous plasticity regarding their geometric arrangement of individual roots and their three-dimensional organization within the soil. Water deficiency has also become an increasing threat to agriculture and dryland ecosystems due to climate change. As a result, roots have become important targets for genetic selection and modification in an effort to improve crop resilience under water-limiting conditions. This review addresses root plasticity from different angles: Their structures and geometry in response to the environment, potential genetic control of root traits suitable for water-limiting conditions, and contemporary and future studies of the principles underlying root plasticity post-Darwin's 'root-brain' hypothesis. Our increasing knowledge of different disciplines of plant sciences and agriculture should contribute to a sustainable management of natural and agricultural ecosystems for the future of mankind.

Reconstructing the Chongbaxia Tsho glacial lake outburst flood in the Eastern Himalaya: Evolution, process and impacts	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						GLOFs; Climate change; Glaciers; Himalayas; Remote sensing	FROM-MOTION PHOTOGRAMMETRY; DAM-BREACH; MOUNTAIN ENVIRONMENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INVENTORY; SNOW; SIMULATION; COLLAPSE; ACCURACY; EVEREST	Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) are one of the most destructive natural disasters. Understanding GLOF evolution, and their impacts, plays a fundamental role in GLOF hazard assessment and risk management. Reconstructing historical GLOFs is an important exercise because detailed case studies of such glacial hazards are rare, which hinders the capacity of glacial hazard practitioners to learn from these events. In this study, we reconstruct a historical GLOF from moraine-dammed Chongbaxia Tsho (89.745 degrees E, 28.211 degrees N) in the Eastern Himalaya, which is a unique case study because the outburst flood cascaded into two further lakes downstream. We employ a combination of i) multi-source and multi-temporal satellite imagery, ii) field investigation (including an unmanned aerial vehicle survey), iii) numerical dam breach and hydrodynamic modelling and, iv) qualitative and quantitative cryospheric and meteorological analysis, to investigate the evolution of the GLOF hazard, simulate moraine dam failure and GLOF propagation, and explore the role that long- and short-termclimate trends played in providing the conditioning factors for the outburst. Chongbaxia Tsho expanded rapidly between 1987 until 2001 in response to glacier recession most likely caused by a regional warming trend of +0.37 degrees C per decade. Based on satellite image analysis we refine the outburst date to be 6 August 2001, instead of 6 August 2000, as previously reported, and attribute an ice avalanche into the glacial lake originating from the receding parent glacier as the most likely trigger for moraine dam failure. Through DEM differencing and lake level decrease, we estimate that a total water volume of 27.1 +/- 1.6 x 10(6) m(3) was released from the lake during the event, and using dam breach modelling we estimate that the peak discharge at the breach was >6600 m(3) s(-1). The GLOF flowed through downstream Chongbamang Tsho and Chongbayong Tsho, both of which served to attenuate the GLOF and reduce downstream losses; the latter stored an estimated 96% of the flood volume. Precipitation totals in the weeks preceding the GLOF exceeded the historical mean by up to 40%, and may have contributed to instability of the parent glacier, and generation of an ice avalanche with enough impact energy to cause lake water to overtop the moraine dam and initiate breach development. A future GLOF from Chongbaxia Tsho cannot be ruled out, but more field data, including detailed lake bathymetry, and information pertaining to the sedimentological and geotechnical characteristics of the moraine dam, are required for a more robust parameterization of a predictive GLOF model and quantification of the hazard posed by a future GLOF.

Changes in water availability are projected to affect a range of ecological processes, including the decomposition of plant litter and carbon cycling. However, a detailed understanding of microbial stress response to drought/flooding is missing. In this study, an intermittent lake is taken up as a model for changes in water availability and how they affect the functional pathways in microbial communities of the decomposing Phragmites australis litter. The results show that most enriched functions in both habitats belonged to the classes of Carbohydrates and Clustering-based subsystems (terms with unknown function) from SEED subsystems classification. We confirmed that changes in water availability resulted in altered functional makeup of microbial communities. Our results indicate that microbial communities under more frequent water stress (due to fluctuating conditions) could sustain an additional metabolic cost due to the production or uptake of compatible solutes to maintain cellular osmotic balance. Nevertheless, although prolonged submergence seemed to have a negative impact on several functional traits in the fungal community, the decomposition rate was not affected.

Although high-resolution flood simulations have made notable advancements, they remain computationally expensive, underscoring the need for efficient machine learning surrogate models. As a result of sparse empirical observation and expensive data collection, there is a growing need for the models to perform effectively in 'small-data' contexts, a characteristic typical of many scientific problems. This research combines the latest developments in surrogate modelling and physics-informed machine learning to propose a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-based surrogate model for hydrodynamic simulators governed by Shallow Water Equations. The proposed method incorporates physics-based prior information into the neural network structure by encoding the conservation of mass into the model without relying on calculating continuous derivatives in the loss function. The method is demonstrated for a high-resolution inland flood simulation model and a large-scale regional tidal model. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by up to 25 %. This research demonstrates the benefits and robustness of physics-informed approaches in surrogate modelling for flood and hydroclimatic modelling problems.

However, these ecosystems are highly impacted by local human activities and climate change, which has resulted in reducing their extent and can limit their role in flooding mitigation. Most studies dealing with the coastal protection offered by ecosystems focus on a single ecosystem and, also seldom assess potential differences in protection with changes in status of the ecosystem. Therefore, based on a Xbeach Non-hydrostatic numerical modeling approach, we quantified the coastal inundation response to different combinations of ecosystems' health statuses. A combination of a fringing reef environment associated with a vegetated beach was chosen as this pattern is typical of many low-lying areas of the Caribbean and tropical areas in general. Our results, (1) highlight the potential of capitalizing on the combined impacts of multiple ecosystems on coastal protection, (2) alert to the consequences of further destruction of these ecosystems, (3) demonstrate the predominant role of vegetation with an increased sea-level rise and (4) provide strategies to limit the deleterious effects of present-day and future reef degradation.

The study aims towards balancing a double edge situation of the inevitable flood and drought. The Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method is used to calculate the rainfall- runoff and the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) is used for identifying potential water accumulation zones, whereas the Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) is used to calculate surface waterbody variations and the Soil Water Index (SWI) is used to identify zones varying in the range of dry-to-wet soil moisture. The study focuses on the use of nature-based solutions (NbS) for achieving mutual flood-drought mitigation for the pilot case of the Banaskantha district, Gujarat, and is validated for the study case of the Muzaffarpur district, Bihar. The application of the developed contingency plan in the form of an applicability rubric agrees to solve the issue by 44.44% for the pilot case and 22.22% for the study case. It suggests the application of NbS for the regions having similar situations of flood-drought as of the pilot case.

Yet this fails to translate into practical application as these scholars miss a clear understanding of the processes that shape indigenous DRR. Based on a case of floods in the Rwenzori (Uganda), in this study, the aimed is to conceptualize the socio-epistemic processes through which Indigenous people question their practices and develop adapted DRR strategies. By trying out various practices over several floods, Indigenous people developed a toolbox of criteria to address the changing disaster risk. The capacity to learn from each event is illustrated by crafting practices that enhance ecological integrity, livelihoods, and sociocultural well-being across the watershed. This skill is largely attributed to the community structures organized around the cultural stewardship which favor a holistic approach to produce best practices. Yet, through history, adapted indigenous DRR strategies remain hampered by external pressures that are sociopolitical and capitalistic in nature. It is thus argued that cultural stewardship is crucial in enabling development of adapted indigenous DRR insofar as external sociopolitical and/or capitalistic situations permit.

The imperfect knowledge and representation of the climate system is considered with multiple global climate models (GCMs). Yet, uncertainty introduced by incomplete representation of natural variability is also relevant but not always accounted for. A set of realizations provides improved insights in natural variability presented by the GCM. This study explores the potential of using a set of realizations from a single GCM-RCP combination instead of single realizations. We use (subsets of) 16 realizations from EC-Earth for RCP8.5 and focus on three locations along the Rhine. We use a single GCM-RCP combination to avoid the interference of additional sources of uncertainty. We find that projected changes in future river flows highly depend on the realization chosen. Individual ensemble members provide different changes for annual mean flow, extreme flows, and regime shift. By increasing the number of realizations and combining their annual maxima in extreme value analysis, future projections of flow extremes converge. We conclude that a single ensemble realization gives overconfident and possibly erroneous projections. In climate science, this is well studied; however, in flood risk assessments, it is still often neglected.

Until recently, civil engineers largely attempted to expel water from the landscape as fast as possible. Over the past three decades, however, engineers have begun to articulate new mechanisms for responding to flooding that store stormwater in the urban landscape. In this paper, I analyse the construction of what are commonly referred to as piscinoes, large-scale detention ponds that pool stormwater in the event of heavy rain events. Drawing from literature in urban political ecology, I argue that piscinoes attempt to correct for a complex and unequal landscape, but that they do so in a way that mainly prioritises large-scale engineering solutions to the problem of flooding. As such, in spite of being hailed as indicative of a paradigm shift in flood management, piscinoes are instead a continuation of the city's broader hydraulic and urban paradigms. In response, I consider alternative approaches to the development of multifunctional piscinoes that could serve both social and ecological aims. Ultimately, however, I draw from urban political ecology to argue that flooding is fundamentally a political problem that requires a political solution.

Although its use grown over the past two decades, to date there has not been a comprehensive review of the environmental sustainability Q-methodology literature. Using bibliometric analysis and systematic review, this paper examines the rapid growth in published Q-methodology research on sustainable natural resource management and environmental governance. We analysed and iteratively coded 277 empirical Q-studies published between 2000-2018 to establish research trends, shared gaps, and best practices among environmental social science Q-researchers. We also conducted co-authorship and co-citation analyses to identify research clusters using Q-methodology. We find that, while Q-methodology uses a relatively standardized protocol, considerable heterogeneity persists across such domains as study design, p-set identification, concourse and Q-set development, analysis and interpretation. Further, we identify major reporting gaps among Q methodology publications where researchers do not fully describe or justify subjective decision-making throughout the research process. The paper ends with recommendations for improving research reporting and increasing the circulation and uptake of up-to-date Q-methodology practices and innovations.

Such plants cause permanent flooding and may produce periodic flooding in adjacent upland forests. We determined the short- and long-term effects of artificial flooding on the soil chemistry of upland forests adjacent to the Balbina Hydroelectric Reservoir, Amazonas State, Brazil. We randomized 20 sampling units in upland forests located on the banks of streams adjacent to the hydropower plant. Each sampling unit consisted of two paired forests: one artificial "flooded forest" near the stream and an unflooded "control forest." We performed soil chemical analyses to determine the pH and total organic C, N, Al3+, and nutrient levels (P, Ca, Mg, and K). In the short term, flooding caused soil acidification, C loss, and increased soil nutrient availability, but this effect did not occur in the long term. In the long term, soil acidity decreased, C loss occurred, and available N cumulatively decreased because of annual flooding after the impoundment of the reservoir. These cumulative N losses, associated with high C emissions, may alter the regional climate and contribute to global climate change.

A random quadrat sampling method was employed to assess percent plant cover and environmental data were collected following standard procedures. Cluster and indicator species analyses using plant cover data were used to define the species composition of plant communities. Differences in community composition along gradients of elevation, slope, soil pH, available phosphorus, and peat/soil depth were analyzed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The wetlands supported 120 vascular plant species from 84 genera and 51 families. Analyses identified four plant communities, I to IV, each named from the three most prominent species. The key indicator species of four plant communities,Acorus calamus, Carex diandra, Equisetum ramosissimum, andCarex capillacea, dominate shallow fresh marsh, seasonally flooded basin of flat, fresh water meadow, and poor fen, respectively. Elevation and soil phosphorus were the most important environmental variables in explaining the variation in wetland vegetation. The findings can be used to support the work of conservation agencies to identify and conserve these plant communities and their habitats in the Himalaya.

As a result of ongoing urbanization, rain and flood events have increasingly affected the well-being of residents in cities across the world. This should draw attention to the role of urban ecosystems in providing runoff retention/flood mitigation services. Focusing on Shenzhen, a major city in southern China, we used a hydrologic model based on the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) model to evaluate this flood reduction ecosystem service and its dynamic trends based on long-term remote sensing data from 1980 to 2018. We find that Shenzhen's capacity for flood reduction gradually decreased due to changes in land use. The spatial distribution showed strong reduction capacity in the eastern part of the city and weak capacity in the western part. Additionally, the city's total flood reduction capacity decreased by over 1.88 x 10(8) m(3) over the past two decades. This loss of ecosystem-based flood reduction capacity undermines Shenzhen's resilience against extreme weather events.

Effective response requires effective risk management concepts and strategies at individual and watershed level to increase community resilience. Focusing on flood risk and the information associated with it, individual risk behavior in the shape of implementing property-level flood risk adaptation (PLFRA) measures is often overlooked. For this research, a comprehensive overview of possible PLFRA measures for homeowners in flood risk areas was made, as well as the possible costs and technical feasibility for new and existing buildings. To complement this, insights into risk mitigation behavior are essential due to the ongoing shift to risk-based and individualized flood risk management, which require a contribution from flood-prone households to risk reduction. Results show that PLFRA measures differentiate in their effectiveness, cost-efficiency and technical feasibility, and full protection can never be guaranteed. Considering risk mitigation behavior, literature generally distinguishes between situational factors (such as communication and economic subsidies) and personal factors (such as personal and psychological components influencing individual behavior).

This paper calls for the incorporation of a wider range of visualization techniques as a critical component of local planning efforts to improve shoreline resiliency in the face of climate uncertainty. We utilized multiple visualization techniques to examine and illustrate diverse data sources as part of a community-based scenario planning process for three Lake Michigan coastal communities Ludington, Grand Haven, and St Joseph, Michigan, USA-between 2013 and 2015. The outcomes demonstrate the localized impacts of climate variability on Lake Michigan's eastern shoreland dynamics over time and visualize a range of future scenarios impacting inland land use. The results show that utilizing a range of visualization techniques in public engagement platforms offers communities a more detailed and complete understanding of climate variability, shoreland dynamics, and the trade-offs involved in community-based resilience planning. To support ongoing efforts advancing resilience planning in the State, many of the visualizations and a toolkit for the Michigan Association of Planners which provides a step-by-step guide for community-based master planning.

This approach, based on risk reduction and reliability, is used to assess the performance of conventional interventions (e.g., flood defences and dams) and to support decisions regarding their implementation. However, for more innovative solutions, performance has often not been quantified by means of these metrics and, therefore, end-users are hesitant to implement them in existing flood risk reduction systems. To overcome the gap between innovators and end-users, we present a framework based on four performance indicators, to ensure the required insights in risk and reliability are provided. The four indicators: effectiveness, durability, reliability and costs, allow end-users to evaluate, select, and implement flood adaptation innovations, and provide innovators with insight into the performance of the technology and the criteria and information necessary for successful market uptake of their innovation. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated for a (hypothetical) case of a hospital complex built in an area that has subsided below the surrounding area, which is subject to tropical rain showers. The following innovations are considered: an early flood warning system, a green roof, and a temporary flood barrier.

By contrast, only fragmented efforts have addressed the personal (expert knowledge), financial, and institutional limits of municipalities to achieve the flood risk management (FRM) goals. Starting with thorough literature review, we emphasise the key gaps in current understanding of municipal FRM and note that scarce attention has been paid to small-sized municipalities (both in area and population). Next, we present an empirical case study based on semi-structured interviews with 17 mayors of small municipalities in a flood-prone area of northern Czechia. The aggregation of the mayors' opinions about flood threat and current and planned FRM measures as well as the perceived barriers in their implementation enabled the classification of different FRM strategies at a municipal level (herein referred to as "self-confidence," "fatalism," and "active scepticism"). These strategies are then discussed in terms of the mayors' leadership styles and the significant consequences on the effectiveness and efficiency of FRM at a municipal level.

Yet, few studies have examined the consequences of the seasonal cycles of flooding and drying to fish condition and reproduction in these ecosystems. In this study, we compared the body condition, reproduction and diet of two chub populations from two adjacent sites (a perennial and an intermittent site) on the main stem of a Mediterranean river (Evrotas River, S. Greece). The study was conducted in spring 2017, three months after flow resumption and before the onset of chub reproductive period. Condition (net weight adjusted for length) of fish did not differ significantly between the two sites, despite lower aquatic macroinvertebrate availability at the intermittent site. Fish at the intermittent site compensated for the lower aquatic prey availability by increasing their feeding intensity and by shifting to higher terrestrial prey consumption. In addition, chub liver weight (adjusted for length) and gonadal weight (adjusted for length) were significantly higher at the intermittent site, indicating higher somatic and reproductive investment. These results highlight the resilience of fish populations inhabiting streams with extreme variation in flow, due to natural and/or anthropogenic drought.

Within floodplainsediments, regular flooding and textural gradients interact to createdynamic redox conditions. While anaerobic protection of OC upon burialis a well-recognized carbon storage mechanism in redox-active floodplainsediments, the impact of protective mineral-organic associations isrelatively unknown. Here we determined the quantitative importanceand chemical composition of mineral-organic associations along well-definedredox gradients emerging from textural variations and depth withinmeander sediments of the subalpine East River watershed (Gothic, CO).We characterized mineral-organic associations using a combinationof sequential extractions, physical fractionation, and high-resolutionmass spectrometry. Across the meander, we found that mineral-associatedOC constitutes a significant fraction of total OC, and that extractableiron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) phases as well as high-density isolateswere strongly correlated with total OC content, suggesting that mineral-organicassociations are quantitatively important for floodplain sedimentOC protection. Our mass spectrometry results showed OC associatedwith increasingly ordered Fe and Al phases are relatively enrichedin low-molecular weight, oxidized, aromatic compounds. Surprisingly,however, total OC content showed weak or no correlation with indicatorsof anaerobic protection, such as relatively bioavailable OC pools(water-extractable and particulate OC) or the molecular weight andoxidation state of OC. Overall, this work highlights that protectionof OC bound to reactive mineral phases in addition to anaerobicprotection can play a quantitatively important role in controllingsoil carbon storage in redox-active floodplain sediments.

Climate change and human activities are key factors that contribute to various natural hazards such as floods, landslides, droughts, and deforestation. Assam state in India experiences annual floods that significantly impact the local environment. In 2022, the flooding affected approximately 1.9 million people and 2930 villages, resulting in the loss of 54 lives. This study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform to investigate the extent of flood inundation and deforestation, analyzing pre-flood and post-flood C band Sentinel-1 GRD datasets. Identifying pre- and post-flood areas was conducted using Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS datasets and the modified and normalized difference water index (MNDWI). The districts of Cachar, Kokrajhar, Jorhat, Kamrup, and Dhubri were the most affected by floods and deforestation. The 2022 Assam flood encompassed approximately 24,507.27 km(2) of vegetation loss and 33,902.49 km(2) of flood inundation out of a total area of 78,438 km(2). The most affected areas were the riverine regions, the capital city Dispur, Guwahati, southern parts of Assam, and certain eastern regions.

Large Ensemble Diagnostic Evaluation of Hydrologic Parameter Uncertainty in the Community Land Model Version 5 (CLM5)	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						CLM5; parameter uncertainty; hydrologic prediction; uncertainty characterization; ensembles	SOIL-MOISTURE; DATA SET; SENSITIVITY; FLOOD; MOPEX; RAINFALL; CRITERIA; ERROR	Land surface models such as the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) seek to enhance understanding of terrestrial hydrology and aid in the evaluation of anthropogenic and climate change impacts. However, the effects of parametric uncertainty on CLM5 hydrologic predictions across regions, timescales, and flow regimes have yet to be explored in detail. The common use of the default hydrologic model parameters in CLM5 risks generating streamflow predictions that may lead to incorrect inferences for important dynamics and/or extremes. In this study, we benchmark CLM5 streamflow predictions relative to the commonly employed default hydrologic parameters for 464 headwater basins over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We evaluate baseline CLM5 default parameter performance relative to a large (1,307) Latin Hypercube Sampling-based diagnostic comparison of streamflow prediction skill using over 20 error measures. We provide a global sensitivity analysis that clarifies the significant spatial variations in parametric controls for CLM5 streamflow predictions across regions, temporal scales, and error metrics of interest. The baseline CLM5 shows relatively moderate to poor streamflow prediction skill in several CONUS regions, especially the arid Southwest and Central U.S. Hydrologic parameter uncertainty strongly affects CLM5 streamflow predictions, but its impacts vary in complex ways across U.S. regions, timescales, and flow regimes. Overall, CLM5's surface runoff and soil water parameters have the largest effects on simulated high flows, while canopy water and evaporation parameters have the most significant effects on the water balance.

J	Cao, XJ; Qi, YC; Ni, GH				Cao, Xuejian; Qi, Youcun; Ni, Guangheng			X-band polarimetric radar QPE for urban hydrology: The increased contribution of high-resolution rainfall capturing	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Urban hydrology; Precipitation; Flood; Hydrological scale	CATCHMENT; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; FREQUENCY; EXTREMES; IMPACT; AREAS	Increased population is exposed to urban flooding as a result of climate change. Flood early warning can largely reduce the loss of life and asset, while how detailed rainfall information is enough has always been a critical issue in achieving robust flood forecasting. Previous analysis has been limited by lacking high-resolution rainfall observation or a spatially-matched urban hydrological model. This study couples mature modeling technologies with comprehensive hydro-meteorological measurement, that is comprised of X-band polarimetric radar (75 m, 3 min), weather stations, and hydrometric stations, and this study further attempts to understand the rainfall spatial resolution effects and critical resolutions from a multi-scale perspective (e.g. block, district, and catchment scales). The results show that coarser resolutions always lead to underestimation of peak flows, even exceeding 40 % in the case of adopting 10 km rainfall data at the block scale. But such damping effects on discharge simulation can be largely attenuated with increased hydrological scale. In general, spatial resolutions of higher than 500 m, and 10 km are needed to obtain accurate simulation results (i.e. keep the relative bias within 20 %) at district and catchment scales, while at least 300 m for the block scale. In conclusion, refined rainfall forcing contributes to better simulation of peak flows in urban hydrological modeling, but the required rainfall spatial resolution changes with the scale of hydrological application. These findings help to better achieve the balance between rainfall observation cost and flood simulation accuracy.

The downscaled projections showed that the basin would be wetter at the annual scale during the next 80 years. Precipitation in spring would be increase over the entire basin under all future scenarios except SSP1-2.6. Parts of the PL basin exhibit drier trends under the four scenarios in summer, with the largest drying area occurring in the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Except in the SSP2-4.5 scenario, precipitation in autumn has increasing trends in all scenarios across the PL basin. Precipitation in winter shows a drying trend in some areas except in the SSP1-2.6 scenario, with the largest area occurring in SSP5-8.5. The results provide improved precipitation information for policy-making in water resource management and adaptation planning to mitigate Yangtze River floods in the future.

Study focus: In this study, a large-scale coupled model of hydrological and hydrodynamic processes was developed via the Distributed Time Variant Gain Model and the hydrodynamics operation coupled model. Two scenarios including operated by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and natural condition hypothesis without the reservoir construction, were analyzed based on the coupled model to investigate the effects of TGD operation on the streamflow from 1970 to 2018. New hydrological insights: Results exhibited that the annual average relative deviation of flow operated by the TGD was approximately 24% compared with the natural state at Yichang, while the value of Chenglingji, Hankou, Hukou and Datong were 8.5~12.8%. During water supply period, the TGD operation increase the streamflow by 33% at Yichang, and the streamflow in downstream can gain about 6-17%. For impounding process, except Hukou, the others showed a decreasing trend, and the reduction ranged from about 7-20%. For flood season, the dam operation mainly intercepts high flood peaks while the average streamflow changes a little. The high flood peaks at Yichang can be reduced by 20%, and the changes of high flood peaks in downstream reduce to no more than 10% due to the influence of interval inflow. The deviations during drawdown period are almost below 10%.

For this reason, sustainable development has become a fundamental agenda in the twenty-first century. The intense urbanization induces significant changes in the natural water cycle, and this feature, coupled with neglecting the natural water dynamics in the urban planning process, increases the population's vulnerability to urban floods. In this context, sustainable urban drainage techniques have been proposed to match the urban and natural demands, while preserving or recovering the environmental functions, as much as possible. However, such techniques are often not adopted, even in developed cities, and this fact seems to be related to the improper awareness of the whole set of benefits involved in their use. This article aims to evaluate the economic viability of sustainable urban drainage systems, in a simple and easily acceptable way, considering the ecosystem services provided by green roofs and rainwater harvesting barrels, and including their action in delivering urban revitalization and valorization. The proposed method can be easily used and understood by decision-makers, facilitating its diffusion and use in urban policy-making process. The results showed a best-performing scenario for the rainwater harvesting system with a payback of approximately three years, a benefit-cost ratio of four, and an internal return rate of 45%. The ecosystem service benefits represent 36.3% to 50.8% of total benefits.

These events, which have become commonplace, constitute a danger for residents and for public facilities, roads, homes, etc. and make these areas more and more vulnerable. Although measures to reduce this vulnerability of coastal cities have been identified by experts and authorities, a resistance exists to their implementation by the inhabitants of these areas exposed to coastal risks. The aim of our study is to investigate risk perception and coping strategies used by inhabitants of areas at risk of coastal flooding and coastal erosion, and to identify potential differences between these two types of coastal risks. More precisely, this study seeks to identify the major predictors of the willingness to cope using Bayesian regression. 208 inhabitants of coastal areas exposed at risk of coastal flooding and erosion in Pays de la Loire, region of western France, participated to our study. Results reveal that coastal erosion is perceived as a greater threat, essentially because it is perceived as more frightening than coastal flooding. Moreover, our results showed that past experiences of coastal risks had an impact on the willingness to use active coping strategies and that there were major differences in the choice of strategy depending on the risks. These results are discussed in terms of risk management.

However, large computational demands of state-of-the art hydrodynamic flood models makes multiple and real-time simulations unfeasible. This study presents a fast-dynamic GIS-based flood model, FloodStmem. FloodStroem generates a surface network of depressions (bluespots) and flow paths, and routes surcharged water from a subsurface drainage model through the network resulting in flood depth maps and associated damage costs. FloodStroem is tested on three sub-catchments in Elster Creek Catchment, Melbourne, Australia and benchmarked against the 2D distributed hydrodynamic model MIKE 21 and two other simplified models, RUFIDAM and CA-ffe. FloodStmem is robust to the number of bluespots included. For the three sub-catchments, FloodStroem can reproduce flooding time, pattern, depth, and damage costs sufficiently, but has a tendency to underestimate flooding upstream and overestimate flooding downstream. Performance is best for the large, steep sub-catchments and largest rainstorms, where FloodStroem performs better than the two other simplified models. The Critical Success Index (CSI) ranges from 23% for a 5-year storm event in a flat catchment to 65% for a 100-year return period for a steeper catchment. With respect to simulation time, FloodStroem is five orders of magnitude faster than the 2D hydrodynamic model, and 33 times faster when including the entire model setup time, which has potential for further reduction by optimization of the workflow.

However, the development of these models has long been hindered by their low accuracy. In order to improve the streamflow simulation accuracy of GHMs, we developed a GHM-the FLEX-Global-based on the regionalization of hydrological model parameters. The FLEX-Global model is primarily based on the framework of the FLEX hydrological model coupled with the HAND-based Storage Capacity curve (HSC) runoff generation module to calculate net rainfall, and uses the global river-routing CaMa-Flood model to calculate river network routing. This new model allows for streamflow simulation at a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1 day in global catchments. To validate FLEX-Global accuracy, the FLEX-Global-simulated streamflow of 26 major rivers distributed in five different climate zones was compared with the observed data from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC). Next, the model performance of FLEX-Global was further verified by comparing it with that of seven existing GHMs with varying accuracy in the five climate zones. Multi-metric evaluation indicated that the streamflow simulation accuracy was improved by the FLEX-Global model with regionalized parameters, especially in the tropical and dry climate zones. This newly-developed GHM with regionalized parameters can provide scientific support for the assessment of climate change impact, optimization of global water resource mangement, simulation of Earth's multi-sphere coupling, and implementation of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project (ISIMIP).

LIPID-PEROXIDATION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; DROUGHT; RESPONSES; GROWTH; HYPOXIA; LEAVES; NACL; SUPEROXIDE; TOLERANCE	Recently, flooding stress caused by nonuniform and excessive rainfall, which occurs in most regions of the world due to global climate change, has adversely affected plant growth and development. In many regions, spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) is severely affected by flooding stress during the cultivation period. This study aimed to determine the effects of flooding stress on the morpho-physiological and biochemical properties of spinach in different harvest times. The changes in the morpho-physiological and biochemical parameters of spinach were determined at two levels of stress, including no stress and flooding stress, as well as five different harvesting times. The results demonstrate that while flooding stress reduced some growth parameters such as chlorophyll a, b and protein content, it caused statistically significant increases in proline, hydrogen peroxide (HO), malon-dialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) activity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that first and second components explained 71.59 % and 73.50 % of variation under no stress and flooding stress conditions, respectively. Correlation and PCA analysis revealed that relative leaf water content (LWC), membrane damage, and chlorophyll a and b are important parameters as they are affected in response to flooding stress. Thus, the flooding stress occurring at harvest times negatively affected the growth and development of spinach and caused significant changes in the morpho-physiological and biochemical properties.

To better understand the extreme events and mitigate their effects, this paper explores the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation extremes in the NAHPP during 1976 and 2018. Variation trends and spatial distributions of the annual maximum 1-day, 3-day, 7-day, and 15-day-rainfall were analyzed, and the probability distribution of rainfall extremes in the NAHPP was calculated by three distribution functions (Gumbel, P-III, and generalized extreme value). The optimal fitting function was selected based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the rainfall in different return periods was calculated according to the optimal fitting function. The results indicate that rainfall extreme showed a 2- to 3-year periodicity on the interannual scale and 21-year periodicity on the chronological scale in the NAHPP. The rainfall extremes showed nonsignificant increase trend over the NAHPP, and some stations showed no significant decrease trend. The P-III distribution function best fit to the rainfall extremes (the maximum 1-day rainfall: 59%). The spatial distributions of rainfall extremes were similar in different return periods. As the return period increased, the estimated rainfall by the three distribution functions were slightly larger than that in the empirical return period. The findings will benefit regional water resources management and water-related risk control.

An Aridity Index-Based Formulation of Streamflow Components	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						long-term water balance; L'vovich formulation; Budyko formulation; baseflow; direct runoff; catchment water partitioning	CATCHMENT WATER-BALANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; DATA SET; RUNOFF; FLOW; SENSITIVITY; SURFACE; PRECIPITATION	Direct runoff and baseflow are the two primary components of total streamflow, and their accurate estimation is indispensable for a variety of hydrologic applications. While direct runoff is the quick response stemming from surface and shallow subsurface flow paths and is often associated with floods, baseflow represents the groundwater contribution from stored sources (e.g., groundwater) to streams and is crucial for environmental flow regulations, and water supply, among others. L'vovich (1979, ) proposed a two-step water balance partitioning, where precipitation is divided into direct runoff and catchment wetting, followed by the disaggregation of the latter into baseflow and evapotranspiration. Here, we investigate the role of the aridity index (ratio between mean-annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) in controlling the long-term (mean-annual) fluxes of direct runoff and baseflow. We present an analytical solution beginning with similar assumptions as proposed by Budyko (1974, ), leading to two complementary expressions for the two fluxes. The aridity index explained 77% and 89% of variability in direct runoff and baseflow from 378 catchments within the continental United States, while our formulations were able to reproduce the patterns of water balance partitioning proposed by L'vovich (1979, ) at the mean-annual timescale. Our approach can be used to further understand how climate and landscape controls the terrestrial water balance at mean-annual timescales, while also representing a step toward the prediction of baseflow and direct runoff at ungauged basins.

J	Liang, JY; Liu, DS				Liang, Jiayong; Liu, Desheng			Estimating Daily Inundation Probability Using Remote Sensing, Riverine Flood, and Storm Surge Models: A Case of Hurricane Harvey	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						fusion; inundation probability; remote sensing; Hurricane Harvey; NDWI; ADCIRC	LAND-COVER DATABASE; UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; DELINEATION; HAZARD; INDEX; LIFE	Heavy precipitation and storm surges often co-occur and compound together to form sudden and severe flooding events. However, we lack comprehensive observational tools with high temporal and spatial resolution to capture these fast-evolving hazards. Remotely sensed images provide extensive spatial coverage, but they may be limited by adverse weather conditions or platform revisiting schedule. River gauges could provide frequent water height measurement but they are sparsely distributed. Riverine flood and storm surge models, depending on input data quality and calibration process, have various uncertainties. These lead to inevitable temporal and spatial gaps in monitoring inundation dynamics. To fill in the observation gaps, this paper proposes a probabilistic method to estimate daily inundation probability by combining the information from multiple sources, including satellite remote sensing, riverine flood depth, storm surge height, and land cover. Each data source is regarded as a spatial evidence layer, and the weight of evidence is calculated by assessing the association between the evidence presence and inundation occurrence. Within a Bayesian model, the fusion results are daily inundation probability whenever at least one data source is available. The proposed method is applied to estimate daily inundation in Harris, Texas, impacted by Hurricane Harvey. The results agree with the reference water extent, high water mark, and extracted tweet locations. This method could help to further understand flooding as an evolving time-space process and support response and mitigation decisions.

Information about the alteration of soil microbiota under heavy metal pollution and flooding is still rather limited. Fast-growing trees are candidates for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soils. Therefore, the impact of Cu pollution on microbiota in soil used for cultivating Salix integra Thunb. was investigated with and without flooding for 60 d. Bacterial and fungal communities were accessed via partial 16S rRNA (V-3-V-4) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes. The activity of invertase, urease and cellulase were markedly decreased by 28.5-59%, 55.0-76.7% and 17.3-34.1%, respectively, with increasing Cu levels. Flooding significantly increased the activity of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase by 56.3% and 41.4% at the highest Cu level compared to its respective nonflooded condition. High Cu concentration significantly decreased the richness and diversity of the bacterial community, and fungi were more sensitive than bacteria under flooding conditions. Redundancy analysis suggests that Cu, Fe and soil organic matter are the key determinants affecting the composition of microbial communities. Our findings provide new insight into the responses of soil microbes to Cu-contamination and contribute to our understanding of metal toxicity in soil-woody plant systems under flooded conditions.

Mitigating the Legacy Effects of Ditching in a New England Salt Marsh	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Ditch remediation; Subsidence; Cordgrass colonization; Resilience	SEA-LEVEL RISE; TIDAL MARSH; COASTAL WETLANDS; MANAGEMENT	The legacy effects of mosquito ditching have made salt marshes more vulnerable to flooding impacts from climate change, presenting management challenges in New England where the majority of salt marshes have been ditched and greater rates of sea level rise and storm events are being observed. One legacy effect of mosquito ditching appears to be subsidence of the marsh, with greater effects near the ditches and extending into the marsh plain. We found an average of 9 cm subsidence midway between ditches that averaged 14 m apart. Ditch Remediation is a new approach to filling ditches that uses existing hydrology and vegetation to mend ditches from the bottom up to restore marsh plain elevations. Smaller, auxiliary ditches are selected for treatment. Hay is mown, allowed to dry, and rolled into the treatment ditch where it is held using twine. Nine ditches in four areas were treated in fall 2014 and 2015. Depth of treated ditches decreased an average of 18 cm by fall 2017, andSpartina alternifloracolonized the ditch centers (plant cover and stem density increased). It is unknown whether the trajectory of filling and revegetation of the ditches will continue on their own or if the reduction in drainage depth will stimulate marsh plain building. Ditch remediation could remove excessive drainage effects of half the ditches, thereby approaching an optimal drainage density that may allow tidal marshes to rebuild elevation. This simple and inexpensive technique to reduce ditch impacts should be considered by partnerships that include mosquito control agencies.

Sustainability Evaluation of Rainwater Harvesting-Based Flood Risk Management Strategies: A Multilevel Decision-Making Framework for Arid Environments	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sustainability; Flood risk management; Arid environments; Fuzzy FMEA; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy TOPSIS	WATER; TOPSIS	Arid environmental regions have faced disastrous floods as a result of global climate change in the recent past, particularly the Gulf countries. For the municipalities in urban areas, flood risk management (FRM) by means of rainwater harvesting (RWH) methods is a daunting task due to multiple influencing variables, such as hydraulic capacity of drainage infrastructure, effectiveness of RWH methods, flood frequencies, and associated consequences in different land uses. The solution of this integration problem may lead to development of several possible scenarios, e.g. improved drainage infrastructure for 10-year flood, existing drainage infrastructure with green roofs for 25-year flood, etc., which have their exclusive techno-economic constraints. A multilevel decision-making framework is developed to prioritize sustainable FRM scenarios for different land uses. Firstly, screening was carried out using checklist matrix to identify potential scenarios out of 105 possible combinations. Subsequently, risk analysis is performed to identify the scenarios with an acceptable risk using fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (fuzzy-FMEA). Finally, shortlisted scenarios are evaluated for their overall environmental, technical, and economic sustainability by means of fuzzy-based multicriteria decision-making. The implementation of the framework on Buraydah (Qassim, Saudi Arabia) revealed that 'existing drainage system supported with green roofs and retention ponds' is the most sustainable FRM scenario (to safely route 100-year flood) for mixed development and residential neighbourhoods, while 'improved drainage system with retention ponds' comes out to be the most sustainable choice for central districts.

METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS			English	Article							ALTITUDE ALPINE BASIN; PRECIPITATION; ENVIRONMENT; EVOLUTION; EXTREMES; LIGURIA	The Genoa Metropolitan Area (GMA) has been historically affected by floods for two reasons, namely meteorological conditions and the city's geographical arrangement. In the past few years in GMA, an increase in flash floods has been registered; among the causes, climate variations have been analysed. In 2014, several floods took place. In some areas of the hinterland, the cumulative annual rainfall exceeded 4000mm. This research analyses the rainfall statistics collected by Genoa University and Chiavari stations (GMA along the coast) and at Isoverde and Diga Giacopiane stations (hinterland of GMA). The analysis was based on the mean annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall and rainy days for the four stations and daily series for Genoa University. Furthermore, annual maximum data of hourly rainfall for the Pontecarrega station were analysed. The annual rainfall does not show any trend. The monthly analysis highlights significant decreases for rainfall and rainy days between spring and summer. Climate indices recorded on daily data at Genoa University station show a certain increase in rainfall intensity in recent years. Additionally, hourly rainfall at 1 and 3h increased, and the series showed a change point in the 1990s. Furthermore, urban sprawl has continually increased until now, and its contribution has already been accepted. These facts can be related to the intensification of flash flood events measured in the last decade. Furthermore, historical data from several sources confirm an increase in the number of events and casualties. These conditions determine a clear need for monitoring potentially hazard situations.

Next, it uses logistic regression to evaluate the socioeconomic determinants of block groups with 20% or more of residents age 65 and older at 3 feet of sea level rise compared to the other block groups in Miami-Dade.Results: The results show that this study area has an older population clustered in flood-prone locations along the shoreline. The block groups with more than 20% of older adults and sea level rise risk have higher homeownership and vacancy rates, a higher percentage of homes constructed before 1980, and more older individuals who live alone.Conclusion: This study identifies place-based compounding factors undermining the ability of older residents to adequately cope with accelerated sea level rise flooding in coastal urban locations. Namely, owning an older home in a declining neighborhood and living alone can trap older individuals in place and increase their flood risk.

Rigorous transient fluid-structure interaction analyses using the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model and the VOF Method are conducted. Geotechnical and abutments damages are neglected. Water surface profiles, velocity vectors, and hydrodynamic coefficients are determined. Based on the latest hydrological regime, particularly in supercritical flows, the results are partially compared against the latest advanced design codes, to evaluate the performance of their hydrodynamic and hydraulic provisions in similar incidents. It was acknowledged that the flood loads recommended by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) are fairly acceptable, Eurocode-1 predicts them rather accurately but not in extreme cases, and the Australian Standard (AS-5100.2) is less effective due to over-estimation of the hydrodynamic loads. Instead, the latter offers comprehensive user-defined hydraulic conditions. Furthermore, upon gradual rise of the water level to thrice the deck height, bridge stability is found to be at risk due to highly turbulent states. It is recommended that due to such threats, re-evaluation of flood regime, as well as its distinct hydrodynamic properties have to be accounted for, when evaluating existing bridges or designing new ones.

Properly addressing such environmental problems would require huge investments that could be decreased thanks to the further implementation of urban forests. Local administrations are designing participative projects to improve territories and their living conditions. The i-Tree Canopy modelling tool and the life cycle assessment method are jointly applied to evaluate the potential benefits of increasing tree coverage within the boundaries of the Metropolitan City of Naples, Southern Italy. Results highlighted that tree coverage could increase by about 2.4 million trees, thus generating 51% more benefits in pollutants removal, carbon sequestration and stormwater management. The benefits are also explored and confirmed by means of the life cycle assessment method. The potential tree cover is expected to provide a total annual economic benefit of USD 55 million, purchasing power parity value adjusted, representing USD 18 per citizen and USD 99,117 per square kilometre of implemented urban forest. These results can support a potential replication elsewhere and provide a reference for the sustainable improvement of cities by expanding urban green areas.

These options involve restoring an oyster reef bar that would act as a natural breakwater versus an impermeable revetment. The results of an on-site survey of users of the amenity and a negative binomial travel cost model demonstrate that the coastal trail has considerable recreational use value to local communities. In terms of a cost benefit analysis it was found that both protection options resulted in a positive net benefit over a 20 year time horizon but the nature based solution had a benefit cost ratio multiple times larger than the grey infrastructure alternative. The conclusions of the analysis remain valid under sensitivity analysis. The results suggest a compelling case for embedding nature based solutions in climate adaption and flood management planning for low lying coastal areas where recreational resources are under threat as it can be not only more cost effective but may also offer other ecosystem benefits to coastal communities.

Nevertheless, the lack of quantitative approaches to assess NBSs' effectiveness limits their technical, social and cultural acceptance. Within the PHUSICOS project (EU H2020 Innovation Action; Grant Agreement nr. 776681) a comprehensive assessment framework tool (AFT) has been developed to fill this gap. This paper presents an ex-post analysis with the PHUSICOS AFT applied to the Isar River case study. The restoration of the urban reach of the Isar River, in the city of Munich, was implemented in the early 2000s and represents a successful example of ecosystem and user-friendly flood risk management plan. The performance of the NBS measures implemented to manage the flood risk and improve the ecological status of the river (NBS scenario) is assessed in comparison with an alternative scenario with traditional hard engineering measures (grey scenario, GS). Results underscore the NBS as a competitive alternative. The ex-post analysis shows the potential of the PHUSICOS AFT for NBS performance assessment, providing guidance on indicator selection, stakeholders' management and performance assessment. The application discussed here is expected to aid professionals and researchers involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of NBSs.

J	Bonati, S				Bonati, Sara			Contested flood risk reduction: An analysis of environmental and social claims in the city of Genoa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Italy; Urban conflict; Flood risk reduction; Environmental justice	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; JUSTICE; POWER; PREPAREDNESS; CHALLENGES; DISTRIBUTE; LIGURIA; CONTEXT; HAZARDS	The most recent significant episodes of floods in terms of victims and damages in the city of Genoa occurred in 2011 and 2014. After 2014, the Italian government has changed its approach to flood risk management (FRM), adopting what has been called a change of direction towards flood risk reduction (FRR). Accordingly, the city has been involved in a process of governance and urban restructuring. In the wake of these governance and infrastructural transformations, I have conducted thirty-five semistructured interviews with local stakeholders. I use the results to discuss the adopted measures and their acceptability for the local community, focusing in particular on identifying the reasons and different narrative frames that move social dissent. The main reasons for dissent have been identified following two situations: no-recognition of the effectiveness of some works, and lack of adequate measures. Conclusions are that such manifestations of dissent could generate a discussion about the validity by the adopted FRR measures and claim for a more participative approach to the analysis of benefits and impacts produced by such measures. What emerges is in line with last international calls to overcome a technocratic approach to post-disaster, giving more space to community's needs.

Spatially Explicit Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping for Participatory Modeling of Stormwater Management	LAND			English	Article						flooding; geospatial analytics; GRASS GIS; knowledge elicitation; spatial scale dependency; socio-environmental systems; climate change; urban growth; socio-hydrology	PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; RIVER-BASIN; SCALE; PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; PPGIS; MAPS; TOOL	Addressing "wicked " problems like urban stormwater management necessitates building shared understanding among diverse stakeholders with the influence to enact solutions cooperatively. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are participatory modeling tools that enable diverse stakeholders to articulate the components of a socio-environmental system (SES) and describe their interactions. However, the spatial scale of an FCM is rarely explicitly considered, despite the influence of spatial scale on SES. We developed a technique to couple FCMs with spatially explicit survey data to connect stakeholder conceptualization of urban stormwater management at a regional scale with specific stormwater problems they identified. We used geospatial data and flooding simulation models to quantitatively evaluate stakeholders' descriptions of location-specific problems. We found that stakeholders used a wide variety of language to describe variables in their FCMs and that government and academic stakeholders used significantly different suites of variables. We also found that regional FCM did not downscale well to concerns at finer spatial scales; variables and causal relationships important at location-specific scales were often different or missing from the regional FCM. This study demonstrates the spatial framing of stormwater problems influences the perceived range of possible problems, barriers, and solutions through spatial cognitive filtering of the system's boundaries.

Human development along the coastline creates barriers to marsh migration, moderating tidal marsh distributions. This study shows that in the Chesapeake Bay, USA an estuarine system with geographic and development variability, overall estuarine tidal marshes are projected to decline by approximately half over the next century. Tidal freshwater and oligohaline habitats, which are found in the upper reaches of the estuary and are typically backed by high elevation shorelines are particularly vulnerable. Due to their geological setting, losses of large extents of tidal freshwater habitat seem inevitable under sea level rise. However, in the meso/poly/euhaline zones that (in passive margin estuaries) are typically low relief areas, tidal marshes are capable of undergoing expansion. These areas should be prime management targets to maximize future tidal marsh extent. Redirecting new development to areas above 3 m in elevation and actively removing impervious surfaces as they become tidally inundated results in the maximum sustainability of natural coastal habitats. Under increasing sea levels and flooding, the future of tidal marshes will rely heavily on the policy decisions made, and the balance of human and natural landscapes in the consideration of future development.

This flooding can severely affect densely populated low-lying coastal areas. Here, combining output from climate and ocean models, we analyse the concurrence probability of the meteorological conditions driving compound flooding. We show that, under a high emissions scenario, the concurrence probability would increase globally by more than 25% by 2100 compared to present. In latitudes above 40 degrees north, compound flooding could become more than 2.5 times as frequent, in contrast to parts of the subtropics where it would weaken. Changes in extreme precipitation and meteorological tides account for most (77% and 20%, respectively) of the projected change in concurrence probability. The evolution of the dependence between precipitation and meteorological tide dominates the uncertainty in the projections. Our results indicate that not accounting for these effects in adaptation planning could leave coastal communities insufficiently protected against flooding. Concurrent coastal extremes - storm surges and flooding from precipitation - are 2.5 times as frequent in latitudes higher than 40 degrees N under a high emission scenario by 2100 compared to today, according to an analysis of climate and ocean model output.

The high seasonal variability of rivers in cold weather regions poses a challenge to river flow forecasting, which tends to be complex and data demanding. This study proposes a novel technique to forecast flows that use a single-input sequential adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) along the Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada. After estimating the optimal lead time between four hydrometric stations, gauging data measured near the source were used to predict river flow near the mouth, over approximately 1000 km. The performance of this technique was compared to nonsequential and multi-input ANFISs, which use gauging data measured at each of the four hydrometric stations. The results show that a sequential ANFIS can accurately predict river flow (r(2)= 0.99, Nash-Sutcliffe = 0.98) with a longer lead time (6 days) by using a single input, compared to nonsequential and multi-input ANFIS (2 days). This method provides accurate predictions over large distances, allowing for flow forecasts over longer periods of time. Therefore, governmental agencies and community planners could utilize this technique to improve flood prevention and planning, operations, maintenance, and the administration of water resource systems.

Among the products archived on a daily basis are five operational numerical weather forecasts, three operational analyses, and one reanalysis product. The products have hourly to daily temporal resolution and 2.5-50-km spatial resolution. To date the archive contains 394 TB of data while 368 GB of new data are added every night. The data are archived in CF-1.6-compliant netCDF-4 format. The archive is available online () since June 2017 and allows users to precisely request data according to their needs, that is, spatial cropping based on a standard shape or uploaded shapefile of the domain of interest and selection of forecast horizons, variables, and issue dates. The degree of customization in CaSPAr is a unique feature relative to other publicly accessible numerical weather prediction archives and it minimizes user download requirements and local processing time. We benchmark the processing time and required storage of such requests based on 216 test scenarios. We also demonstrate how CaSPAr data can be employed to analyze extreme rainfall events. CaSPAr provides access to data that are fundamental for evaluating numerical weather prediction models and demonstrating the improvement in products such as flood and energy demand forecasting systems.

J	Chowdhooree, I; Sloan, M; Dawes, L				Chowdhooree, Imon; Sloan, Mellini; Dawes, Les			Community perceptions of flood resilience as represented in cognitive maps	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						adaptation; Bangladesh; cognitive mapping; flood mitigation; flood resilience; Haor region	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION	Community perceptions of flood resilience hinge upon translation of impressions of events and built environment, which thereby influence a community's ability to resist, cope with and recover from adverse impacts of flooding. Particularly in developing countries, NGOs, often in collaboration with communities, design and fund non-traditional structural measures to enhance community resilience. This study examines community perceptions of flood resilience in the Haor region of Bangladesh, where communities live on constructed islands, reinforced by structural flood mitigation measures. Wave activity due to riverine flooding places communities at significant risk, especially as NGO-funded non-traditional structural measures intended to increase resilience may fail to do so. Small group meetings with community members were facilitated in graphically depicting and discussing areas of risk and relative safety during flood events. Maps constructed by community groups indicate that perceptions of community vulnerability are shared between generations, and that measures intended to enhance resilience may actually increase community perceptions of vulnerability, highlighting a need for a more nuanced understanding of community adaptation to ongoing risk. Findings identified the use of non-language-dependent tools such as cognitive mapping as quick and effective data collection mechanisms. Incorporating this local knowledge allows for more effective targeted measures, increasing community resilience and better informing NGO practices.

Using main campus of NTU as a case study, the results shows that the effectiveness of LID depends on storage capacity in delaying and attenuating discharge prior to the onset of peak inflow. With enough surcharge storage control the discharge at the beginning of the rising limb, the benefits of the LID s increased with the rainfall recurrence intervals. A reversal of effect of peak reduction is observed when the surface storage space has been exhausted. At the watershed scale, the optimization results revealed that a higher ratio of LID installations in midstream subcatchments than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments. Hydrograph analysis also explained that installing LID facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow is preferable in reducing peak flow at a watershed outlet. The finding of this study could be useful to formulate watershed guidelines or strategies for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities.

In this study, temporal variability of water level extremes is investigated across the plain river network region of the Taihu Basin. The driving force analysis on water level extremes is mainly conducted for atmospheric (rainfall, climatic index, and tide) and anthropogenic forcing. The quantile perturbation method is employed to examine variability of extreme values and the Spearman correlation analysis to identify potential drivers of extreme water level variability. Considering water level extremes in all seasons, the 1990s have statistically significant positive anomalies, while the late 1960s to the 1970s and the 2000s have significant negative anomalies. The oscillation pattern of anomaly in summer has a higher variability than that in the other three seasons. Significant correlations are detected between the anomalies of water level extremes and rainfall (tide level) during summer and winter. Water level extremes in summer and winter have a strong connection to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation, respectively. Conversely, no consistent significant correlations between water level extremes and climatic indices are found in spring and autumn, which is mainly related to hydraulic structure construction and operation.

We measured the eco-hydrological failure rate, degree of flooding alteration and degree of eco-hydro deficit in relation to indicators of hydrological alteration in riparian wetlands. Normalized Differences Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Differences Water Index (MNDWI) images derived from Landsat satellite images were studied. A greater intensity of NDWI and MNDWI score were associated with the higher amount of water availability and therefore, monthly NDWI and MNDWI values were used. We showed that due to the attenuation of water availability (52% in pre-monsoon season, 34% in monsoon, and 32% in post-monsoon seasons), most months had a considerable decrease of NDWI/MNDWI scores, often below acceptable ecological thresholds. The registered failure rates for attaining the eco-hydrological threshold exceeded 100%. The estimated degree of flooding alteration in the larger parts of wetlands reached 100%, indicating a high degree of impact. Up to 54% of wetlands were eco-hydrologically deficit and 36% of wetlands were critically affected. Sustenance of ecological flow is necessary to reduce the growing hydrological crisis of the wetland habitat and ecosystem.

Individual flood event layers are identified by combining core stratigraphy, sedimentology, and the ratio of incoherent to coherently scattered x-ray radiation (inc/coh) from mu XRF (x-ray fluorescence) core scans. The inc/coh time series is used as a proxy for sediment grain size and, in combination with radiocarbon-anchored core age-depth models, enables the reconstruction of late-Holocene hydrologic variability for the Quinault River catchment. Decadal to centennial variability in inc/coh is interpreted to reflect trends in ocean-atmosphere teleconnections favorable for the formation of land-falling atmospheric rivers along the Pacific Ocean flank of the Olympic Mountains. Such processes likely modulate the rate of flooding and may explain notable increases in the frequency of flood event layers observed during the periods 2350-2450 cal. yr BP and the most recent century (AD 1910-2010). Understanding past hydrologic variability has important implications for the landscape and ecosystem response of Olympic Mountain catchments to future climate warming.

The operation of such a reservoir network can serve as a significant source of variability in the local hydrological regime and should be included in research to better understand the interaction between multiple hydrological processes and watershed management. In this study, a reservoir network module that included reservoirs of multiple sizes was developed and fully integrated into the coupled land surface and distributed hydrologic model system (CLHMS), for a detailed description of the hydrological impact of a reservoir network. A generalized release scheme was employed to determine the outflow of both large and small reservoirs. The integrated model was then evaluated against observations and reanalysis data, which indicate that the model can reasonably reconstruct the reservoir operation, streamflow, and other hydrological variables. Results quantitatively demonstrate that a reservoir network can result in an increased streamflow in dry seasons, a decreased streamflow in wet seasons, a generally larger groundwater discharge, higher groundwater level, a slightly damper soil condition, and a larger amount of evapotranspiration at the basin level. With the integrated model, it is feasible to achieve more sustainable watershed planning and management.

Floods and Water Service Disruptions: Eliciting Willingness-to-Pay for Public Utility Pricing and Infrastructure Decisions	WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY			English	Article						Flood risk; water service disruption risk; water infrastructure; green infrastructure; discrete choice experiment and willingness to pay; valuation of flood risk reduction	CONTINGENT VALUATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK	Devastating floods and ongoing droughts throughout the world highlight the infrastructure and management challenges facing water and wastewater utilities. While increasing variability in climate has been identified as the immediate culprit, the severity of events has been exacerbated by years of underinvestment in infrastructure improvements due to inadequate pricing of services. The American Water Works Association (2015) identifies a crucial step for decision-makers: identify clearly communities' priorities with respect to water and wastewater management, both of which provide public or community-level goods and services. Using data from two separate choice experiments, collected in the same survey of Canadian households, the current paper estimates household willingness-to-pay (WTP) to reduce the likelihood of flood events and water service disruptions. Results from both choice experiments show a strong preference for policy scenarios that reduce these risks, although there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity. People living in the Prairie region, rural residents, and people living in areas with higher home values have a higher WTP. Although the results lend support to public infrastructure programs for addressing flood and water disruption risks, the degree to which these are preferred to private action is not clear.

This process is the primary cause of glacial lakes expansion and has increased the possibilities of the glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that have been responsible for heavy loss of life and damage to downstream infrastructures. This study examines the status of the existing potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the Nepalese Himalaya such as Imja Tsho, Tsho Rolpa, Thulagi, Chamlang South, Barun Tsho, and Lumding Tsho; which were more susceptible to GLOF after the devastating earthquake in 2015. We examined the evolution and decadal expansion rate of lakes from 1987 to 2016 using Landsat images. The results show significant expansion of Imja Tsho, Barun Tsho, and Lumding Tsho at the rates of 42.1, 46.8, and 32.9% respectively, during 2006 - 2016; while other glacial lakes (i.e., Chamlang South, Barun Tsho, and Lumding Tsho) are relatively stable. Although the current status of glacial lakes may be stable in term of burst risk, high expanding lakes must be prioritized for detail studies. Continuous model-based monitoring and risk assessment, mitigation measures and disaster management strategies are necessary for reducing the impact of GLOFs.

At present, the most frequently used spatial interpolation methods for precipitation are based on the assumption of stationary in spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. As climate change is altering the precipitation, stationary in spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity should be first analysed before spatial interpolation methods are applied. This study aims to propose a framework to understand the spatial patterns of autocorrelation and heterogeneity embedded in precipitation using Moran's I, Getis-Ord test, and semivariogram. Variations in autocorrelation and heterogeneity are analysed by the Mann-Kendall test. The indexes and test methods are applied to the 7-day precipitation series which are corresponding to the annual maximum 7-day flood volume (P-AM7FV) upstream of the Changjiang river basin. The spatial autocorrelation of the P-AM7FV showed a statistically significant increasing trend over the whole study area. Spatial interpolation schemes for precipitation may lead to better estimation and lower error for the spatial distribution of the areal precipitation. However, owing to the changing summer monsoons, random variation in the spatial heterogeneity analysis shows a significant increasing trend, which reduces the reliability of the distributed hydrological model with the input of local or microscales.

In this study, a refined prediction and early warning method system for urban flood and waterlogging processes based on deep learning methods is proposed. The spatial autocorrelation of rain and ponding points is analyzed by Moran's I (a common used statistic for spatial autocorrelation). For each ponding point, the relationship model between the rainfall process and ponding process is constructed based on different deep learning methods, and the results are analyzed and verified by mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE) and correlation coefficient (CC). The results show that the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm has the highest accuracy and efficiency (with a 0.001 m RMSE of the predicted and measured ponding depth) for ponding process prediction and is regarded as the most suitable method for ponding process prediction. Finally, the real-time prediction and early warning of urban floods and waterlogging processes driven by rainfall forecast data are realized, and the results are verified by the measured data. The research results can provide theoretical support for urban flood prevention and control.

Consequently, accurate estimation of flood peaks is crucial. As conventional physically based prediction models reflect the traits of only a small number of areas, applying them in ungauged catchments is challenging. The interrelationship between catchment characteristics and flood features to estimate flood peaks in ungauged areas remains underexplored, and evaluation standards for the appropriate number of flood events to include during data collection to ensure effective flood peak prediction have not been established. Therefore, we developed a machine-learning predictive model for flood peaks in ungauged areas and determined the minimum number of flood events required for effective prediction. We employed rainfall-runoff data and catchment characteristics for estimating flood peaks. The applicability of the machine learning model for ungauged areas was confirmed by the high predictive performance. Even with the addition of rainfall-runoff data from ungauged areas, the predictive performance did not significantly improve when sufficient flood data were used as input data. This criterion could facilitate the determination of the minimum number of flood events for developing adequate flood peak predictive models.

It is often assumed that people who reside in a riverine area have adapted to flood pulses. However, in most cases, household-level risk reduction strategies are inadequate for ensuring a livelihood resilient to floods. The objective of this study was to investigate the determinants of households' decisions on coping strategies in the Manafwa catchment, Eastern Uganda. The study was based on a field survey of 210 households supplemented with focused group discussions (6) and key informant interviews (4) conducted in the Butaleja district in March 2019. The study used the protection motivation theory framework and applied the multivariate probit model. The most common short-term coping strategy was building temporary embankments (37%), whereas afforestation (44%) was the most common long-term solution deployed. The determinants that consistently and significantly influenced the choice of coping strategies adopted were: family size, number of adult males in the family, location of the house within the floodplain and time of residence in the affected area (P . 0.05). For policy purposes, this study recommends that the relevant stakeholder interventions should consider these determinants, in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of rural households to flooding.

The objective of this study is to investigate what and how UA contributes to environmental sustainability (ES) thereby to the building of a resilient city. Scholarly search engines such as Elsevier, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Springer and Taylor & Francis were used to retrieving articles of interest. The findings revealed that UA has immensely contributed to urban environmental sustainability through mitigating greenhouse gas, mitigating urban heat island effect, controlling flood, enhancing biodiversity, promoting agro-tourism and generating technologies contributing to addressing urban land allocation challenges for UA. UA is a solution to curb rising key urban ES issues. However, challenges such as lack of policy support, exclusion to include in urban land use planning and/or replacing it with other land use types and urbanites' behavior toward the choice of its agricultural products are determinants to enjoy the full benefits of UA. Therefore, implementing UA as a strategy to ensure ES at this very high time of global climate change is time to harvest its multiple benefits. Policy support is a key tool for the success of UA as well as making a competent urban land user.

Flood forecasting tools and flood risk models have to be compared to observe flooding patterns for training, calibration, validation, and benchmarking. At the regional to continental scales, satellite earth observation (EO) is the established method for surface water extent (SWE) mapping, and several operational global-scale data products are available. However, the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWE maps remains a limiting factor, especially in low-lying areas with complex hydrography, such as Denmark. We collected thermal imagery using an unmanned airborne system (UAS) for three areas in Denmark shortly after major flooding events. We combined the thermal imagery with an airborne lidar-derived high-resolution digital surface model of the country to retrieve high-resolution (40 cm) SWE maps. The resulting SWE maps were compared with low-resolution SWE maps derived from satellite earth observation and with potential flooded areas derived from the high-resolution digital elevation model. We conclude that UASs have significant potential for SWE mapping at intermediate scales (up to a few square kilometers), can bridge the scale gap between ground observations and satellite EO, and can be used to benchmark and validate SWE mapping products derived from satellite EO as well as models predicting inundation.

Antarctic lake phytoplankton and bacteria from near-surface waters exhibit high sensitivity to climate-driven disturbance	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							MCMURDO DRY VALLEYS; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; POLAR NIGHT; ICE COVER; DIVERSITY; BONNEY; ACTINOBACTERIA; MARINE	The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica, represent a cold, desert ecosystem poised on the threshold of melting and freezing water. The MDVs have experienced dramatic signs of climatic change, most notably a warm austral summer in 2001-2002 that caused widespread flooding, partial ice cover loss and lake level rise. To understand the impact of these climatic disturbances on lake microbial communities, we simulated lake level rise and ice-cover loss by transplanting dialysis-bagged communities from selected depths to other locations in the water column or to an open water perimeter moat. Bacteria and eukaryote communities residing in the surface waters (5 m) exhibited shifts in community composition when exposed to either disturbance, while microbial communities from below the surface were largely unaffected by the transplant. We also observed an accumulation of labile dissolved organic carbon in the transplanted surface communities. In addition, there were taxa-specific sensitivities: cryptophytes and Actinobacteria were highly sensitive particularly to the moat transplant, while chlorophytes and several bacterial taxa increased in relative abundance or were unaffected. Our results reveal that future climate-driven disturbances will likely undermine the stability and productivity of MDV lake phytoplankton and bacterial communities in the surface waters of this extreme environment.

Analyses of water content, gas exchange intensity, photosynthetic apparatus activity, chlorophyll content, plant height and biological membrane integrity were performed on the 10th day of drought and flooding in both species at the third leaf stage. A specific response of wheat under both drought and flooding conditions involved an increase in ETo/RC ratio, describing electron transport flux converted into a single reaction center in PSII. Correlations between electrolyte leakage and the probability of electron transport beyond the plastoquinone Q(A), and the amount of energy used for the electron transport were also found. A specific response of maize during flooding was the increase of stomatal conductance. Additionally, a significant correlation between P-N/C-i and relative water content was exhibited. Furthermore, the parameters differentiating the studied species only under stressful conditions were rendered. The application of such parameters can be widely used, e.g., for studying the reaction of a potential cultivars to drought and flooding. Providing such information to potential farmers can help better select cultivars for their environmental conditions.

Policymakers and practitioners thus need to develop a robust understanding of factors that influence people's intentions to adopt protective measures. This study investigated the factors influencing flood risk adaptation intentions using a survey of 392 households in Glefe, Accra. The survey used a Likert-scale based questionnaire to collect data. We then conducted structural equation modeling analysis to test hypothesized relationships. The results revealed that flood experience, coping experience, flood risk vulnerability and severity perceptions, and perceived adaptation capacity have a statistically significant relationship with adaptation intentions. The residents' perception of their adaptive capacity, represented by self-efficacy and response efficacy, determined the strength of the intention to adapt to flooding risks. The findings make significant contributions to knowledge by (a) defining and validating 'Coping Experience' and `Flood Risk Adaptation Intention' as measurable latent constructs and (b) providing a path for developing protective measures to enable adaptation. The findings also hold practical value to policymakers and practitioners, encouraging flood risk adaptation measures as a choice of longterm and anticipatory disaster risk reduction strategy.

J	Zhang, JX; Wang, HM; Huang, J; Sun, DC; Liu, GF				Zhang, Jingxuan; Wang, Huimin; Huang, Jing; Sun, Dianchen; Liu, Gaofeng			Evaluation of Urban Flood Resilience Enhancement Strategies-A Case Study in Jingdezhen City under 20-Year Return Period Precipitation Scenario	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						urban flood; resilience enhancement strategies; community scale; engineering measures; adaptive measures	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENHANCING RESILIENCE	Various flood resilience enhancement measures have been proposed to deal with the growing problem of urban flooding. However, there is a lack of evaluation about the applicability of these measures at a community scale. This paper investigates the effects of two types of flood resilience enhancement measures: engineering measures and adaptive measures, in order to explore their effectiveness in different flood-prone communities. A community-scale oriented flood resilience assessment method is used to assess the impact of different types of measures. A case study is applied in three communities that suffer from waterlogging problems in Jingdezhen city, China. Results show that there are spatial differences of flood resilience in three flood-prone communities. Future scenarios present a poorer performance in flood resilience compared to current scenarios due to the effects of urbanization and human activities. Engineering measures are suitable for the old communities with high-density residential areas when sitting alongside the river, for example the communities of Fuliang and Zhushan. On the other hand, adaptive measures exhibit more efficiency in improving flood resilience in all communities, especially effective for the new city town Changjiang where engineering measures are nearly saturated. The findings can help local governments develop appropriate flood resilience enhancement strategies for different types of communities.

First, the urban one-dimensional rainwater pipe network model and two-dimensional surface model are implemented based on MIKE URBAN model. Next, a green ecological rainwater facility model is implemented through node generalization to evaluate the rainwater pipe network pressure and land water area. Finally, the improved multi-objective optimization non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II (NSGA-II) is used to optimize the design and research of urban green ecological rainwater simulation systems. The results show that compared with traditional genetic algorithms and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA), the accuracy of NSGA-II is 96.17% and 88.57%, which greatly improves the application performance of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by comparing the performance of traditional genetic algorithm (GA) and improved sorting GA. The research conclusion is that NSGA-II is superior to the conventional design scheme in economy and hydraulic performance. The above results can provide a reference for using green ecological rainwater model to solve urban rainstorms and flood management in complex terrain.

Determinants of farm-level adaptation strategies to flood: insights from a farm household-level survey in coastal districts of Odisha	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Coastal Odisha; Determinants; Ex ante strategies; Ex post strategies; Flood; Farm households	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIGRATION; CHOICE; AGRICULTURE; DECISIONS; ETHIOPIA; ADOPTION; CYCLONE; HAZARD; REGION	Farmers choose different strategies to cope with disasters. The scientific information on what adaption strategies do farmers across different socio-economic and regional strata choose to cope with disasters can help policymakers to make informed farm-level support interventions. Odisha is a flood-prone state in eastern India. The flood adaptation strategy choices of farmers in Odisha have not been much studied in the literature. Along with identifying the most commonly adopted ex ante and ex post adaptation strategies of farmers, we also identified the common factors influencing the choice of these adaptation strategies. We used the Likert scale and the ordered probit model to analyse the primary data collected from the field survey conducted at the three selected coastal districts. It finds that migration, reduction in food consumption, and pest and disease management are the most common ex post strategies, whereas stocking of foodgrains and usage of flood-resistant seeds are the most common ex ante strategies adopted by the farmers. It also identifies that education, family size and the size of landholding are the main determinants of ex post adaptation strategies, whereas age, the size of landholding and family income are the major determinants of ex ante coping strategies.

Most of the farmlands located between the margin of the Southern Venice lagoon and the Northern Po delta, Italy, lie a few meters below mean sea level and are drained by a large network of artificial channels and hydraulic infrastructures to avoid frequent flooding and allow agricultural practices. This work proposes an assessment of the vulnerability to saltwater intrusion, following a new concept of the hazard status, resulting in combining the depth of the freshwater/saltwater interface and the electrical resistivity of the shallow subsoil. The sensitivity of the farmland system was assessed by using ground elevation, distance from freshwater and saltwater sources, permeability, potential runoff, land subsidence, and sea-level rise indicators. Relative weights were assigned by a pairwise comparison following the Analytic Hierarchy Process approach. The computed vulnerability map highlights that about 30% of the farmlands is under strong and extreme conditions, 28% between marginal and moderate, and 40% under negligible conditions. Results from previous vulnerability assessments are discussed in order to explain their differences in terms of hazard status conceptualization and sensitivity characterization of farmland system.

Further increases in their demand must be expected and with it grows the need to sustain these services in times of disasters. Existing risk assessment tools and guides support HHC service providers to secure their services. However, they do not provide insights on interdependencies of complex systems like HHC. Causal-Loop-Diagrams (CLDs) are generated to visualize the impacts of epidemics, blackouts, heatwaves, and floods on the HHC system. CLDs help to understand the system design as well as cascading effects. Additionally, they simplify the process of identifying points of action in order to mitigate the impacts of disasters. In a case study, the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on HHC in Austria in spring 2020 are shown. A decision support system (DSS) to support the daily scheduling of HHC nurses is presented and applied to numerically analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, using real-world data from a HHC service provider in Vienna. The DSS is based on a Tabu Search metaheuristic that specifically aims to deal with the peculiarities of urban regions. Various transport modes are considered, including time-dependent public transport.

Households with IWS must invest in water storage infrastructure and often rely on multiple sources of water; therefore, these household-level purchasing and infrastructure decisions is a critical component of water access. Informed by interviews with IWS households, we use radial basis function networks, a type of artificial neural network, to determine optimal household water management decisions that maximize reliability of water supply while minimizing costs for a representative household in Mexico City that uses municipal piped water, trucked water, and rainwater. We find that securing reliable water supply for IWS households is greatly assisted by installation of household storage tanks of at least 2500 L. In the case of IWS households with limited storage options, the overall cost for water supply is reduced by scheduling water deliveries on nonconsecutive days. Rainwater harvesting systems were shown to be economically viable for households with limited water supply. This study demonstrates the importance of considering the management of multiple sources and household storage infrastructure when evaluating water investments in cities with IWS.

The lakes expansion under changing climate usually poses high risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) hazard for the downstream communities. In the present study, the risk of glacial lake outburst flood was investigated in the HKH region of Pakistan using LANDSAT-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) image data of 2013 period coupled with ground information. The results of present study revealed 3044 lakes (surface area about 134.8 km(2)) in the three HKH ranges, maximum in the Karakoram (1325) and minimum in the Hindu Kush range (722) during 2013. The lakes exhibited an overall increase of about 26% in number and 7% in area in the region during 2001-2013 period. The increase in lake number was 91% within 2500-3500 m, 20% within 3500-4500 m and 31% within 4500-5500 m elevation range. Among total identified lakes during 2013, 36 were characterized as potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs) that can pose GLOF hazard in the HKH region. A regular monitoring of cryosphere changes and critical glacial lakes is essential to develop sustainable risk management strategies for this region in future.

The probability of UHE and IHE are the major concern of decision-makers. This research proposes an analytical flood risk probability calculation framework for single-hazard event, UHE and IHE caused by uncertainties in flood forecasting and takes Dahuofang Reservoir, located in the Hunhe River basin, Northeast China, as a case study. In the framework, the risk is calculated by the integral of the joint probability density function (Pdf) of the risk sources over the hazard domain, which is the collection of the values of risk sources that cause hazards. The determination method of the hazard domain and the Pdf of risk sources and the procedure of risk analysis are elaborated. Results of single-hazard events show that the proposed methodology is of higher precision compared with the risk analysis method based on the law of total probability. Meanwhile, the flood risks of UHE and IHE are calculated for the reservoir operation under different levels of flood limit water level. The study provides a new method of flood risk analysis for flood control reservoir operation.

Few of these studies discuss the disparities between supply and demand of ES, which are dependent on spatial relationships and even fewer reveal the impact of land use zoning on disparities in ES. We advance the ES framework by examining the equitable distribution and resilient supply of flood protection of urban green spaces in Bandung City. To illustrate supply, we used land cover-based methods to produce flood protection benefits whereas we used the IPCC Risk Framework to generate flood risk for indicating demand. This study found that the distribution of urban green spaces is not equitably distributed and green space locations do not offer resilient supply of flood protection. Moreover, Bandung's existing zoning regulations will exacerbate these problems in the future. This paper provides insights into the considerations for determining spatial priorities in planning urban green spaces especially for flood protection and co-leverage of flood adaptation and mitigation measures.

This accounts for considerable economic losses in the region. Regional adaptation strategies for costs minimization require a comprehensive assessment of the disasters' economic impacts at a multiple-region scale. This article adapts the flood footprint method for multiple-region assessment of total economic impact and applies it to the 2009 Central European Floods event. The flood footprint is an impact accounting framework based on the input-output methodology to economically assess the physical damage (direct) and production shortfalls (indirect) within a region and wider economic networks, caused by a climate disaster. Here, the model is extended through the capital matrix, to enable diverse recovery strategies. According to the results, indirect losses represent a considerable proportion of the total costs of a natural disaster, and most of them occur in nonhighly directly impacted industries. For the 2009 Central European Floods, the indirect losses represent 65% out of total, and 70% of it comes from four industries: business services, manufacture general, construction, and commerce. Additionally, results show that more industrialized economies would suffer more indirect losses than less-industrialized ones, in spite of being less vulnerable to direct shocks. This may link to their specific economic structures of high capital-intensity and strong interindustrial linkages.

Although the terminology is recent, the concept is older and has its roots in ecological resilience. However, a synthesis of studies through the lens of the insurance value concept is lacking. Here we fill this important knowledge gap by conducting a rapid evidence assessment on how, where and why the insurance value of ecosystems has been measured. The review highlighted the often substantial positive values that were associated with restoration, rehabilitation or avoidance of loss of natural ecosystems. However, many regions, ecosystems and hazards are not widely researched. Most studies focused on forests, agriculture and wetlands, often with an emphasis on habitat restoration to reduce flood risks. Over half the studies provided non-monetary or monetary estimates of value, reporting, for example, improved ecological function, achieved/achievable cost reductions or willingness-to-pay. Nevertheless, the evidence-base remains fragmentary and is characterised by inconsistent reporting of valuation methodologies. This precludes drawing general conclusions. We recommend that future studies of insurance value adopt a common approach to facilitate the development of a more robust evidence-base.

The Relationships of Extreme Precipitation and Temperature Events with Ethnographic Reports of Droughts and Floods in Nonindustrial Societies	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Social Science; Drought; Flood events; Precipitation; Climate classification; regimes; ENSO	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTABILITY; WAR	Our broad research goal is to understand how human societies adapt to natural hazards, such as droughts and floods, and how their social and cultural structures are shaped by these events. Here we develop meteorological data of extreme dry, wet, cold, and warm indices relative to 96 largely nonindustrial societies in the worldwide Standard Cross-Cultural Sample to explore how well the meteorological data can be used to hindcast ethnographically reported drought and flood events and the global patterns of extremes. We find that the drought indices that are best at hindcasting ethnographically reported droughts [precipitation minus evaporation (P - E) measures] also tend to overpredict the number of droughts, and therefore we propose a combination of these two indices plus the PDSI as an optimal approach. Some wet precipitation indices (R10S and R20S) are more effective at hindcasting ethnographically reported floods than others. We also calculate the predictability of those extreme indices and use factor analysis to reduce the number of variables so as to discern global patterns. This work highlights the ability to use extreme meteorological indices to fill in gaps in ethnographic records; in the future, this may help us to determine relationships between extreme events and societal response over longer time scales than are otherwise available.

KAROL WOJTYLA'S PHILOSOPHY OF THE HUMAN PERSON AND THE FILIPINO CONTEMPORARY SOCIETAL ISSUES	PHILOSOPHIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY			English	Article							JOHN-PAUL-II; DIGNITY	The contemporary Philippine society is flooded with various concerns and issues such as drug abuse, extrajudicial killings of the War on Drugs, HIV and AIDS, fake news, and human-induced climate change, among others. This predicament can be attributed not only to the degradation of ethics and values but basically to the deterioration of the philosophy of the human person; that is, the lack if not a distortion of the Filipino's understanding of what man truly is. By using content analysis, this paper delves into Karol Wojtyla's Philosophy of the Human Person as a means to help address and rectify the said distorted outlook of the human person as the root cause of the many issues of contemporary Philippine society. It allows the Filipino to understand himself and others as a human person who, according to Wojtyla, is created in God's image and likeness, a subject and not an object, a substantial amalgamation of body and soul, endowed with the faculties of intellect and will, a conscious and free-efficient cause or agent of his actions. Therefore, a moral being capable of moral choices, who seek the Truth and the Good as the basis of his decisions, and a social being who is responsible and accountable for his actions as well as a steward of the environment and the whole of creation.

Assessing the performance of global hydrological models for capturing peak river flows in the Amazon basin	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							MULTISATELLITE PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS; FLOOD RISK; ECMWF MODEL; PREDICTION; IMPACT; ENSEMBLE; RUNOFF; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; EXTREMES	Extreme flooding impacts millions of people that live within the Amazon floodplain. Global hydrological models (GHMs) are frequently used to assess and inform the management of flood risk, but knowledge on the skill of available models is required to inform their use and development. This paper presents an intercomparison of eight different GHMs freely available from collaborators of the Global Flood Partnership (GFP) for simulating floods in the Amazon basin. To gain insight into the strengths and shortcomings of each model, we assess their ability to reproduce daily and annual peak river flows against gauged observations at 75 hydrological stations over a 19-year period (1997-2015). As well as highlighting regional variability in the accuracy of simulated streamflow, these results indicate that (a) the meteorological input is the dominant control on the accuracy of both daily and annual maximum river flows, and (b) ground-water and routing calibration of Lisflood based on daily river flows has no impact on the ability to simulate flood peaks for the chosen river basin. These findings have important relevance for applications of large-scale hydrological models, including analysis of the impact of climate variability, assessment of the influence of long-term changes such as land-use and anthropogenic climate change, the assessment of flood likelihood, and for flood forecasting systems.

To accommodate the increasing population, the megacity now stretches out in an urban continuum covering more than 800 square kilometers and is currently growing at a rate of 3.2% per year. If the neighboring provinces around HCMC are included, the total population reaches nearly 18 million people. This paper attempts to describe the interplay between HCMC and flood-related risks and offer some guidelines to deal with inundations. The potential risks of flooding by rain, tsunami and/or dam failure upstream of the city are evaluated and contextualized within the perspective of climate and human induced environmental changes. The region is highly vulnerable to the combined effects of subsidence and rising sea levels and has already led to serious flooding that may extend spatially before the end of the century. We propose possible preventative solutions to urban flooding using a multi-pronged approach to issues regarding urban development and suggest a redevelopment strategy for major infrastructure projects.

However, little is known about how the magnitudes and/or durations of hydrological shifts relate to these regime shifts. Here we analyse long-term water table data in conjunction with plant community data collected from primary mires on the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. These ecosystems represent various stages of drainage: undrained, drained sites with developing tree stands, and unsuccessfully drained sites not supporting tree encroachment. The varying success of drainage provides an ideal field laboratory for investigation of thresholds of water table control on the successional trajectories of primary mire. Our data indicate a likely mechanism for the control of vegetation regime shifts in northern peatlands by water table, with time of year being as important a factor as the magnitude of change. Spring flooding rather than summer water table level appeared to be crucial for controlling state shifts in primary mire vegetation. As the effects of climate change on peatlands are most likely to be mediated by changes in hydrology and water table level, our study indicates a need for more thorough investigation of seasonal variability in the controlling factors.

Glacial lake outburst floods occurring due to the failure of moraine dams are significant hazards for the valley downstream the failure, as they possess huge amount of hydraulic energy that can kill thousands and destroy infrastructures and riverine landscape. Also, the entrainment of debris to the flow from the breaching process and downstream channel may develop the flow into a much bigger disaster or even a series of hazard chain. Ice and rock avalanche or landslide, glacier calving, degradation of ice cores, earthquake and atmospheric events trigger the breaching phenomenon which generates a series of waves overtopping the dam or seepage causing the failure of the dam. Various approaches have been discussed in this review paper to produce an understanding of the failure mechanism of moraine dams: experimental works, empirical relationships, analytical solutions, and numerical modelling. No concrete experimental investigations and parametric solutions pertained to the failure mechanism of moraine dam is found in the review, but various empirical relationships are discussed and suitable approaches for numerical modelling are suggested as per the requirement of the task.

The objective of this study is to demonstrate a methodological approach that integrates the community members' local and indigenous knowledge and GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making using the Analytic Network Process in mapping flood vulnerability in an informal settlement. The study was conducted in Quarry Road West informal settlement located in Durban, South Africa. A mixed-method approach that involved a household survey (n = 359), interviews with key informants (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) was used in this study. This study's results showed a spatial differentiation of flood vulnerability in the study area. Households along the Palmiet River were highly vulnerable to flooding. A section of the settlement called Mcondo 1 was also highly vulnerable to flooding while maMsuthu had low flood vulnerability. The sensitivity analysis results showed that changing the indicator weights, correspondingly, affected the output of the flood vulnerability map. Therefore, this study can guide decision-makers on how to elicit adequate community participation and comprehensively integrate local and indigenous knowledge with Geographical Information System in mapping flood vulnerability in informal settlements.

As a result, several mineral transformations occur, in which iron plays a decisive role. The presence of iron enables the study of magnetic properties, improving the understanding of the geophysical signatures of highly dynamic environments (e.g., biogeochemical hotspots and contamination plumes). In this work, we seek to identify creosote biodegradation related to the precipitation of magnetic minerals on sediments at a contaminated site in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Several rock magnetism analyses were carried out to provide the magnetic mineralogy of the samples in terms of their composition, size, and abundance. We conducted high-temperature thermomagnetic curves, frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility, anesthetic remanent magnetization (ARM) and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) data, superparamagnetic concentration and dipole moment (SPCDM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The magnetic signatures of the contaminated samples suggest an increase of superparamagnetic grains in the water table fluctuation zone if compared to the magnetic signatures of the uncontaminated samples. Thermomagnetic curves of contaminated samples showed a lower heterogeneity of the magnetic mineral phases than the uncontaminated ones. This work contributes to the advancement of the understanding of how natural biogeochemical processes are impacted by human actions, such as soil contamination, and even by climate change, which should affect soil redox conditions in periods of drought and flooding.

Furthermore, minimum environmental flow regime and target of the environmental flow regime were defined based on the historical flow data in the optimization model of the reservoir operation. Different evolutionary algorithms were applied to optimize reservoir operation. Moreover, different indices were used to measure the performance of the optimization model. Based on the results in the case study, management of the flood damage and environmental flow is a serious challenge in the Australian tropical region that needs an optimal operation. The genetic algorithm was the best method to optimize reservoir operation based on the outputs of the decision-making system. The main application of the proposed framework for all case studies is simulation of the optimal operation in the past periods to get lessons for improvement of the operation in the future period. Moreover, coupling the proposed framework with the climate change models might be helpful to project the future challenges of the flood damage and environmental flow management.

To improve the understanding of the signatures of the water cycle in the Three Gorges Reservoir, the spatial variation of the isotopic composition and hydrological processes were investigated by measuring stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta O-17, and delta H-2) of the river water in this research. The results showed that the isotopic compositions of the upper (Yibin-Luzhou) and lower reaches (Fengdu-Wushan) of the river underwent kinetic fractionation, while the middle reaches ( Chongqing) were dominated by equilibrium fractionation. According to the correlation analysis, the evaporation processes of the river were associated with temperature and wind speed, and the isotopic compositions of river water were mainly controlled by the quantity effect of precipitation. The d-excess responded well to climate change, while the O-17-excess was more sensitive to altitude and mixing processes. This study revealed the information of triple oxygen isotopes in flood season and improved the understanding of the evaporation processes in the Three Gorges Reservoir, which provides a theoretical basis for further understanding the hydrological processes of the river-reservoir system.

A major focus is on extracting and disseminating useful information from satellite and airborne data sources for effective planning and decision making during and after disasters. This study presents a case study from Ko-Rian, a sub-district in Ayutthaya, Thailand which is frequently hit by monsoon flooding. First, an approach is demonstrated to extract buildings and roads from very-high-resolution satellite images. The results showed that use of selected multiple indices with object-based image analysis produced excellent results in mixed urban environment. Secondly, a procedure and framework are proposed for geodatabase modeling of urban flood vulnerability and disseminating information to a wider community through ESRI story maps. The proposed approach using virtual reality technologies such as Google Street View for assessing physical vulnerability and ESRI story maps to share the information can significantly reduce the time and costs of the traditional survey. The techniques and approach presented in this study can be useful to develop detailed vulnerability profile for effective decision making and dynamic planning for a flood resilient city.

One of the challenges highlighted by the hydrology and related communities is the need for more open data and monitoring of floods in space and time. In this paper, we present the development phases and experiments of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensor network for hydrometeorological data collection and flood monitoring for the urban area of Colima-Villa de alvarez in Mexico. The network is designed to collect fluvial water level, soil moisture and weather parameters that are transferred to the server and to a web application in real-time using IoT Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol over 3G and Wi-Fi networks. The network is tested during three different events of tropical storms that occurred over the area of Colima during the 2019 tropical cyclones season. The results show the ability of the smart water network to collect real-time hydrometeorological information during extreme events associated with tropical storms. The technology used for data transmission and acquisition made it possible to collect information at critical times for the city. Additionally, the data collected provided essential information for implementing and calibrating hydrological models and hydraulic models to generate flood inundation maps and identify critical infrastructure.

Cross-sectional data were sourced through a well-structured questionnaire and direct personal interview and used for the analysis. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 459 respondents, while descriptive statistics, multinomial logit and binary logistic regressions were used for the data analysis. Results revealed that farmers perceived increase in heavy rainfall, storms, floods, cases of ailments/diseases and pollutant concentration and decrease in food production. Creating sanitation programmes, planting of shade trees and use of medicine/herbs were the main adaptation strategies frequently used to combat the effects of climate change on their health. Self-medication was commonly used as a source of treatment, while age, education, income and climate variables were the main factors influencing preference to healthcare utilisation using multinomial logit regression. Results of logistic regression revealed that education, marital status, dependants, female household, environmental sanitation, extreme weather events and elderly persons were the main determinants of catastrophic health expenditure in the area. Therefore, a robust synergy among meteorological forecast, health surveillance and better disaster management should be established among the farmers. This will help in guiding against diseases and extreme weather events and improve adaptive capacity.

Prediction of maximum rainfall in Mexico through non-stationary probabilistic models	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA			Spanish	Article						Frequency analysis; extreme hydro-meteorological events; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; change point and trend and climatic variability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; DECOMPOSITION; EXTREMES	The prediction of maximum rainfall is the basis of the design of hydraulic structures for flood mitigation. This prediction is traditionally made from frequency analysis methods that consist of studying past events in order to define the probabilities of future occurrences. However, because climatic variability causes changes in the mean and variance of rainfall time series, design events are unreliable if they are estimated from techniques valid for stationary conditions. For Mexico, there is evidence that rainfall patterns are changing, consequently for predictions to be reliable, it is necessary to apply methods that contemplate changes in the statistical characteristics of the data over time. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate annual maximum 24-hour rainfall events associated with different return periods, through non-stationary probabilistic models. We analyzed 769 series to which were applied the Pettitt, Mann-Kendall and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition tests to verify the seasonality. Different probabilistic models were proposed, in which parameters of the Lognormal, Gamma, Gumbel, Weibull and Generalized Extreme Value distribution have as covariates to time and Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The results indicated that for the non-stationary series the proposed models represent the variability of the data better than conventional stationary models.

This work presents a methodology to assess the operational conditions of infrastructures located in coastal areas based on the combination of advanced statistical techniques, laboratory experiments and state-of-the-art numerical models properly validated. It is applied to a case study in the SW coast of England, the railway seawall at Dawlish, which was subjected to recurrent wave overtopping until its dramatic collapse in February 2014. To quantify the increase in overtopping discharges with wave height and water level, we define an ad hoc variable, the effective overtopping forcing, which explains 98% of the variability of the overtopping discharge. The return periods associated to the operational thresholds for coastal structures protecting people and railways are also obtained. The proposed methodology enables the assessment of the overtopping discharge induced by a given sea state and, thus, check if a coastal infrastructure will be or not operational under any expected marine condition. This innovative methodology can also be used to analyse the flooding event consequences on urban areas protected by coastal infrastructures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Flood Resilient and Sustainable Urban Regeneration Using the Example of an Industrial Compound Conversion in Seoul, South Korea	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban resilience; stormwater management; decentralized water infrastructure; sustainable building renovation; conversion design; industrial compound; urban regeneration		The objective of this study was to illustrate the urban flood resilience and sustainability improvement potential by integration of decentralized water management systems in sustainable urban regeneration projects. This paper discusses sustainable and resilient urban regeneration potentials using the example of an industrial compound (ICs) conversion in Seoul, South Korea. Urban flood vulnerability has been a concern globally due to land use changes, limited capacity of existing stormwater management infrastructures and the effects of climate change. Due to their comparably low building density, ICs can effectively contribute to the separation and decentralized retention and infiltration of stormwater. However, no sustainable and resilient conversion examples of ICs have been realized in Seoul so far. After identification of a representative IC, its exemplary sustainable conversion with implementation of decentralized water management infrastructures were designed. The rainwater collection, retention and infiltration system was dimensioned in order to create a stormwater discharge-free property. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the improvement potentials before and after the conversion unveiled that this conversion contributes also to the improvement of the neighborhoods' sustainability, spatial quality and resilience to disasters. The research results are transferable to other urban ICs and are a good practice example for sustainable and resilient regeneration of existing urban districts.

Spatial ecology of male hippopotamus in a changing watershed	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RUAHA-NATIONAL-PARK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESOURCE SELECTION; RIVER; MEGAHERBIVORE; VULNERABILITY; AMPHIBIUS; PREDATION; RESPONSES; PATTERNS	The obligate dependency of the common hippopotamus, Hippopotamus amphibius, on water makes them particularly vulnerable to hydrological disturbances. Despite the threats facing this at-risk species, there is a lack of information regarding H. amphibius spatial ecology. We used high-resolution tracking data of male H. amphibius to assess home range size, movement mode (e.g. residency and migratory movements), and resource selection patterns. We compared these results across seasons to understand how hydrological variability influences H. amphibius movement. Our study watershed has been severely impacted by anthropogenic water abstraction causing the river to stop flowing for prolonged periods. We observed H. amphibius movements to be highly constrained to the river course with grassy floodplains being their preferred habitat. Dominant and small sub-adult males displayed year-round residency in/near river pools and had smaller home ranges compared to large sub-adults. During the dry season, large sub-adult males made significant (similar to 15 km) upstream movements. The larger home range size of large sub-adults can be attributed to the elevated levels of migratory and exploratory activities to limit conspecific aggression as the river dries. Our observations provide insight into how future changes in water flow may influence male H. amphibius movements and populations through density-dependent effects.

Especially at river or lake confluences, the presence of backwater effects greatly amplifies the flood risk. To investigate the influence of backwater effects on the hydraulic characteristics of rivers and lakes, this study focuses on the Dongping Lake in China. An enhanced two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was employed to simulate and analyze three different degrees of backwater effects. The results indicate that, compared to the working conditions without the backwater effect, the highest lake water level increased by 1.0 m and 0.1 m under severe and moderate backwater effect conditions, respectively. The total outflow flood volume decreased by 30.1% and 2.3%, respectively. The demolition time for the Jinshan Dam needs to be advanced by 12.5 h and 10.0 h, respectively, and the inundation area in the western region expanded by 2.73% and 0.32%. Additionally, the average inundation depth increased by 0.93 m and 0.08 m, respectively. These results provide valuable data support for the safe operation of Dongping Lake, the formulation of flood defense strategies, and, likewise, offer valuable insights into the risk management of flood events in other rivers and lakes with backwater effects.

In Brazil, among these disasters, floods, flash floods, and landslides account for the highest number of deaths, the latter being the most lethal. Bearing in mind the importance of monitoring areas susceptible to disasters, the REMADEN/REDEGEO project of the National Center for Monitoring and Natural Disaster Alerts (Cemaden) has promoted the installation of a network of soil moisture sensors in regions with a long history of landslides. This network was used in the present paper as a base to develop a system for moisture forecasting in those critical zones. The time series of rainfall and moisture were used in an inversion algorithm to obtain the geotechnical parameters of the soil. Then the geotechnical model was used in a forward calculation with the rainfall prediction to obtain the soil moisture forecast. The landslide events of March 2020 and May 2022 in Guaruj ' a and Recife, respectively, were used as study cases for the developed system.

J	Richter, M; Dickhaut, W				Richter, Michael; Dickhaut, Wolfgang			Long-Term Performance of Blue-Green Roof Systems-Results of a Building-Scale Monitoring Study in Hamburg, Germany	WATER			English	Article						green roof; blue-green roof; blue-green infrastructure; climate change adaptation; urban water cycle; WSUD; sponge city	RUNOFF; WATER; RETENTION; MITIGATION; REDUCTION; QUALITY; SURFACE; MEDIA; DEPTH; SLOPE	For the first time, a long-term monitoring study with different full-scale blue-green roof (BGR) types was conducted. Within a pilot project from Hamburg's Rainwater InfraStructure Adaptation (RISA) framework, four different BGR types were built in 2015 for long-term evaluation and comparison with each other. The test site was created to find out to what extent BGRs are able to improve hydrological performance and if increased water supply affects vegetation development and species diversity. Therefore, the roofs were equipped with hydrologic monitoring systems, their retention performance was evaluated, and vegetation analysis was conducted. During 2017-2023, between 64 and 74% of the precipitation was retained on the roofs, and in the summer months there was hardly any outflow from the roofs. For single (heavy) rain events, high retention capacities, low outflow intensities, and high detention times were demonstrated. On the BGRs where rainwater is permanently stored on the roof, the vegetation species' composition changed in the long term, resulting in an increase in biodiversity. The studied BGRs are effective in reducing flood risk from heavy rain events and can increase evaporative cooling and biodiversity. Therefore, such BGRs are a blue-green infrastructure with far-reaching positive effects.

However, under the influenceof climate change, human activities and other factors, the consistency ofHTS has been destroyed and cannot meet the requirements of mathematicalstatistics. Series division and wavelet transform are effective methods toreuse and analyse HTS. However, they are limited by the change-pointdetection and mother wavelet (MWT) selection and are difficult to apply andpromote in practice. To address these issues, we constructed a potentialchange-point set based on a cumulative anomaly method, the Mann-Kendall test andwavelet change-point detection. Then, the degree of change before and afterthe potential change point was calculated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,and the change-point detection criteria were proposed. Finally, theoptimization framework was proposed according to the detection accuracy ofMWT, and continuous wavelet transform was used to analyse HTS evolution. Weused Pingshan station and Yichang station on the Yangtze River as studycases. The results show that (1) change-point detection criteria can quicklylocate potential change points, determine the change trajectory and completethe division of HTS and that (2) MWT optimal framework can select the MWT thatconforms to HTS characteristics and ensure the accuracy and uniqueness ofthe transformation. This study analyses the HTS evolution and provides abetter basis for hydrological and hydraulic calculation, which will improvedesign flood estimation and operation scheme preparation.

Spatial and temporal patterns of methane emissions from mountain peatlands in the northern Andes across a disturbance gradient	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						Andes (South America); peatlands ecology; methane; disturbance; Sphagnum; Distichia muscoides; sedge	CUSHION PLANTS; DYNAMICS; WATER; CORDILLERA; PARAMO; ZERO	Methane emitted by wetlands accounts for nearly 30% of the global methane emissions and is expected to double by 2,100. Methane fluxes from peatlands are related to m soil temperature, water table, and vegetation. Disturbances, mostly drainage, are considered to have a more limited impact on CH4 fluxes from peatlands. Here, we studied the temporal and spatial patterns of methane emissions from four peatlands across and elevation and disturbance gradient in the northern Andes. Our research seeks to understand the effects of disturbance legacies and soil temperature, flooding patterns, and vegetation on methane emissions in Andean peatlands. Our results indicated a strong control of CH4 emissions by soil temperature with a stronger effect at intermediate elevations. The removal of peat forming vegetation from the surface had the higher effect on CH4 emissions, increasing methane fluxes by an order of magnitude. Methane fluxes from conserved cushion vascular plants were low, but nearby hollows had relatively high emissions. Our research provides evidence of high methane emissions from degraded peatlands in the tropical Andes. However, the role of climate change and disturbance legacies on methane emissions from tropical Andean peatlands remains unknown affecting our ability to predict future emission patterns and our ability to incorporate climate mitigation strategies.

New hydrological insights: Flood occurrences at paddy fields are not uncommon and pose a serious threat, because rice is a staple food for most Asian countries. In a tropical environment, paddy cultivation normally undergoes three growth stages, namely vegetation, reproductive and ripening. These stages have different water requirements. Therefore, it is essential to include the paddy growth stages in the risk assessment, as well as the inundated duration and depth which are unique to the specific location and the paddy seed variety. These parameters have not been investigated in previous studies. The risk indices were classified into 5 major classes, namely very low, low, moderate, high and very high. A comprehensive flood risk map developed in this study can be used by all relevant authorities and stake holders to evaluate the level of flood risk.

The study provides a detailed analysis of the event using different observation sources currently available. The employed techniques include both conventional (rain gauges, radar, atmospheric sounding) and non-conventional (satellite-based Earth observation products, GNSS, and lightning detection network) observations for hydro-meteorological analysis. The study is split in three main topics: event description by satellite-based observations; long-term analysis by the ERA5 model and ASCAT soil water index; and short-term analysis by lightning data, GNSS delays and radar-VIL. The added value of the work is the near-real-time analysis of some of the datasets used, which opens up the potential for use in alerting systems, showing considerable application possibilities in NWP modeling, where it can also be useful for the implementation of early warning systems. The results highlight the validity of the different techniques and the consistency among the observations. This result, therefore, leads to the conclusion that a joint use of the innovative techniques with the operational ones can bring reliability in the description of events.

Flood-driven increases in phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria abundance in the western Atchafalaya-Vermilion Bay System, Louisiana	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Mississippi river; Flood; Estuary; Plankton community; Microcystin	MISSISSIPPI RIVER DIVERSIONS; TOXIN TRACKING SPATT; GULF-OF-MEXICO; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; COASTAL WATERS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; DOMINATED ESTUARY; MICROCYSTIN-LR; NORTH-CAROLINA	The 2019 Mississippi River flood impacted estuaries and coastal economies across the Gulf Coast, USA. This flood resulted in blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in eastern Louisiana and impacted fisheries region wide. The Atchafalaya-Vermilion Bay System (AVBS) is located along Louisiana's central coast and receives nearly one-third of the Mississippi River's flow through the Atchafalaya River distributary, in addition to localized freshwater inputs. To understand how this extreme flood affected the AVBS, we compared environmental, phytoplankton biomass, and community composition data collected during and after the 2019 flood to historical data from previous years (2016, 2017). Compared to historical data, 2019 was characterized by higher concentrations of silica and nitrate and lower salinities. Following the flood period, increased phytoplankton biomass and relative abundance of potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria were observed at sites farthest from the Atchafalaya River outlet. We found no differences in community composition at sites closer to the river mouth due to hydrologically induced disturbance. Particulate and dissolved microcystins were detected throughout the system. These results suggest that, even in a system that receives regular freshwater input, the extreme 2019 flood resulted in significant alteration of phytoplankton biomass and community composition in the western AVBS.

However, if residents become less aware of flooding due to engineering mitigation, this may result in greater loss of life and property (levee effect), or if residents are exposed to more frequent flooding, this often contributes to a greater adaptive capacity (adaptation effect). Therefore, this study adopts the Global Moran's I and Local In-dicators of Spatial Association methods to classify areas with different flooding characteristics based on actual historical flooding data, and further explores the differences of residents' adap-tation behaviours between "Floods continuing" and "Floods slowing" areas by means of field interviews and questionnaires. Research Results: (I) "Floods continuing" and "Floods slowing" areas were identified; (II) the relationship between risk perception (including flood awareness, risk threat assessment, non-protective awareness) and adaptation behaviour was established; (III) "Floods continuing" areas had higher flood awareness and risk threat assessment, and most of them were willing to adopt adaptation behaviour; "Floods slowing" area are more trusting in engineering mitigation measures. These results confirm the adaptation effect and levee effect.

Flood modelling research contains a broad wealth of material, and microbial risk assessment has gained more popularity over the last decade. However, there is still a relative lack of understanding of how the microbial risk can be quantified from urban sewer flooding. This article intends to review the literature encompassing contemporary urban flood modelling approaches. Hydrodynamic and microbial models that can be applied for quantitative microbial risk assessment will be discussed. Consequently, urban sewer flooding will be the focus. This review found that the literature contains a variety of different hazards posed by urban flooding. Yet, far fewer examples encompass microbial risk from sewer system exceedance. To date, there is no evidence of a perfect model or technique, to carry out a quantitative microbial risk assessment from hydrodynamic simulations. The literature details many different methods. We intend to detail the advantages and limitations of each method. Along similar lines, hydraulic data constitutes a large part of the uncertainty which is inherent to this research field. Many studies in the literature detail data paucity and uncertainty in input data. As such, any advancement in this discipline will very likely aid future research.

Indeed, the need to minimise the adverse impact of climate change and extreme weather events cannot be overstressed. Notably, damage to the built environment by extreme weather and its consequential effects is highly significant. This emphasises the need for a climate-resilient built environment. Thus, this study derived the strategic capability areas required by business organisations to achieve the flood resilience of their built environment. The research method involved rounds of review by a carefully selected team of experts, and the review of lessons from four case studies. Twenty-six capability areas were identified from literature but were consolidated to nineteen at the end of data collection and analysis. The capability areas covered how properties are used and managed as well as the actual fabric and design of business premises/properties. The capability areas included awareness and understanding of flood risk to property, review for a flood resilience scheme, product acquisition for flood risk management, dynamic stakeholder identification and strong network, maintenance and post-flood management scheme, physical characteristics of the property and business data management. Professionals and business organisations can use the outcome of this study as a guide for business premises flood resilience enhancement planning and decision making.

However, the degree to which these frameworks are driving necessary changes to public policies and practices for disaster risk reduction remains questionable. This article explores the influence of these frameworks on flood and drought risk management in two federal states, Canada and Australia, and from the perspective of government practitioners. Through two Delphi studies and semistructured interviews, the research found that although international agreements are considered valuable to the maturation of disaster risk management principles and practices, their perceived application in flood and drought risk management has been more limited. Government practitioners warn that using these frameworks to drive meaningful change to disaster risk management systems and structures risks further politicizing the field because of existing complex and deeply entrenched socio-political infrastructures. The findings highlight the fact that the ability of these global frameworks to facilitate meaningful changes toward more equitable, resilient, and sustainable disaster risk management is challenged not only by the institutional design of these agreements, but by resistant institutional structures that are embedded across levels of governance.

Firstly, the areas prone to pluvial flood are identified by a spatial multicriteria analysis that combines five criteria (imperviousness, slope, hydrologic soil groups, density of sewer system and social vulnerability) to build a Pluvial Flood Index (PFI). The PFI is validated by the comparison with historical pluvial flood events in the city and it is used for the identification of high priority areas for intervention. Then, this information is merged with the analysis of urban planning and NBS design constraints to identify the suitable areas for NBS installation. New hydrological insights for the region: Results allow the definition of a NBS implementation strategy against pluvial flooding in the city of Florence, identifying for each pluvial flood hotspot the set of measures that can be implemented to solve the problem. The proposed approach represents a flexible assessment technique that can be reproduced in other urban context and provide useful support for NBS adoption in urban flood risk management for heritage cities.

Ineffective public consultation has been cited as one reason for failure of these policies. Using the deliberative polling method, this study assessed the capacity of rural communities to participate in flood risk management policy priority setting and the impact of providing accurate and balanced information on policies by comparing pre-and post -deliberation data. The study also assessed the level of trust on whether government and community would use the results of this study. Results indicated strong community support for policy options to reduce vulnerability in communities and strong resistance to relocation. As all the top five ranked policy options were concerned with population pressure, gender, and social service issues, which are all conceptually considered social determinants of a healthy community, this study concludes that public health considerations are central to flood risk policy development and implementation. The study revealed high levels of trust in government and the community relating to flood risk management, which policymakers in low-to-middle income countries can capitalise on for meaningful community consultation for effective disaster risk management.

Taking the world's largest agricultural country, China, as the research object, this study evaluated China's disaster-induced grain yield loss from 1978 to 2019 and investigated the contribution of three driving factors, using a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) approach. The results showed that drought and flood were the main disasters causing grain yield losses in China. China's grain disaster loss peaked in 2000 and then entered a declining period. In terms of spatial distribution, disaster-induced grain yield loss mainly concentrated in the regions including the Middle-Lower Yangtze region, the Huang-Huai-Hai region, and Northeast China. The gravity center of disaster-induced grain yield loss shifted northward in China. Disaster intensity contributed the most to change in disaster-induced grain yield loss, followed by yield loss density, and the grain planting area. Thus, addressing drought and flood disasters, and enhancing disaster prevention and reduction capacity are critical to reduce disaster-induced grain yield loss, especially in the Middle-Lower Yangtze, the Huang-Huai-Hai region, and Northeast China.

Sustained coral reef growth in the critical wave dissipation zone of a Maldivian atoll	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CARBONATE PRODUCTION; ENCRUSTER COMMUNITIES; BUILDING CORALS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRINGING-REEF; RATES; BIOEROSION; PATTERNS; ISLAND	Sea-level rise is expected to outpace the capacity of coral reefs to grow and maintain their wave protection function, exacerbating coastal flooding and erosion of adjacent shorelines and threatening coastal communities. Here we present a new method that yields highly-resolved direct measurements of contemporary reef accretion on a Maldivian atoll reef rim, the critical zone that induces wave breaking. Results incorporate the suite of physical and ecological processes that contribute to reef accumulation and show growth rates vary from 6.6 +/- 12.5 mm.y(-1) on the reef crest, and up to 3.1 +/- 10.2 mm.y(-1), and -0.5 +/- 1.8 mm.yr(-1) on the outer and central reef flat respectively. If these short-term results are maintained over decades, the reef crest could keep pace with current sea-level rise. Findings highlight the need to resolve contemporary reef accretion at the critical wave dissipation zone to improve predictions of future reef growth, and re-evaluate exposure of adjacent shorelines to coastal hazards. High-resolution direct topographic measurements obtained with a purpose built coral reef accretion frame reveal net reef growth and increased elevation of the Huvadhoo atoll reef rim between 2018 and 2020.

Disaster databases are potentially useful tools for exploring trends, however, criteria for inclusion of events and for associated descriptive characteristics is not standardized. For example, some databases include only primary disaster types, such as 'flood', while others include subtypes, such as 'coastal flood' and 'flash flood'. Here we outline a method to identify candidate events for assignment of a specific disaster subtype-namely, 'flash floods'-from the corresponding primary disaster type-namely, 'flood'. Geophysical data, including variables derived from remote sensing, are integrated to develop an enhanced flash flood confidence index, consisting of both a flash flood confidence index based on text mining of disaster reports and a flash flood susceptibility index from remote sensing derived geophysical data. This method was applied to a historical flood event dataset covering Ecuador. Results indicate the potential value of disaggregating events labeled as a primary disaster type into events of a particular subtype. The outputs are potentially useful for disaster risk reduction and vulnerability assessment if appropriately evaluated for fitness of use.

This study presents global-scale potential coastal overtopping estimates, which account for not only the effects of sea level rise and storm surge, but also for wave runup at exposed open coasts. Here we find that the globally aggregated annual overtopping hours have increased by almost 50% over the last two decades. A first-pass future assessment indicates that globally aggregated annual overtopping hours will accelerate faster than the global mean sea-level rise itself, with a clearly discernible increase occurring around mid-century regardless of climate scenario. Under RCP 8.5, the globally aggregated annual overtopping hours by the end of the 21(st)-century is projected to be up to 50 times larger compared to present-day. As sea level continues to rise, more regions around the world are projected to become exposed to coastal overtopping. As sea levels rise, coasts are being increasingly threatened by overtopping caused by the combination of sea level rise, storm surge and wave runup. Here the authors find that global coastal overtopping has increased by over 50% in the last two decades, and under a RCP 8.5 scenario this could increase up to 50 times by 2100 compared to today.

Feedback from regional authorities on the Loire River basin	LHB-HYDROSCIENCE JOURNAL			French	Article						runoff; regional authorities; urban runoff; reduction of the vulnerability		While flood hazards are commonly perceived, those related to runoff remain underestimated. However, on the Loire river basin, 7 out of 10 regional authorities have already faced flooding from urban runoff. Their consequences can be major, both material and human. In addition, exceptional rainfall appears to be increasing in line with current climate change. How is it taken into account today by the regional authorities of the basin? What are the answers? What are the possible actions? It is in particular to these questions that the Loire River Basin Autority (Etablissement public Loire) has endeavored to answer, by taking the initiative to draw up an inventory of the policies for the management of urban runoff water implemented by the regional authorities of the river basin. The lessons learned from the experiences of the ligerian authorities were compiled in a practical guide, then in a short and illustrated popularization booklet, to sensitize the actors concerned to the solutions for better management of the risk of urban rain runoff, and to enable regional authorities wishing to do so, to go further on questions such as improving risk awareness and the level of service of stormwater management works, the integration of planning rules adapted to the urban environment, the reduction of the vulnerability of people and property and the organization of crisis forecasting and management.

The prediction models of permafrost thermal thawing sensibility and thaw depth have been developed by incorporating the MODIS and in situ soil temperature observation data. The comprehensive earth-atmosphere-coupled numerical models of different embankment structures have been utilized to calculate the thaw depth of the underlying permafrost foundation. Finally, using the given data and above developed prediction models, the distribution maps of permafrost thermal thawing sensibility and thaw depth in QTEC are obtained by grid calculation. The results show the following: (1) Insensitive permafrost of QTEC mainly distributes in the large-scale mountain and high latitude area, and highly sensitive permafrost is located in the perennial river bed, flood plain, and terrace regions. (2) Road construction has a strong thermal disturbance to underlying permafrost, and the proportion of large thaw depth area of separate embankment is obviously smaller than that of 26 m full-width embankment. (3) Increase of subgrade interval reduces the proportion of large thaw depth areas, and the application of separate embankment structure is an effective engineering means for the Qinghai-Tibet expressway.

How Satellite Soil Moisture Data Can Help to Monitor the Impacts of Climate Change: SMAP Case Studies	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Soil moisture; Meteorology; Monitoring; Floods; Agriculture; Alarm systems; Agriculture; drought monitoring; snowmelt flood prediction; soil moisture active passive (SMAP); soil moisture; weather forecast	DROUGHT; ASSIMILATION; SURFACE; WATER	Socially and economically costly extreme weather events have become more prevalent in the last decade. Monitoring and early warning systems could help mitigate the impact of such events by allowing people to better prepare themselves to manage their responses to these events. One significant element of an effective warning system is soil moisture because it is a key determinant of the exchange of water and heat energy between the land and atmosphere, the partitioning of precipitation between infiltration and runoff, and therefore has an influence on weather patterns and streamflow. In addition, soil moisture governs plant water availability - the key to crop yield forecasting. For these reasons, a wide range of organizations use soil moisture information to better predict and monitor climate and weather phenomena such as floods and droughts. By improving soil moisture estimates, it may be possible to improve the monitoring and early warning systems upon which these organizations rely, and hence better mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events. Through case studies, this article discusses several uses of soil moisture data products from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission to help improve soil moisture-related monitoring and early warning systems.

This study was made possible by the cooperation of the Concepcion Chiguayante School community and the Explora project (Chile), with the support of citizen science. The aim was to compare coarse particulate organic matter quantities and types in the Lonquen basin.MethodsSamplings were performed in two perennial rivers and two intermittent rivers. First, the riparian vegetation of the streams was characterized through photointerpretation and subsequently the organic matter accumulated in the selected river beds was quantified and typified. Spearman's correlation was used.ResultsThe riparian vegetation was similar in both types of rivers, though significantly greater (p<0.05) plant material accumulation was found in intermittent rivers compared to perennial rivers (1029 and 337gm(-2), respectively). Likewise, there was a significant relationship among leaves, smaller organic matter, seeds, herbs and shrubs in intermittent rivers.ConclusionsThe results reveal the importance of the intermittent rivers that were sampled as transitory reservoirs of organic matter with high productive potential, especially in the first flood pulses, when this material is transported downstream.

Therefore, determining the extent of such variations on regional and local scales is imperative. We used monthly precipitation data from 25 meteorological stations in northern Pakistan (NP) to document the observed changes in seasonal and annual precipitation. The station density in the NP is small and unevenly distributed; therefore, ERA-5 reanalysis data were used to supplement the observed dataset to assess the spatial trends in NP. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's Slope estimator (SSE), and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests were performed to assess the trends. In addition, the wavelet analysis technique was used to determine the association of precipitation with various oceanic indices from 1960 to 2016. Results indicate that maximum precipitation was shown in the annual and summer seasons. In NP, annual, winter, spring, and summer precipitation declined, while an increase in autumn was observed at a rate of 0.43 mm/decade between 1989 and 2016. The spatial trends for observed and ERA-5 reanalysis datasets were almost similar in winter, spring, and autumn; however, some disagreement was observed in both datasets in the summer and annual precipitation trends in NP during 1960-2016. Between 1989 and 2016, summer and annual precipitation increased significantly in Region III. However, seasonal and annual precipitation decreased in NP between 1960 and 2016. Moreover, there were no prominent trends in annual precipitation until the mid-1980s, but an apparent increase from 1985 onwards. Annual precipitation increased in all elevations except at the 500-1000 m zone. The ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) shared notable interannual coherences among all indices above 16-64 months. Inter-decadal coherence with the ENSO, AO (Arctic Oscillation), and PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) in NP for 128 months and above. Generally, AO, AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) exhibited less coherence with precipitation in NP. The regression of seasonal and annual precipitation revealed that winter and spring precipitation levels had higher linear regression with the AO and ENSO, respectively, while both the AO and ENSO also dominated at the annual scale. Similarly, the IOD and PDO indices had a higher influence in summer precipitation. The findings may help water resource managers and climate researchers develop a contingency plan for better water resource management policies in the face of changing climate change in Pakistan, particularly in NP.

Satellite images reveal that from 1965 to 2020, the surface area of Jinwuco has expanded by 0.2 km(2) (+56%) to 0.56 km(2), and subsequently decreased to 0.26 km(2) (-54%) after the GLOF. Estimates based on topographic reconstruction and sets of published empirical relationships indicate that the GLOF had a volume of 10 million m(3), an average breach time of 0.62 hours, and an average peak discharge of 5,390 m(3)/s at the dam. Based on pre-and post-event high-resolution satellite scenes, we identified a large progressive debris landslide originating from western lateral moraine, having occurred 5-17 days before the GLOF. This landslide was most likely triggered by extremely heavy, south Asian monsoon-associated rainfall in June. The time lag between the landslide and the GLOF suggests that pre-weakening of the dam due to landslide-induced outflow pushed the system towards a tipping point, that was finally exceeded following subsequent rainfall, snowmelt, a secondary landslide, or calving of ice into the lake. We back-calculate part of the GLOF process chain, using the GIS-based open source numerical simulation tool r.avaflow. Two scenarios are considered, assuming a debris landslide-induced impact wave with overtopping and resulting retrogressive erosion of the moraine dam (Scenario A), and retrogressive erosion due to pre-weakening of the dam without a major impact wave (Scenario B). Both scenarios yield plausible results which are in line with empirically derived ranges of peak discharge and breach time. The breaching process is characterized by a slower onset and a resulting delay in Scenario B, compared to Scenario A. Evidence, however, points towards Scenario B as a more realistic possibility. There were no casualties from this GLOF but it caused severe destruction of infrastructure (e.g. roads and bridges) and property losses in downstream areas. Given the clear role of continued glacial retreat in destabilizing the adjacent lateral moraine slopes, and directly enabling the landslide to deposit into the expanding lake body, the GLOF process chain under Scenario B can be robustly attributable to anthropogenic climate change, while downstream consequences have been enhanced by the development of infrastructure on exposed flood plains. Such process chains could become more frequent under a warmer and wetter future climate, calling for comprehensive and forward-looking risk reduction planning.

C stored in wetland soils that experience seasonal flooding is likely the most vulnerable to increased severity and duration of droughts in response to climate change. Redox conditions, plant root dynamics, and the abundance of protective mineral phases are well-established controls on soil C persistence, but their relative influence in seasonally flooded mineral soils is largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the relative importance of environmental (temperature, soil moisture, and redox potential) and biogeochemical (mineral composition and root biomass) factors in controlling CO2 efflux, C quantity, and organic matter composition along replicated upland-lowland transitions in seasonally flooded mineral soils. Specifically, we contrasted mineral soils under temperature deciduous forests in lowland positions that undergo seasonal flooding with adjacent upland soils that do not, considering both surface (A) and subsurface (B and C) horizons. We found the lowland soils had lower total annual CO2 efflux than the upland soils, with monthly CO2 efflux in lowlands most strongly correlated with redox potential (E-h). Lower CO2 efflux as compared to the uplands corresponded to greater C content and abundance of lignin-rich, higher-molecular-weight, chemically reduced organic compounds in the lowland surface soils (A horizons). In contrast, subsurface soils in the lowland position (C-g horizons) showed lower C content than the upland positions (C horizons), coinciding with lower abundance of root biomass and oxalate-extractable Fe (Fe-o, a proxy for protective Fe phases). Our linear mixed-effects model showed that Fe-o served as the strongest measured predictor of C content in up- land soils, yet Fe-o had no predictive power in lowland soils. Instead, our model showed that Eh and oxalate-extractable Al (Al-o, a proxy of protective Al phases) became significantly stronger predictors in the lowland soils. Combined, our results suggest that low redox potentials are the primary cause for C accumulation in seasonally flooded surface soils, likely due to selective preservation of organic compounds under anaerobic conditions. In seasonally flooded subsurface soils, however, C accumulation is limited due to lower C inputs through root biomass and the removal of reactive Fe phases under reducing conditions. Our findings demonstrate that C accrual in seasonally flooded mineral soil is primarily due to low redox potential in the surface soil and that the lack of protective metal phases leaves these C stocks highly vulnerable to climate change.

This research proposes a conceptual framework based on the PSR-SENCE model for evaluating and exploring trends in urban flood resilience over time, using 27 cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of China as case studies. For the overall evaluation, a hybrid weighting method, VIKOR, and sensitivity analysis were used. During that time, UFR in the YRD region averaged a moderate level with an upward trend. This distinguishes between the resilience levels and fluctuation trends of provinces and cities. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces all displayed a trend of progressive development; however, Shanghai displayed a completely opposite pattern, mainly because of resilience in the state dimension. During that time, 81.41% of cities exhibited varying, upward trends in urban flood resistance, with few demonstrating inverse changes. Regional, provincial, and city-level implications are proposed for future UFR enhancement. The research contributes to a better understanding of the urban complex ecosystem under flood conditions and provides significant insights for policymakers, urban planners, and practitioners in the YRD region and other similar flood-prone urban areas.

Integrated water resources trend assessments: State of the science, challenges, and opportunities for advancement	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Editorial Material						water quality; water quantity; surface water; groundwater; trend analysis; water availability; water use	LONG-TERM TRENDS; LAND-USE; QUALITY TRENDS; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; CONTERMINOUS US; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NITRATE; VARIABILITY; TIME; AQUIFER	Water is vital to human life and healthy ecosystems. Here we outline the current state of national-scale water resources trend assessments, identify key gaps, and suggest advancements to better address critical issues related to changes in water resources that may threaten human development or the environment. Questions like, "Do we have less suitable drinking water now than we had 20 years ago?" or "Are flood events more common now than they were in the past?" prompted improvements in data, trend estimation methods, and modeling frameworks to track changes in, and better understand how land use and climate influence four water resources domains: surface and groundwater quantity and quality. However, continued advancement in trend assessments to better address issues related to changes in water availability is needed. Areas of need include more timely and efficient delivery of water resources trend results and improved capacity to estimate trends at unmonitored locations. Additional integration pieces include increased understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions, incorporation of both quantity and quality trends into water availability estimates, and the refinement of trend metrics to account for the competing needs of society and ecological integrity. Coupled with improved driver attribution studies, these components will better inform current and future water resources management.

Evaluation of rice germplasm for tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses using multivariate techniques and molecular screening	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						Abiotic stress; multiple stress tolerance; drought; submergence; anaerobic germination; rice	STAGE DROUGHT STRESS; SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; SEEDLING GROWTH; GRAIN-YIELD; GERMINATION; TRAITS; MECHANISMS; LOCUS; GENE; QTLS	Due to climate change, rice productivity and sustainability in rainfed areas have become increasingly threatened by both drought and flooding. Identifying new germplasm resources with tolerance to high and low extremes of precipitation is required to meet the impelling demand of climate-resilient varieties. To identify promising accessions with tolerance to both drought and submergence, 38 gora rice landraces along with 12 traditional cultivars and check varieties from the rainfed ecologies in eastern India were evaluated under drought and submergence stresses, both at the seedling and germination stages of the crop. The marker-based survey of nine DTY QTLs for grain yield under drought revealed that 17 accessions potentially carried multiple DTY QTLs. Most (82%) of the genotypes scored positive for Sub1A locus by SNP-based functional marker AEX1. However, their survival rate under 14 days of complete submergence varied widely (0.58-92.4%). By multivariate analysis using important traits of abiotic stress conditions, Dular and Kalakeri genotypes were identified as the most promising genotypes along with a few gora cultivars such as IC640869 and IC0640884. The promising genotypes identified in this study can be utilized as potential donors for multiple abiotic stress tolerance as well as for understanding the molecular basis of adaptation to multiple abiotic stresses.

Our study is focused on the reconstruction of the settlement's structure and character of the environment from which the site drew resources. These research questions were addressed by the interpretation of plant macroremains, charcoals, and the results of the spatial model. We have focused on the maximum size of the settlement that the surrounding countryside was able to withstand. Our results clearly demonstrated significant deforestation and intensive land use in the vicinity of the Late Bronze Age study site. As the weed taxa showed, a wide range of crops was grown in rather dry or less often in damp fields. Based on our archaeobotanical results, we were able to reconstruct several types of grasslands: dry pastures and fallow fields on plateaus and slopes, wet pastures or meadows in the floodplain. Acidophilous oak forests, alluvial forests, and shrubs were reconstructed as the most common forest habitats in the vicinity of the study site. Based on the archaeological knowledge of the region, we assume relatively low population density during the Late Bronze Age, and thus only a small part of the more or less forested landscape was significantly affected by human activities.

Hidden levees: Small-scale flood defense on rural coasts	ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Sea level; Marsh; Wetland; Vegetation; Soil; Dyke; ditchbank; Gloucester	MARSH; LAND; BAY; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; CONVERSION; HABITATS; SQUEEZE; FOREST; UPLAND	Climate change, land subsidence, and coastal population growth are increasing coastal flood risks and changing land uses. Large-scale levee systems protect many urban areas from flooding, but much less is known about how rural coasts respond to sea level rise and increasing flood risks. This study examined previously unreported, small-scale earthen levees that have been constructed for centuries by individual landowners in rural, low-lying portions of the Chesapeake Bay region in the USA. Analysis of aerial imagery, digital elevation models, and field measurements revealed that levees are constructed from inorganic silt loam sediment consistent with adjacent terrestrial soils. They extend above Highest Astronomical Tide, and are today surrounded by marsh or low-lying terrestrial vegetation. Although preliminary measurements revealed inconsistent effects of levees on soil salinity or soil organic content, the landward side of levees are generally lower in elevation than the seaward side. They are also characterized by less flood tolerant vegetation and shallower organic-rich soils. These results suggest that small-scale levees may have historically impeded wetland development, though their effects today are unclear. This work highlights a historical approach to rural flood defense and suggests that, in some cases, the impacts of small levees are observable long after coastal retreat and levee abandonment. They are therefore part of the evolving human-landscape system for potential management into the future.

Considering this, the predictive modeling of flow in small mountain catchments that are particularly vulnerable to flooding is critical. Rainfall data sources such as rain gauges, meteorological radars, and satellites provide data to the hydrological model with a lag. Only numerical weather predictions can achieve this in advance, but their estimates are often subject to considerable uncertainty. This article aims to verify whether Global Environmental Multiscale numerical precipitation prediction can be successfully applied for event-based rainfall-runoff hydrological modeling. These data were verified for use in two aspects: the flow modeling and determination of antecedent moisture conditions. The results indicate that GEM data can be satisfactorily used for hydrological modeling, and particularly good simulation results are obtained when significant rainfall occurs. In addition, these data can be used to correctly estimate the AMC groups for each sub-catchment in advance, which is one of the key elements flowing into the amount of projected outflow in the catchment. It is worth noting that, according to the literature review conducted by the article's author, this is the first published attempt to use GEM data directly in applied hydrological applications.

In order to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of investments in NBS, this paper provides a first Meta-Regression Analysis (MRA) function transfer to identify and assess the value of NBS measures for flood risk mitigation in the basin context. Our data are based on 199 observations related to 62 studies conducted in America, Europe, and Asia-Oceania since the mid-1990s. Our estimates show that NBS measures in river streams and floodplains are the most valued and that the primary benefit of water regulation is insignificant. However, individuals value co-benefits such as recreation, aesthetics, food and materials, and the scenario that provides more room for nature in the river basin. The in-sample convergent validity test shows that the average MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is around 48% and the median around 17%. In the same vein, the out-of-sample test in the case study of the Brague catchment shows a MAPE of between 5% and 66%. This suggests that the MRA function transfer can reasonably be used to inform policymakers when estimating NBS measures for flood risks.

In recent decades, the regime of the streamflow flowing into the lower Yellow River has been significantly altered by large reservoirs and dams. In this work, we investigate the "valve function" of Xiaolangdi Dam on the water discharge for multiple scales. Xiaolangdi Dam exhibits little impact on the total streamflow in the long run, although it dramatically changes the seasonal distribution. The ratio of average daily discharge during non-flood seasons to average daily discharge during flood seasons at Xiaolangdi station increased progressively from 39.8% during 1971-1989 to 93.2% during 1997-2016. Based on a linear relationship determined from historical data, the theoretical daily discharge at Huayuankou station in the absence of Xiaolangdi Dam was reconstructed. Through comparative analysis of the observed and reconstructed daily discharge series, we estimate that 78% of the potential flood events that could have happened during 1997-2007 were mitigated due to the construction and operation of Xiaolangdi Dam. Meanwhile, the peak discharge at Huayuankou station was also reduced from > 6000 m(3)/s to < 4500 m(3)/s. The redistribution of seasonal discharge by Xiaolangdi Dam not only is beneficial for meeting water demand but also effectively extirpates the river drying-up phenomenon.

However, its adoption rate has been low despite the decade of dissemination in Asia, especially in the Philippines. Using cross-sectional farm-level survey data, this study empirically explored factors shaping AWD adoption in a gravity surface irrigation system. We used regression-based approaches to examine the factors influencing farmers' adoption of AWD and its impact on yield. Results showed that the majority of the AWD adopters were farmers who practiced enforced rotational irrigation (RI) scheduling within their irrigators' association (IA). With the current irrigation management system, the probability of AWD implementation increases when farmers do not interfere with the irrigation schedule (otherwise they opt to go with flooding). Interestingly, the awareness factor did not play a significant role in the farmers' adoption due to the RI setup. However, the perception of water management as an effective weed control method was positively significant, suggesting that farmers are likely to adopt AWD if weeds are not a major issue in their field. Furthermore, the impact on grain yields did not differ with AWD. Thus, given the RI scheduling already in place within the IA, we recommend fine-tuning this setup following the recommended safe AWD at the IA scale.

In order to asses the flood magnitude, the flow parameters of the flood were calculated using the super-elevation of the flood marks preserved in the flood affected valleys. The textural characteristics of the flood deposits in the upper reaches of the valleys indicate dominance of debris flows. The peak discharge upstream of the confluence of Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga was around 1.1x10(5) m(3)/s, which was four order of magnitiude higher than the normal peak discharge (similar to 3 m(3)/s). The flow achieved a velocity of 30 +/- 3 m/s. An exponential reduction in the flow velocity (from similar to 37 to 2 m/s) with distance is observed. For which the river gradient and increase in sediment load is implied flow that along its entrained way downstream between Raini and Tapovan. Considering the sensitivity of paraglacial zones to climate change, the paper calls for detailed studies pertaining to the response of paraglacial zones to extreme weather events. Importantly, it is necessary to have more hydrological data covering multiple valleys for predictive model simulation of the nature and magnitude of such disasters in future.

Despite a wide range of definitions and studies into community resilience, there is a lack of clarity about what community, practice and policy stakeholders understand it to represent, and how communities can practically develop such resilience. In this article, we present findings from two workshops with a range of stakeholders across communities, policy, academia and the statutory sector to gain an understanding of the current state of knowledge about community resilience to extreme events in the UK, including examples of current practice and how to collaborate better. From our workshops seven key themes about what makes communities resilient were identified: social ties and connections; experience and shared memory; leadership, engagement and shared responsibility; mind-set, collective thinking, openness to adapt and cultural change; integration, inclusivity, equity and diversity; communications, social support and co-ordination; and training and exercises and identifying local needs. How we develop resilient communities is by no means straightforward; resilience is not an outcome, rather a process (or perhaps a state of becoming?). However, this study has combined the evidence base on community resilience with qualitative inputs from a range of community, policy and academic stakeholders to provide a novel perspective on what community resilience is and how it can be developed.

However, with aquifers stressed by overdraft, contamination from land use, and the hydrologic impacts of climate change, identifying reliable sources for new wells is increasingly challenging. Well forecasting is a process in which potential groundwater resources are evaluated for a location of interest. While this process forecasts the depth of each aquifer for a given location, it takes historical groundwater well data from nearby locations into account. Conventionally, well forecasting is done by geological survey professionals by manually analyzing the well data and, that makes the process both time and resource-intensive. This study presents a novel web application that performs well forecasting for any location within the state of Iowa in a matter of seconds utilizing client-side computing instead of expensive professional labor. The web application generates well forecasts by triangulating millions of combinations of historical aquifer depth data of nearby wells stored in a state-level database. The proposed web system also provides water quality information for arsenic, nitrate, and bacteria (total c and fecal coliform) on the same interface with forecasts. The system is open to the public and is aimed to provide a go-to tool for homeowners, well drillers and, authorities to help inform decision-making regarding groundwater well development and water quality monitoring efforts.

The aim of this systematic literature review is to assess the current state of research linking place attachment to voluntary migration among residents living in natural hazard prone areas in developing countries. While place attachment has several collective benefits and improves one's quality of life, it can be dysfunctional by reducing the perceived risk of hazard. Place attachment provides a sense of security to the residents and contributes to one's self-identity. The review finds that residents who are strongly attached to their place are unlikely to leave even when the risk is high. This is especially the case where the place attachment is related to religious beliefs and where the social capital is high. The review also identified that place attachment helped communities to better prepare for natural hazard in the pre-disaster period. The review calls for further research to unravel the complexity between place attachment and voluntary migration from natural hazard risk-prone areas.

The advancement of current technologies such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems facilitated and improved flood applications. In a LiDAR system, a laser emits light that travels to the ground and reflects off objects like buildings and trees. The reflected light energy returns to the sensor, whereby the time interval is recorded. Since the conventional methods cannot produce high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data, which results in low accuracy of flood simulation results, LiDAR data are extensively used as an alternative. This review aims to study the potential and the applications of LiDAR-derived DEM in flood studies. It also provides insight into the operating principles of different LiDAR systems, system components, and advantages and disadvantages of each system. This paper discusses several topics relevant to flood studies from a LiDAR-derived DEM perspective. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives regarding DEM LiDAR data for flood mapping and assessment are also reviewed. This study demonstrates that LiDAR-derived data are useful in flood risk management, especially in the future assessment of flood-related problems.

Through the example of floods, we here develop a critique of one of those tools, the hydrosocial cycle framework, in order to expand our conceptualizations of water. The hydrosocial cycle is a re-elaboration of the classical hydrological cycle which explicitly politicizes and denaturalizes the study of hydrological systems. In political ecology, such a conceptual framework has been pivotal to the understanding of how water circulates in society through a complex web of power relations, economic structures, and processes that are at the same time spatial and historical. But when we deploy this concept to examine floods, a number of limitations emerge. In this article, we formulate three specific theses which focus on those limitations: (a) an overemphasis on society, (b) a lack of attention to ecology and, more generally the relationships between water and other nonhuman elements and processes, and (c) a heuristic overreliance on the metaphors of flow and cycle. In developing these three theses, we discern alternative paths of analysis to conceptualize floodwaters at a time when these events increasingly constitute a significant threat to humans and nonhumans alike. Our hope is that this critique will also contribute to broader interdisciplinary debates about water and society.

Marshaling Adaptive Capacities within an Adaptive Management Framework to Enhance the Resiliency of Wastewater Systems	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						climate variability; change; planning; flooding; precipitation; wastewater management; organizational learning; resilience; adaptive capacity	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; BARRIERS; STATE; RISK	We assess adaptive capacity and adaptive management as measures of wastewater (WW) system resiliency using data from interviews with WW system managers (hereafter managers) impacted by past storms. Results suggest the most resilient WW systems are those with high adaptive capacities that employ an adaptive management approach to make ongoing adaptation investments over time. Greater amounts of generic adaptive capacities (i.e., skilled staff and good leadership) help smooth both day-to-day and emergency operations and provide a foundation for adaptive management. In turn, adaptive management helps managers both build more generic adaptive capacities, and develop and employ greater amounts and diversity of specific adaptive capacities (i.e., soft and/or hard adaptations) that are especially important for enhancing and sustaining resiliency. Adaptive management also enables managers to better understand their system's vulnerabilities, how those vulnerabilities change over time, and what specific actions may reduce those vulnerabilities. Finally, our work suggests WW system resilience critically depends on the capacities of the human systems for building resilience as much as or more so than relying only on physical infrastructure resilience. Our work contributes to filling an important gap in the literature by advancing our understanding of the human dimensions of infrastructure resilience and has practical implications for advancing resilience in the WW sector.

This study aims to assess spatiotemporal rainfall variability and flash flood intensity events in the Sylhet haor region of Bangladesh by analyzing rainfall data from April for the period 1995-2022. For this, we used both Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) daily rainfall data. Rainfall patterns were studied using zonal statistics in ArcGIS and graphical illustration. The results revealed that the rainfall pattern was erratic and showed a range of spatiotemporal variability. If the average rainfall exceeds 250 mm in Meghalaya and Assam and 400 mm in Sylhet, severe flash floods may occur in the Sylhet haor region. An increase in pre-monsoon rainfall and its shift from May to April may increase the intensity of flash floods and consequently damage the rice crop. This finding might help flood management agencies to develop flood management strategies, prepare flood contingency plans, provide real-time and advanced warnings to strengthen flood warning and forecasting systems, and schedule seasonal agricultural activities.

The main objective of this study is to assess the potential flash flood hazard areas in the Likodra watershed (218.62 km(2)), one of the most vulnerable parts to flash floods in Serbia, using the flash flood potential index (FFPI) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Recurring events from 1995 to this day and the devastating impact on settlements of the analyzed area show that this territory is extremely vulnerable. The data used include hydrological statistics (maximum daily rainfall) and spatial data on watershed geographical characteristics (slope, soils, land use, vegetation, drainage density) obtained or derived from various sources (maps, satellite images, digital databases) which were integrated into the GIS environment. The results indicate a severe flash flood hazard level, with high flash flood susceptibility classes occupying 76.20%, 87.78%, and 91.73% of the area, depending on the considered criteria and weights assigned to them.

Spatiotemporal classification of heavy rainfall patterns to characterize hydrographs in a high-resolution ensemble climate dataset	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Heavy rainfall; Classification; Hierarchical cluster analysis; d4PDF; Climate change	SPACE-TIME VARIABILITY	Peak discharge in rivers mostly varies depending on spatiotemporal characteristics of the rainfall, even with the same total rainfall amount. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of heavy rainfall such as rainfall levels used for river planning are difficult to determine due to the limited number of rainfall observations. We propose a spatiotemporal classification method for massive-ensemble rainfall datasets produced through dynamical downscaling with a regional climate model to clarify the possible rainfall patterns. This classification method was applied to several hundred heavy rainfall events from the massive-ensemble climate dataset, corresponding to identical exceedance probabilities within a given statistical confidence interval (i.e., 95% confidence interval of the 150-year return period in the probability limit test). The new classification method detected spatiotemporal rainfall patterns affecting peak discharges in the main river and tributaries within the target basin. These classified rainfall patterns can be used to investigate damage scenarios in the target basin, which are difficult to determine from the observed rainfall patterns. As a result, the proposed method with the massive-ensemble climate dataset will contribute to flood control planning.

Results indicated that in the 1990s, dominant LULC types were arable cropland, wetland, and permanent crops, which covered approximately half of the delta, 28% and 8%, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the wetland area decreased from 28% to 5% due to the expansion of aquaculture and the arable cropland. The aquaculture, however, expanded more rapidly than other land use conversions, namely, from 2% to 19%. Although mangrove forests slightly recovered by 58 km(2) from 2005 to 2019, the overall trend (1990-2019) showed an intense loss of 740 km(2) due to widespread conversions into aquaculture. The paper unravels the complex dynamics between land-cover change, socio-economic development and associated land-use policies, which have significant implications for the change in rural landscapes.

But, the rainfall time series contains nonlinear and non-stationary data which lowers the model performance. This paper attempts to solve the nonlinear and non-stationary challenges imposed by the rainfall forecasting models by building a hybrid model based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with Adaptive Noise(CEEMDAN) combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) for forecasting All India monthly rainfall. For monthly rainfall forecasting, homogeneous Indian monthly rainfall time series dataset (1871-2016) is used. Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition decomposes the rainfall time series data into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and residual element. Each IMF and residual is forecasted using the LSTM after determining the significant lags. The forecasted intrinsic mode functions and the residual elements are reconstructed to obtain the forecasted rainfall value. The proposed model performance has been verified against existing models. Compared with single LSTM model, the forecasted values prove that the model achieves good performance in predicting monthly rainfall time series.	[Kala, A.; Femi, P.

As many rural areas in Iran are vulnerable to flash floods occurring mainly in the spring, more accurate plans are needed to help reduce the risk of related damage. To address this concern, a robust methodology using multi-objective optimization is proposed, which incorporates the large uncertainties in the modeling parameters defining the risk of flooding. The proposed framework has been implemented in the upper catchment of the Taleghanrood river in the Taleghan district in Iran, which is vulnerable to flooding. The results provide a detailed performance assessment of alternative infrastructure designs, which will help to increase the efficiency of flood management strategies. The optimization uses multi-criteria optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) and Bayesian estimation concepts. The resulting specific design plans, as levees' height increases over a 50-year time horizon, for controlling floods under given scenarios reflect the uncertainty in the parameters.

Implications of ambiguity in Antarctic ice sheet dynamics for future coastal erosion estimates: a probabilistic assessment	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Coastal erosion; Sea-level rise; Probabilistics; Antarctica; Rapid disintegration	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; DUNE EROSION; STATISTICAL SIMULATION; EXPERT JUDGMENT; FLOODING RISK; WAVE CLIMATE; MARINE; UNCERTAINTY; RECESSION	Sea-level rise (SLR) can amplify the episodic erosion from storms and drive chronic erosion on sandy shorelines, threatening many coastal communities. One of the major uncertainties in SLR projections is the potential rapid disintegration of large fractions of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS). Quantifying this uncertainty is essential to support sound risk management of coastal areas, although it is neglected in many erosion impact assessments. Here, we use the island of Sint Maarten as a case study to evaluate the impact of AIS uncertainty for future coastal recession. We estimate SLR-induced coastal recession using a probabilistic framework and compare and contrast three cases of AIS dynamics within the range of plausible futures. Results indicate that projections of coastal recession are sensitive to local morphological factors and assumptions made on how AIS dynamics are incorporated into SLR projections and that underestimating the potential rapid mass loss from the AIS can lead to ill-informed coastal adaptation decisions.

Quantification of Amu River Riverbank Erosion in Balkh Province of Afghanistan during 2004-2020	LAND			English	Article						riverbank erosion; river discharge; NDWI; Landsat; ERA5	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BASIN; REANALYSIS; RESOURCES; DYNAMICS	In this study, we propose quantifying the Amu River riverbank erosion with the modelled river discharge in Kaldar District, Balkh Province of Afghanistan from 2004 to 2020. We propose a framework synergizing multi-source information for modelling the erosion area based on three components: (1) river discharge, (2) river width, and (3) erosion area. The total river discharge for the watershed shared by Afghanistan and Tajikistan was modelled using hydrological parameters from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data through multivariate linear regression with ground station data. The river width was determined manually using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from Landsat data. The riverbank erosion area was derived from the digital shoreline analysis using the NDWI. The digital shoreline analysis showed that, between 2008 and 2020, the average riverbank erosion area in Kaldar District is about 5.4 km2 per year, and, overall, 86.3 km2 during 2004-2020 due to flood events. The significantly higher land loss events occurred at 10 km2 bank erosion during the years 2008-2009 and 2015-2016, and 19 km2 peak erosion occurred during 2011-2012. A linear relation between the erosion area with respect to the discharge intensity and the specific stream power was observed with an R2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 1.761 for both.

The results showed that the peak annual flood sequence and the variation point of the annual maximum 3-day flood sequence of the Chengbi River Reservoir was in 1979, and the variation point of the annual maximum 1-day flood sequence was in 1980. A mixed distribution model was developed via a simulated annealing algorithm, hydrological frequency analysis was carried out, and a non-stationary design flood considering the variation point was obtained according to the analysis results; the increases in the flood peak compared to the original design were 4.00% and 8.66%, respectively. A maximum peak reduction model for optimal reservoir scheduling using the minimum sum of squares of the downgradient flow as the objective function was established and solved via a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The proposed adaptive scheduling scheme reduced discharge flow to 2661 m(3)/s under 1000-year flood conditions, and the peak reduction rate reached 60.6%. Furthermore, the discharge flow was reduced to 2661 m(3)/s under 10,000-year flood conditions, and the peak reduction rate reached 65.9%.

Bluetongue and footrot outbreaks in migratory Sheep due to unseasonal rains/floods: Special reference to BTV Serotype 12	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Bluetongue; Climate change; Epidemiology; Floods; Footrot; Serotype 12; Vector borne disease	MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; VIRUS; INFECTION; GOATS	Following heavy rains and floods during October-November of 2019, outbreaks of Bluetongue (BT) disease was witnessed in migratory sheep in flood affected areas. The disease was investigated in fifteen migratory flocks in Karnataka state, involving a total of 3575 sheep with over 1480 ailing and 428 deaths. Samples collected from 208 ailing and 79 dead animals were initially subjected for NS1 genome based group specific Bluetongue virus (BTV) detection by Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and later for segment 2 genome based serotype specific RT-PCR. The RT-PCR and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the virus involved in the current outbreak as BTV serotype 12. This data gives further insights into BT epidemiology and recommends inclusion of locally circulating BTV serotype/s in vaccines in endemic regions for effective control of BT. Since these migratory sheep were forced to stand in water stagnated agricultural fields/lands for days to weeks due to continuous rains, they were concurrently affected with acute footrot caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum and Staphylococcus aureus. Foot-tanks and higher antibiotics were very effective in treatment of footrot in the current outbreak. Present study is an evidence of how unforeseen natural calamities can disrupt animal health with profound socio-economic consequences eventually affecting the food-chain and here a few scientific measures have been attempted to mitigate such animal health crisis.

J	Sengsri, P; Kaewunruen, S				Sengsri, Pasakorn; Kaewunruen, Sakdirat			Influences of Flood Conditions on Dynamic Characteristics of Novel 3D-Printed Porous Bridge Bearings	MATERIALS			English	Article						novel 3D-printed porous bridge bearings (3DPPBBs); dynamic modal parameters; idealised single degree of freedom (ISDOF); flood; climate change adaptation; structural dynamics	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CAVITATION; DESIGN; RUBBER	As the key safety-critical component of a bridge support system, bridge bearings are extensively used to accommodate, balance, and transfer differential displacements and loads between the superstructure and substructure of a bridge during operations. Several studies have been conducted to obtain dynamic modal parameters of traditional bridge bearings only in perfectly dry environments. However, in extreme weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain, flash floods, etc.), water can ingress and change the bearings' properties. In this study, novel 3D-printed porous bridge bearings (3DPPBBs) have been fabricated by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filaments. This study is the first to determine the influences of flood conditions on their dynamic properties, which has never been done before. An idealised single degree of freedom (ISDOF) for these novel bearings is considered for the non-destructive field-testing technique of the critical bridge component. A series of experimental tests have been performed under several conditions of flooding levels. The new results unprecedentedly indicate that relatively higher dynamic damping ratios can be found with the increasing flood levels.

Measures based on local knowledge (LK) is of great significance for communities to live with flood risks. However, the analysis on their costs and benefits is often overlooked. In this study, participatory GIS (PGIS) is used to explore LK in a flood-prone community in Zhejiang Province, China. By incorporating flood risk analysis, we apply the net present value (NPV) method to quantify the costs and benefits of LK-based flood adaptation measures (FAMs) (i.e., the wet-floodproofing, 0.5 m-uplift, 1.0 m-uplift and hybrid measures). Our results show that, the flood-prone community residents have gradually adopted FAMs through a series of flood experiences and learning processes. The LK-based FAMs can significantly reduce flood risk. With FAMs, the expected annual damage (EAD) decreases by 55.6-98.8%. All FAMs with three discount rates are feasible (NPV >0) regardless of short-, medium-, or long-term goals, of which the hybrid measure is the most desirable. Our work suggests that LK is beneficial in reducing flood risk and can be incorporated into decisions on resilient community building. Our approach can also be applied in other coastal communities for their cost-benefit analysis of LK-based FAMs.	[Lai, Xiaoxia; Wen, Jiahong; Shen, Liucheng; Wan, Chengcheng; Shao, Lin; Li, Weijiang] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Shan, Xinmeng] East China Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanjuan] Ningbo Univ, Dept Geog & Spatial Informat Tech, Ningbo 315211, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bo] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bo] Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China	Shanghai Normal University; East China Normal University; Ningbo University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University	Li, WJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.; Chen, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Key Lab Environm Change & Nat Disaster, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Chen, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.	bochen@bnu.edu.cn; lwj@shnu.edu.cn	Li, Xinyue/JVN-4601-2024		National Natural Science Foundation of China [42171080, 41771540, 42001014]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, China [20YJCZH180]; Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project [LGF21D010003]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Foundation, China; Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project	Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 42171080, 41771540, 42001014) .

Voices from the Flood Prone Dharavi Slum in Mumbai	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE			English	Article						Dharavi; Evaluation; Mumbai flood; Participatory disaster risk reduction; Participatory flood risk mapping; Process-based criteria of participation	NATURAL-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION; COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION; HOUSING RECONSTRUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REDUCTION; FRAMEWORK; INSIGHTS; VULNERABILITY	Participatory flood risk mapping (PFRM) is a well-recognized and widely implemented tool for meaningful community involvement in disaster risk reduction (DRR). The effectiveness of PFRM remains anecdotal. The PFRM exercise has rarely been applied identically in two different places by two different organizations, which produces varied and uncertain outcomes. In the absence of any agreed and comprehensive framework for participatory DRR, existing studies struggle to provide a scientific account of how the structure, design, and process of PFRM ensure the effective participation of local communities. This study, examines what factors and methods make PFRM an effective participatory DRR tool. In this study, we first identified the process-based criteria of participation. Then we briefly introduced a participatory flood risk mapping exercise conducted in a flood-prone informal settlement in Dharavi, Mumbai. The exercise was carefully designed to meet the process criteria of effective participation. Finally, using qualitative research methods, we evaluated the effectiveness of our PFRM from the local community perspective. The findings show that ensuring community livelihood security and true involvement of marginalized groups, preparing an action plan, and incorporating fun and cultural connotations into the facilitation process are critical components that enhance community participation through PFRM in DRR.

As climate change threatens to raise the frequency and severity of flooding in vulnerable areas, the ability to predict the number of property insurance claims resulting from flood events becomes increasingly important to flood resilience. Based on random forest, we develop a flood property Insurance Claims model (iClaim) by fusing records from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), including building locations, topography, basin morphometry, and land cover, with data from multiple sources of hydrometeorological variables, including flood extent, precipitation, and operational river-stage and oceanic water-level measurements. The model utilizes two steps- damage level classification and claim number regression-and subsampling strategies designed accordingly to reduce overfitting and underfitting caused by the flood claim samples, which are unevenly distributed and widely ranged. We evaluate the model using 446,446 grid samples identified from 589 flood events occurring from 2016 to 2019 over CONUS, overlapping 258,159 claims out of a total of 287,439 NFIP records of the same period. Our rigorous validation yields acceptable performance at the grid/event, county/event, and event accumulative level, with R-2 over 0.5, 0.9, and 0.95, respectively. We conclude that the iClaim model can be used in many application scenarios, including assessing flood impact and improving flood resilience.

Machine learning (ML) techniques, as an increasingly popular approach, have been applied in diverse climatic regions, showing their respective superiority. On top of that, the ensemble learning model that synthesizes the advantages of different ML models deserves more attention. In this study, an ensemble learning model based on stacking approach was proposed. Four prevalent ML models, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) are taken as base models. To combine the outputs from the base models, the weighting algorithm is used as second-layer learner to generate predictions. Large-scale climate indices, large-scale atmospheric variables, and local meteorological variables were used as predictors. R-2, RMSE and MAE, were used as evaluation metrics. The results show that the performance of base models varied among the nine stations in the Taihu Basin, while the stacking approach generally performed better than the four base models. The stacking model showed better performance in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. During wet months, the accuracy of model prediction varied more significantly. On the whole, based on performance evaluation measures, it is concluded that the proposed stacking ensemble multi-ML model can provide a flexible and reasonable prediction framework applicable to other regions.

For steep, forest-covered mountainous watersheds, deep-learning models may improve prediction of river stages from rainfall. Here we use the framework of multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks to develop such a river stage model. The MLP is constructed for the Shimanto river, which lies in southwestern Japan under a mild, rain-heavy climate. Our input for stage estimation, as well as prediction, is a long-term rainfall time series. With a one-year time series of rainfall, the model estimates the stage with RMSE less than 67 cm for about 10 m of stage peaks, as well as accurately simulating stage-time fluctuations. Furthermore, the forecast model can predict the stage without rainfall forecasts up to three hours ahead. To estimate the base flow stages as well as flood peaks with high precision, we found that the rainfall time series should be at least one year. This indicates that the use of a long rainfall time series enables one to model the contributions of ground water and evaporation. Given that the delay between the arrival time of rainfall at a rain-gauge to the outlet change is well-simulated, the physical concepts of runoff appear to be soundly embedded in the MLP.

However, flood forecasting in semi-arid region is a great challenge to hydrologists, particularly in a changing environment. Taking the Zhulong River catchment located in north China as a case, the performance of GR4J model for hydrological modelling was investigated based on the analysis for changes in hydrological process of three periods defined as natural period (1967-1979), moderate human impact period (1980-1996) and intensive human impact period (1997-2015). Results show that 1) the annual precipitation and temperature of the catchment both presented upward trends, while the annual observed runoff exhibited a significant downward trend in the time span from 1967 to 2015; 2) the correlations between runoff and precipitation were comparatively higher on both monthly and annual scales in natural period than those in human disturbed periods; 3) both annual runoff and daily peak discharge in human disturbed periods decreased relative to those in natural period due to the environmental changes; 4) the GR4J model performed well for runoff simulations in natural period but gradually lost its applicability with the intensification of human activities. It is essential to improve the accuracy of hydrological modelling under a changing environment in further studies.

However, the number of the global in situ discharge measurements has been declining since the eighties and the global supply of available data is often restricted in many parts of world. All these reasons have fostered in the last decades the exploitation of new technologies, such as satellite data, in the estimation of river discharge. In this study, satellite altimetry water level data are used to set-up a consistent and up-to-date river discharge dataset by means of rating curves for different sites across the world. Long continuous river discharge time series so obtained are used to perform a trend analysis on extreme hydrological events. Specifically, peak-over threshold values are extracted from the discharge time series, as proxy variables of independent extreme events, and the trend analysis is then carried out to identify changes in the magnitude of extreme events. The analysis permits to identify areas of the world prone to floods, like the West Africa, or drought so that appropriate actions for disaster risk mitigation and continuous improvement in disaster preparedness, response and recovery practices can be adopted.

J	Wang, YT; Liu, Z; Wang, GQ; Xue, WC				Wang, Yuntao; Liu, Zhen; Wang, Guoqiang; Xue, Wenchao			Cellular automata based framework for evaluating mitigation strategies of sponge city	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban flooding; CADDIES; Sponge city; Mitigation strategies; Performance evaluation	PLUVIAL FLOOD RISK; IMPACT; MODEL; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSTRUCTION; OPTIONS; DAMAGE	Urban surface water flooding is increasing because of climate change and urbanization, and brings great challenges to urban sustainable development. It is, therefore, most important to develop urban flood management approaches to alleviate the consequences of floods. China is implementing a "sponge city" initiative to tackle urban surface water flooding and improve urban water management. There is, however, limited cost-effectiveness evaluation to support the choice of economically efficient mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this study developed an evaluation framework based on cellular automata and cost-benefit analysis to assess the performance of mitigation strategies in sponge city construction. This approach is demonstrated with a case study of Siergou (Dalian, China), which has a total area of 10.1 km(2). The mitigation measures of green roofs, permeable pavements and bio-retention were used to generate mitigation scenarios. A two-dimensional cellular automata-based model was used to simulate urban surface water flooding. The results obtained from the case study indicate that the framework can achieve cost-effective mitigation strategies for sponge city construction, which can support robust decision making. The distribution of mitigation strategies has great impacts on the effectiveness of alleviating urban flood risk This study provides new insight into the development of cost-effective mitigation strategies for sponge city construction.

J	Deng, P; Zhu, JT				Deng, Peng; Zhu, Jianting			Forecast and uncertainty analysis of extreme precipitation in China from ensemble of multiple climate models	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article								Global climate change is expected to have a major impact on the hydrological cycle. Understanding potential changes in future extreme precipitation is important to the planning of industrial and agricultural water use, flood control, and ecological environment protection. In this paper, we study the statistical distribution of extreme precipitation based on historical observation and various global climate models (GCMs), and predict the expected change and the associated uncertainty. The empirical frequency, generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, and L-moment estimator algorithms are used to establish the statistical distribution relationships and the multi-model ensemble predictions are established by the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. This ensemble forecast takes advantage of multi-model synthesis, which is an effective measure to reduce the uncertainty of model selection in extreme precipitation forecasting. We have analyzed the relationships among extreme precipitation, return period, and precipitation durations for 6 representative cities in China. More significantly, the approach allows for establishing the uncertainty of extreme precipitation predictions. The empirical frequency from the historical data is all within the 90% confidence interval of the BMA ensemble. For the future predictions, the extreme precipitation intensities of various durations tend to become larger compared to the historic results. The extreme precipitation under the RCP8.5 scenario is greater than that under the RCP2.6 scenario. The developed approach not only effectively gives the extreme precipitation predictions, but also can be used to any other extreme hydrological events in future climate.

Farmers' perception on climate extremes and their coping mechanism: evidences from disaster prone regions of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE			English	Article						Agro-biodiversity conservation; Arid ecosystem; Natural disasters; Sustainability; Traditional practices	INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; ADAPTATION; RAJASTHAN; DROUGHT; MANAGEMENT; SERVICES; DISTRICT; AREAS	The state of Rajasthan is highly vulnerable to climatic extremes. The perception of local communities regarding climate change and their indigenous coping management strategies is important for decision-making and policy formation. In this paper, the perceptions of farmers and their coping strategies were studied using primary data collected from 180 farmers of Bikaner and Kota districts. The data were collected through personal interviews as well as focused group discussions. The findings indicated that the risk of droughts, rainfall anomalies and wind-storms increased over the decade. The people at drought-prone regions were more food insecure in comparison to flood-affected regions. However, their traditional wisdom and indigenous species like Khimp (Leptadenia pyrotechnica), Kair (Capparis decidua), Phog (Calligonum polygonoides), Khejri (Prosopis cineraria), etc. helped them in coping with climate extremes. Adjustments in the dates of sowing, deep summer ploughing in morning hours, dry sowing, increased seed rate, mixed cropping and farming; especially crop-livestock integration were common coping management strategies. Farmers perceived that with modernization of agriculture, biodiversity of the region is declining. The study suggests that local communities need to be incentivized for conserving these species. These indigenous products have high market value. Therefore, the value chains of these products need to be strengthened by providing processing equipment such as solar drier at subsidized rates.

The North American COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment (NA-CORDEX) matrix of global and regional climate models at multiple resolutions (similar to 50-km and 25-km grid spacings) is used to evaluate mean monthly precipitation, extreme daily precipitation, and snow water equivalent (SWE) over the western United States, with a sub-regional focus on California. Results indicate significant model spread in mean monthly precipitation in several key water-sensitive areas in both historical and future projections, but suggest model agreement on increasing daily extreme precipitation magnitudes, decreasing seasonal snowpack, and a shortening of the wet season in California in particular. While the beginning and end of the California cool season are projected to dry according to most models, the core of the cool season (December, January, February) shows an overall wetter projected change pattern. Daily cool-season precipitation extremes generally increase for most models, particularly in California in the mid-winter months. Finally, a marked projected decrease in future seasonal SWE is found across all models, accompanied by earlier dates of maximum seasonal SWE, and thus a shortening of the period of snow cover as well. Results are discussed in the context of how the diverse model membership and variable resolutions offered by the NA-CORDEX ensemble can be best leveraged by stakeholders faced with future water planning challenges.

Green Infrastructure (GI) can reduce stormwater runoff and offer multiple benefits that have been initiated in the United Kingdom (UK) and China, namely Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) and Sponge Cities Program (SCP) respectively. Currently, the implementation of GI is restricted to small spatial (site specific) scale and facing several constraints such as financial investment and governance, that limited its fuller functions and potential. This study aims to identify the barriers and enablers for the adoption of GI by investigating SUDS and SCP in the UK and China, through twelve in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. Our results found that multiple benefits of the SUDS and SCP were identified, as the main enablers in both countries with reducing the stormwater runoff and alleviating peak discharge in the drainage system, also contributing to social well-being and climate adaptations. Some barriers found the current practices are facing challenges from financial, biophysical and socio-political circumstances in both cases. We conclude that it is beneficial to learn the comparative findings and experiences from both countries, which contributes to stakeholders for improving current GI practices, in prior to achieve more sustainable long-term deliverables.

J	Ionita, M; Nagavciuc, V				Ionita, M.; Nagavciuc, V			Forecasting low flow conditions months in advance through teleconnection patterns, with a special focus on summer 2018	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE	Over the past decades, Europe has been affected by several low flow periods which had substantial impacts on the hydrology of the rivers themselves as well as on the society and economy. Low flow periods have a direct impact on the environment, on the inland waterway navigation, on the hydropower production as well as on the sediment management, among others. Similar to floods, low flows are naturally occurring phenomena which can significantly hinder different uses and functions of the rivers and impact the aquatic system and the water quality. Moreover, it is projected that, in the future, climate change might lead to drier summers over the European region and therefore to more frequent and severe low flow periods. The results presented here show that the summer 2018 low flow situation, over the Rhine and Elbe Rivers basin, could have been predicted up to two seasons ahead by using previous months' sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, mean air temperature and soil moisture. The lagged relationship between the predictand (e.g. seasonal streamflow) and the climate and oceanic predictors varies between 1 month (e.g. precipitation) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Taking into account that all predictors are available in real-time, the forecast scheme can be used to provide early warnings for the upcoming low flow situations, thus offering the possibility for better management of the water resources.

These challenges include loss of culture and economy for humans as well as loss of ecosystem functions and habitats for the socio-ecological system. To best mitigate and adapt to these challenges in the near-term, the Restore the Mississippi River Delta ( MRD) -- a consortium of five nonprofit organizations with a shared goal of restoration of coastal Louisiana -- identified 17 projects from Louisiana's Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast ( 2017 Coastal Master Plan or CMP) through a streamlined prioritization process. Prioritization of these projects were based on criteria including the project's scale and synergies, enhancement of ecosystem services, contributions to species diversity and abundance, resilience to coastal flooding, sustainability, and feasibility of implementation. To gauge the progress in the implementation of chosen projects, outcome indicators were developed for coastal restoration via scientific research, expert opinion, and defensible assumptions. A detailed methodology was formulated where up-to-date information for each project was collected, converted into measurable scores calculated annually through a comprehensive evaluation-tracking tool. The criteria for "success" of each project was based on actual scores meeting the target scores (calculated from projection of the project's annual progress during the project's life cycle). Scoring methods were analyzed and reported yearly on and improvements and strategies formulated for underperforming projects.

Scalable flood level trend monitoring with surveillance cameras using a deep convolutional neural network	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; URBAN; MODEL; CALIBRATION; CITIES; CHALLENGES; DAMAGE	In many countries, urban flooding due to local, intense rainfall is expected to become more frequent because of climate change and urbanization. Cities trying to adapt to this growing risk are challenged by a chronic lack of surface flooding data that are needed for flood risk assessment and planning. In this work, we propose a new approach that exploits existing surveillance camera systems to provide qualitative flood level trend information at scale. The approach uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect floodwater in surveillance footage and a novel qualitative flood index (namely, the static observer flooding index - SOFI) as a proxy for water level fluctuations visible from a surveillance camera's viewpoint. To demonstrate the approach, we trained the DCNN on 1218 flooding images collected from the Internet and applied it to six surveillance videos representing different flooding and lighting conditions. The SOFI signal obtained from the videos had a 75% correlation to the actual water level fluctuation on average. By retraining the DCNN with a few frames from a given video, the correlation is increased to 85% on average. The results confirm that the approach is versatile, with the potential to be applied to a variety of surveillance camera models and flooding situations without the need for on-site camera calibration. Thanks to this flexibility, this approach could be a cheap and highly scalable alternative to conventional sensing methods.

Characterising marshland temporal dynamics using remote sensing: The case of <i>Bolboschoenetum maritimi</i> in Donana national park	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						NDVI; Remote sensing; Ecosystems functioning; MODIS; Rainfall; Macrophytes	ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONAL TYPES; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; TIME-SERIES; WETLAND; SERVICES; WATER; RESPONSES; NETWORK	This work examines the temporal dynamics of macrophytes present in the Donana National Park marshland (SW Spain), represented by the plant association Bolboschoenetum maritimi. The characterisation of the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of these vegetation masses was carried out through the analysis of biweekly NDVI time series from MODIS over a 16-year period (2000-2015). The NDVI provides information regarding the status of vegetative cover. Different indicators of seasonal dynamics were obtained through the NDVI time series, such as: annual mean (NDVI-I), relative range (RREL), maximum and minimum values (MAX and MIN), and months of MAX and MIN (MMAX and MMIN), which were evaluated as indicators of the seasonal variation of the vegetation and of its response to variations in the rainfall and flooding regimes of the marshland. Results showed a strong dependence on the flooding processes of the marshland, requiring a minimum rainfall threshold (350 mm/year) for proper development. Furthermore, a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.70; p < 0.05) was found between the seasonal nature of the vegetation masses, measured using RREL, and the accumulated rainfall during the flooding period of the marshland. Slightly weaker relationships between rainfall and other indicators such as the minimum and maximum annual NDVI (R-2 = 0.61 and R-2 = 0.43; p < 0.05, respectively) were also found.

The newly available Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS-v2) gridded data spanning 37years (1981 to 2017) was validated against gauge observations (N=4243) and utilised to map zones experiencing significant monotonic rainfall trends. Standardised annual rainfall anomalies revealed the spatial-temporal distribution of below and above normal rains that are associated with droughts and floods respectively. Results showed that CHIRPS-v2 data had a satisfactory skill to estimate monthly rainfall with Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE=0.68 and a high temporal agreement (r=0.73) while also preserving total amount (beta=0.99) and variability (gamma=0.8). Two contiguous zones with significant increase in annual rainfall (3-15mmyear(-1)) occurred in Southwest Zambia and in Northern Lake Victoria Basin between Kenya and Uganda. The most significant decrease in annual rainfall (-20mmyear(-1)) was recorded at Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Other significant decreases in annual rainfall ranging between -4 and -10mmyear(-1) were observed in Southwest Tanzania, Central-South Kenya, Central Uganda and Western Rwanda. CHIRPS-v2 rainfall product provides reliable high spatial resolution information on amount of rainfall that can complement sparse rain gauge network in rain-fed agricultural systems in ESA region. The observed spatial-temporal trends and variability in rainfall are important basis for guiding targeting of appropriate adaptive measures across multiple sectors.

Observed trends in indices for daily rainfall extremes specific to the agriculture sector in Lower Vellar River sub-basin, India: Extreme rainfall trends over Lower Vellar sub-basin	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate variability and change; monsoon; observations; extreme climate indices; agriculture and food security; trend analysis	NORTHEAST MONSOON RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; EVENTS; TEMPERATURE; SOUTHERN; SERIES; SHIFTS; IMPACT; TESTS; ENSO	Globally, climate change has caused changes in frequency and intensity of climate extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical cyclones. There is a need to understand the pattern of regional climate extremes to develop crucial adaptation strategies for the farming community. This paper focuses on developing the Expert Team on Climate Risk and Sector-specific Indices for rainfall, relevant for the agriculture and food security sector. The indices have been developed for Lower Vellar River sub-basin, a coastal basin in Tamil Nadu, India. Trend analysis has been done for the climatic and cropping seasons in the sub-basin. Overall, there has not been any trend in the annual rainfall index values. The monthly trend values for the different indices have mostly exhibited insignificant trends throughout the study period (1978-2015) except for a few indices. Overall, the southwest monsoon season has shown a significantly decreasing trend in the indices. The northeast monsoon season has shown insignificant trends with positive slopes for most indices. There were insignificant or no trends in the indices for the summer season. The findings from the study can be used as a guiding tool for developing adaptation strategies, for the farming community.

This paper examines the variation trend in the conversion rate between PWV and actual precipitation on a monthly scale in Hubei from 1960 to 2020. To estimate historical PWV data, we propose a new method for estimating PWV using water vapor pressure based on the RF algorithm. The new method was evaluated by radiosonde data and improved the accuracy by 1 mm over the traditional method in Hubei. Based on this method, we extrapolate the monthly average PWV in Hubei from 1960 to 2020 and analyze the conversion rate between PWV and precipitation during this period. Our results showed that there was no obvious cyclical pattern in the conversion rate in either the longitude or latitude directions. In Hubei, where the topography varies significantly in the longitude direction, the conversion rate is influenced by topography, with the smallest conversion rate being in the transition zone between the mountainous region of western Hubei and the Jianghan Plain. In the latitudinal direction, the conversion rate decreases with increasing latitude.

However, understandings of conceptions and experiences of severe climate risks in indigenous farming communities are insufficient. This research respond to that knowledge gap with evidence from selected indigenous farming communities in northern Ghana through a mixed-method approach. Results from the empirical data show that farmers perceive severe climate risk to mean livelihood disruption throughout the season, unproductive farmlands, ineffective adaptation and inability to break even. The logistic regression estimates show that gender, marital status, livelihood activity and ecological zone are all influential factors that are likely to predict farmers' perceptions of severe climate risk. Farmers in northern Ghana experience severe physical climate risks such as extreme droughts, extreme temperatures, severe heatwaves, frequent floods and severe water stress. To mitigate severe physical climate risks and disasters, individual farmers implement indigenous adaptation strategies such as livelihood diversification, construction of hand-dug wells in farms, migration, building of mounds or ridges, and early marriage of young girls. Collectively, farming communities culturally utilize animal sacrifices and spiritual incantations to invoke rains to address prolonged droughts. Understanding severe climate risks and their determinants will provide good policy guidelines for early warning systems to sustainably improve livelihood and food security in resource-constrained communities.

Water issues have been scientifically investigated from several perspectives, namely institutional, economic, social, environmental, managerial, and technological. However, the technological aspects of irrigation and water supply for smallholder farmers in the Mediterranean region have not been adequately addressed. This paper explores irrigation and water supply technologies for smallholder farmers in the selected Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Malta, Morocco, and Portugal). The methods of analysis are literature review, fieldwork, and observation. The literature survey reveals that Mediterranean countries share many common features in terms of climate, water and land resources, and development issues. Nevertheless, the selected countries in the Mediterranean region (Egypt, Malta, Morocco, and Portugal) differ in terms of type of crops, water management regulations, labor force availability, financial sustainability, and economic approaches. These remarks signal the need for applying a specific approach in selecting a technology for irrigation and water supply according to the regional context. Additionally, the financial and economic perspectives of the three key technologies (i.e., SLECI, desalination technology, and engineering constructed wetlands) require further analysis.

J	Agnon, U				Agnon, Uri			Houses Slide	TEMPO			English	Music Performance Review								At its beginning Houses Slide is raised from complete darkness by 16 cyclists. Their pedalling powers the show; its constant woosh is the pedal point against which Laura Bowler's music is played. Both impressive and absurd, pedalling fast but getting nowhere, these cyclists are an apt symbol for the questions that Houses Slide raises. This London Sinfonietta commission explores the consciousness of the ecologically conscious. At the heart of the piece lies a paradox that has become part of our collective and personal anxiety. We are repeatedly told two contradictory things: that our actions are utterly disastrous (for example, heating the world, killing the whales) and, at the same time, that they are too insignificant to create positive change. How can we be simultaneously so dangerous and so ineffective? And what can we (guilty yet useless creatures as we are) do? These are the questions that come to mind as we listen to the recorded text that accompanies the piece throughout. This text is a verbatim record of personal testimonies gathered through the artists' call out to the public to submit answers to questions about how they've experienced the climate changing and what it makes them feel. Some speak of the disappearance of moths and hedgehogs, others of unseasonal snow or floods, and one voice candidly says that they haven't experienced any change at all, but they believe the scientists who tell them that change, the crisis, is happening.

However, previous flood prediction methods usually require a lot of computation to obtain the prediction results and impose a heavy burden on the unit cost of the prediction. This paper proposes the use of a deep learning model (DLM) to overcome these problems. We alleviated the high computational overhead of this approach by developing a novel framework for the construction of lightweight DLMs. The proposed scheme involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) by using a radar echo map in conjunction with historical flood records at target sites and using Grad-Cam to extract key grid cells from these maps (representing regions with the greatest impact on flooding) for use as inputs in another DLM. Finally, we used real radar echo maps of five locations and the flood heights record to verify the validity of the method proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that our proposed lightweight model can achieve similar or even better prediction accuracy at all locations with only about 5~15% of the operation time and about 30~35% of the memory space of the CNN.

Conservation agriculture for food security and climate resilience in Nepal	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							RICE-WHEAT EXPERIMENT; CROPPING SYSTEMS; MIDDLE MOUNTAINS; FARMING SYSTEMS; SOIL FERTILITY; MAIZE YIELD; TILLAGE; MIDHILLS; IMPACTS; PRODUCTIVITY	Achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations requires innovations in agriculture and development of climate-smart and economically feasible approaches for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Historical climate data of Nepal, which include 116 yr since 1901, has shown an increasing trend for average temperature by 0.016 degrees C yr(-1) whereas precipitation has shown a decreasing trend by 0.137 mm yr(-1). Such weather trends could enhance glacier melt associated flooding, and delayed monsoon rainfalls negatively impacting the agricultural production. The Nepalese government is promoting conservation agriculture (CA) through development of low-cost technologies that can be used effectively in difficult terrains. Such techniques include crop diversification, crop rotation, cover crops, and minimum tillage; all of which can reduce soil degradation. In addition, increasing crop residue retention can result in greater C sequestration and crop yield and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is still lack of consensus on the merits of CA in the context of smallholder farming systems in Nepal. This paper reviews existing literature and provides an overview of farming practices in Nepal, highlights near-term challenges associated with climate change and food security, and discusses the role of CA as a climate-smart strategy to minimize soil degradation and improve food security.

Assessing Trustworthiness of Crowdsourced Flood Incident Reports Using Waze Data: A Norfolk, Virginia Case Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CREDIBILITY	Climate change and sea-level rise are increasingly leading to higher and prolonged high tides, which, in combination with the growing intensity of rainfall and storm surges, and insufficient drainage infrastructure, result in frequent recurrent flooding in coastal cities. There is a pressing need to understand the occurrence of roadway flooding incidents in order to enact appropriate mitigation measures. Agency data for roadway flooding events are scarce and resource-intensive to collect. Crowdsourced data can provide a low-cost alternative for mapping roadway flood incidents in real time; however, the reliability is questionable. This research demonstrates a framework for asserting trustworthiness on crowdsourced flood incident data in a case study of Norfolk, Virginia. Publicly available (but spatially limited) flood incident data from the city in combination with different environmental and topographical factors are used to create a logistic regression model to predict the probability of roadway flooding at any location on the roadway network. The prediction accuracy of the model was found to be 90.5%. When applying this model to crowdsourced Waze flood incident data, 71.7% of the reports were predicted to be trustworthy. This study demonstrates the potential for using Waze incident report data for roadway flooding detection, providing a framework for cities to identify trustworthy reports in real time to enable rapid situation assessment and mitigation to reduce incident impact.

Future urban development exacerbates coastal exposure in the Mediterranean	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH; EXPANSION; SIMULATION	Changes in the spatial patterns and rate of urban development will be one of the main determinants of future coastal flood risk. Existing spatial projections of urban extent are, however, often available at coarse spatial resolutions, local geographical scales or for short time horizons, which limits their suitability for broad-scale coastal flood impact assessments. Here, we present a new set of spatially explicit projections of urban extent for ten countries in the Mediterranean, consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). To model plausible future urban development, we develop an Urban Change Model, which uses input variables such as elevation, population density or road network and an artificial neural network to project urban development on a regional scale. The developed future projections for the five SSPs indicate that accounting for the spatial patterns of urban development can lead to significant differences in the assessment of future coastal urban exposure. The increase in exposure in the Extended Low Elevation Coastal Zone (E-LECZ = area below 20 m of elevation) until 2100 can vary, by up to 104%, depending on the urban development scenario chosen. This finding highlights that accounting for urban development in long-term adaptation planning, e.g. in the form of land-use planning, can be an effective measure for reducing future coastal flood risk on a regional scale.

The contribution of TC-induced to total extreme precipitation events along the southeast coast of China was higher than 50%, and the values gradually decreased as TCs moved inland. However, the precipitation extremes (magnitude and frequency) related to TCs did not show statistically significant changes over the most recent 57 years. The impacts of TCs on precipitation extremes are evidently modulated by the ENSO phases. We found less extreme precipitation linked with TCs in southeastern China during El Nino phase, because of the fewer TC tracks over this region and less TC genesis in the western North Pacific (WNP). The small TC track density over southeastern China is due to the prevalent westerly steering flow and abnormal integrated vapor transport from northern to southern China during El Nino years. Additionally, warmer sea surface temperature, more vigorous westerlies, larger vorticity in 250 hPa, and higher divergence in 850 hPa in an El Nino phase jointly displaced the mean genesis of the WNP TCs eastward and this led to fewer TCs passing through southeastern China.

The large groundwater withdrawals, coupled with an overall worsening of the water quality, requires a detailed knowledge of the recharge mechanisms of these aquifers that can be useful for further adaptation measures. Concerning the recharge area of the alluvial aquifers (i.e., apices made up of gravelly materials), the present study investigates a dataset made up of 282 water samples for which stable isotopes oxygen-18 (O-18) and deuterium (H-2) are available. The latter involves precipitations (three rain gauges), surface water (five rivers) and groundwater (twenty wells) from five selected alluvial fans. The study confirms that the different isotopic signatures characterizing rain and river water from this area can be exploited for preliminary characterization of their significance on groundwater recharge. These results lay the foundations for the further use of a suite of environmental tracers (in which a primary role is that of water stable isotopes) at the event-scale (i.e., that of rainfall and/or flood) for eventually estimating the effective quota of recharge linked to precipitation and surface water.

Vision-Based Decision-Making Methodology for Riparian Forest Restoration and Flood Protection Using Nature-Based Solutions	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						nature-based solutions; climate change; ecological restoration; flood risk management; stakeholder involvement; decision-making	FRAMEWORK	Nature-based solutions (NBS) are actions that use natural processes in a resource efficient manner to solve societal challenges. The lack of supportive legislature, and financial, communication and social barriers complicate the process of NBS implementation. It is an urgent need to develop approaches to design and implement NBS that would act as drivers to overcome potential barriers and enhance the social acceptability of the project. The vision-based decision-making methodology and participatory process created in this study has been carried out in the Koiliaris Critical Zone Observatory in Crete to design erosion and flood protection NBS and restore the riparian forest. The methodology consists of four distinct steps as follows: i) develop a vision of the area, ii) conduct a baseline assessment study, iii) NBS design and co-design, and iv) procurement and implementation. The methodology overcame multiple barriers because of the effective stakeholder engagement and the vision "drove" the project and created the necessary consensus that is necessary to achieve the objective of converting privately owned prime agricultural land to riparian forest. It offers an exemplar of a functional ecosystem restoration project that protects the river in a sustainable way, improves its biodiversity and water quality and improves the quality of life and social cohesion.

Flash flood is mainly initiated by intense rainfall, and due to its rapid onset (within six hours of rainfall), taking action for effective response is challenging. Building resilience to flash floods require understanding of the socio-economic characteristics of the societies and their vulnerability to these extreme events. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of socio-economic vulnerability to flash floods and investigates the main characteristics of flash flood hazard, i.e. frequency, duration, severity, and magnitude. A socio-economic vulnerability index is developed at the county level across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). For this purpose, an ensemble of social and economic variables from the US Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis were analyzed. Then, the coincidence of socioeconomic vulnerability and flash flood hazard were investigated to identify the critical and non-critical regions. Results show that the southwest U.S. experienced severe flash flooding with high magnitude, whereas the Northern Great Plains experience lower severity and frequency. Critical counties (high-vulnerable-hotspot) are mostly located in the southern and southwestern parts of the U.S. The majority of counties in the Northern Great Plains indicate a non-critical status.

These modifications have been caused by population change and the transition through rural, industrial and post-industrial economies. Land use and rainfall regime changes, together with land use variations, are frequently associated with flood hazard increase. This paper examines geomorphological landscape changes from the nineteenth century to the present day in the Bisagno Valley, Genoa metropolitan area. The Valley is internationally known for its recurring floods: the last events with fatalities occurred in 2011 and 2014. The extent of landscape change and the history of floods were examined by combining scientific data and information from historical maps, written accounts, topographical drawings and photographs. Historical-geographical and geomorphological analyses were used to reconstruct the runoff for three different periods since 1850. Our results demonstrate that geomorphological landscape variations, including modifications of the river bed, and the abandonment of the countryside and terraces are not sustainable and have progressively allowed an increase in flooding, making it necessary to implement sustainable management policies. In particular, specific spatial urban planning and management measures are necessary in order to mitigate flood hazard and vulnerability.

The risk evaluation considers the structural survivability of the operation components at berth fronts, storage areas and internal transport system within a typical container terminal when subjected to the impact of cyclone wind and storm surge. We present the potential cyclone risks and economic losses for the top 14 East Asian container ports for their respective 100 year return period cyclone wind and storm surge events. The results suggest that many of the container ports are potentially faced with high economic losses: on average, 0.05 billion USD and up to 0.4 billion USD if widespread flooding occurs. The ports located in the Great Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta are subject to the highest risks from both wind and storm surge perils. The maximum 100-year return period loss for these two port clusters can reach up to USD 0.1-0.2 billion under cyclone wind impact and USD 1.0-2.0 billion under storm surge impact. This calls for more effective port planning for cyclone preparedness and emergency response by port authorities and operators.

This evaluation is accomplished by integrating land-use and socioeconomic scenarios, downscaled climate projections, biogeophysical simulation models, and the results of a citizen-stakeholder deliberative multicriteria evaluation. We find that although there are some trade-offs between alternative plausible futures, for the most part, it can be expected that future inhabitants of the watershed will be most satisfied if land-use planning in the intervening years prioritizes water supply and flood protection as well as maintenance of existing farmland and forest cover. With respect to climate change, it is expected that future watershed inhabitants will be more negatively affected by the projected loss of snow cover than the anticipated increase in hot summer days. More important than the specific results for the upper Merrimack River watershed, this integrative assessment demonstrates the complex yet ultimately informative potential to link stakeholder engagement with scenario generation, ecosystem models, and multiattribute evaluation for informing regional-scale planning and decision making.

This study explores heterogeneity in extreme rainfall in the Baltimore Metropolitan region at small spatial scales using hydrometeorological analyses of major storm events in combination with hydroclimatological analyses based on storm catalogs developed using a 16-year record of high-resolution bias-corrected radar rainfall fields. Our analyses demonstrate the potential for rainfall frequency methods using storm catalogs combined with stochastic storm transposition (SST); procedures are implemented for Dead Run, a small (14.3km(2)) urban watershed located within the Baltimore Metropolitan area. The results point to the pronounced impact of complex terrain (including the Chesapeake Bay to the east, mountainous terrain to the west and urbanization in the region) on the regional rainfall climatology. Warm-season thunderstorm systems are shown to be the dominant mechanism for generating extreme, short-duration rainfall that leads to flash flooding. The SST approach is extended through the implementation of a multiplier field that accounts for spatial heterogeneities in extreme rainfall magnitude. SST-based analyses demonstrate the need to consider rainfall heterogeneity at multiple scales when estimating the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationships.

The climate change evident in the fast few decades has further aggravated the problem of eutrophication causing water stress and sedimentation leading to rampant macrophyte proliferation affecting ecological and economic functioning of these ecosystems. Macrophyte control and management needs serious attention for sustaining ecosystem services provided by these resources. In this direction, pen culture of grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella as a biocontrol for macrophytes along with Indian major carps was implemented in a co-management mode in Beledanga, a typical floodplain wetland, a gradually shrinking, macrophyte dominated floodplain wetland in lower Ganga basin. Indian major carps Labeo catla (6.28 +/- 0.23g), Labeo rohita (5.1 +/- 0.12g), Cirrhinus mrigala (3.5 +/- 0.08g) were stocked in the ratio 4:3:3 at the rate of 20 Nos.m(-2) in pens (0.1ha each) in triplicate. Grass carp (7.1 +/- 0.42g) was stocked in pen at the rate of 20Nos.m(-2) in duplicate. The fishes were fed with pelleted feed twice a day at the rate of 2-3% of body weight. The seed was overwintered in pens for a period of 90 days from November 2019 to January 2020. Average weight recorded at the end of culture period was 25.13 +/- 1.70g, 18.11 +/- 0.63g, 14.53 +/- 0.87g, and 39.20 +/- 1.90g in L. catla, L. rohita, C. mrigala, and C. idella, respectively. The survival of fish ranged from 70 to 81%. Growth performance and feed utilization efficiency of grass carp were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to other carp species. The pen culture was found to be economically viable with a benefit cost ratio of 1.53. The fishes produced were released back into the open wetland as an additional input for culture-based fisheries. The intervention along with niche-based enhanced stocking led to 24% increase in the fish production from the wetland with grass carp contributing 20-22% of the total catch with 32% increase in revenue generated by the sale of fish within a short span of 1 year. The study successfully demonstrated technological suitability and economic feasibility of pen culture in this wetland and role of grass carp as a potential biocontrol species for macrophyte management. Grass carp stocked in open wetland grew to 0.8 to 1kg within 6 months and 2-2.3kg within a year and could utilize 40-45% of the submerged and emergent macrophytes. Integration and optimization of grass carp will not only aid in habitat management of macrophyte-choked wetlands but will also boost their small-scale fisheries by converting standing macrophyte biomass into protein-rich fish biomass. The enhanced production will also cater to nutritional and livelihood security of the dependent fishers.

J	Pari, L; Cozzolino, L; Bergonzoli, S				Pari, Luigi; Cozzolino, Luca; Bergonzoli, Simone			Rainwater: Harvesting and Storage through a Flexible Storage System to Enhance Agricultural Resilience	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						rainwater harvesting; flexible water storage; rainfall distribution; rainfed agriculture; irrigated agriculture	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; EXTREMES	Many climatic variables are projected to occur with more intense and frequent extreme events, possibly unpredictable patterns and negative feedback loops with other environmental processes. Agriculture has faced uncertainty regarding ground temperature and rainfall distribution during the last few years, making water availability one of the major concerns for farm management. In this scenario, rainwater harvesting could represent a powerful tool to mitigate this problem, and consequently, the research community has been fostering new technical solutions. On the other hand, a few studies on agronomic assessment of rainwater harvesting systems are present in scientific literature. The present study reports preliminary data of a long-term study on a Flexible Water Storage System (FWSS) evaluating the possibility of enhancing agriculture systems resilience, shifting from rainfed production to irrigated agriculture relying on excessive rainfall, collectible from extreme events. The idea of intercepting excess rainfall, which is generally lost, thanks to an innovative water harvesting system, and using it to mitigate drought stress for crops is in line with sustainable approaches aiming to improve the resilience of agricultural systems. The results highlighted that the system studied could potentially collect an annual average of 831.7 m3 of water, mitigating the excess of water in the ditch that can potentially cause flooding and storing fresh water to provide irrigation during dry periods.

Accurately quantifying this coupling enhances the ability to predict hydroclimatic extremes like floods and droughts. In this study, the ability of soil moisture to affect precipitation (SM-P) is characterized by two parts: the influence of soil moisture on evapotranspiration (SM-ET), and the influence of evapotranspiration on precipitation (ET-P). We determined localized ET-P by incorporating the coupling between latent heat flux (LH) and LCL height, to optimize the estimation of the SM-P. This approach links SM more closely to P by considering the influence of surface fluxes. The results indicate that CMIP6 models exhibited the anticipated hotspot patterns for the three coupling metrics in transition regions. However, we observed that climate models generally exhibit weaker SM-P coupling compared to reanalysis models. Both SM-ET and SM-P showcase higher values wherein wet climate regions during dry years, and the converse occurs in dry regions.

This study helps understand P's response to SM shifts in climate models, crucial for predicting hydrological extremes and coupled global warming impact.

This exceeded the average MHWs duration of 10 d by a factor of 6. In addition, 2022 was also recorded as a year of many extreme events throughout Asia, such as summer floods in China and Pakistan, droughts and extreme heat in Europe, raising the question of whether they were caused by a 'triple-dip' La Nina, which has persisted since September 2020. Here we examine the key local and remote processes that led to the 2022 MHWs in the ECS using mixed-layer heat budget analysis. During the onset of the MHWs, a salinity-stratified shallow mixed-layer due to the large river discharge from the Yangtze-Huaihe River floods in June created favorable conditions for warm ocean temperature in the ECS. Simultaneously, an anomalous anticyclone maintained by the stationary Rossby wave, which is generated by vorticity forcings in mid-latitudes and thermal forcing in Pakistan, settled in the corresponding region and led to the long-lasting MHWs until Typhoon Hinnamnor began to dissipate the wave in early September. This study improves our understanding of the physical mechanism of flood-related MHWs that have increased with recent climate change.

Global climate change has even worsened this situation. Flooding is a continuous process including two stages of submergence and re-oxygenation, and both are harmful to plant growth and development, resulting in a serious decline in crop yield. Therefore, the understanding of plant flooding tolerance and developing flooding-resistant crops are of great significance. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB30 participates in plant submergence response through 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 7 (ACS7) by repressing ethylene (ET) biosynthesis. The MYB30 loss-of-function mutant exhibits reduced submergence tolerance with a higher level of ET production, whereas the MYB30-overexpressing plant displays enhanced submergence tolerance and repressed ET production. The coding gene of ACS7 might be a direct target of MYB30 during the submergence response. MYB30 binds to the promoter of ACS7 and represses its transcription. The ACS7 loss-of-function mutant with defect in ET biosynthesis displays enhanced submergence tolerance, whereas plants overexpressing ACS7 exhibit a submergence-sensitive phenotype. Genetic analysis shows that ACS7 functions downstream of MYB30 in both ET biosynthesis and submergence response. Taken together, our work revealed a novel transcriptional regulation that modulates submergence response in plants.

Literature survey reveals many relevant studies whose outcomes are divergent, possibly because different data series and different methodologies have been applied. This paper presents a critical appraisal of past studies and methodologies for trend analysis. Results of trend analysis of Indian rainfall data are presented. Data for all of India and for five homogenous regions (North-West, Central North-East, North-East, West Central, and Peninsular India) for 1871-2016 were used. The Pettitt change point test, regression, Mann-Kendall (MK), and Wavelet Decomposition were used to study different aspects of changes. Results of the change point test showed that most rainfall series had change points around 1957-65, possibly due to large-scale land use, cultivation, irrigation, and industrial changes in this period. Generally, rainfall for most homogenous regions and sub-divisions show falling trends; some are statistically significant. Series was also decomposed by the wavelet method. Approximate and detailed components of some decomposed series showed a significant declining trend. This work has focused on the magnitude of rainfalls; trends in rainfall intensities are also important. It is necessary to establish denser observation networks to collect short-term data and analyze.

Researchers have shown that the negative phase of PDO or La Nina episodes of ENSO produces higher magnitude rainfall and hence relatively wetter years. So, it is imperative to have better knowledge of flood characteristics in the Indian watersheds for optimal planning and design of various infrastructures, and for optimal planning and management of reservoir operations. Traditionally, such information is estimated using flood frequency analysis (FFA), however, the adequacy of a traditionally accepted assumption that the annual peak flows are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) is questioned globally. This study evaluates the adequacy of this assumption in the Godavari and Narmada River basins and assesses the influence of PDO, ENSO and IOD on flood characteristics. Very few gauges show inverse relations, although statistically not significant. Overall, the signal of all three teleconnections is found in annual and seasonal floods in a majority of the gauging stations and the results clearly indicate that flood characteristics at a majority of the gauges are significantly influenced by these oscillations, higher magnitude floods are associated with negative episodes.

Invasive Mold Infections Following Hurricane Harvey-Houston, Texas	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						aspergillosis; hurricane; invasive mold infections; surveillance	NEW-ORLEANS; FUNGAL-INFECTIONS; DAMAGED HOMES; KATRINA; RISK	Background Characterizing invasive mold infection (IMI) epidemiology in the context of large flooding events is important for public health planning and clinical decision making. Methods We assessed IMI incidence (per 10 000 healthcare encounters) 1 year before and after Hurricane Harvey at 4 hospitals in Houston, Texas. Potential IMI cases were assigned as proven or probable cases using established definitions, and surveillance cases using a novel definition. We used rate ratios to describe IMI incidence and multivariable logistic regression to examine patient characteristics associated with IMI case status. Results IMI incidence was significantly higher posthurricane (3.69 cases) than prehurricane (2.50 cases) (rate ratio, 1.48 [95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.00]), largely driven by surveillance IMI cases. Aspergillus was the most common species cultured (33.5% prehurricane and 39.9% posthurricane). About one-quarter (25.8%) of IMI patients lacked classical IMI risk factors such as hematologic malignancy and transplantations. Overall, 45.1% of IMI patients received intensive care, and in-hospital all-cause mortality was 24.2%. Conclusions IMI incidence likely increased following Hurricane Harvey and outcomes for IMI patients were severe. Patient and clinician education on IMI prevention and identification is warranted, particularly as the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change.

We describe educational games in which the protagonist, a fictional character girl, saves herself and others from natural disasters. This girl faces risk situations, from earthquake to flood to environmental challenges, and for each of these she is the protagonist of educational quizzes and of an escape room. These games were designed and played online during the COVID-19 pandemic, to introduce an engaging activity, reducing the difficulties of both students and teachers in distance learning. Simultaneous challenges between several classes were played during special scientific events, with a total of more than 8000 students flanked by about 500 teachers, always with very positive feedback. We pooled our knowledge to embrace innovation in gamification at school. Our games aim at increasing the response capacity of future more resilient citizens to protect themselves and others, adapting to natural risks, and to spread good practices in support of the civil protection. Each online race between classes from primary and middle school (ISCDE 2) is based on cooperative learning and followed by an important debriefing moment of reflective learning, guided by researchers to deeply analyze scientific topics.

The complex largely formed while Lake Bonneville flooded the basin. Three distinct stratigraphic units separated by minor unconformities have been identified. The oldest unit (Unit 1) occurs over the entire outcrop area and ranges from 10 cm to 2.5 m in thickness. It precipitated as aragonite in the wave-agitated shoreline environment during the early transgressive phase of Lake Bonneville and was subsequently pervasively dolomitized. Some near-vertical faces of Unit 1 are overlain by an 8-cm-thick calcite microbialite (Unit 2) precipitated in deeper water of the regressive phase of Lake Bonneville. The youngest microbialite unit (Unit 3) overlies the calcite layer and precipitated as aragonite when the lake had dropped to levels similar to those of modern Great Salt Lake. The elevation, stratigraphy, distinct mineralogical layers, diagenetic history and long depositional span distinguish the Death Point microbialite complex from other microbialites in the Lake Bonneville/Great Salt Lake lacustrine system. The geochronology of Death Point microbialite will lead to modifications of the Lake Bonneville hydrograph, showing significantly lower lake levels in the early-transgression stage.

Climate disaster and the Green vote following the 2021 Germany floods	RESEARCH & POLITICS			English	Article						climate politics; natural disasters; electoral politics; party politics; Green Party politics; difference-in-differences	EXTREME WEATHER; PERCEPTIONS; SUPPORT	Can first-hand experience of a climate-related natural disaster make citizens more likely to vote in favour of progressive climate politics? Leveraging the rare occurrence of a large-scale disaster just two months before a federal election, we use a difference-in-differences design to study the short-term electoral effects of the devastating 2021 Germany floods on voter support for Germany's major environmentalist party, the Green Party. Compared to other German voters, those living in areas affected by the floods were marginally (0.4-1.6 percentage points) more likely to vote for the Greens. The largest increases in Green vote share are observed in municipalities which were directly exposed to flooding. Contrary to expectation, we tend to find larger increases in Green Party support in the less severely affected areas. Despite substantial increases in turnout in affected areas, we find that the observed increase in vote share for the Greens was rather driven by a persuasion effect on voters who previously supported other parties. In the absence of evidence that the floods led to an increase in voters' issue prioritisation of climate change, our results highlight the limited possibility for major natural disasters to induce increased localised support for Green parties.

This paper presents a real-time flood forecasting approach for the data-scarce Jhelum basin, using MIKE 11 Nedbor-Afstromings Model (NAM), hydrodynamic (HD), and flood forecasting (FF) models. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) model-forecasted precipitation and temperature data were used to forecast floods and increase the forecast lead time. The model performance was evaluated using the Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and indicators of agreement between the simulated values and the observed values. These indicators show good consistency between the observed and simulated hydrographs for the calibration and validation periods, resulting in a level of reliability sufficient for flood forecasting purposes. Errors in forecasting were corrected using an automatic updating routine MIKE 11 FF with the ECMWF input. The forecast results were acceptable for lead times up to 7-days. The study concluded that the developed model was effective for flood forecasting in the data-scarce, snow-dominated Jhelum basin, and that it might be extended to other similar basins throughout the world as part of an early flood warning system.

At a regional or national scale, such modelling is often a lengthy process, which does not allow changes in risk resulting from new science such as revised rainfall frequency estimates or climate projections to be readily quantified by policy makers. A framework of interpolation and extrapolation methods has been developed in the R language via practical application to the city of Perth in central Scotland. These methods allow existing flood mapping, design rainfall estimates and property receptor datasets combined with revised design rainfall estimates to be used to rapidly assess the consequences of change in risk and EAD. The results are evaluated against detailed hydraulic modelling and are shown to provide a good approximation of changes in flood depth and EAD for properties previously modelled as at risk of flooding, particularly residential properties, with lower confidence for non-residential properties. In the Scottish context, the methods are considered to be robust for regional and national scale application and would allow policy makers with a means to rapidly determine the consequence of changes in design rainfall estimates without the immediate requirement to undertake complex hydraulic modelling.

While blue-green infrastructure has emerged as a focal adaptation technique for stormwater management, in order to craft adaptation policies cities must consider a multitude of emerging, complex, and competing stakeholder interests around multiple adaptation alternatives. However, accounting for these different interests, analyzing their diverse priorities, and maintaining a transparent decision-making process is not easily achieved within the existing policy frameworks. Here we define and present a combined multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods that easily integrates and quantifies stakeholder priorities while remaining accessible for non-experts engaged in the policy-making process. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through analyzing opinions about stormwater adaptation in New York City across several stakeholder groups. The method succeeds in integrating quantitative and qualitative judgements, indicating stakeholder preferential differences and allowing for more inclusive policy to be crafted. It can be extended beyond stormwater to many urban climate adaptation decisions facing multi-criteria considerations.

We achieve this by evaluating flood risk and intervention targeting strategies across a case study in Bristol (UK) using data types generally available for preliminary option assessment. We investigate opportunities for mitigating flood damages within catchments using PFR and evaluate two targeting strategies: Installing PFR across strategic areas of a catchment and targeting interventions at specific high-risk properties. We find that individually targeting PFR is more effective than focusing resources on specific high-risk areas. Targeting pluvial flood measures at individual properties across our case study provides an average annual benefit per property of approximately 750 pound more than applying zonal targeting, supporting use of high-resolution modelling in surface water management, and highlighting the applicability of PFR to manage damages at specific high-risk properties which may not fall under the protection of community level defences. A similar approach provides the best outcomes for fluvial targeting; however, the hazard is more concentrated and so a zonal targeting approach may be more acceptable. Overall, we find resistance based PFR an effective intervention to mitigate damages, however complementary strategies are required when managing extreme flooding.

International Perceptions of Urban Blue-Green Infrastructure: A Comparison across Four Cities	WATER			English	Article						blue-green infrastructure; perceptions; climate change adaptation; urban water management; resilience; multiple benefits	NEW-YORK-CITY; WATER MANAGEMENT; SPONGE CITY; IMPLEMENTATION; CLIMATE; STORMWATER; CHINA; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES	Blue-Green infrastructure (BGI) is recognised internationally as an approach for managing urban water challenges while enhancing society and the environment through the provision of multiple co-benefits. This research employed an online survey to investigate the perceptions of BGI held by professional stakeholders in four cities with established BGI programs: Newcastle (UK), Ningbo (China), Portland (Oregon USA), and Rotterdam (The Netherlands) (64 respondents). The results show that challenges associated with having too much water (e.g., pluvial and fluvial flood risk, water quality deterioration) are driving urban water management agendas. Perceptions of governance drivers for BGI implementation, BGI leaders, and strategies for improving BGI uptake, are markedly different in the four cities reflecting the varied local, regional and national responsibilities for BGI implementation. In addition to managing urban water, BGI is universally valued for its positive impact on residents' quality of life; however, a transformative change in policy and practice towards truly multifunctional infrastructure is needed to optimise the delivery of multiple BGI benefits to address each city's priorities and strategic objectives. Changes needed to improve BGI uptake, e.g., increasing the awareness of policy-makers to multifunctional BGI, has international relevance for other cities on their journeys to sustainable blue-green futures.

A Multi-Disciplinary Approach to Understand Hydrologic and Geochemical Processes at Koiliaris Critical Zone Observatory	WATER			English	Article						karst; critical zone; hydrology; geomorphology; tidal analysis; weathering rates	WELL-AQUIFER SYSTEMS; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EARTH-TIDE; CARBON; MODEL; CRETE; IMPACTS; IDENTIFICATION; NITROGEN	Koiliaris CZO is a European Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) typical of the Mediterranean karstic geomorphology, which represents watersheds affected by humans over the centuries. This study aims to provide information that underpins the hydrologic and geochemical processes functioning at Koiliaris CZO. Linking geomorphologic and tectonic analysis improved the delineation of a karstic area which extends outside of the Koiliaris watershed and identified how structural elements influence the regional hydrology. The fluctuation in the river flow represents processes occurring in the karst and the periodic signal is related to Earth tide stressing of the karstic reservoirs. The conceptualization of a two-reservoir, well-mixed karstic system is confirmed by both the geomorphologic and tidal analysis. The hydrologic response is fast and it is manifested especially during extreme events where 70% of the precipitation becomes surface runoff, creating major flood events. The different sampling sites in the Koiliaris CZO were geochemically clustered and the quantification of the weathering fluxes showed that 25 mm/1000 years and 39 mm/1000 years of carbonate were removed by chemical weathering for the Keramianos ephemeral river and the springs, respectively. These studies illustrate the importance of critical zone science and transdisciplinary studies on water and soil management.

This study constructed the inundation curve to dynamically simulate the disaster, and established an inundation severity indicator (ISI) and cost-effectiveness indicator (CEI) to quantify the severity and cost effectiveness at each site. The study set 10 different density scenarios using a zonal approach. The results showed that LID could reduce the overall ISI value, but as the construction increased, the CEI exhibited a downward trend, showing that there is a marginal utility problem in LID. However, the performance of CEI differed slightly in areas of different severity. In the vulnerable resilience zone, the CEI increased initially and then decreased, and the optimal cost-benefit combination was 60% permeable pavement +20% green roof +50% vegetative swale. The mutual effects of LID measures in different zones led to synergistic or antagonistic effects on LID. This study explored the tradeoff between the resilience enhancement effect and strategy transformation cost, and determined the optimal combination of the LID strategy, thereby providing a new analytical perspective for the sustainable development of sponge cities.

Vulnerability assessments have been recognized as one way we can better understand which geographic areas and segments of society are more susceptible to adverse impacts from different stressors or hazards. The aims of this paper are to evaluate the state of coastal vulnerability assessment mapping efforts and to identify opportunities for advancement and refinement that will lead to more cohesive, impactful, and policy-relevant coastal vulnerability studies. We conducted a systematic review of the literature that addresses physical and social vulnerability to coastal hazards and contains corresponding mapping products. The content was analyzed for the scale of analysis, location, disciplinary focus, conceptual framework, metrics used, methodological approach, data sources, mapping output, and policy relevance. Results showed that most Coastal Vulnerability Mapping Assessments (CVMAs) are conducted at the local level using a range of methodologies, often with limited inclusion of social considerations and limited discussion of policy relevance.

CASE STUDY: BISTRA RIVER (APUSENI MOUNTAINS, ROMANIA)	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						hydrographs; surface runoff; GIS; SCS-CN method; distributed hydrological model; settlements	RUNOFF; GIS; HAZARD; AREAS	Romania is among the European countries which are still susceptible to flood disasters. Climate change, the lack of a sustainable land management and floods approach are the most important driving factors of flood risk. Accordingly, additional research to improve or develop various methods for predicting the flash flood events, especially within densely populated watersheds, is required. This paper aims to provide a further assessment of the reliability of a distributed hydrological model developed within a GIS framework The model was developed for use in small river basins and so forth, another objective is to provide insight into whether it is acceptable for use in larger-sized watersheds than the ones it was created for. The methodology is presented by computing the discharges at the entrance of six human settlements located within the Bistra river watershed, a left-bank tributary of Barcau river (Bihor department, Romania). The chosen study area is frequently impacted by flooding, endangering the socioeconomic activities, human settlements and infrastructure. A distributed hydrological modeling approach and the SCS-CN method are used in this research. The results revealed a good correlation between the estimated and measured hydrographs at the gauging points of Padurea Neagra (upstream) and Chiribis (located at the downstream end of the drainage basin).

River flow data is key to understanding river behavior and develop flood mitigation and prevention strategies. The present study provides a revision and an update of the existing discharge dataset of the Sirba River with the aim of enhancing the reliability of these data. The revision also includes the recalibration of the Garbey Kourou rating curves. The analysis of the revised discharge time series strengthens the previous findings, evidencing a positive trend in flood frequency and intensity over the entire analyzed period of 1956-2018. This positive trend is more pronounced for the last 40 years due to a significant underestimation of the rating curves used. A relevant finding is a new changepoint in the time series, detected for 2008, which represents the beginning of the period in which the highest flood magnitudes were registered. The effect of land use/land cover changes and climate changes on the water resource is depicted using flow duration curves. This research produces a revised and more reliable discharge time series that will be a new starting point for future hydrological analyses.

Of particular importance was the development of a local and sustainable food supply for the thousands of laborers involved in this monumental undertaking. Here, we explore the long-term behavioural mechanisms that led human societies to gradually colonize the Nile swamps at Giza. They developed herding and farming, paving the way for greater human exploitation of the area during the Dynastic Egypt. We show that transhumance tribes, originally from the Eastern Sahara, settled along the Giza Plateau 5200 years ago, primarily engaging in herding and, more sporadically, agriculture. Giza was transformed into a pastoral landscape, with the development of large swaths of the floodplain, providing societies with permanent access to livestock produce (e.g. proteins, milk, meat and wool). Our palaeoecological data reveal that the initial complex societies at Giza were deeply rooted in transhumance, pastoralism and animal husbandry. These activities played a fundamental role in establishing the foundations of a robust and sustainable food system, while also serving as a crucial logistical support for the subsequent construction of the monu-mental structures that celebrated the grandeur of pharaonic Egypt. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

This is despite growing recognition that DRR interventions can reduce potential impacts from disasters as well as deliver broader economic, ecological, and social co-benefits. Focusing on the net benefits of DRR, beyond avoiding losses and damages, is considered as an important strategy to strengthen the case for DRR as part of a sustainable development by academics and international organizations alike. However, there is very limited evidence of on-the-ground accounting of these "multiple resilience dividends" by those who act to reduce disaster risk at the local level. Using an innovative analytical approach, we investigate the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with considering multiple resilience dividends in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of DRR interventions at the community level for the example of flood risk. We use a newly developed framework to analyze empirical survey data on community-level DRR interventions as well as five in-depth case studies from Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and the United Kingdom. The analysis reveals a disconnect between available planning tools and the evidence of materialized multiple resilience dividends, which is a key obstacle to successfully apply the concept at the community level. Structured consideration of multiple resilience dividends from the planning to the monitoring and evaluation stages is required to secure local buy-in and to ensure that these dividends materialize as intended.

We assessed the economic feasibility of restoring coastal wetlands for climate change mitigation by reinstating tidal flows on floodplain, agricultural land of the Wet Tropics catchments in Queensland, Australia. We assessed whether potential carbon credits would be sufficient to incentivise conversion of the land, or whether additional ecosystem service payments would be required. We explored the co-benefits for biodiversity, fisheries, and nitrogen removal using a prioritisation approach to identify profitable restoration solutions that maximise these benefits. We identified 5,046 ha of potential restorable area that could abate 221,006 tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-e) annually from carbon sequestration in vegetation and soils and avoided greenhouse gas emissions. Cost-benefit analysis over 25 years demonstrate that 3,399 ha (67%) would be profitable under conventional farm management practice using the current Australian carbon price ($13.85 per tonne CO2-e), which increased to 4,534 ha (90%) at a higher carbon price ($25 per tonne CO2-e). The profitability of coastal wetland restoration was enhanced by a higher carbon price, which can be achieved by bundling ecosystem services, or through stacking ecosystem service payments. Prioritising restoration sites by costeffectiveness and co-benefits can achieve multiple ecosystem services for a substantial profit.

In such a context, the urban drainage systems may not be sufficient to convey the rainwater, thus increasing the risk deriving from the occurrence of such events. This study focuses on a particularly intense urban flood that occurred in Palermo (Italy) on 15 July 2020; it represents a typical pluvial flood due to extreme rainfall on a complex urban area that many cities have experienced in recent years, especially in the Mediterranean region. A conceptual hydrological model and a 2D hydraulic model, particularly suitable for simulations in a very complex urban context, have been used to simulate the event. Results have been qualitatively validated by means of crowdsourced information and satellite images. The experience of Palermo, which has highlighted the urgent need for a shift in the way stormwater in urban settlements is managed, can be assumed to be a paradigm for modeling pluvial floods in complex urban areas under extreme rainfall conditions. Although the approaches and the related policies cannot be identical for all cities, the modeling framework used here to assess the impacts of the event under study and some conclusive remarks could be easily transferred to other, different urban contexts.

Study focus: This study investigates the trends of groundwater levels (GWLs), the memory effect of alluvial aquifers, and the response times between surface water and groundwater across the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Trend analysis, auto- and cross-correlation, and time-series decomposition were applied within a moving window approach to examine non-stationary behavior. New hydrological insights: Our study revealed an effective connection between the shallowest aquifer unit (Holocene) and surface water, and a high potential for shallow groundwater recharge. However, low-permeable aquicludes separating the aquifers behave as low-pass filters that reduce the high-frequency signals in the GWL variations, and limit the recharge to the deep groundwater. Declining GWLs (0.01-0.55 m/year) were detected for all aquifers throughout the 22 years of observation, indicating that the groundwater abstraction exceeds groundwater recharge. Stronger declining trends were detected for deeper groundwater. The dynamic trend analysis indicates that the decrease of GWLs accelerated continuously. The groundwater memory effect varied according to the geographical location, being shorter in shallow aquifers and flood-prone areas and longer in deep aquifers and coastal areas. Variation of the response time between the river and alluvial aquifers was controlled by groundwater depth and season. The response time was shorter during the flood season, indicating that the bulk of groundwater recharge occurred in the late flood season, particularly in the deep aquifers.

However, they are negatively affected by human impact worldwide. The need for restoration is high, but its realization is often hampered by antagonistic human interests. Replacing artificial riverbank protection with bioengineering techniques can be a first and straightforward step to restore riparian ecosystems. However, bioengineering still plays a marginal role in river management. We aim to introduce new arguments for bioengineering along riverbanks by applying the ecosystem service approach. We focus on major regulating services usually provided by floodplains. Denitrification and phosphorous retention were estimated by applying proxy-based models. Carbon sequestration within vegetation was calculated using biomass equations. Our study clearly indicates an increase of ecosystem services by bioengineering measures compared to conventionally fixed riverbanks. The dismantling of riprap removes up to 30 times more nitrogen and 20 times more phosphorous from the river load. Additional slope lowering increases both values up to 50-fold. The carbon storage capacity is four times higher in reed beds and 30 times higher in willow-brush mattresses. Our results show that bioengineering techniques for riverbank protection can be a feasible tool to support general efforts towards enhancing the self-purification of rivers and contribute to mitigating climate change, especially if conducted on a larger scale.

Habitat loss, forest flooding, and hybridization could lead to the extinction of V. epipsila. A hybrid index and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to select qualitative and quantitative morphological features to distinguish parent species and hybrids, inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to determine the genetic diversity of the populations, flow cytometry to estimate the genome size (GS), and non-coding chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions to indicate the directions of crosses. All taxa are very morphologically variable, and their features can change within a season. The most stable feature is the distance of the bracts on the pedicel from the rhizome. The genetic diversity of all taxa populations is low and highly influenced by selfing and vegetative propagation. The population structure is differentiated: populations of V. epipsila or V. palustris, mixed populations with both parent species, F1 hybrids and populations with introgressive forms occur in different regions. The interspecific GS variation corresponds to the ploidy level (4x = 2.52 pg, 8x = 4.26 pg, 6x = 3.42 pg). Viola epipsila is the mother plant of the hybrids. Research has shown the risk of V. epipsila extinction in Central Europe and the importance of local populations in studying the role of hybridization in reducing/maintaining/increasing biodiversity.

Martin			Responses and impacts of atmospheric rivers to climate change	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review							EXTREME PRECIPITATION EVENTS; ON-SNOW FLOOD; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; NORTH PACIFIC; WATER-VAPOR; WEST-COAST; OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION; EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONES; DROPSONDE OBSERVATIONS; HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are characterized by intense moisture transport, which, on landfall, produce precipitation which can be both beneficial and destructive. ARs in California, for example, are known to have ended drought conditions but also to have caused substantial socio-economic damage from landslides and flooding linked to extreme precipitation. Understanding how AR characteristics will respond to a warming climate is, therefore, vital to the resilience of communities affected by them, such as the western USA, Europe, East Asia and South Africa. In this Review, we use a theoretical framework to synthesize understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic responses of ARs to anthropogenic warming and connect them to observed and projected changes and impacts revealed by observations and complex models. Evidence suggests that increased atmospheric moisture (governed by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling) will enhance the intensity of AR-related precipitation - and related hydrological extremes - but with changes that are ultimately linked to topographic barriers. However, due to their dependency on both weather and climate-scale processes, which themselves are often poorly constrained, projections are uncertain. To build confidence and improve resilience, future work must focus efforts on characterizing the multiscale development of ARs and in obtaining observations from understudied regions, including the West Pacific, South Pacific and South Atlantic. Due to their intense moisture transport, atmospheric rivers are associated with hydrological hazards such as extreme rainfall and flooding. This Review discusses how atmospheric-river characteristics and impacts may change with warming, synthesizing physical theory, observations and modelling.

Across these zones, the annual amount of rainfall, including its intensity and its seasonal distribution, vary considerably. These variations, which impact on both urban and rural communities, including the occurrence of water shortages and flash flooding events. are increasing in both frequency and magnitude due to global warming and climate change. Several types of climate occur in Turkey where climate zones have been defined with various methodologies. To better understand rainfall intensity patterns across Turkey, this study used the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm to define their spatial distribution. In the first stage, the annual maximum rainfall intensity records for periods ranging from 30 to 78 years were obtained from 95 stations operated by the Turkish State Meteorological Service, and the longitude, latitude and altitude data for the stations were compiled for cluster analysis. Secondly, all rainfall intensities and geographical values were normalized, and in the third stage. the FCM algorithm was applied. The comparison of annual maximum rainfall intensities revealed five clusters. Four clusters were identified as discrete zones and one was identified as a transitional zone. Weather stations located in different geographical regions sometimes fell into the same clusters. In other words, rainfall events of similar intensity can occur in different climatic zones. This study, which brought a different perspective to clustering studies, showed that rainfall intensity values can be successfully analyzed at a national scale with the FCM technique.

Assessment of two behavioural models (HBM and RANAS) for predicting health behaviours in response to environmental threats: Surface water flooding as a source of groundwater contamination and subsequent waterborne infection in the Republic of Ireland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Risk perception; Health; Groundwater contamination; Flooding; Extreme weather events	ESCHERICHIA-COLI VTEC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENTERIC DISEASE; INTERVENTIONS; DETERMINANTS; CONSUMPTION; MANAGEMENT; HOUSEHOLD; COUNTRIES; IMPACT	Extreme weather events (EWEs) are increasing in frequency, posing a greater risk of adverse human health effects. As such, developing sociological and psychological based interventions is paramount to empowering individuals and communities to actively protect their own health. Accordingly, this study compared the efficacy of two established social-cognitive models, namely the Health Beliefs Model (HBM) and Risks-Attitudes-Norms-Abilities-Self-regulation (RANAS) framework, in predicting health behaviours following EWEs. Surface water flooding was used as the exemplar EWE in the current study, due to the increasing incidence of these events in the Republic of Ireland over the past decade. Levels of prior experience with flooding were considered for analyses and comparative tools included a number of variables predicting health behaviours and intervention potential scores (i.e. measure of impact of targeting each model element). Results suggest that the RANAS model provides a robust foundation for designing interventions for any level of experience with an extreme weather event, however, use of the simpler HBM may be more cost-effective among participants unacquainted with an EWE and in relatively infrequent health threat scenarios. Results provide an evidence base for researchers and policymakers to appropriately engage with populations about such threats and successfully promote spatiotemporally appropriate health behaviours in a changing climate.

Conservation reliance of a threatened snake on rice agriculture	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Agroecology; California; Giant gartersnake; Mortality; Survival; Thamnophis gigas	GIANT GARTERSNAKES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATRIX-MAURA; CALIFORNIA; PESTICIDES; AMPHIBIANS; ABUNDANCE; TOXICITY; DECLINE	Conservation-reliant species require perpetual management by humans to persist. But do species that persist largely in human-dominated landscapes actually require conditions maintained by humans? Because most extant populations of giant gartersnakes (Thamnophis gigas) inhabit the highly modified rice agricultural regions of the Sacramento Valley, we sought to evaluate whether giant gartersnakes are indeed a conservation-reliant species dependent on maintenance of rice agriculture and its infrastructure for their continued existence. Specifically, we examined the extent to which giant gartersnakes use rice fields themselves, and whether survival of adult giant gartersnakes was influenced by the amount of rice grown near their home ranges and daily movements. We found that although giant gartersnakes only use rice fields minimally and then only between mid-June and early September, their survival was lower when less rice agriculture was available near the areas they inhabited. Survival was particularly low in early spring, when giant gartersnakes emerge from brumation but rice fields are not yet flooded. The incongruity between the phenology of rice growing and giant gartersnake foraging requirements suggests that although giant gartersnakes are reliant on the rice agroecosystem, rice agriculture is likely suboptimal habitat for giant gartersnakes. Giant gartersnakes' reliance on the rice agroecosystem challenges the notion of preservation-based conservation, but provides opportunities for win-win scenarios benefitting both rice farmers and giant gartersnakes. Our study highlights that in addition to land use, the timing of land management might be crucial for conservation-reliant species. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The relation between historical floods and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is also analyzed. Results indicate that in general, the reduction of precipitation, especially in the center of the basin with negative annual and seasonal trends in intensity indices, namely, the annual maximum 1-day precipitation amount (RX1day) and annual maximum 5-day precipitation amount (RX5day). Sixty-four percentage of the stations exhibit an increasing trend in September-October-November in the consecutive dry days. In December-January-February interval, positive trends in most of the stations is noted for total precipitation and for the number of wet days with rainfall greater than or equal to 1 mm. The findings also show that sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific is statistically correlated (r) with indices of extreme precipitation (r -0.40). However, the effect of ENSO is evident with a time lag of 2-3 months. These results are relevant for forecasting floods on a regional scale, since changes in SST of the equatorial Pacific may take place 2-3 months ahead of the basin inundation. Our results contribute to the understanding of extreme rainfall events, hydrological hazard forecasts and climate variability in the Colombian Andes.

From Mountain Ranges to Sweeping Plains, in Droughts and Flooding Rains; River Murray Water Quality over the Last Four Decades	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water chemistry; Murray-Darling basin; Millennium drought; Trend analysis; Climate change	BASIN PLAN CHALLENGES; DARLING BASIN; BLACKWATER; SYSTEM; BLOOMS	The aim of this paper was to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of water quality in a large arid/semi-arid river system (River Murray, Australia) using a long term (1978-2015) dataset collected from 24 monitoring sites. The water quality is highly variable, but on average electrical conductivity (EC), pH, turbidity, dissolved and total nutrient, colour and chlorophyll a levels increase with distance downstream from the headwaters to the lower reaches. This is a function of the natural accumulation of dissolved and particulate components and intermittent, mostly diffuse source, pollutant inputs. The Darling tributary inflow increases turbidity, total phosphorus and pH in the main River Murray channel. Based on long-term trend analysis at four representative sites, EC, nutrients and colour showed declining trends on average at most sites except in the headwaters. Increased flow increases concentrations of most quality parameters, although at very high flows decreases in pH, EC, turbidity and oxidized nitrogen were apparent at many sites. The extreme Millennium drought (2002-2009) period resulted in lowered concentrations of many water quality parameters, indicating retention in the landscape. In the post-drought flooding (2010-2012) period a large amount of organic material was mobilised, resulting in much higher peak colour concentrations than when mid-range flooding was more frequent. It is critical that this monitoring program is continued as a Basin-wide water management plan is implemented.

This study presented a numerical groundwater modeling of the Poyang Lake area to reveal the difference of the temporal variation patterns of the groundwater-lake water interchange and that of the groundwater-river water interchange, and to assess the potential effects of year-scale climate on the temporalspatial variability of water interchange and on the allocation pattern of the net groundwater discharges into rivers and lake. It is found that the monthly groundwater discharge into surface water exhibits significant temporal variability, which reveals an inverse correlation between monthly groundwater discharge and lake water levels and precipitation amounts. Rainy months can lead to groundwater recharge from the Poyang Lake. Our simulated results reveal that, in the dry year of 2018, the variable monthly groundwater discharge into Poyang Lake and the monthly groundwater recharge from Poyang Lake were 0.97-9.67 x 108 m3/month and 0.07-2.54 x 108 m3/month, respectively. Additionally, the annual water interchange amount between groundwater and the Poyang Lake was 9.44 x 108 m3/year, and the annual net groundwater discharge into Poyang Lake was 6.76 x 108 m3/year. However, the hydraulic interaction between groundwater and the five rivers only features groundwater discharge into rivers with variable monthly groundwater discharge into the five rivers of 0.20-0.72 x 108 m3/month and an annual total groundwater discharge amount of 5.32 x 108 m3/year in 2018. Additionally, our water interchange results of the rainy year of 2010 indicate that the annual water interchange amount between groundwater and the Poyang Lake was 22.74 x 108 m3/year, the annual net groundwater discharge into the Poyang Lake was 1.26 x 108 m3/year, and the annual groundwater discharge into the five rivers was 8.10 x 108 m3/year. These comparisons between the results of the rainy year of 2010 and dry year of 2018 can reveal the effects of the year-scale climate on water exchange between groundwater and surface water and imply that a rainy year can increase the total water interchange amount but decrease the total net groundwater discharge into surface water and that groundwater is more likely to discharge into rivers during a rainy year. Furthermore, it is found that a rainy year can significantly alter the spatial distribution of the water interchange between groundwater and lake water and that the backward particle tracking simulation could be helpful in regard to identifying the spatial distribution of water exchange between groundwater and regionalscale lake. These findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of climate effects on the spatial-temporal variability of water interchange between groundwater and surface water in regional floodplain lake areas and provide useful information for the evaluation of local water resources and the estimation of pollutant transportation.

Pluridisciplinary analysis and multi-archive reconstruction of paleofloods: Societal demand, challenges and progress	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Review						Paleoflood hydrology; Flood hazard; Natural archives; Documentary sources; Multi-archive reconstruction; Integration model	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; FLOOD FREQUENCY; EXTREME FLOODS; BERNESE ALPS; HOLOCENE; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY; HYDROLOGY; SWITZERLAND; HISTORY	Floods are one of the gravest natural hazards for societies, worsened by population growth, unchecked development, and climate change. From a Global Change perspective, past extreme events merit particular interest because they can be linked to wider climate and environmental changes, introduce perturbations. During the last decade, knowledge of long-term flood frequency and magnitude has been improved by extracting data from different types of archive. But, despite advances in dating methods, proxies and statistical techniques and efforts to identify atmospheric drivers, some fundamental questions remain unresolved. The Special Issue entitled "Pluridisciplinary analysis and multi-archive reconstruction of paleofloods" in the journal Global and Planetary Change addresses these uncertainties and complexities by assembling a selection of studies, which were first presented at the Past Climate Changes (PAGES) Open Scientific Meeting held at Zaragoza in 2017. In this introductory paper, the guest editors outline the 17 research contributions and meta-data from the 17 paleoflood studies were systematically analyzed in terms of i) geographical distribution; ii) methodologies applied; iii) types of archives; lii) numbers of flood series compiled and iv) spatial and temporal resolution of paleoflood data. The data indicate that paleoflood studies focused on fluvial depositional environments show a higher rate of integration with other types of paleoflood archive (mean of 4.5 types of archive) than studies focused on documentary sources (mean of 3.5) and lake sediments (mean of 2.4). We suggest that this strategy of archive integration has been adapted to effectively compensate for the higher uncertainties of fluvial deposition in floodplains. Statistical processing of the meta-data shows quantitative associations between specific types of flood archive and offers a solid platform for designing the optimal approach for multi-archive paleoflood research. A qualitative review and visual comparison of the 17 paleoflood series shows some consistent trends and breaks but also notable differences within and between regions. While a trend of increased flooding since 4-5 ka BP is evident, the lack of synchronicity between breaks and the coeval increases and decreases in fluvial activity is manifest. The majority of studies in the Special Issue do denote the 19th century - including the youngest cool climate pulses during the Little Ice Age - as a particularly flood-rich period. It is more difficult to assess the 20th century because of social changes, population growth and extensive river modification. Despite the mentioned uncertainties, 10 of 14 papers do not record the 20th century as an exceptional flood period. Assessing the effects of human impact on paleoflood calendars and disentangling anthropogenic from natural drivers are major challenges in integrated paleoflood analysis. It is concluded that the interpretation of flood series is complex as landscapes and flood drivers are heterogeneous and systems show different sensitivities to flood control and drivers. Thus, the study of past floods, from historical and natural archives, is challenging but also offers unparalleled opportunities to document low-frequency, large-magnitude flood events, which occurred under a broad range of climate and/or environmental scenarios, and, probably, the only way to reconstruct robust paleoflood series.

Floods and droughts can have devastating consequences on society, resulting in significant financial damage to the economy. Climate models suggest that precipitation and temperature changes will exacerbate future hydrological extremes (i.e., floods and droughts). Such events are likely to become more frequent and intense in the future; thus to develop adaptation plans climate model projections feed hydrological models to provide future water resource projections. 'eFLaG' is one set of future river flow projections produced for the UK driven by UKCP18 climate projections from the UK Met Office. The UKCP18-derived eFLaG dataset provides state-of-the-art projections for a single GCM driven by RCP 8.5 across the entire UK. A QE-ANOVA approach has been used to partition contributing sources of uncertainty for two flow quantiles (Q5 high flows and Q95 low flows), at near and far future time scales, for each of the 186 GB catchments in the eFLaG dataset. Results suggest a larger hydrological model uncertainty associated with low flows and greater regional climate model uncertainty for high flows which remains stationary between flow indicators. Total uncertainty increases from near to far future and highly uncertain catchments have been identified with a high concentration in South-East England.
