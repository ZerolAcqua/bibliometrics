With its wide range of hazards to human societies, climate change is posing serious threats to human survival and impacting every aspect of human life, including food production systems. It is, therefore, imperative to gauge the local knowledge, perceptions, and adaptation capacity for the effective mitigation of the ill impacts of climate change. In this backdrop, the present study has been designed to investigate the perceptions of farmers regarding causes and impacts of climate change on agriculture. Required data were collected from the Madinah region in Saudi Arabia and analyzed to answer the following study questions: How do farmers perceive impacts of climate change? What factors affect their perceived impacts of climate change? Additionally, what factors affect their perception about the causes of climate change? Individual logit models were used to assess the impacts of various factors on perceived causes and perceived impacts of climate change on agriculture. A multinomial logit model was also employed to figure out significant determinants of perceived causes of climate change on agriculture. Results indicated that the most dominant perceived impacts of climate change are its effects on crop production, followed by drying water sources. The results also revealed that the age of the farmers had a positive effect on their perception of natural processes being the cause of climate change. Similarly, farming experience had an inverse effect on their perceptions regarding causes of climate change. The majority of the farmers seemed clear about the possible drivers of climate change in the country. In particular, about 79 percent of the farmers believed that GHGs and pollution are causing climate change in the country. The findings provide useful insights into farmers' perceptions about causes and impacts of climate change and may be used by policymakers to strategically design extension and agricultural development initiatives for helping the farmers to implement sustainable agricultural practices to adapt to and lower the adverse impacts of climate change in the Kingdom.

J	Chang, CM; Ortega, O; Weidner, J				Chang, Carlos M.; Ortega, Oscar; Weidner, Jeffrey			Integrating the Risk of Climate Change into Transportation Asset Management to Support Bridge Network-Level Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Climate change; Transportation asset management (TAM); Bridge; Risk assessment		Climate change continues to cause frequent storms, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, and these events are affecting transport infrastructure assets around the world. Despite broad recognition that climate change is a significant threat to infrastructure, the traditional asset management process does not explicitly consider it. The upshot is that asset management decisions, at the current time, may not be helping to reduce the risk of climate change-related infrastructure failure. This paper describes a step-by-step framework to integrate the risk of infrastructure failure due to climate change into transportation asset management (TAM) practices. This framework incorporates methods for risk assessment, needs estimation, and climate change scenario analyses that one can apply to the management of infrastructure assets. The paper also presents an example to quantify the risk of climate change-related bridge failure. This example demonstrates the applicability of the framework to infrastructure management decision support at the network level.

The article employs survey data from the 2017 Special Eurobarometer 459 (87.1) and country-level statistical data on political contexts and climate-related hazards. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regressions were applied. The results of the research indicate that few macro level variables related to natural hazards can significantly explain climate change risk perceptions (like temperature increases or water deficit), and political contexts at the macro level do not significantly explain the variance in the levels of concern about climate change. However, individual level variables (education and political orientation) significantly mediate how natural hazards and political contexts influence climate change risk perception. People with higher education levels have higher concerns about climate change in countries that are more vulnerable to floods and droughts, and left-leaning voters in countries with higher democracy indices and better climate policies demonstrate higher levels of climate change risk perception. Scientific literacy is an important factor in shaping public opinions and concerns about climate change, particularly with regard to the complex understanding of natural factors of climate change; having a clear political orientation helps people to reflect on the national political contexts of climate change.

Here, we explore the potential that this inconsistency relates to the measurement of flooding experience in terms of individual versus local experience, and the subsumption of multiple distinct constructs within composite indicators of climate change engagement. Using national survey data from Norway, we show that individual and local flooding experiences differentially predict subjective attribution and climate change concern. People with individual flooding experience reported significantly greater climate change concern than those with local, or no, flooding experience. Subjective attribution of flooding to climate change did not differ significantly between people with individual versus local flooding experience, except among those with a right-wing political orientation where individual experience was associated with greater subjective attribution. Our findings highlight the need for careful operationalisation of flooding experience and climate change engagement in subsequent research.

As climate change adaptation gains increasing prominence in global environmental policies and development strategies, there is a tendency to conceptualize adaptation as a technical process, disconnected from the everyday reality of how adaptation is practised by people facing negative climate change impacts. We present evidence from a small-scale case study of a flood-prone informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to provide a contextually grounded contribution to a growing body of literature on gender, climate change and cities. We argue that the way climate change impacts are perceived, experienced and adapted to on an everyday level is characterized by gendered differences (among others). We demonstrate that a greater understanding of these gendered nuances highlights the disconnect between everyday gendered realities and a high-level technical notion of adaptation deployed at strategic and policy levels.

In this paper, we examine UK residents' expectations of future threats and opportunities associated with climate change impacts, along with willingness to prioritise different climate change impacts for investment. Using a national survey (n = 2007), we report on three main findings. First, UK residents tend to expect threats related to flooding and wet weather to be more likely and concerning than heat extremes or opportunities. Second, UK residents' expectations of climate change impacts do not align with expert assessments, especially showing lower estimates of heat-related threats as compared to experts. Third, willingness to allocate resources to potential climate change impacts tends to be more strongly associated with anticipated concern should they occur than climate change belief or the expected likelihood of them occurring. We discuss the implications of our findings for policies and communications about climate change adaptation in the UK and elsewhere.

They imply more frequent extreme weather events, which are responsible of sea level rise, coastal erosion, flooding, droughts, and desertification. Mitigation and adaptation represent intertwined strategies for counteracting climate changes. Mitigation is associated to the lessening of the causes of climate changes and includes actions reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation is a proactive concept addressing how humans can adapt and benefit from climate change. The mainstreaming and integration of adaptation to climate change into routine practice can be favored by Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of regional policies, plans and programmes. In this study, we aim at scrutinizing a set of SEA reports of regional plans and programmes adopted in Sardinia (Italy), to investigate if -and to what extent- adaptation to climate change has characterized planning and programming tools. Evidence shows that the integration of adaptation-driven issues into regional planning is still in its infancy but presents the signs of promising expansion.

Based on the theory of adaptive management, this paper selects Yuanping City from Shanxi Province, Qingyuan County from Liaoning Province, and Kulun Banner from Inner Mongolia as representative cases in agricultural, forestry, and pastoral areas, respectively, to carry out field research, and it uses 1970-2017 meteorological station data to apply vulnerability assessment and climate element change trend analysis, combined with the meteorological hazards data, and explore the adaptive management measures for agricultural, forestry, and pastoral areas in China. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the vulnerability of precipitation in Yuanping is high, the increase in temperature and drought and floods are the most important factors affecting crop yields in agricultural areas, and the key to climate change adaptive management lies in the awareness of farmers of climate change risks and the institutional guarantee of the government; (2) Qingyuan has high temperature vulnerability, and the forest areas have relatively strong adaptive capacity to climate change, but climate change will significantly affect the forest's carbon sequestration function, and the focus of climate change adaptive management in the forestry sector is on engineering and technology field practices; (3) Kulun has the highest vulnerability to climate change, the frequent meteorological disasters seriously impact livestock development, and climate change adaptive management in pastoral areas relies on the participation of pastoralists' local knowledge and also needs the support of the government and society.

Adaptation, exposure, and politics: Local extreme heat and global climate change risk perceptions in the phoenix metropolitan region, USA	CITIES			English	Article						Climate change; Extreme heat; Risk perceptions; Scale; Adaptive capacity; Phoenix; Arizona; USA	URBAN HEAT; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CHANGE BELIEFS; VULNERABILITY; ATTITUDES; JUSTICE; PLACE; HOT; GENTRIFICATION	Cities around the planet are facing climate change risks including (but not limited to) extreme heat, drought, wildfire, and flooding. Urbanites perceptions of the risks posed by climate change influence communities' mitigation and adaption responses, but there is limited literature on the perceptions of climate risks in cities. Urban climate change impacts are multi-scalar, but existing work isolates local versus global considerations. Adaptive capacity affects climate change impacts, yet scholarship on urban climate typically is not framed through an adaptive capacity lens. In this study, we explore how exposure to heat, place-based vs. social connections, and socio-demographics affect residents' perception that extreme heat (local extreme heat) or climate change (global climate change) seriously affects their household and way of life. Using a survey from metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona (USA), an area facing increased extreme heat and rapid climate change, this study shows that urbanites' perceptions of risks posed by extreme weather conditions and global climate change are mediated in part by the existing urban infrastructure and planning (e.g., access to urban green infrastructure) and magnified by exposure to heat, but also shaped by political ideology. We also find that place attachment and Latino or Hispanic ethnic background positively affect perceptions of local extreme heat, while high income negatively influences perceptions of global climate change impacts. Heat exposure positively, whereas green infrastructure negatively affects risk perceptions of both local extreme heat and global climate change. Risk perceptions are influenced by exposure and adaptive capacity. Identifying the drivers of risk perceptions across different local contexts is an essential step for generating in-situ climate adaptation strategies for cities.

Climate change impacts on peak river flows: Combining national-scale hydrological modelling and probabilistic projections	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Flooding; Hydrological modelling; Probabilistic projections; UKCP18	SCENARIO-NEUTRAL APPROACH; FLUVIAL FLOOD RISK; GREAT-BRITAIN; BOTTOM-UP; PART 2; SENSITIVITY; FREQUENCY; RAINFALL; DROUGHTS; RUNOFF	Potential future increases in flooding due to climate change need to be taken into consideration when designing flood defences or planning new infrastructure or housing developments. Existing guidance on climate change allowances in Great Britain was based on research that developed a sensitivity-based approach to estimating the impacts of climate change on flood peaks, which was applied with catchment-based hydrological models. Here, the sensitivity-based approach is applied with a national-scale grid-based hydrological model, producing modelled flood response surfaces for every river cell on a 1 km grid. This provides a nationally consistent assessment of the sensitivity of flood peaks across Britain to climatic changes. The flood response surfaces are then combined with the most recent climate change projections, UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18), to provide location-specific information on the potential range of impacts on floods across the country, for three flood return periods, three future time-slices and four emissions scenarios. An accompanying web-tool provides a convenient way to explore the large amount of data produced. Consideration is now being given to how to use the latest work to update guidance on climate change and flood peaks, including a workshop held to gather stakeholder views.	[Kay, A. L.; Rudd, A.

With the acceleration of climate change, climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases (VBDs) pose an increasing threat to public health. This paper summaries 10 publications on the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human health; then it synthesizes the other existing literature to more broadly explain how climate change drives the transmission and spread of VBDs through an ecological perspective. We highlight the multi-dimensional nature of climate change, its interaction with other factors, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transmission and spread of VBDs, specifically including: (1) the generally nonlinear relationship of local climate (temperature, precipitation and wind) and VBD transmission, with temperature especially exhibiting an n-shape relation; (2) the time-lagged effect of regional climate phenomena (the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation) on VBD transmission; (3) the u-shaped effect of extreme climate (heat waves, cold waves, floods, and droughts) on VBD spread; (4) how interactions between non-climatic (land use and human mobility) and climatic factors increase VBD transmission and spread; and (5) that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on climate change is debatable, and its impact on VBDs remains uncertain. By exploring the influence of climate change and non-climatic factors on VBD transmission and spread, this paper provides scientific understanding and guidance for their effective prevention and control.

It operates on a local scale and can project climate change-related river flood damage for various socioeconomic, climate and flood adaptation scenarios. Whereas other lAMs have relied on temperature as a climate change proxy, we show that precipitation is a key variable in projecting river flood damage. The way adaptation is accounted for in our flood damage functions has a large influence on the results, highlighting the relevance of modelling local level adaptation in lAMs. Results presented at different spatial scales demonstrate the relevance of river flood damage functions for estimating the economic impacts of climate change and allows for exploration of the spatial distribution of impacts through local estimates.

Pavements will be significantly affected by increased temperatures, precipitation, and flooding, and will require present design methodology to be modified accordingly. Several climate change adaptation strategies are easily available to agencies including upgraded asphalt binder grades, increased Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) thickness, modified mix gradations, and stabilized base. The objective of this study is to investigate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) for climate change adaptation strategies across various locations in Canada, from a Global Warming Potential (GWP) perspective. All analysis was completed leveraging the Athena Pavement LCA software and the LTPP database. The investigated scenarios were (i) a baseline asphalt pavement with no climate change, (ii) a baseline asphalt pavement with climate change, and (iii) an asphalt pavement adapted to withstand climate change, appropriate to the level of changes experienced by the specific location. The study revealed that although there are initial increases in both cost and emission to administer these adaptation strategies, they are offset over the life of the pavements. Increasing the HMA thickness and using stabilized bases were the most expensive and the highest emitting among the inves-tigated strategies, but they are only necessary for extreme coastal climate change regions including British Columbia and Newfoundland. British Columbia is expected to observe a near 30% increase in agency costs to effectively adapt their pavements to climate change. However, these initiatives were found to decrease the overall global warming potential by nearly 10% in comparison to not adapting. The other examined locations, although not returning as drastic of changes, followed similar trends. The conclusions find that climate change adaptation strategies are highly beneficial from the standpoint of both an LCA and LCCA for all of the investi-gated locations.

This deterioration reduces the resistance of RC bridges to natural hazards, including earthquakes and floods. This paper proposes an improved framework for time-dependent multi-hazard seismic vulnerability and risk assessment of a deteriorating RC bridge considering climate change. The framework addresses (a) the corrosion initiation and propagation processes affected by climate change, (b) time-dependent corrosion rate, (c) seismic fragility analysis of a deteriorating RC bridge using a three-dimensional finite-element model, and (d) the integration of deterioration due to corrosion, climate change, and earthquake and flood-induced scour hazards into time-dependent seismic vulnerability and risk assessment. This paper provides extensive comparisons to demonstrate the effects of corrosion propagation based on uniform and pitting corrosion models, climate change, intensity of ground motion of earthquakes, and flood-induced scour on seismic vulnerability and risk. For illustration, an existing multi-span RC girder bridge is investigated. The results show that pitting corrosion under climate change with flood-induced scour significantly increases the seismic vulnerability and risk of deteriorating RC bridges.

Currently, research is often done in isolation. Now, more than ever, the aggregation of Torres Strait research information is needed to address climate change. Information aggregation leads to informed agency. Informed agency leads to best possible climate change policies and actions. Information markets can facilitate informed agency and climate change project selection and valuation. We demonstrate the benefit of employing a particular information market approach to facilitate informing agents in a real world workshop setting. The workshop considers how best to address the Torres Strait climate change problem. Our a priori theoretical model motivates a specific hypothesis on the functional form of information uptake by agents (workshop participants). Analysis of collected data supports our hypothesis. The information market implies a valuation of climate change project information. It is estimated to be as valuable as a typical flood insurance premium.

Drawing upon a mixed-methods research approach, this paper explores the progress that has been made by the planning system in England in addressing the challenge of climate change adaptation in coastal urban areas. The results indicate that the adaptation produced through the planning system remains incremental rather than transformative. It is focused on experienced hazards, especially flooding, and there is a lack of attention being paid to wider impacts of climate change, such as rising average temperatures. Furthermore, it was found that the contemporary contribution of planning to climate change adaptation is seriously limited by the government's emphasis on housing and economic growth and by the development industry's emphasis on economic viability.

Moreover, climate change increases plant diseases and pests, the cost of agricultural production and risk in food security. This study aims to determine whether climate change is a phenomenon via the analysis of the perceptions of the farmers regarding this issue in the Mersin province conducted through 251 questionnaires. Farmers primarily perceive climate change through production costs and the reduction in yield. Moreover, they are highly aware of its relation to natural events such as floods, drought, and storms. Nevertheless, inappropriate agricultural practices too have led to the negative consequences caused by climate change. In this respect, this study has revealed that farmers with strong cooperative partnerships and experience perceived climate change significantly.

The nature, significance, and influence of perceived personal experience of climate change	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						climate change; global warming; human dimensions; personal experience; psychological significance	EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; CHANGE MITIGATION; RISK PERCEPTIONS; FLOODING EXPERIENCE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; PLACE ATTACHMENTS; LOCAL WEATHER; ADAPTATION; ATTRIBUTION	Following a previous 2014 review of perceived personal experience of climate change, the authors review relevant research published or reported between January 2014 and mid-year 2019. The review findings suggest that the nature, significance, and influence of perceived personal experience of natural environment changes, conditions, and events deemed to be likely consequences of global climate change have been problematically conceptualized, researched, reported, and understood by many climate change scientists and by reporters of climate change science and their audiences. The nature,psychologicalsignificance, andpsychologicaladaptation and issue engagement influence of personal experience of perceived environmental manifestations of climate change are arguably central considerations with respect to the human dimensions of climate change. These matters encompass public understanding of climate change science, both internal and external adaptation processes, and the psychological impacts of the ongoing stressor of climate change. They also affect issue engagement and behavioral change. It is increasingly necessary that existing issues with discipline-based assumptive worlds, constructs and measures-and often unclear research and policy questions and objectives-be identified, clarified, and addressed. This particularly matters when researchers and policy makers are addressing public risk perceptions, understandings, and responses to global climate change, ideally to inform and enhance policies directed at climate change mitigation and adaptation, or, alternatively framed, directed towards public issue engagement and 'psychologically significant' as well as 'environmentally significant' behavioral change.

This rising temperature also alters precipitation conditions and patterns, thereby causing frequent occurrences of extreme calamity, particularly droughts and floods. Much evidence has been documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, illustrating fluctuations in precipitation patterns caused by global climate change. Recent studies have also highlighted the adverse impact of climate change on river flow, groundwater recovery, and flora and fauna. The theoretical political approach and scientific progress have generated ample opportunities to employ previously allusive methods against impacts caused by varying climatic parameters. In this study, the current state of India's water environment policy is compared with that of South Korea. The 3Is-ideas, institutions, and interests-which are considered pillars in the international field of political science, are used as variables. The concept of ideas highlights the degree of awareness regarding climate change while formulating water environment policy. Here, the awareness of India's management regarding emerging water issues related to climate change are discussed and compared with that of South Korea. The concept of institutions illustrates the key differences in water environment policy under the umbrella of climate change between both countries within the associated national administrations. India's administrations, such as the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change; the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation; the Ministry of Rural Development; and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, are used as a case study in this work. Finally, the concept of interest elaborates the prioritization of key issues in the respective water environment policies. Common interests and voids in the policies of both countries are also briefly discussed. A comparison of India's water environment policies with that of South Korea is made to expose the gaps in India's policies with respect to climate change, thereby seeking to identify a solution and the optimal direction for the future of the water environment policy of India.

In this study, we first construct the transmission mechanism of "climate change-change in investor attention-financial stability " and analyze the impact of transition risks on Chinese financial market stability. Second, we construct a Climate Change Index (CCI). The CCI depicts changes in investors' attention to the transition risks of climate change based on the Baidu Index. We also use the dynamic factor model (DFM) to construct a Financial Stress Index (FSI) that describes the Chinese financial market stability. The FSI can also effectively identify financial events within the sample interval. We then use the TVP-VAR model to empirically analyze the impact of the transition risks of climate change on Chinese financial market stability. We present the following results: in the short and medium terms, more financial market pressure will be caused by an increase in the CCI. In the long run, the impact of an increase in CCI on Chinese financial market pressure is uncertain. Finally, we present valuable countermeasures and suggestions from the different perspectives of investors, financial institutions, and regulators.

Under these conditions, it is relevant to analyze investment decisions in a real options framework, as this approach takes into account the economic value associated with investment time flexibility. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature adopting a real option approach to analyze investment in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and examine how the uncertain impacts of climate change on the condition of the human environment, risk preferences, and strategic interactions among decisions-makers have been modeled. We found that the complex nature of uncertainties associated with climate change is typically only partially taken into account and that the analysis is usually limited to decisions taken by individual risk neutral profit maximizers. Our findings call for further research to fill the identified gaps.

Therefore, it is not only important to understand the impact of climate change but also necessary to formulate adaptation strategies to negate the effect of climate change. To this end, we have developed a hydrologic modeling framework (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) concomitant with Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to develop individual as well as composite climate vulnerability index in a Southern New Jersey Watershed. Three agricultural BMPs including cover crop, filter strip, and no till were examined to determine their ability to negate the climate change impact on water fluxes and water quality in the watershed. Downscaled projected temperature and precipitation from six General Circulation Models (GCMs) for moderate and high emission scenarios (RCP-4.5 and 8.5, respectively) from the latest suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were incorporated in to the hydrologic model. Overall, results suggested an increase in temperature and precipitation under climate change scenarios leading to rise in surface runoff, streamflow, sediment and TP load relative to baseline scenario. Highly vulnerable areas to flooding, sedimentation and eutrophication under climate change using AHP framework were standout from other types of vulnerable areas in the watershed due to presence of excess impervious surface, higher percentage of agricultural lands, and increased sediment and organic phosphorus, respectively. When agricultural BMPs were implemented in corn and soybean fields located inside critical source areas (CSAs) under climate change scenarios, BMPs showed little to no effect towards reduction of water fluxes while they reduced maximum 2% and 12% of sediment and TP, respectively, compared to no BMP under climate change scenario. Further, as the BMP were incorporated in all corn and soybean fields in the watershed, the maximum sediment and TP reduction increased to 8% and 44%, respectively. The study outcomes suggests that climate change will increase the water fluxes as well as pollution load in the watershed, however, BMPs can be used to negate the water quality impact due to climate change.

Global warming has also increased the frequency and severity of surgical disease, particularly for children, who bear an estimated 88% of the global burden of disease attributable to climate change. Health care delivery itself weighs heavily on the environment, accounting for nearly 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Within the health care sector, surgery and anesthesia are particularly carbon intensive. The surgical community must prioritize the intersection of climate change and pediatric surgery in order to address pediatric surgical disease on a global scale, while reducing the climate impact of surgical care delivery. This review defines the current state of climate change and its effects on pediatric surgical disease, discusses climate justice, and outlines actions to reduce the climate impact of surgical services.

However, at present, there is dearth of research examining the adaptation practices by the urban poor in African cities. Focusing on Ghana's capital, Accra, the purpose of this study is fourfold: (i) to explore climate change literacy among the urban poor and local planning institutions; (ii) to examine the urban poor's perceptions on climatic events in Accra; (iii) to analyze autonomous adaptation measures to climate change impacts; and (iv) to assess planned adaptation measures to climate change impacts. This paper uses household surveys, secondary data analysis and agency interviews in two informal communities - Nima and Chorkor - in Accra as case studies. Underpinned by the social exclusion theory, the results show limited climate literacy despite widespread experience of climate change impacts by the urban poor. Most adaptation measures were community driven and autonomous while the limited institutional responses were both planned and autonomous. However, both community and institutional planning responses were ad-hoc, reactionary and unsustainable. The paper recommends consideration of community-based selforganizing adaptation measures into city plans to ensure that autonomous measures are complemented with planned adaptation strategies. In addition to stakeholder participation, collaborations and partnerships in climate change adaptation, pro-poor adaptation measures - both autonomous and planned remain imperative as they can contribute to inclusive and just climate change policy.

Previous studies have used climate models to compare performance in terms of simulating observed climates or preserving model variability among scenarios. In this study, the Katsavounidis-Kuo-Zhang algorithm was applied to select representative climate change scenarios (RCCS) that preserve the variability among all climate change scenarios (CCS). The performance of multi-model ensemble of RCCS was evaluated for reference and future climates. It was found that RCCS was well suited for observations and multi model ensemble of all CCS. Using the RCCS under RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 8.5, the future extreme precipitation was projected. As a result, the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation increased towards the farther future. Especially, extreme precipitation (daily maximum precipitation of 20-year return-period) during 2070-2099, was projected to occur once every 8.3-year. The RCCS employed in this study is able to successfully represent the performance of all CCS, therefore, this approach can give opportunities managing water resources efficiently for assessment of climate change impacts.

A total of 2819 articles were quantitatively analysed, and these articles visualised the academic communities, key research topics, and knowledge body of existing research. The results indicate that the academic communities of urban resilience to climate change consist of influential authors from the main academic institutions in the USA, England, China, Australia, and the Netherlands. The key research topics of urban resilience to climate change show evolutionary trends during different research periods. Furthermore, existing research on urban resilience to climate change is supported by 20 classical references with higher co-citation frequency, and the knowledge structure of urban resilience to climate change is divided into four significant co-citation clusters. Finally, three future research directions are predicted for the field of urban resilience to climate change: the comprehensive analysis of urban resilience to climate change, climate change vulnerability in urban systems, and multi-hazard coupling impacts on urban resilience. This study provides a comprehensive knowledge map of urban resilience to climate change to guide future academic collaborations and urban management practices.

As a result, update of Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves considering climate change is essential for adaptation of water-related structures to climate change. The present work reviews the main challenges regarding the update of IDF curves considering climate change. A wide literature search was conducted in scientific databases. More than one hundred articles published between 2001 and 2021 have been reviewed and are summarized and discussed. The main aims of the present work were to: (i) identify the state-of-the-art scientific approaches regarding IDF curve update under climate change projections; (ii) assess whether or not these approaches incorporate uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty related to climate models, statistical downscaling techniques, temporal resolution of data, theoretical distribution selection etc.); and (iii) and to propose general guidelines for updating IDF curves based on climate projections. First, the motivation is presented that makes IDF curve renewal a global issue. Second, current practices are described and reviewed and the main impacts of climate change on short precipitation extremes around the world are shortly discussed. Finally, limitations and future research needs are discussed.

Therefore, this study aims to compare and analyze the degree of risk of climate change impact on areas with and without urban regeneration projects (for Eup, Myeon, and Dong regional units) in Busan, South Korea. In this study, (1) climate change risk indicators were extracted based on the concept of risk (hazard, vulnerability, and exposure), (2) a spatial analysis was performed using a graphic information system (GIS), and (3) the primary influencing factors were derived through a logistic regression analysis. The principal results show that urban regeneration areas have a higher risk of climate change impact than other areas. The results indicate that urban regeneration areas have a higher population density per area and more impermeable or flooded areas can increase the risk of climate change impacts. We also discuss strategies to develop resilient cities and climate change adaptation policies for future urban regeneration projects.

J	Gurbey, AP				Gurbey, A. P.			CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEMS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE AREAS: EASTERN THRACE VINEYARDS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; viticulture; Thrace Region; agricultural landscapes		Hurricanes, heat waves, torrential rain, flooding and other extremes of weather are being reported every year around the world. Each of these weather events is unusual, and are held in growing consensus as early indications of global climate change. It is now widely agreed that changes in land use, deforestation, and especially burning fossil fuels have already caused and will continue to cause substantial releases of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which directly affects global climate change. One of the largest contributors to this phenomenon is the agriculture sector, and, paradoxically, this sector is also one of the most affected by climate change. That is, because agriculture depends directly on predictable climate conditions, and suffers when environmental variables fluctuate unpredictably. The impacts of climate change on agriculture come about through changes in variability, seasonality, mean precipitation and water availability, as well as the emergence of new pathogens and diseases. The importance of understanding climate change impacts on agriculture is especially evident within viticulture. Direct or indirect effects of climate change in viticulture were monitored on vegetative and generative development, crop quality, yield, harvest time, irrigation, fertilisation, crop preservation and marketing. The climate not only influences the production of quality grapes, but it also affects the quality of the resulting products, including wine. In the scope of this study, a representative survey was done within Eastern Thrace Wine Producers, Turkey, to reveal the effects of climate change on wine grape production and the produced wines. The results were examined in order to present suggestions for future climate projections.	[Gurbey, A.

As one of China's most important agricultural production regions, the North China Plain (NCP) is subject to climate change. This paper examines the influence of climate change on the wheat and maize yields at household and village levels, using the multilevel model based on a large panel survey dataset in the NCP. The results show that: (i) Extreme weather events (drought and flood) would significantly reduce the wheat and maize yields. So, the governments should establish and improve the emergency service system of disaster warning and encourage farmers to mitigate the adverse effects of disasters. (ii) Over the past three decades, the NCP has experienced climate change that affects its grain production. Therefore, it is imperative to build the farmers' adaptive capacity to climate change. (iii) Spatial variations in crop yield are significantly influenced by the household characteristics and the heterogeneity of village economic conditions. Therefore, in addition to promoting household production, it is necessary to strengthen and promote China's development of the rural collective economy, especially the construction of rural irrigation and drainage infrastructures.

Rising temperatures, abnormal rainfall increases, storms, floods, and droughts have become more frequent and severe phenomena in Vietnam. This causes serious consequences for the livelihood security of the poor. Binh Chanh district (Ho Chi Minh City) is an area subject to severe risks of climate change in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam. Here, the low-income groups are the most vulnerable because their adaptive capacity is still limited and low. This study uses the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) to assess the level of vulnerability to climate change in households and communes in the Binh Chanh district. LVI includes three components: exposure (E), sensitivity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC) based on 23 indicators selected by reviewing the literature and consulting with experts. The article also conducted surveys with 931 households in 16 administrative communes in Binh Chanh for primary data. The research results showed that Tan Kien and An Phu Tay communes have the highest level of vulnerability since they are areas with mainly low-lying terrain and contiguous location rivers; the people in these towns are also vulnerable groups because they do not have a stable source of income, skills, and have low education and experience in climate change adaptation. The study also proposes some solutions to improve the capacity to adapt to climate change of vulnerable communes specifically: 1) creating diversified livelihoods with stable incomes; 2) deploying community-based climate change adaptation models for communes adjacent to rivers; 3) implementing adaptive agriculture and improving social capital for vulnerable households; 4) building resettlement areas for households heavily affected by disasters; and 5) raising awareness among low-income households to respond to natural hazards in the context of climate change.

As a promising alternative for stormwater management, the low impact development (LID) performance under the impact of climate change was analyzed in this study. The hydraulic and water quality models were integrated and the hydrological inputs were derived from downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections. Results demonstrated that the LID practices in the given areas mitigated runoff volume, peak flow, and non-point pollution by 45-80%, 39-60%, and 31-82%, respectively. Scenario analysis showed that the LID hydraulic performance declined under all three future climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5), while the LID water quality performance fluctuated among different climate patterns. Uncertainty analysis suggested that the climate change caused wide-range uncertainties on LID performance, the uncertainty of LID water quality performance was larger than that of LID hydraulic performance. Spatial analysis indicated that the LID performance was spatially heterogeneous under climate change, and the heterogeneity was related to the land cover distribution of the given area. In addition, sensitivity analysis suggested that the impact of climate change on the short-term performance of LID practices was stronger than that on the long-term performance. Accordingly, the methods and findings provided herein could assist sustainable urban water management by investigating the LID performance under climate change.

It exemplifies the assessment of urban vulnerability to climate change by an integrated approach. The results indicate that Beijing is highly exposed to multiple climate threats in the context of global climate change, specifically urban heat waves, urban drainage floods and drought. Vulnerabilities to the climatic threats of heat waves, drainage floods and droughts have increased by 5%-15% during the period of 2008-2016 in Beijing. High vulnerabilities to both heat waves and drainage floods have been observed in the urban downtown area and high vulnerability to droughts have been observed in the outskirts. This vulnerability assessment, which addressed climatic threats, provides a holistic understanding of the susceptibility to climate change that could facilitate adaptation to climate change in the future. The developments of threats like flooding, heat waves and droughts are analyzed separately for 16 districts and an integrated vulnerability index for all of Beijing is provided as well.

Here we present the results of a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature reporting the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The review used the 'Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative' database (comprising 1682 publications related to climate change adaptation responses) that was constructed through systematic literature searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar (2013-2020). For this study, further screening was performed to identify studies from LMICs reporting the effects on human health of climate change adaptation responses. Studies were categorised by study design and data were extracted on geographic region, population under investigation, type of adaptation response and reported health effects. The review identified 99 studies (1117 reported outcomes), reporting evidence from 66 LMICs. Only two studies were ex ante formal evaluations of climate change adaptation responses. Papers reported adaptation responses related to flooding, rainfall, drought and extreme heat, predominantly through behaviour change, and infrastructural and technological improvements. Reported (direct and intermediate) health outcomes included reduction in infectious disease incidence, improved access to water/sanitation and improved food security. All-cause mortality was rarely reported, and no papers were identified reporting on maternal and child health. Reported maladaptations were predominantly related to widening of inequalities and unforeseen co-harms. Reporting and publication-bias seems likely with only 3.5% of all 1117 health outcomes reported to be negative. Our review identified some evidence that climate change adaptation responses may have benefits for human health but the overall paucity of evidence is concerning and represents a major missed opportunity for learning. There is an urgent need for greater focus on the funding, design, evaluation and standardised reporting of the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses to enable evidence-based policy action.

Advancing Gerontological Nursing Science in Climate Change	RESEARCH IN GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING			English	Editorial Material							PARTICULATE MATTER; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; AIR-POLLUTION; OLDER; HEALTH; DEMENTIA; EXPOSURE; CO2	Older adults have unique health risks related to climate change. This commentary addresses the health impacts of climate change for older adults, identifies gaps in gerontological nursing research, and highlights areas for research to address the significant gap in nursing science. Climate risks of extreme weather events, such as heat, rain, flooding, and wildfires, as well as poor air quality, vector-borne diseases, interruptions of services, and treatment plans all place older adults at risk of experiencing greater morbidity and early mortality. Despite these risks, there is a gap in nursing research related to climate change and aging. Nurse scientists can address this gap with an interdisciplinary approach. There are climate resources and theoretical frameworks to support scientific inquiry. Funding sources must be made available to assure rigorous scholarship of climate-related health impacts for older adults. Gerontological nurse researchers must build capacity to address climate change and health.

With the climate changing, the frequency and intensity of flood and drought are likely to increase. Thus, the impact of reservoirs on runoff under climate change needs to be studied to cope with future floods and drought. In this study, the Nierji Reservoir located on the Nenjiang River Basin was chosen to explore the impact. The Nenjiany River Basin is the vital water source in the water resources transfer project in Northeast China. Climate change in Nenjiang River Basin was analyzed using the 1980 to 2013 climate observations. The results show that the temperature of the basin significantly (p < 0.05) increased while the precipitation significantly (p < 0.05) decreased. Based on the result, nine kinds of different climate scenarios were set up. For different climate scenarios, the Hydroinformatic Modeling System (HIMS) model and the HIMS model with the reservoir calculation module were used to simulate runoff during the no reservoir operation period (1980-2000) and reservoir operation period (2007-2013), respectively. The impact of reservoirs on runoff under climate change is studied. Results show that the Nierji Reservoir can effectively relieve the impact of climate change on downstream runoff. When temperature increases or precipitation decreases, there are larger differences in runoff over the non-flood period, especially during periods of no reservoir operation. Reservoir operation under climate change can provide reliability in drought protection.

J	Nag, R				Nag, Rajat			A methodological framework for ranking communicable and non-communicable diseases due to climate change-A focus on Ireland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Risk assessment; Ranking hazards; DALY; Communicable diseases; Non-communicable diseases; Climate change		There is currently a significant global focus from the public health community on addressing climate-related public health issues. Globally we are witnessing geological shifts, extreme weather events, and the associated incidents that may have a significant human health impact. These include unseasonable weather, heavy rainfall, global sea -level rise and flooding, droughts, tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires. Climate change can have a direct and indirect health impact. The global challenge of climate change requires global preparedness for potential human health effects due to climate change, including vigilance for diseases carried by vectors, foodborne and waterborne diseases, deteri-orated air quality, heat stress, mental health, and potential disasters. Therefore, it is essential to identify and prioritise the consequences of climate change to become future-ready. This proposed methodological framework aimed to de-velop an innovative modelling method using the 'Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)', to rank potential direct and indirect human health impacts (communicable and non-communicable diseases) of climate change. This approach aims to ensure food safety, including water, in the wake of climate change. The novelty of the research will come from developing models with spatial mapping (Geographic Information System or GIS), which will also consider the influence of climatic variables, geographical differences in exposure and vulnerability and regulatory control on feed/food quality and abundance, range, growth, and survival of selected microorganisms. In addition, the outcome will identify and assess emerging modelling techniques and computational-efficient tools to overcome current limita-tions in climate change research on human health and food safety and to understand uncertainty propagation using the Monte Carlo simulation method for future climate change scenarios. It is envisaged that this research work will con-tribute significantly to developing a lasting network and critical mass on a national scale. It will also provide a template to implement from a core centre of excellence in other jurisdictions.

The effects of natural disasters on public perceptions of climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Public beliefs; Natural disasters	TROPICAL CYCLONES; FLOOD RISK; DROUGHT; IMPACT; AVAILABILITY; FREQUENCY	The frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods are predicted to change as greenhouse gas concentrations increase. These disasters may represent sources of information for individuals as they update their beliefs related to climate change. Using a dataset that includes climate beliefs of respondents, we examine the effect of natural disasters on climate change beliefs and find that hurricanes significantly increase the probability that survey respondents from a given county believe that climate change is occurring and that it is human caused. We find that past experience with certain types of natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes) impacts beliefs regarding whether climate change is occurring and if it is human caused. The research contributes to the literature evaluating climate change attitudes by using spatially disaggregate information on climate change beliefs and exposure to a set of natural disasters over time. Characterizing beliefs and attitudes toward climate change and related policies is important since these beliefs are a determinant of individual adaptation and support for policies related to reducing carbon emissions.

This is the primary way many individuals experience climate change, which has led researchers to investigate the influence of personal experience on climate change concern and action. However, existing evidence is still limited and in some cases contradictory. At the same time, behavioral decision research has highlighted the importance of pre-existing values and beliefs in shaping how individuals experience changes in environmental conditions. This is in line with theories of motivated reasoning, which suggest that people interpret and process information in a biased manner to maintain their prior beliefs. Yet, the evidence for directional motivated reasoning in the context of climate change beliefs has recently been questioned. In the current paper, we critically review the literature on the interrelationships between personal experience of local weather anomalies, extreme weather events and climate change beliefs. Overall, our review shows that there is some evidence that local warming can generate climate change concern, but the capacity for personal experience to promote action may rely upon the experience first being attributed to climate change. Rare extreme weather events will likely have limited impact on judgments and decisions unless they have occurred recently. However, even recent events may have limited impact among individuals who hold strong pre-existing beliefs rejecting the reality of climate change. We identify limitations of existing research and suggest directions for future work.

Climate change will exacerbate the existing threats to vulnerable communities, such as the poor, and threaten the food security of populations in coastal areas through the effects of flooding due to coastal inundation. Indonesia is an Archipelagic State of over 17,000 islands and is vulnerable to climate change impacts in its coastal areas and especially in its highly populated low lying delta areas, such as Jakarta and Semarang, where vulnerability to sea level rise is evident. The adequacy of the legal adaptation framework in Indonesia to respond to this climate vulnerability is assessed and it is found to have limited consideration of the community burden arising from these climate and SLR uncertainties. A more inclusive social justice approach could assist government to respond to the impacts from these issues and to their implications for vulnerable groups. The nation can improve adaptive legal measures to address climate change impacts and increase the involvement of local people in climate change adaptation decision making. Funding is required to assist policy makers to further incorporate adaptation into decision making, and this could improve social justice outcomes for vulnerable Indonesian coastal communities.

A particular focus is placed on the human security risks associated with the three elements. Recent Findings Climate change has been perceived as a "threat multiplier," directly aggravating human security risks, such as food and water insecurity, as well as indirectly contributing to (violent) conflict in regions vulnerable to climate change. In addition to climate change-related environmental risks, such as droughts and floods, land and land use can be affected by climate mitigation and adaptation measures. These include, for instance, large-scale renewable energy plants and relocation efforts. Summary It is not only important for decision-makers to take climate change impacts into account but also to assess the indirect risks associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. For further research, it is hence promising to explore how conflict-sensitive approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation can be developed.

Inaction on Climate Change Projected to Reduce European Life Expectancy	POPULATION RESEARCH AND POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						Climate change; Life expectancy; Mortality; Europe	HUMAN HEALTH; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; GLOBAL BURDEN; 187 COUNTRIES; MORTALITY; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; DISEASE; SEX; AGE	Climate change-related excess mortality estimates clearly demonstrate a dramatic impact on public health and human mortality. However, life expectancy at birth is more easily communicated and understood by the public. By properly situating climate change mortality within the contexts of life expectancy, we better represent the cost of climate change on longevity. In this paper, we convert excess mortality estimates due to increases in extreme weather from climate change (heat waves, cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal floods, and windstorms) into potential reductions in life expectancy at birth in thirty-one European countries. We project climate change extremes to reduce life expectancy at birth by 0.24 years for the average European country with differences in excess of 1.0 years in some countries by 2100. We only estimate the impact of mortality directly related to climate extremes, making our estimates conservative. Thus, the cost of inaction on climate change could approach, and likely to exceed, one year of life in some European countries.

Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Vary With Climatic Stress: Evidence From Three Regions of Vietnam	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; maximum likelihood method; multivariate probit; rice; Vietnam; climatic stress	FARMERS ADAPTATION; RIVER DELTA; FUTURE; VULNERABILITY; SIMULATION; MODELS; RISK	Vietnam faces several adverse climatic stresses such as increases in temperature, drought, flooding, saltwater intrusion, and sea-level rise. Past research on climate change adaptation in Vietnam has highlighted that climatic stresses and challenges faced by populations vary across the country. In this study, we are interested to know if autonomous responses also vary, depending on which stress individuals are responding to. To answer this question, we use primary-collected data of 1,306 individuals from the Mekong River Delta, Central Vietnam, and the Red River Delta. Adaptation choices of these individuals are analyzed at two levels: the household-level and the agricultural-level. We estimate multivariate probit models by Geweke-Hajivassilou-Keane (GHK) simulated maximum likelihood methods. Our results show that climate change adaptations vary depending on which stresses individuals are responding to. At the household level, droughts and floods have the strongest effect on climate change adaptation. However, adaptations at the agricultural level depend more on the impacts of the stress and less so on the climatic strss itself. Understanding what climatic stresses are already eliciting a response, and what adaptations are being used by individuals, is invaluable for designing successful climate change policies. This understanding can also help policymakers identify where gaps exist in individual climate change adaptations and fill these gaps with a public response.

Unplanned and unsustainable poor urban storm water management strategies will aggravate the impact and frequency of flood occurrence. In this study, impacts of urbanization and climate change on generated flood magnitude are analyzed using the urban hydrological model of Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and Low Impact Development (LID) sustainable land use optimization techniques. Three rainfall distribution patterns (TS1, TS2 and TS3) in combination with rainfall duration periods of 10, 30 and 60 min and a pessimistic climate change scenario of RCP 4.5 compared to RCP 8.5 are used for the analysis purpose for selected infiltration and storage LID techniques (Bio-Retention Cell, Infiltration Trench and Rain Barrel). The study results showed that combined LID techniques have a significant impact on urban flood reduction of up to 75%. This significant amount of flood reduction is greater than the amount of excess flood magnitude which occurred as a result of climate change using the most pessimistic climate change scenario. The study results also confirmed that rainfall patterns have a significant impact on peak discharge for shorter rainfall durations. This study highly recommends using cost effective, easy and environmental adaptive and sustainable LID techniques for urban flood management in addition to existing drainage structures.

Apart from efforts to achieve a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases so as to mitigate the problem, there is a perceived need for adaptation initiatives urgently. Ecosystems are known to play an important role in climate change adaptation processes, since some of the services they provide, may reduce the impacts of extreme events and disturbance, such as wildfires, floods, and droughts. This role is especially important in regions vulnerable to climate change such as the African continent, whose adaptation capacity is limited by many geographic and socio-economic constraints. In Africa, interventions aimed at enhancing ecosystem services may play a key role in supporting climate change adaptation efforts. In order to shed some light on this aspect, this paper reviews the role of ecosystems services and investigates how they are being influenced by climate change in Africa. It contains a set of case studies from a sample of African countries, which serve the purpose to demonstrate the damages incurred, and how such damages disrupt ecosystem services. Based on the data gathered, some measures which may assist in fostering the cause of ecosystems services are listed, so as to cater for a better protection of some of the endangered Africa ecosystems, and the services they provide.

Previous studies provided inconclusive results on the relationship between climate change perceptions and adaptation behavior. Using a longitudinal approach, we examined whether risk perception, self-efficacy, and outcome efficacy play a role in how and when climate change perceptions are associated with adaptation to pluvial flooding and heat stress in the Netherlands. As expected, stronger climate change perceptions were associated with stronger perceptions of climate-related risks, which in turn lead to stronger intentions to implement adaptation measures. Yet, neither climate change perceptions nor risk perception were associated with whether people had actually implemented adaptation measures during a 1-year period. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, higher levels of perceived self-efficacy and outcome efficacy did not strengthen the relations between climate change perceptions and adaptation intentions and behavior. Rather, higher levels of self-efficacy and outcome efficacy were directly related to stronger intentions to take adaptive measures and taking those measures within a period of 1 year. Exploratory analyses offered initial support for a sequential model where climate change perceptions lead to higher levels of perceptions of specific climate-related risks, which in turn lead to stronger self-efficacy and outcome efficacy, ultimately increasing adaptation intentions, but not actual behavior. Strategies to promote adaptation behavior could aim to remove behavioral barriers to increase self-efficacy, and strengthen outcome efficacy, enabling people to act on their climate change perceptions.

Local perceptions and knowledge of climate change are also generally viewed as crucial for sustainable adaptation planning in developing countries. Yet the extent to which perceptions of climate change are influenced by the context of informal urbanisation in the Global South remains unexamined. This paper aimed to examine the extent to which the context of residents of informal settlements influences their perceptions and the congruence of these perceptions with scientific knowledge of climate change in an African city. Using Accra, Ghana as a case, 582 household surveys, 25 institutional key informant interviews and 14 focus group discussions were conducted and analysed. Results show two main findings: (1) respondents mainly perceived changes in climate change related-phenomena which were in synergy with scientific sources but their claims of increases in flooding were not supported by scientific data; and (2) while the literacy levels of the respondents were unrelated to their perception about climate change, heir perceptions were also discordant with city authorities' perceptions on the causes of flooding as a hazard. The study suggests the integration of local perceptions and knowledge of climate change in adaptation planning in Accra and similar contexts.

As, this country is extremely vulnerable to climate change phenomena. For an agriculture-dependent country like Pakistan, exploration of timely climate change adaptation strategies is immediately required. Taking the base of this important issue we investigate the factors affecting farm household adaptation to climatic change and constraints to adapt strategies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. For the purpose, the multinomial logit model has used to categories the farmer's choice adaptation strategies to climate change. Results of the study present that the number of adaptation practices has a positive association with education, family size, marital status, cultivated farm size, credit, extension service, relatives in Government, farmer to farmer extension, temperature, precipitation, insurance, information on climate and floods. Additionally, the age of the household, non-farm income, and distance to the market had a negative effect on adaptations to climate. Furthermore, results identify that respondents of the climate change adaptation practices faced some main barriers and limitations. These include lack of money, lack of information, and lack of Government support. The outcome of the study provides incited information for policymakers who are tackling the vulnerability of climate change.

J	Bitire, BB				Bisare Bitire, Bilate			Appraisal of climate change mitigation and adaptation regulatory frameworks in Ethiopia and their congruency with the UN climate change convention	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ethiopia; Climate change; Mitigation; Adaptation; UN climate convention; Regulatory frameworks		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to critically investigate the Ethiopia's climate change adaptation and mitigation regulatory frameworks and their congruency with the guiding principles under the United Nations (UN) Climate Convention, to show the alignment of the regulatory frameworks with the UN Climate Change rules. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall distribution, recurrent droughts and floods require robust climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and effective implementation in the country. Design/methodology/approach Through the doctrinal legal research method, the author has used a detailed analysis of primary sources, both national and international legislative enactments. Besides, the research has benefitted from secondary sources like research reports, online publications, scientific journals, international reports, books and journal articles. Findings The findings reveal that in Ethiopia, there is no national climate change-specific policy and legislation. Although there are scattered sectoral climate-related policies and strategies, they are not consistent with the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Originality/value This study argues that having comprehensive specific climate change policy and legislative frameworks consistent with UNFCCC guiding principles could help to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change in the country.

SuDS as a climate change adaptation strategy: Scenario-based analysis for an urban catchment in northern Italy	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Climate change; Rainfall extremes; Urban flooding; Sustainable drainage systems SuDS; Storm water management model; Climate change adaptation	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; DRAINAGE SYSTEMS; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; SUBSTRATE; RAINFALL; DESIGN; FLOOD	Urbanization and climate change effects on precipitation are the leading cause of flood risk increase in urban settlements. Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) are effective strategies to improve city resilience toward flooding but usually they are designed to meet performance standards based on historical climate settings. The reported modeling scenario-analysis strives for investigating the potential of SuDS as adaptation strategy to a projected medium-term climate change affecting Sesto Ulteriano (Milan, Northern Italy). Two drainage models, a benchmark scenario reproducing the drainage network current configuration and a designed scenario involving SuDS retrofitting, were tested under historical (observed) and expected future precipitation extremes (projected) to assess and compare hydrological and hydraulic variables essential for the definition of a Precipitation Variability Adaptation Index (PVAI), which measures the adaptation strategy performance. Results indicate that even though SuDS were confirmed as effective flood control measures, their adaptability potential is affected by changes in rainfall severity indeed. In particular, the multi-variable PVAI, a global index able to take into account the effects of different determinants for an overall assessment of SuDS potential as adaptation strategies to climate changes, decreases when rainfall frequency decreases, among the same climate scenario, or when rainfall intensity increases due to climate changes.

J	Cianconi, P; Betrò, S; Janiri, L				Cianconi, Paolo; Betro, Sophia; Janiri, Luigi			The Impact of Climate Change on Mental Health: A Systematic Descriptive Review	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						climate change; mental health; resilience; migration; vulnerability; climatic and economic turmoil; extreme events	INCREASE SUICIDE RATES; PHYSICAL HEALTH; STRESS-DISORDER; UNITED-STATES; HEAT WAVES; SEA-LEVEL; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; EXPOSURE; CONSEQUENCES	Background Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time. The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects, as well as on vulnerable societies, are a concern for the entire scientific community. Rising temperatures, heat waves, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fires, loss of forest, and glaciers, along with disappearance of rivers and desertification, can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental. However, there is a clear lack in psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change. Methods Literature available on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library until end of June 2019 were reviewed. The total number of articles and association reports was 445. From these, 163 were selected. We looked for the association between classical psychiatric disorders such as anxiety schizophrenia, mood disorder and depression, suicide, aggressive behaviors, despair for the loss of usual landscape, and phenomena related to climate change and extreme weather. Review of literature was then divided into specific areas: the course of change in mental health, temperature, water, air pollution, drought, as well as the exposure of certain groups and critical psychological adaptations. Results Climate change has an impact on a large part of the population, in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health. However, the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect. Lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue. It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing. The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly-some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions. Moreover, climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions, as well as a lack of access to resources, information, and protection. Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms, coined only recently: ecoanxiety, ecoguilt, ecopsychology, ecological grief, solastalgia, biospheric concern, etc. Conclusions The effects of climate change can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term. Acute events can act through mechanisms similar to that of traumatic stress, leading to well-understood psychopathological patterns. In addition, the consequences of exposure to extreme or prolonged weather-related events can also be delayed, encompassing disorders such as posttraumatic stress, or even transmitted to later generations.

Understanding public perceptions of climate change and its risks is the key to any mitigation and adaptation initiatives. Previous works discussed the influence of experiencing climate-related disasters, as well as the role of environmental sensitivity, but also acknowledged important regional variations, gaps and uncertainties. This work focuses on examining the relationship between personal disaster experience, risk perceptions of climate change and ideology with respect to the environment using the New Ecological Paradigm. The study exploits the results of a questionnaire survey in Greece, a characteristic example of the multihazard region of the Eastern Mediterranean. Results show that both direct disaster experience and a person's views on the causes of recent disasters in the country are connected with environmental sensitivity and climate change risk perception in a positive way. Both factors are also correlated with views on the effects of climate change. The findings are in agreement with research outcomes in other areas of the world, showing the importance of disaster experience and the views on extreme events in influencing perceptions of climate change. The work contributes to the growing literature on risk perception of climate change and the role of natural hazards, by adding a new piece in the knowledge puzzle in the climate-sensitive and relatively data-poor region of the Eastern Mediterranean.

This particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.

J	Mngumi, LE				Mngumi, Lazaro Eliyah			Ecosystem services potential for climate change resilience in peri-urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						Climate change; Urban landscape; Sustainable development; Policy; Planning and management	DAR-ES-SALAAM; LAND-USE; CHANGE ADAPTATION; SOUTH-AFRICA; SETTLEMENTS; ENVIRONMENTS; MANAGEMENT; FORESTS; CITIES; AGRICULTURE	Ecosystem services provide considerable development opportunities, including incorporating land use planning and enhancing climate change resilience in peri-urban communities. However, the application of this concept in planning and enhancing climate change resilience is negligible in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This article reviews state-of-the-art research on the potential contribution of peri-urban ecosystem services to climate change resilience in SSA and identifies research gaps for further work. This study was conducted through systematic review of articles from the Web of Science. The literature shows limited knowledge on peri-urban ecosystem services research globally and SSA in particular. The gaps in this knowledge stem from inadequate conceptualization and lack of understanding about how such knowledge can be translated into policy, planning and management and, hence, realizing development goals. In nutshell, the potential for climate change resilience of well-managed peri-urban ecosystem services includes reducing the physical exposure of peri-urban areas to floods and droughts and minimizing climate change risks through increased socio-economic resilience to hazard impacts and provision of the carbon sequestration function. However, specific peri-urban studies describing ecosystem service types and how they can be synchronized into mainstream urban planning and climate change resilience strategies are lacking in most SSA urban regions/landscapes. Therefore, case studies need to be conducted to contextualize and downscale the concept in peri-urban areas and to determine how the concept can be synchronized into broad urban planning and strategies for enhancing resilience to climate change in vulnerable urban and peri-urban communities.

RETRACTED: Life in riverine islands in Bangladesh: Local adaptation strategies of climate vulnerable riverine island dwellers for livelihood resilience (Retracted article. See vol. 121, 2022)	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article; Retracted Publication						Climate change; Vulnerability; Disaster management; Resilience; Sandbar	PERCEPTIONS; REGION; PEOPLE; FLOODS	Adaptation is a key tool to reduce the climate change vulnerability of rural people whose livelihood is dependent on agriculture. An appropriate policy and strategy cannot be effective without a proper understanding of peoples' climate change perception. This study intends to explore the local adaptation strategies of the riverine island (char) dwellers in the face of climate change hazards through a survey of 374 char dwellers living in the flood and riverbank erosion prone geographically isolated areas in Bangladesh. The study reveals almost no difference between the perception of char dwellers and the observed data on climate change. It further reports that the climate impacts make the char households a vulnerable community and minimize their livelihood resilience. A number of local adaptation strategies are adapted by char dwellers in the face of climate change effects which enhance their livelihood resilience. The study further reveals that homestead gardening, changing cropping pattern, tree plantation and migration are the most common strategies adapted by char dwellers. The study suggests that continuous development program and riverine island-based disaster management projects should be executed through an effective monitoring for enhancing char dweller's livelihood resilience.

Researchers could come to conflicting conclusions about what variables are important in predicting people's perceptions of risk if they do not differentiate between perceptions of personal and general risk. In this study, we used data from a survey of residents in a Midwestern region of the United States to examine the relationship between two measures of knowledge and perceptions of the risk of climate change at personal and the global (i.e. general) levels. Knowledge of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change significantly predicted perceptions of both types of risks, but was more strongly related to greater risk perceptions at the global level. Knowledge of climate change's impact on regional flooding predicted greater climate change risk perception, and we did not find a difference in its association with risk perception at the global versus the personal level. Understanding how different types of knowledge influence peoples' perception of climate change risks can foster a better understanding of related decision-making processes and used to support more strategic public education and communication on climate change.

However, green infrastructure projects are often distributed inequitably based on race and class. Residents' perspectives are necessary to develop and enact effective and equitable 'green' strategies to address climate change and its health impacts. This study reports findings from interviews and ethnographic observations with diverse residents of Detroit, Michigan, USA, who have experience with both green infrastructure projects and intense weather events (flooding). Residents expressed widespread support for green infrastructure solutions, while also sharing concerns about unintended health consequences from unsatisfactory governance of green spaces and climate change itself. Residents also held differing perspectives regarding their responsibility for, and capacity to enact, these solutions compared to businesses, city government, and nonprofit organizations. These findings illuminate key factors that city governments and partnering institutions should incorporate into planning processes with residents to achieve greater environmental justice through green infrastructure strategies to mitigate climate change and related health impacts.

Social inequalities in climate change-attributed impacts of Hurricane Harvey	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; FLOOD RISK	Climate change is already increasing the severity of extreme weather events such as with rainfall during hurricanes. But little research to date investigates if, and to what extent, there are social inequalities in climate change-attributed extreme weather event impacts. Here, we use climate change attribution science paired with hydrological flood models to estimate climate change-attributed flood depths and damages during Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. Using detailed land-parcel and census tract socio-economic data, we then describe the socio-spatial characteristics associated with these climate change-induced impacts. We show that 30 to 50% of the flooded properties would not have flooded without climate change. Climate change-attributed impacts were particularly felt in Latina/x/o neighborhoods, and especially so in Latina/x/o neighborhoods that were low-income and among those located outside of FEMA's 100-year floodplain. Our focus is thus on climate justice challenges that not only concern future climate change-induced risks, but are already affecting vulnerable populations disproportionately now. New study shows that up to 50% of properties flooded after hurricane Harvey flooded because of climate change, with low-income and Latina/x/o neighborhoods experiencing higher climate change-attributed impacts.

The Dodola town has previously experienced rainfall-induced flooding effects, and future floods may be more frequent and severe due to possible variations in rainfall intensity due to climate change. In this study, the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are updated for the design of urban stormwater drainage infrastructures under climate change to reduce flooding risks. To assess the variations in the rainfall intensity, the future IDF curves for the periods (2020-2100) and two GCMs (CanESM2 and HadGEM2-ES) were derived and compared to the current IDF curves. It was found that rainfall intensities for future climate conditions will differ from the current period for all durations and return periods. The comparison results show that the relative change between future rainfall intensities and historic rainfall ranges from 1.5 to 30.6%, 2.48 to 42.6%, and 3.7 to 23.24% for 2020-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, respectively. The IDF relationships revealed that as a result of climate change, urban flooding will increase in the future. This study will help to better understand the impacts of climate change on rainfall IDF relationships, as well as have implications for the design of current and future stormwater management systems in Dodola, Ethiopia.

This research compares the public's responses to extreme disasters and climate change when governments intervene to mitigate long-term climate change impacts. To do so we examine the property market behaviour in response to beach erosion and cyclone damage in Queensland, Australia. The results show that the impact on the property market of the public's response to the negative impact of cyclones is more marked than its response to the negative impact of beach erosion. The relative non-responsiveness to beach erosion can be seen as a product of both local government intervention strategies and the recreational and aesthetic attractions of beaches. This study, therefore, provides useful insights for the development of sustainable coastal development strategies.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues.

J	Fang, SC				Fang, Shyang-Chyuan			THE PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE	JOURNAL OF BALTIC SCIENCE EDUCATION			English	Article						climate change; knowledge levels; partial least square; place attachment; pro-environmental behavior	UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; RISK PERCEPTIONS; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL NORMS; KNOWLEDGE; CONSUMPTION; SUSTAINABILITY; INCENTIVES; COMMITMENT; CONFIDENCE	As the impact of climate change is increasingly intense, environmental educators of higher education would like to know the influencing factors for college students to proceed financial strategies, such as flood insurance or energy taxes, to adapt climate change; however, the sustainable environmental education provided by most colleagues still lags far behind the pace of business and government. The research is aimed at eight colleagues in Taiwan and is an undergraduate student taking courses in general environmental education. As diverse courses integrate climate change issues, distributed 1,000 questionnaires were proportionally allocated to each university according to the number of students who had taken the course; a total of 866 questionnaires were recovered. The pro-environmental behavior model be validated, and assess the correlations among risk perception, economic incentives, intrinsic motivation, sacrifice for the environment, place attachment, cheerful emotion, and social norm with partial least squares regression. For college students with high or medium knowledge on climate change, this research demonstrated that if pro-environmental behaviors bring cheerful feeling, they will induce their intrinsic motivation; meanwhile, because of environmental sacrifice and social norms, pro-environmental behaviors will trigger cheerful feeling.

The nature and extent of climatic aberrations, perceived impact, and adaptation strategies by the farmers reduce the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate 2160 IFS farmers about their perceptions of climate change, barriers, and the likelihood of adapting to the negative impacts of climate change. The study observed an increasing rainfall trend for humid (4.18 mm/year) and semi-arid (0.35 mm/year) regions, while a decreasing trend was observed in sub-humid (-2.02 mm/year) and arid (-0.20 mm/year) regions over the last 38 years. The annual rise in temperature trends observed in different ACZs varied between 0.011-0.014 degrees C. Nearly 79% of IFS farmers perceived an increase in temperature, decreasing rainfall, variability in the onset of monsoon, heavy terminal rains, mid-season dry spells, and frequent floods due to climate change. The arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid farmers' adapted several measures in different components with an adaption index of 50.2%, 66.6%, 83.3%, and 91.6%, respectively. The majority of the IFS farmers perceived constraints in adopting measures to climate change, such as meta barriers, capacity barriers, and water barriers. Therefore, we infer that educated farmers involved in diversified and profitable farms with small to medium landholdings are concerned more about climate change in undertaking adaptive strategies to reduce the environmental impact of climate change.

J	Khazaei, MR; Heidari, M; Shahid, S; Hasirchian, M				Khazaei, Mohammad Reza; Heidari, Meisam; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Hasirchian, Mehraveh			Consideration of climate change impacts on a hydropower scheme in Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							WEATHER GENERATORS; UNCERTAINTY; CONSEQUENCES; CALIBRATION; CATCHMENT; FLOODS; SYSTEM	Climate change is likely to significantly affect hydropower generation in the future. It is important to assess the impacts of climate change on hydropower plants for their optimal and cost-effective design. This article proposes a modeling framework for assessing climate change impacts on a potential hydropower plant in Iran. A modified version of the LARS-WG model (M-LARS-WG) was used for downscaling the simulations of two global climate models, CanESM2 and HadGEM2, for three emission scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, and generating 50 sets of daily weather variables, each covering a 30-year period for the historical period and each future scenario. The generated data was introduced into a calibrated HBV hydrological model to simulate the daily streamflow series of the basin. Finally, the Modified Standard Operating Policy (MSOP) model was employed to simulate reservoir water level and power plant productions under climate change scenarios. The rank-sum test showed the similarity in the average of M-LARS-WG simulated and observed variables in each month at 5% significance. The HBV model estimated the observed streamflow with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.83 during validation. The output of the modeling framework revealed the changes in annual streamflow ranging from a decrease of 35% to an increase of 90% during 2035-2064 compared to the historical period for different climate change scenarios. This would change the hydropower generation between - 25 and + 2% compared to the historical period. The study indicates the importance of considering climate change impacts on hydropower plant design.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Adaptation; Climate change; Psychological distance; Flooding; Risk perception; Droughts	PLACE ATTACHMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; RISK PERCEPTIONS; FLOOD RISK; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; TIME PERSPECTIVE; HEALTH; WILLINGNESS; EXPERIENCE; BELIEFS	As humanity faces the increasingly intense effects of climate change, it seems crucial that individuals adapt to this environmental issue. The means of assessing climate change and its impact are linked to the manner of adapting to the situation. It is pertinent to take place attachment into account in order to understand how an individual assesses and adapts to their environment. As the effects of climate change are various, different risky situations should be studied. Thus, this study aims to establish the relations between psychological distance regarding climate change, risk perception, place attachment and adaptation, when humans are exposed to the effects of climate change (flooding, droughts). 626 inhabitants of Santa Marta (Colombia), of whom 317 are rather exposed to flooding and 309 to droughts, participated in this research. The results show that low psychological distance relative to climate change is linked to higher risk perception and to adaptive behavior. Furthermore, place attachment can explain how an individual assesses their environment and adapts to it. These relations are direct or indirect, according to the risk under consideration. These various elements lead us to discuss the importance of considering the specificities of the environment in which individuals live and the pertinence of making climate change concrete in the eyes of the populations that are concerned.

Although everyone is vulnerable to some health impacts associated with climate change, children are disproportionately affected because of their developing bodies. Climate changes that include extreme heat, flooding, rising sea levels, wildfires, and increasing carbon dioxide levels are associated with a wide range of health issues in children such as asthma, allergies, vector-borne diseases, neurodevelopmental issues, and depression. Nurse practitioners play a critical role in translating scientific findings into their clinical practices to promote and protect children's health through interventions that include anticipatory guidance.

The increase in temperatures has affected sea levels, polar masses and extreme events, among others. There are many scientific studies that analyze the impacts of climate change on coastal communities, but most of them focus on beach erosion and coastal recession. Scientific literature on the effects of climate change on ports and harbors and their adaptation is much less abundant. Ports are essential for the economy and society of their cities, so studying the impact of climate change on them is an urgent need. The Mediterranean and the Spanish Mediterranean coast is one of the areas that will be most affected by climate change in the future. In addition, the Spanish economy depends a lot on its tourism and, thus, on its coastal cities. Therefore, the study of the impact of climate change on Spanish ports and coastal communities is essential. This article presents a review of the studies carried out until now on the effects of climate change on Spanish ports, and it identifies research gaps and weaknesses and suggests new research lines.

J	Watanabe, T				Watanabe, Tsugihiro			SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENVISAGED CLIMATE CHANGES IN LIGHT OF THE ICID VISION 2030	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE			English	Article						climate change; agricultural water management; UN-SDGs; ICID Vision 2030; activity plan		Climate change brings about changes of precipitation pattern, and consequently management of flood and drought risk and water resources becomes an urgent subject. Changes in local hydrological regimes affect the available water resources, which require modification of agricultural water management (AWM). These changes inevitably influence food production, poverty conditions and social stability. On the other hand, to mitigate climate change, the energy used for water use should be reduced. With this context, AWM is drawn into the climate change issue. The International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) released its Vision 2030, for better and wiser AWM aimed at a society free of poverty and hunger. In this paper, the challenges of climate change issues for the ICID community are reviewed as the current subjects of AWM in the light of ICID Vision 2030 and the Action Plan for it. In its processes, the complexity of the climate change issue and the uncertainty of impact assessment and future projection are confirmed. Even with these constraints, immediate actions are needed, and with increasing available information, society should formulate a system for the co-design or co-production of stakeholders at different levels against the changing climate.

Proactive planning for climate change requires anticipating potential climate change impacts to green infrastructure and adjusting management strategies accordingly. We apply climate change projections for the Midwest US state of Indiana to assess the possible impacts of climate change on common forms of urban green infrastructure and identify management implications. Projected changes in Indiana's temperature and precipitation could pose numerous management challenges for urban green infrastructure, including water stress, pests, weeds, disease, invasive species, flooding, frost risk, and timing of maintenance. Meeting these challenges will involve managing for key characteristics of resilient systems (e.g., biodiversity, redundancy) as well as more specific strategies addressing particular climate changes (e.g., shifting species compositions, building soil water holding capacity). Climate change also presents opportunities to promote urban green infrastructure. Unlike human built infrastructure, green infrastructure is conducive to grassroots stewardship and governance, relieving climate change-related strains on municipal budgets. Resources for adapting urban green infrastructure to climate change are already being applied to the management of urban green infrastructure, and emerging research will enhance understanding of best management practices.

This research analyses the case of El Colli, a community with high levels of marginalization and urban poverty in an area characterized by informal settlements in the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (state of Jalisco, Mexico). The main objective was to analyse the vulnerability to climate change in El Colli, focusing on the flood risk it is exposed to and using a mixed-methods design with various research tools. The findings show the specific aspects of vulnerability in a context of urban poverty, in which basic municipal services are scarce, government action is inadequate and residents show a high acceptance of risk. Based on the data, we state the need to incorporate local urban challenges into the debate on climate change, particularly those affecting informal settlements.

However, traditional hydrological approaches often fail to analyse the multiple characteristics of runoff within a bivariate framework under climate change. This study explores the influence of future climate change (2031 - 2080) on the runoff volume series in spring, summer and autumn as well as their dependence structures in the Luanhe River Basin, China. The results indicate that the time-varying dependence structure between spring and summer runoff series, as well as that between the summer and autumn runoff series, are mainly related to the summer precipitation. The differences between copula models with constant dependence parameters and those with time-varying dependence parameters are presented under different cases. This study incorporates the impacts of climate change on the bivariate frequency analysis of seasonal runoff series, which may provide important guidance for water resource management under climate change.

Due to the complexity of runoff generation and the streamflow process, the historical impact of human-induced climate change on river flooding remains uncertain. Here, we address the question of whether anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability of the extreme river flood events for the period 1951-2010 based on simulated river discharge derived from large ensemble climate experiments with and without human-induced climate change. The results indicate that human-induced climate change altered the probabilities of 20 of the 52 analyzed flood events. Fourteen of these 20 flood events, which occurred mainly in Asia and South America, were very likely to have been enhanced by human-induced climate change due to an increase in heavy precipitation. Conversely, two flood events in North/South America and two flood events in Asia and two flood events in Europe were suppressed by human-induced climate change, perhaps as a result of lower snowfall. Human-induced climate change has enhanced flooding more prominently in recent years, providing important insights into potential adaptation strategies for river flooding.

J	Ly, S; Sayama, T; Try, S				Ly, Steven; Sayama, Takahiro; Try, Sophal			Integrated impact assessment of climate change and hydropower operation on streamflow and inundation in the lower Mekong Basin	PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Hydropower; Lower Mekong Basin; River discharge; RRI model	WATER INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; TONLE-SAP LAKE; HYDROLOGICAL ALTERATIONS; RIVER; FLOW; RUNOFF; DAMS; REGIMES	Water resources are key to economic development of the Mekong River Basin, but are threatened by climate change and affected by hydropower development. Knowledge of these drivers' integrated impact on future hydrological alterations is limited, especially with respect to flood inundation in the lower basin. This study assesses streamflow and flood extent alterations by reservoir operations and climate change using the latest climate projections. A distributed hydrologic model is used to generate discharge and flood extent. Our findings indicate substantial changes in seasonal and annual peak discharge due to reservoir operations. Under the future hydropower scenario, the discharge at Kratie will change by + 28% ( - 10%) during the dry (wet) season. While the effects of hydropower operations vary by season, climate change tends to increase river discharge overall. Under the high-emission scenario, the wet seasonal flow at Kratie will increase by + 7% in the near-future (2026-2050), but change by -5% under integrated impact of climate change and reservoir operations. In the far-future, the wet seasonal flow at Kratie under climate change only (integrated impact) will increase by + 33% (+ 19%). Although climate change is the dominant driver of flow alterations, hydropower development is critical for reducing discharge and flood magnitude. Nonparametric statistical testing shows significant changes in the inundated area by up to + 37% during the projected periods.

State governments are critical in deploying local resources to help address climate change impacts. This policy study analyzes states' climate adaptation plans to assess the methods through which they address the impact of climate change on older adults.Research Design and Methods This study uses content analysis to analyze available climate change adaptation plans for all U.S. states for strategies designed to increase the resilience of older adults to the impacts of climate change.Results A total of 19 states have climate adaptation plans, of which 18 describe older adults as a population group with specific health impacts and risk factors. There are 4 categories of adaptation strategies for older adults that includes communications, transportation, housing, and emergency services. State plans vary in terms of the risk factors and adaptation strategies included.Discussion and Implications To varying degrees, states' climate change adaptation planning addresses health, social, and economic risks specific to older adults, as well as strategies for mitigating those risks. As global warming continues, collaborations between public and private sectors and across regions will be needed to prevent negative outcomes such as forced relocation and other social and economic disruptions as well as disparate morbidity and mortality.

J	Ahn, JM; Kim, J; Kim, H; Kim, K				Ahn, Jung Min; Kim, Jungwook; Kim, Hongtae; Kim, Kyunghyun			Watershed environmental impact assessment for extreme climates based on shared socioeconomic pathway climate change scenarios	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Shared socioeconomic pathways; Standardized precipitation index; Event mean concentration; Distributed RUnoff model; GEFC; Non -point pollution	QUALITY; DROUGHT; INDEX	Abnormal climate phenomena that exceed conventional weather observations occur worldwide, such as severe floods, droughts, and environmental issues, and have attracted increasing attention. To avoid indiscriminate industrialization and achieve sustainable development, environmental experts have presented various opinions based on climate change scenario data. In this study, shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) climate change scenarios that consider socioeconomic conditions were used to assess the environmental impact of extreme climate conditions on watersheds. Using the UK Earth System Modelling (UKESM1) SSP scenarios, we analyzed the following: 1) Heat index for each SSP climate change scenario using the H-Index; 2) extreme climate for each SSP climate change scenario using the standardized precipitation index (SPI); 3) the impact of extreme climate on non-point pollution using event mean concentration (EMC); and 4) the environmental flow caused by extreme climate by combining the K-water Distributed RUnoff Model (K-DRUM) and global environmental flow calculator (GEFC) models. According to the heat index analysis regarding SSPs climate change scenarios, the heatwave index will continue to rise if high carbon emissions persist. Temperature serves as an important indicator that has the most meaningful impact on ecosystems. The SPI analysis showed an increase in "extremely dry" conditions, and overall, more severe droughts are likely to occur due to high carbon emission-induced climate change. The nonpoint source pollution is also higher in climate change scenarios with high carbon emissions. The extreme drought event assessment using SPI and environmental flow revealed a shift from the "moist conditions" category to grade C. Our assessments in this study conclusively indicate that drought frequency will increase along with nonpoint source pollution. Furthermore, environmental flows will shift to grade C, resulting in the disappearance of some sensitive ecological species and an increase in invasive species. These analyses determined that high carbon emission-induced climate change caused leads to severe droughts and significant alterations in the overall water circulation, thereby complicating water resource management. Furthermore, we identified watersheds that are highly vulnerable to climate change and designated these as "mid-watersheds" that first require non-point pollution management. Here, the aquatic ecosystem environment can be affected by climate change without any artificial environmental influence. Various research-based analysis methods based on modeling have been presented using SSP climate change scenarios, and are highly beneficial for establishing policies and coping strategies for environmental preservation and sustainable development.

The Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) was used as an urban hydrology model to formulate the low-impact development (LID) controls on runoff for flood mitigation. We used ensemble projections provided by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) for the climate change assessment. The results for future periods (2038-2069) show an increase in mean annual runoff from 40% to 70%. The LID mitigation strategies were compared based on the rain barrel, the rain garden, and a combination of the two approaches to evaluate the potential reduction in urban flooding. It is recommended that LID practices should be used synergistically with improved drainage facilities for successful stormwater management. This analysis will help stakeholders to develop strategies to minimize the socio-economic impacts due to urban flooding.

Therefore, new methodologies for hydrological dam safety assessment considering climate change are required. This study presents a methodology that considers the impact of climate change on both inflow hydrographs and initial reservoir water levels. Moreover, the uncertainty in the procedure is assessed. The methodology is applied to the Eugui Dam in the River Arga catchment (Spain). An ensemble of 12 climate models is used. The results show an increase in the maximum reservoir water level during flood events and in the overtopping probability in the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5 scenario), especially in the 2071-2100 time window. The proposed methodology can be useful to assess future hydrological dam safety, fulfilling the requirements of recent regulations to consider the impact of climate change on dams.

Based on the daily records from 16 meteorological stations and 7 gauging stations in the Poyang Lake Basin from 1960 to 2015, the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff variations under different timescales (annual, flood season, and non-flood season) were explored using the Mann-Kendall, Moving-T test, and a linear regression model. The results showed that on annual timescale, climate change accounted for 91.88% of the increased runoff depth. However, intensive human activities in the subbasins would have reduced the runoff depth in the Poyang Lake Basin. The impact of climate change on the variation of runoff depth increased during the flood season. Climate change and human activities contributed similar to 57% and similar to 42%, respectively. Both climate change and human activities could increase the runoff depth during the non-flood season.

More than 60 million people across the United States live within 3 miles of a Superfund site. Disentangling multifaceted environmental health problems compounded by climate change requires a multidisciplinary systems approach to inform better strategies to prevent or reduce exposures and protect human health. The purpose of this minireview is to present the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program (SRP) as a useful model of how this systems approach can help overcome the challenges of climate change while providing flexibility to pivot to additional needs as they arise. It also highlights broad-ranging SRP-funded research and tools that can be used to promote health and resilience to climate change in diverse contexts.

However, aquaculture has raised a range of environmental concerns, and further increases in aquaculture production will face widespread environmental challenges. The effects of climate change will pose a further threat to global aquaculture production. Aquaculture is often at risk from a combination of climatic variables, including cyclone, drought, flood, global warming, ocean acidification, rainfall variation, salinity, and sea level rise. For aquaculture growth to be sustainable its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. Adaptation to climate change is also needed to produce more fish without environmental impacts. Some adaptation strategies including integrated aquaculture, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), and the expansion of seafood farming could increase aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability, and climate change adaptability.

Whether and how societies adapt, adjust, change, or transform because of climate change and related risks, is a currently debated topic. This question demands revisiting and comprehensively addressing existing theoretical foundations of transformations in risk management strategies and in risk governance to find effective ways to deal with climate change effects and their social consequences. Hence, the paper discusses current developments in transformation research and exemplifies this discussion with four interdisciplinary cases, which the co-authors reported in previous publications. Findings from Austria include a governance change within flood risk management related to zonation. Relocation in Indonesia and Kiribati showcases its cultural, behavioural as well as economic implications. Water scarcity in South Africa underlines the importance of behavioural change to enable the structural storage of rainwater. This paper analyses aspects of adjustment or transformation in these four examples. This may inform risk managers, decision-makers, practitioners, and planners dealing with natural hazards related to climate change how to conceptualise their (re-)actions.

Mycorrhizal Symbiosis for Better Adaptation of Trees to Abiotic Stress Caused by Climate Change in Temperate and Boreal Forests	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Review						mycorrhizal symbioses; trees; climate change; environmental abiotic stress; high temperature; drought; salinity; flooding	PLANT SALT-TOLERANCE; ROOT WATER TRANSPORT; ARBUSCULAR-MYCORRHIZAL; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL COMMUNITY; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; FLOODING TOLERANCE; TRIFOLIATE ORANGE; FUNGI; SEEDLINGS	Global climate changes have serious consequences on natural ecosystems and cause diverse environmental abiotic stressors that negatively affect plant growth and development. Trees are dependent on their symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi, as the hyphal network significantly improves the uptake of water and essential mineral nutrients by colonized roots. A number of recent studies has enhanced our knowledge on the functions of mycorrhizal associations between fungi and plant roots. Moreover, a series of timely studies have investigated the impact and benefit of root symbioses on the adaptation of plants to climate change-associated stressors. Trees in temperate and boreal forests are increasingly exposed to adverse environmental conditions, thus affecting their durable growth. In this mini-review, we focus our attention on the role mycorrhizal symbioses play in attenuating abiotic stressors imposed on trees facing climatic changes, such as high temperatures, drought, salinity, and flooding.

Forecasts and simulations of climate runoff processes are essential for assessing the impact of global climate change on runoff variations. This study focuses on the upper Taohe River Basin, which is an important watershed in the semi-arid regions of northwest China. To assess the runoff in the upper Taohe River Basin and the responses to climate change, the SWAT hydrological model was used to analyze future climate change scenarios and their effects on water resources. The results indicate that the minimum temperature would increase gradually in the 21st century and that the minimum temperature change would be more significant than the maximum temperature change, which indicates that minimum temperature changes would make an obvious contribution to future regional warming. Under RCP2.6, the average precipitation would decrease; at the same time, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the average precipitation would increase.

J	Rüttenauer, T				Ruttenauer, Tobias			More talk, no action? The link between exposure to extreme weather events, climate change belief and pro-environmental behaviour	EUROPEAN SOCIETIES			English	Article; Early Access						Climate change; climate change belief; climate change mitigation; pro-environmental behaviour; extreme weather events; floods; heatwaves; individual panel data	CHANGE MITIGATION; RISK PERCEPTION; LOW-COST; EXPERIENCE; ADAPTATION; METAANALYSES; DETERMINANTS; WILLINGNESS; ATTITUDES; ACTIVISM	Previous research has shown a link between extreme weather events and people's beliefs about climate change and their pro-environmental behaviour. This indicates that people may become more environmentally friendly amid increasing extreme weather events. Still, the influence of experiencing extreme weather events on actual behaviour has rarely been tested with large-scale individual-level data and longitudinal methods. This study links panel data from 35,678 individuals to floods across England and heatwaves across the UK and applies within-person estimators to account for pre-existing differences between affected and unaffected individuals. Results reveal that individuals are more likely to believe in climate change after being affected by a geographically proximate flood or a temporally proximate heatwave. This association is stronger among initially right-leaning partisans and those initially more sceptic about the existence of climate change, thereby indicating attitudinal updating due to experiential learning. However, those exposed to extreme weather events do not change their environmental behaviour such as energy saving, sustainable shopping or mode of transportation. Even among those who are more likely to believe in climate change, people's behaviour does not react to extreme weather events.

A scoping review of the literature was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies related to climate change and health education in schools and to examine their content focus and evaluation. The search covered five electronic databases and considered English peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to May 2022. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, representing various countries and employing different study designs. Climate change and health adaptation content dominated the included studies with varying foci, including heatwaves, disaster preparation, flood education, vector-borne diseases, and general climate change and health adaptation. Other studies utilized climate change and health topics to develop skills, employ the use of information and communication technologies within curricula, and highlight the interconnectedness between the environment and health. Although heterogenous in their methodology, the intervention studies and evaluations included (five out of nine) found that interventions impacted knowledge, awareness or perception. Two studies also highlighted the intergenerational learning potential of the interventions. While there is a growing body of research in the field, more research is necessary to measure their effectiveness and thereby develop suitable educational strategies.

J	Hasan, MK; Kumar, L				Hasan, Md Kamrul; Kumar, Lalit			Comparison between meteorological data and farmer perceptions of climate change and vulnerability in relation to adaptation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Perception; Climate change; Vulnerability; Farming adaptation; Coastal farmer; Bangladesh	SMART AGRICULTURE; RISK PERCEPTION; VARIABILITY; STRATEGIES; SECURITY; WATER; HOUSEHOLDS; RESPONSES; SALINITY; BEHAVIOR	How farmers perceive climate change has an influence on how they adapt to climate change. Climate change perception and vulnerability were assessed based on the household survey information collected from randomly selected 118 farmers of Kalapara subdistrict in Bangladesh. This paper identified the socio-economic covariates of climate change perception and vulnerability in relation to agricultural adaptation. It was also determined whether their perception was consistent with meteorological information. Findings revealed that the farmers had a moderate level of perception of and vulnerability to climate change. An overwhelming majority (98%) of the respondents perceived a wanner summer and 96% of them observed a colder winter compared to the past. Among the fanners, 91% believed that rainfall had increased and 97% thought that the timing of rainfall had changed. The belief of increase in soil salinity and associated loss was prevailing among 98 and 99% of them, respectively. Observed climate data were mostly aligned with the fanners' perception with respect to temperature, rainfall, floods, droughts and salinity. Positive correlations were found among the perception of climate change, the perception of vulnerability and the number of adopted adaptation practices. Farmers' level of understanding of climate change, vulnerability and adaptation practices could be improved by involving them in different organizations, such as climate field school and farmer associations. It could accelerate the dissemination of agricultural adaptation practices among them to cope with adverse agricultural impacts of climate change.

To study the climate risks associated with rapid urbanization in the global context of climate change, the vulnerability degree of urban agglomeration is constructed by the Grey Model (GM (1, 1)). Based on the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) data sets SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, drought, heat wave, and flood hazards under different emission scenarios are calculated. The vulnerability degree of the urban agglomeration and the climate change hazard were input into the climate change risk assessment model to evaluate future climate change risk. The analysis results show regional differences, with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration having good urban resilience, the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration having slightly higher overall risk, and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration having the highest relative risk overall. On the whole, the higher the emission intensity is, the greater the risk of climate change to each urban agglomeration under different emission scenarios.

However, climate change also has significant implications for hurricane climatology. While the effect of climate change on hurricane frequency is inconclusive, there is a general consensus among climate scientists that hurricane intensity will increase over the coming decades. A number of studies indicate that hurricane size and translation speed may intensify with climate change as well. Each of these properties influences storm surge generation and propagation, and thus has significant implications for the coastal flood hazard, particularly in the densely populated northeast region of the U.S. As coastal populations grow, increasing the resilience of the built environment will become an increasingly necessary priority. Local, detailed, and comprehensive flood hazard assessment is a central aspect of such efforts. In this work, we integrate global climate data, statistical-deterministic hurricane modeling, physics-based numerical storm surge modeling, and extreme value analysis methods to comprehensively assess the present day and end of century flood hazard due to hurricanes for several coastal communities along the U.S. North Atlantic coastline. We find that by the end of the century, annual exceedance probabilities of the 100-year flood may increase by factors as great as 7 due to sea level rise, and on average projected changes to tropical cyclone climatology cause these probabilities to double. For truly effective long-term resilience efforts, coastal engineers, planners, and other stakeholders must account for climate change impacts to both sea level and tropical storm climatology.

It has repeatedly been argued that proximising climate change through extreme weather events holds a promising strategy to increase engagement with the issue and encourage climate change action. In this paper, we exploit geo-referenced panel data on climate change attitudes as well as natural variation in flood and heatwave exposure in England and Wales to estimate the causal effect of extreme weather events on climate change attitudes and environmental behaviours using a difference-in-differences matching approach. Our findings suggest that personal experience with both flooding and heatwaves significantly increases risk perception towards climate change impacts but has no effect on climate change concern or pro-environmental behaviour, on average. Moreover, the findings indicate that the effect of flooding on risk perception is highly localised and diminishes at greater distances. For heatwaves, we find that the effect on risk perception is driven by the recent salient summer heatwaves of 2018 and 2019. Having experienced both events also significantly increases climate change concern and pro-environmental behaviour, in addition to risk perception.

Direct and Indirect Effects of Climate Change in Coastal Wetlands: Will Climate Change Influence Wetlands by Affecting Plant Invasion?

We assessed the direct and indirect effects of flooding, salinity, and introduced species on wetland communities across a salinity gradient by analyzing existing monitoring data from over 390 Coastwide Reference and Monitoring Sites (CRMS) using path analysis. As expected, we found that introduced species cover and richness was highest in fresh marshes and decreased across the salinity gradient. In fresh marshes, introduced cover and salinity separately negatively affected native cover and richness, but there were no indirect effects. In intermediate marshes, introduced cover and salinity reduced native cover and richness, and indirect effects were weakly positive because salinity negatively affected introduced cover. In brackish and saline marshes increasing salinity and flooding reduced native cover and richness. Our results suggest that climate change will negatively affect all wetland plant communities, and invasion will negatively affect fresher wetlands; however, climate change will not exacerbate invasions in wetlands and could reduce introduced species effects.

Future projections predict that the average global temperature will rise by 2.0 to 6.4 degrees C and the increase in sea level will be 59 cm by the end of 21st century. The unprecedented rise in temperature has led to an increase in the incidence of heat waves, droughts, floods, and irregular patterns of precipitation. These changes have a dramatic impact on prevailing agricultural cropping systems, productivity, and food security of people regionally and globally. The change in climatic parameters have substantial effects on weeds, diseases, insect, and pests in different ways, and can result in an increase of their geographical distribution, number of generations, and survival during winter. Thus, to sustain the crop production on the eve of climate change is the main challenge. Therefore, adaptation measures are prerequisites to reduce the effects of climatic changes on production of agricultural crops. In this review, a brief insight has been given in the impact of climate change on agriculture and, the future challenges of climate change on the production of crops. In addition, integrated approaches, or recent developments for the improvement of crops such as breeding, transgenic approaches to biotechnology, and functional genomics, agronomic practices, cultivation of climate resilient crops, and nanotechnology for abiotic stress such as drought stress, temperature, heat, and salinity tolerance have also been discussed.

This study applied Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to understand residents' anxieties about potential incidents caused by climate change in Amami islands, Japan. Through an interview with stakeholders, we selected five potential incidents for our BWS attributes: damage caused by typhoon and heavy rain (typhoon), damage caused by flood and a landslide (flood), damage from a drought (drought), damage from ciguatera fish poisoning (ciguatera), and incident caused by jellyfish (jellyfish). Changes in frequencies of the abovementioned incidents have already been observed in Japan. In 2016, we conducted a questionnaire survey of residents in Amami islands and received over 700 valid responses to BWS questions. Results showed that the average respondent was most anxious about the risk of typhoon, followed by flood, drought, ciguatera, and jellyfish. Furthermore, a comparative analysis did not find large variations among the islands in the residents' anxiety ranking concerning the incidents, but the degrees of their anxieties were different. The Amami-Oshima residents, for example, had relatively higher anxieties about flood, whereas the Okinoerabujima residents showed higher anxiety about drought. These findings support that their risk perceptions are determined by their experience and surrounding environments. Understanding the sensitivity of residents to climate change risk will encourage stakeholders to communicate and enhance climate change adaptation in local communities.

Impacts of combined land-use and climate change on streamflow in two nested catchments in the Southeastern United States	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Anthropocene land-use change; Climate change scenarios; Streamflow modeling; Stormwater runoff; Headwater stream restoration; Watershed management	WATERSHED HYDROLOGY; SOUTH-CAROLINA; COVER CHANGE; URBAN; RUNOFF; MODEL; URBANIZATION; SCENARIOS; FLOOD; RESTORATION	Stream restoration aims to improve hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological processes and provides an opportunity for ecological design in an urban context. Urban stream restoration and stormwater management involve conventional and low impact development strategies that may employ ecological engineering techniques. Urban flood-risks may increase rapidly due to the combination of land-use and climate change. This is a major research frontier because the changes are poorly understood, especially for the combined impacts of climate and land-use change in small catchments. Climate and land-use change may affect hydrologic systems in a complex, nonlinear, and non-additive manner. Streamflow simulation models can measure the relative magnitude of land-use and climate change on hydrologic response to precipitation events. Based on a simulation model calibrated with instrumental rainfall and streamflow data, this study compares simulated urban stormflow response to projected land-use and climate change in two highly urbanized catchments in Columbia, South Carolina, USA, using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Runoff responses for moderate-magnitude storms are contrasted using three land-use change scenarios with differing imperviousness and three climate-change scenarios. Land-use effects on runoff were proportionally greater in the smaller of the two catchments. At the headwater and downstream gauges, a warm/wet climate-change scenario caused larger increases than land-use changes in peak discharges and total event runoff volumes from late spring to early fall. The maximum monthly increase in peak discharge and total runoff volume from all simulations of climate change was for the warm/wet climate scenario in both catchments. However, the combined climate and land-use change scenario produced a 117.9% increase in peak discharge, a slightly (up to 8.6% in September) greater increase in peak discharge than the sum of changes from the individual scenarios (82.6% from climate change and 26.7% from land-use change) at the headwater gauge for the far term (2045-2074). These results suggest a complexity and nonlinearity of the impacts of combined land-use and climate change on hydrological processes, and have implications for stream restoration projects, integrated climate-impact assessments, urban planning, and policy decisions related to storm runoff and water quality.

An Empirical Analysis on 200 Countries from 1970 to 2020	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Social science; Climate change; Regression analysis; Economic value	NATURAL DISASTERS; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; SHOCKS	In this paper, we study the role of climate change as a financial risk for foreign investors. Multinational enter-prises seek to internationalize where financial risk is at the minimum level, including the climate change risk on profitability and productivity. Thereby, we conducted an empirical analysis of the effect of climate change on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) net inflows using data from 200 countries and times series from 1970 to 2020 and employing two categories of climate change indicators: Climatology and climate-related natural hazards. Using the estimation methods of fully modified ordinary least squares and robust weighted least squares, we concluded that the rise of climatology indicators (mean annual temperature and precipitations) negatively impacts inward FDI. Second, we conclude that most climate-related natural hazards (coastal/ rural/urban floods, landslides, and cyclones) deter FDI while extreme heat and wildfires show no significant effect. In addition, the results show that the negative impact of climate change is more severe when the host economy depends on agricultural activ-ities and there is no significant investment in research and development as compared with countries that depend on service and manufacturing activities and are more innovative and invest in technology infrastructure. Furthermore, we conclude that poorer host countries experience more severe effects of climate change on FDI than rich countries in terms of GDP per capita.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of the paper is to investigate the effect of climate change on inflows of cross-border capital in 200 countries. In other words, we see if rising temperature and natural hazards related to climate change affect the decision of firms to invest in a given country. The results show that global warming and unstable mete-orological indicators deter firms from investing abroad. Equally, natural hazards linked to climate change (coastal/ rural/urban floods, landslides, and cyclones) constitute an investment risk. The finding suggests that the deterring effects of climate change are less severe when a given country depends less on agriculture and more on industrial sectors and when that country is more developed and technologically advanced.

This study investigated the influence of climate change on hydroclimate-focused changes in the climatology of heavy precipitation (and streamflow) means and extremes based on the multi-model ensemble mean of earth system models in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). For runoff analysis, hydrologic responses to future climate conditions were simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model over the Ruvubu River basin, Burundi. Temperature increases by 5.6 degrees C, with strong robustness, under future climate conditions. The mean annual precipitation (and runoff) undergoes large seasonal variations, with weak robustness. Precipitation (and streamflow) changes between the wet and dry seasons differ in signal and magnitude. However, alterations in both the amount and frequency of precipitation reveal the intensification of the water cycle due to anthropogenic climate change. Thus, the highest variability in the maximum daily streamflow is shown in months of long wet seasons, especially in the far future (2085). Without considering the regional climate characteristics and shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, this behavior is expected to be enhanced in 2085 (compared with 2045) and increase the severity of extreme precipitation and flood risk. Climate change will cause alterations in the magnitude and seasonal distributions of extreme precipitation (and streamflow). These findings could be important for flood planning and mitigation measures to cope with climate change in Burundi.

This review paper aims at (1) characterizing climate change in countries of the EMR; (2) examining the potential effects of climate change on the nutritional and health status of the population; and (3) identifying the most vulnerable population groups. The paper explored several climate change indicators including daily temperatures, extreme temperature, daily precipitation, extreme precipitation (flooding, drought, storms, etc.), humidity, CO2 concentrations and sea surface temperature in EMR countries. Findings suggest that climate change will exert a significant adverse effect on water and food security and showed that the nutritional status of the population, which is already characterized by the triple burden of malnutrition, is likely to worsen via three main pathways mediated by climate change, namely, its impact on food security, care and health. Women, infants, children, those living in poor households and those experiencing displacement will be among the most vulnerable to the nutritional impacts of climate change. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations from the Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition, which can support the region in tackling the critical nexus of climate change and nutrition.

The Mann-Kendall method, Heuristic segmentation method, cross-wavelet analysis method, generalized extreme value (GEV) model, and generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model were applied in this paper. The 55-year (1963-2017) extreme rainfall and temperature data recorded in the Chengbi River Basin were applied. The results show that extreme rainfall showed a downward trend (-0.169 and -8.735 mm/10a), while the trends of extreme temperatures were not obvious (Sen's slope estimate is 0). The mutation points range from 1981 to 2002 and the mutation point of extreme rainfall series is earlier than that of extreme temperatures. Compared with the GEV model, the parameters of the GPD model show a smaller variation before and after climate change, and the extreme meteorology values corresponding to the same recurrence period show a decreasing trend after climate change. The performance of GEV and GPD models after climate change is generally more fit than that before climate change.

Health consequences of climate change in Bangladesh: An overview of the evidence, knowledge gaps and challenges	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						adaptation; Bangladesh; climate change; health	NINO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; DRINKING-WATER SALINITY; SEA-LEVEL RISE; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; TROPICAL CYCLONES; VIBRIO-CHOLERAE; GLOBAL CLIMATE; SOIL-SALINITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; NIPAH VIRUS	Climate change affects almost all aspects of human life, including health. This is particularly true in densely populated and low lying deltas such as Bangladesh. However, the climate-health nexus is a relatively poorly explored domain of research, which is a cause for concern given the country's intrinsic vulnerability to climatic impacts. The impact of climate change on human health and well-being can be manifested through different pathways and can be categorized as being direct or indirect, mediated through complex biophysical and social dynamics. The direct effects of climate change that have been observed in Bangladesh include morbidity and mortality due to heat stress, cyclones, floods, droughts and other weather extremes at different spatio-temporal scales. The indirect effects adopt more complex routes which includes, threatening food and water security due to salinity intrusion, and spread of infectious diseases due to changes in vector and pathogen ecology. Social dynamics in Bangladesh, such as those related to gender roles, poverty and power relations, also influence how the effects of climate change are experienced by different segments of the society. The Government of Bangladesh has a number of measures already in place, efforts that have been complemented by local interventions. Evidence to take robust health policy decisions related to climate change is limited and scattered, while there is a lack of multidisciplinary research efforts. Considering these limitations, generating and summarizing scientific evidence is vital for informing a resilient health system against future public health concerns in climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh and in other low-income regions.

Examining the Effectiveness of Climate Change Communication with Adolescents in Vietnam: The Role of Message Congruency	WATER			English	Article						climate change; risk communication; message framing; construal level; adolescents	CONSTRUAL-LEVEL THEORY; LOSS-FRAMED MESSAGES; FEAR APPEALS; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; PUBLIC SUPPORT; CHANGE IMPACTS; CHANGE RISK; FUTURE; BEHAVIOR; ADAPTATION	Climate change makes coastal communities more vulnerable to floods associated with storm surges and sea level rise, requiring both adaptation and mitigation measures. Moreover, proper understanding of flood risks and their potential impacts on climate change appears to be a communication challenge. In climate change communication, the effect of framing congruency on perception of risk, efficacy and behavioural intentions towards climate change adaptation and mitigation has received limited attention. Messages have not been congruent in framing risks associated with climate change. We define congruency as the coherent alignment of several aspects of message content. Messages are considered congruent when they provide recipients with consistent contents such as giving concrete and actionable advice, or by providing more abstract and general background information. This research focuses on climate change communication in fostering mitigation behaviours among adolescents in vulnerable locations in the global South. Based on Construal Level Theory, this paper investigates how message congruency affects the link between perceptions of climate change risk and efficacy and two predictors of behavioural change: perceived responsibility and mitigation intentions. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of congruent vs. incongruent risk communication among adolescents in highly vulnerable coastal communities in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (N = 348). Multiple regression analysis found strong effects of congruency in message framing; when messages were congruent in the content, communicative interventions changed adolescents' perceptions and attitudes toward climate change mitigation more consistently. This research contributes both theoretically and practically to risk communication among adolescents and toward climate change mitigation behaviour.

A framework for assessing the vulnerability of rubber plantations to the impacts of climate change with special reference to Kerala, India	JOURNAL OF RUBBER RESEARCH			English	Review						Adaptation strategies; Analytical hierarchy process (AHP); Climate change vulnerability assessment; Geographic information system (GIS); Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM); Rubber plantations	HIERARCHY PROCESS AHP; HEVEA-BRASILIENSIS; CHANGE MITIGATION; WESTERN-GHATS; FLOOD; FORESTS; AGROFORESTRY; DISTRICT; RAINFALL; BENGAL	The impacts of climate change are more frequent due to global warming, which will negatively affect the production of natural rubber globally. There is a substantial lack of research on assessing the vulnerability of rubber plantations to extreme weather events in rubber-growing countries around the world. The traditional rubber-growing regions of Kerala state in India have been experiencing impacts of climate change like floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones due to extreme weather events since 2016, which adversely affected the rubber plantations and latex production. Therefore, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent the frequent impacts of climate change on rubber plantations in the state that produce most of the rubber in the country (67%). It is vital to develop a climate change vulnerability map of rubber-growing regions to ensure the sustainability of rubber plantations. Climate change impacts on rubber plantations lead to permanent damages and substantial economic losses. A detailed review of climate change incidents affecting the state is presented, such as flooding, landslides, droughts, and cyclones, and the need to develop climate change vulnerability maps of rubber plantations. Developing a composite climate change vulnerability model based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) will help characterize rubber-growing regions based on climate change impacts and develop appropriate adaptation strategies to mitigate the impacts on rubber plantations. Thus, the proposed model could be used as a geographic information system (GIS)-based scientific framework to assess the vulnerability of rubber plantations to climate change impacts for rubber-producing countries worldwide.

Currently, the living soil ecosystem has become dreadful as a consequence of several anthropogenic activities including climate change. Climate change continues to transform the living soil ecosystem as well as the soil microbiome of planet Earth. The majority of studies have aimed to decipher the role of forest soil bacteria and fungi to understand and predict the impact of climate change on soil microbiome community structure and their ecosystem in the environment. In forest soils, microorganisms live in diverse habitats with specific behavior, comprising bulk soil, rhizosphere, litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are influenced by biotic interactions and nutrient accessibility. Soil microbiome also drives multiple crucial steps in the nutrient biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur cycles). Soil microbes help in the nitrogen cycle through nitrogen fixation during the nitrogen cycle and maintain the concentration of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Soil microorganisms in forest soils respond to various effects of climate change, for instance, global warming, elevated level of CO2, drought, anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, increased precipitation, and flood. As the major burning issue of the globe, researchers are facing the major challenges to study soil microbiome. This review sheds light on the current scenario of knowledge about the effect of climate change on living soil ecosystems in various climate-sensitive soil ecosystems and the consequences for vegetation-soil-climate feedbacks.

Alexander			Responding to Climate Change Disaster The Case of the 2019/2020 Bushfires in Australia	EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article						climate change; disaster preparedness; social identity approach; leadership	SOCIAL IDENTITY; COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES; LEADERSHIP; PERSPECTIVE	Climate change-induced disasters (e.g., bushfires, droughts, and flooding) occur more frequently and with greater intensity than in previous decades. Disasters can at times fuel social change but that is not guaranteed. To understand whether disasters lead to status quo maintenance or social change, we propose a model (Social Identity Model of Post-Disaster Action; SIMPDA) which focuses on the role of leadership in the aftermath of a disaster. Looking specifically at climate change-related disasters, we propose that intragroup and intergroup dynamics in both the pre-disaster as well as the post-disaster context affect whether leadership (a) has the potential to mobilize social identity resources to enable social change, or else (b) fails to capitalize on emerging social identity resources in ways that ultimately maintain the status quo. Given the importance of urgent climate change action, we predict that status quo maintenance is associated with post-disaster paralysis. In contrast, social change that is set in train by capitalizing on social identity-based resources holds the promise of greater post-disaster learning and enhanced disaster preparedness when it is focused on addressing the challenges brought about by climate change. We apply this model to understand responses to the 2019/2020 bushfires in Australia. Our analysis suggests that while an emerging sense of shared identity centered on acting to tackle climate change provides a window of opportunity for securing increased disaster preparedness, this opportunity risks being missed due to, among other things, the absence of leaders able and willing to engage in constructive identity-based leadership.

Climate change attribution and the economic costs of extreme weather events: a study on damages from extreme rainfall and drought	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Probabilistic event attribution; Disaster economics; Climate change economics; Climate change adaptation	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; FLOOD RISK; ENGLAND; LONG	An important and under-quantified facet of the risks associated with human-induced climate change emerges through extreme weather. In this paper, we present an initial attempt to quantify recent costs related to extreme weather due to human interference in the climate system, focusing on economic costs arising from droughts and floods in New Zealand during the decade 2007-2017. We calculate these using previously collected information about the damages and losses associated with past floods and droughts, and estimates of the "fraction of attributable risk" that characterizes each event. The estimates we obtain are not comprehensive, and almost certainly represent an underestimate of the full economic costs of climate change, notably chronic costs associated with long-term trends. However, the paper shows the potential for developing a new stream of information that is relevant to a range of stakeholders and research communities, especially those with an interest in the aggregation of the costs of climate change or the identification of specific costs associated with potential liability.

Near the Sundarbans area, proliferation of aquaculture in this delta contributes appreciably to the national economy. Although aquaculture has become a means of daily livelihood, this sector is nevertheless threatened by a complex of climate change impacts. Cyclones, rising temperatures, rising sea levels, coastal flooding, and erosion make coastal farming difficult. As a panacea, the Sundarbans can play a critical role in preserving coastal aquaculture. As noticed, forests have high potential to recover from unusual consequences of climate change. Practicing safe aquaculture should be opted to refrain from endangering the Sundarbans. This review addressed various climate change impacts on coastal farming and identified the capabilities of the Sundarbans to protect coastal aquaculture from calamitous impacts.

Our multi-disciplinary research team used a mixed-methods approach to document, analyze, and conceptualize the interacting factors that shape vulnerability and to explore community members' perceptions of the role and relative importance of climate change compared to other factors in three rural communities in Ecuador. Economic instability, lack of access to basic services, and environmental degradation are perceived as greater threats to community well being than increasing seasonal variability and flooding. Programs and policies directed at climate change adaptation should integrate climate and non-climate related stressors. Our findings also point to a greater need for collaboration across public health, poverty alleviation, and environmental management fields through practical research targeting assistance to vulnerable populations.

Further, it aims to increase the government attention for adaptation measures by providing awareness of climate change and its negative impacts on livelihood. Design/methodology/approach For study purpose, cross-sectional and secondary data sets were used. The community perceptions about climate change were recorded by face-to-face interviews of 500 respondents from Nam Dinh province, Vietnam in April 2015 by using a well-structured questionnaire, whereas secondary data were collected from the statistical yearbook of General Statistics Office of Vietnam. To accomplish the study objectives, Cobb-Douglas production function and Likert scale were used to estimate the community perceptions of climate change and impact of climate change on livelihood, respectively. Findings Results depict that climate change negatively impacted on the productivity of rice and livestock. Particularly, frequently occurring of droughts, floods and salinity intrusion negatively impacted on rice productivity, while livestock productivity is decreased by frequent occurring of flood storms in study area. Originality/value The study results suggest a government support is essential to achieve sustainable livelihoods for coastal communities living in the Red River Delta, particularly some adaptation measures in the context of climate change are required in study area.

Climate change disrupts the global food system through a number of mechanisms including extreme weather events, rising food prices, and compromised food quality. In this article, we explore the effect of climate change on food security and the resulting health impacts of poor nutrition on pregnant women and infants in the perinatal period. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy raises the risk of vitamin deficiencies, obstetric complications, maternal mortality, and infant malnutrition. Climate change exacerbates these challenges and perpetuates intergenerational cycles of poor nutrition. Addressing these issues requires traditional approaches to combating the climate impacts on general food security as well as specific approaches to bridge the food security gender gap. Empowering women as key stakeholders is crucial for overcoming the complex barriers to food insecurity caused by climate change, as well as protecting the well-being of vulnerable populations during the perinatal period.

The impact of climate change is greatest in developing countries, especially in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Vibrio cholerae, a waterborne pathogen, is most susceptible to and most prevalent during severe climatic changes. The Philippines is regularly exposed to tropical cyclones, such as Bopha in 2012 and Haiyan in 2013, because of its geographical location, while Cyclone Nargis in 2008 caused over 95% of the damage and casualties seen in the preceding two decades in Myanmar. Therefore, implementing policies to adjust to these climate changes and to safeguard their citizens from the effects of WBDs is imperative for ASEAN countries. This study aimed to (1) investigate the effects of climate change on health and to understand the policy requirements to prevent or minimize its negative impact and (2) explore the link between the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the effects of climate change on WBDs to determine perspectives for global sustainability. The framework of the SDGs should be adapted to ASEAN countries to improve legislation, laws, and regulations on climate-related health issues. Efficient collaboration among scientists, researchers, health professionals, and policymakers will assist in addressing the problems associated with the impact of climate change on WBDs in ASEAN countries.

Communities in the region almost exclusively depend on fisheries for food and livelihoods. Although threatened by over-exploitation and habitat changes, fish populations are also affected by climate change. Using semi-structured questionnaires, we assessed fisherfolk's opinions of how recent variation in climate affected their livelihoods and the environment. Fisherfolk perceived that climate had changed in the past decade and were negatively impacted by this. Interviewees reported average higher temperatures, a greater frequency of floods and droughts, unpredictable timing of seasons, and erratic rainfall. Destruction of fishing villages/camps, loss and damage of fishing equipment, shifts in the fishing calendar, reduction of fish trade, and fish catch declines as well as psycho-social problems were given as the major consequences of climate change. Causes of climate change and variability were perceived to be linked to uncontrolled harvest of forest resources, anger of God and ancestors, and natural variability in climate. Most respondents expressed a desire to adopt more responsible behavior such as planting trees and establishing community nurseries, being educated on climate change risks, and sustainable fisheries management. Our results show that fisherfolk in the Sudd are troubled by climate change impacts on their livelihoods and on fish populations. In South Sudan, climate change has been reported from hydroclimatological data but concrete impacts on people remain largely unknown and of little concern because of recent wars and the poor economy. Our study provides an example of how fisherfolks' local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be used as an early warning system of the negative impacts on livelihoods and fish populations and support adaptation to the changing climate.

Higher temperatures may result in reduced yields while encouraging weed, pest, and disease infestation. The impacts of climate change on agriculture are projected to be negative, threatening global food security; therefore, this is an important area of empirical research. This study sought to identify the factors affecting the adoption and intensity of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adoption among smallholder maize farmers in the uMshwathi and uKhahlamba Municipal areas of KwaZulu Natal. The study used the primary data collected from 99 respondents who were selected through simple random sampling. The descriptive results indicated that farmers had experienced severe climatic conditions such as drought, pests, diseases, hailstorms, heavy rains (floods), soil infertility, and frost in their farming system. The first hurdle of the probit model results showed that drought, on-farm income, and household size significantly influenced the adoption of CSA practices. In contrast, the main source of income and educational level had a significant negative influence. The results from the second hurdle showed that drought had a significant positive impact on the intensity of CSA adoption, while marital status had a significant negative effect. Several factors influence the adoption of an intensification of CSA practices. The study recommends that policymakers and climate change champions consider smallholder farmers' socioeconomic factors when developing climate change adaptation programs. Local climate change organizations must scale up climate change awareness and adaptation programs collaboratively. Investments in public climate and adaptation education or training are needed, as well as localized meteorological observations and early warning systems. Mass media dissemination of climate change and adaptation information in locally understood languages is urgently required.

In future, projected changes to the frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events could change weather-infrastructure risk profiles. Infrastructure owners and operators need to manage current weather impacts and put in place adequate plans to anticipate and adapt to changes in future weather risks, or mitigate the impacts arising from those risks. The assessment of the risk posed to railway infrastructure from current and future weather is dependent on a good understanding of the constituent components of risk: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. A good understanding of the baseline and projected future risk is needed in order to understand the potential benefits of various climate change adaptation actions. Traditional risk assessment methods need some modification in order to be applied to climate change timescales, for which decisions need to be made under deep uncertainty. This review paper highlights some key challenges for assessing the risk, including: managing uncertainties; understanding weather-impact relationships and how they could change with climate change; assessing the costs of current and future weather impacts and the potential cost versus benefit of adaptation; and understanding practices and tools for adapting railway infrastructure. The literature reveals examples of progress and good practice in all these areas, providing scope for effective knowledge-sharing-across the railway infrastructure and other sectors-in support of infrastructure resilience and adaptation.

To compensate for a lack of research in this area, we also address some of the projected mental health implications resulting from disasters linked to climate change, such as flooding, hurricanes, and cyclones. This broader scope enables the identification of areas where more research into mental health concerns related to climate change in the Pacific is needed. In closing, we provide recommendations for further research into the mental health and well-being of Pacific peoples and suggest ways to develop resilience to the effects of climate change.

We conducted a scoping literature review on the evaluation of risk communication for extreme weather and climate change to inform local public health messaging, consistent with requirements under the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS), which were updated in 2018 to include effective communication regarding climate change and extreme weather. Methods: Search strategies were developed by library information specialists and used to retrieve peer-reviewed academic and grey literature from bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL) and Google country specific searches, respectively. The search strategy was validated through a workshop with experts and community stakeholders, with expertise in environment, health, emergency management and risk communication. Results: A total of 43 articles were included. These articles addressed issues such as: climate change (n = 22), flooding (n = 12), hurricane events (n = 5), extreme heat (n = 2), and wild fires (n = 2). Studies were predominantly from the US (n = 14), Europe (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). Conclusion: To meet the OPHS 2018, public health practitioners need to engage in effective risk communication to motivate local actions that mitigate the effects of extreme weather and climate change. Based on the scoping review, risk communication efforts during short-term extreme weather events appear to be more effective than efforts to communicate risk around climate change. This distinction could highlight a unique opportunity for public health to adapt strategies commonly used for extreme weather to climate change.

J	Hai, Z; Perlman, RL				Hai, Zuhad; Perlman, Rebecca L.			Extreme weather events and the politics of climate change attribution	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							PUBLIC-OPINION; POLARIZATION; COMMUNICATION; MITIGATION; EXPERIENCE; WILDFIRE; SENATE	The consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly visible in the form of more severe wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding. As the science linking these disasters to climate change has grown more robust, it has led to pressure on politicians to acknowledge the connection. While an analysis of U.S. Congressional press releases reveals a slight increase in politicians' willingness to do so, many remain hesitant. Why? We hypothesize that climate change attribution can backfire, harming politicians' popularity and undermining their ability to adapt to the visible manifestations of climate change. We conduct an original survey experiment on a representative sample of American adults and show that when a politician links wildfires to climate change, Republicans perceive the official as less capable of addressing weather-related disasters. In addition, Republicans become less supportive of efforts to protect against similar disasters in the future. Our findings shed light on the potential trade-offs of conveying the link between climate change and its impacts.

Designers and artists can contribute to public engagement using the landscape as a setting and medium to visualize climate change futures. This research note presents the case example of High Tide, a temporary landscape installation in Boston, MA, designed to bring attention to projected flooding in the area due to sea level rise. Our study sought to pilot the use of social science methods to gain initial insight on whether a landscape installation, through its accessible and site-specific qualities, could engage local audiences in the subject of climate change. Our findings provide an initial proof-of-concept for the role of public art in contributing to public engagement by bringing attention to and visualizing local effects of climate change using the landscape as a publicly accessible setting. Future research using robust social science methods would further illuminate these issues.

However, knowledge about how climate change and variability affect mangrove ecosystem services (MES) and their role in supporting coastal communities to adaption is limited in Tanzania. We used participatory rural appraisal methods and field observations to explore local communities' perceptions of climate change and variability, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) strategies in the mangroves of the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. Decrease in rainfall, increased temperatures, coastal flooding, and the incidence of sea level rise were identified as key variables associated with a changing climate in the delta. Perceived climatic stresses included damaged fish breeding sites, altered climate regulation and a decrease in coastal protection and flood control. Decline in crop, fish and honey production were perceived as the main impacts on community livelihoods, although there were significant differences across occupational groups. Dependence on MES in times of shocks, such as when agriculture production fails, switching of occupation, crop diversification, fishing in deep waters and migration to other areas provided potential adaptation options. Although the reported perceptions related to climate change or variability are not explicit, they both have negative consequences to mangrove dependent communities' livelihoods.

J	Park, H; Jang, D				Park, Hyoseon; Jang, Dongwoo			Optimal RCM and spatial interpolation methods for estimating future precipitation in the Republic of Korea	LHB-HYDROSCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Precipitation; regional climate model; climate change; spatial interpolation method; Precipitation; modele climatique regional; changement climatique; methode d'interpolation spatiale	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; SIMULATIONS	Recent droughts and floods caused by climate change have caused considerable damage to the use of water resources. According to several climate forecasts in various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the use of stable water resources remains vulnerable and can be heavily influenced by climate change. An adequate response to the climate change threat is thus growing more important for water resources management. This study aimed to select the optimal regional climate model (RCM) and spatial interpolation method for the practical application of future estimation of precipitation data produced by climate change scenarios. The results indicate that HadGEM3-RA (Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 3 - Regional Atmospheric) is the most suitable of the five RCMs when comparing its predicted values to the monthly precipitation forecasts of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), from 2006 to 2015, in Korea. Universal kriging was chosen as the optimal interpolation method for generating accurate precipitation data, among several spatial interpolation methods. In Korea, the accuracy of precipitation prediction by the RCM is low on the coasts and islands. In comparison, the accuracy is found to be higher in the northern inland area.

The study explores how inhabitants of Marseilles and Nice, two major cities on the French Mediterranean coast, perceive recent climate change and how competent they find themselves in coping with changing climate and coastal risks. It also analyses the influence of socio-demographic and psycho-social variables on their perceived level of coping. The tool used is the French translated and adapted version of the Climate Change Perception Inventory (CCPI) by Rishi and Mudaliar (2014), filled in by a total of 475 participants in the study. Results show that in both cities, respondents are aware of climate change, but are not really worried about it. Marseilles and Nice differ in the role played by Coastal Subjective Well-Being. In both samples, the most important predictor of Coping and Adaptation is Climate related Stress and Emotional Concern. Finally, the study highlights the importance of considering psycho-social variables in the management of Climate Change Adaptation.

However, given the limitations of observations and model simulations, evidence of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on past extreme river discharge is scarce. Here, a large ensemble numerical simulation revealed that 64% (14 of 22 events) of floods analyzed during 2010-2013 were affected by anthropogenic climate change. Four flood events in Asia, Europe, and South America were enhanced within the 90% likelihood range. Of eight snow-induced floods analyzed, three were enhanced and four events were suppressed, indicating that the effects of climate change are more likely to be seen in the snow-induced floods. A global-scale analysis of flood frequency revealed that anthropogenic climate change enhanced the occurrence of floods during 2010-2013 in wide area of northern Eurasia, part of northwestern India, and central Africa, while suppressing the occurrence of floods in part of northeastern Eurasia, southern Africa, central to eastern North America and South America. Since the changes in the occurrence of flooding are the results of several hydrological processes, such as snow melt and changes in seasonal and extreme precipitation, and because a climate change signal is often not detectable from limited observation records, large ensemble discharge simulation provides insights into anthropogenic effects on past fluvial floods.

Incorporating climate change in flood estimation guidance	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Review						flooding; climate change; flood estimation; engineering; design	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CONTINUOUS SIMULATION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CHANGE IMPACT; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; SOIL-MOISTURE; RETURN PERIOD; RISK; RAINFALL	Research into potential implications of climate change on flood hazard has made significant progress over the past decade, yet efforts to translate this research into practical guidance for flood estimation remain in their infancy. In this commentary, we address the question: how best can practical flood guidance be modified to incorporate the additional uncertainty due to climate change? We begin by summarizing the physical causes of changes in flooding and then discuss common methods of design flood estimation in the context of uncertainty. We find that although climate science operates across aleatory, epistemic and deep uncertainty, engineering practitioners generally only address aleatory uncertainty associated with natural variability through standards-based approaches. A review of existing literature and flood guidance reveals that although research efforts in hydrology do not always reflect the methods used in flood estimation, significant progress has been made with many jurisdictions around the world now incorporating climate change in their flood guidance. We conclude that the deep uncertainty that climate change brings signals a need to shift towards more flexible design and planning approaches, and future research effort should focus on providing information that supports the range of flood estimation methods used in practice. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.

J	Dewan, C				Dewan, Camelia			'Climate Change as a Spice': Brokering Environmental Knowledge in Bangladesh's Development Industry	ETHNOS			English	Article						Development; Bangladesh; climate change; embankments; knowledge production		This article examines whether the use of climate change as a 'spice' in order to attract donor funding may instead exacerbate existing environmental problems. The World Bank's latest adaptation project in coastal Bangladesh aims to create higher and wider embankments against rising sea levels. This disregards a long history of how embankments, by stopping beneficial monsoon inundations, result in dying rivers and damaging floods that devastate rural livelihoods. Bangladeshi 'development brokers' must therefore balance their roles as project employees supporting embankments as adaptation, and as locals knowledgeable about their harmful effects. The article shows how donors, NGOs, consultants and government bodies with different agendas, priorities and knowledge backgrounds 'translate' climate change to legitimise their activities. It contributes to debates about the politics of environmental knowledge production by arguing that development brokerage helps explain why some climate adaptation projects increase environmental vulnerability, while others address local needs.

The agriculture sector depends on the climate and may be susceptible to future climate changes, such as increasing temperature, heavy rainfall, droughts, and floods directly impacting cotton productivity. This study empirically investigates the relationship between climate change variables and non-climate change variables on cotton productivity in Pakistan. An econometric technique, the "autoregressive distributed lag model" (ARDL), was employed on time series data from 1970 to 2018 to explore the existence and nature of the relationship among variables. The findings indicated the presence of co-integration among variables which confirms the long-run relationship among the variables. At the same time, the empirical results revealed that increases in temperature and rainfall positively affected cotton productivity. However, CO2 harms cotton productivity. Moreover, infrastructural changes positively affect cotton productivity in both the long and short run, while labor is negatively related to productivity. The area, fertilizer, and seed consumption showed a significant positive effect on cotton productivity. We employed the dynamic ordinary least squares (OLS), co-integration regression estimation, and the series test to validate the robustness of the finding. The finding of this study urges policymakers to devise a comprehensive policy to mitigate the adverse effect of climate change and upsurge water conservation. Furthermore, it is imperative to adopt environmentally friendly production inputs and modern techniques, which helps to gain sustainable cotton productivity. To conclude, the cotton crop is significantly affected by climate change subject to the region. Although this study analyzed the Pakistan case, the model can be generalized to all the developing countries.

For the first time, the EPIC model was used in a long-term organic vegetable field experiment to evaluate the performance of agro-ecological practices, as adaptation and mitigation measures to cope with climate change in Southern Italy. These practices were a soil hydraulic arrangement (consisting of ridges and flat strips) combined with crop rotation (winter and summer cash crops), organic fertilization (poultry manure vs. no fertilization), and cover crops (pure or in mixture vs. no cover) managed as living mulch, green manure, or flattened by roller crimper. Seven treatments were selected for the simulation procedure. EPIC was calibrated and validated using measured crop yield and soil organic carbon stock values. The statistical metrics of EPIC showed r to be between 0.96 and 0.97, the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency between 0.54 and 0.94, and the relative root mean square error between 2 and 18%. Then, the model was run under baseline current climate (1985-2014) and near-future climate change (2015-2044) scenarios. Climate change increased both microbial respiration and nitrate leaching compared to the baseline, while soil organic carbon stock change and nitrous oxide emissions were mainly influenced by agro-ecological practices. Cover crop management could be an effective solution to limit negative climate effects, since it allowed improving summer cash crop yield (32%) and soil organic carbon stock change (2%), and reducing nitrogen losses (-34%), as compared to the no-cover-crop system. Finally, under climate change, green manure increased microbial respiration (5%) and reduced nitrogen losses (- 19%), compared to roller crimper flattening. Our findings indicated that the tested agro-ecological practices contribute to re-designing new climate change-resilient vegetable systems, by involving the stakeholders in promoting a co-innovation and co-research knowledge platform and fine-tuning agro-ecological practices in a wider range of environments.

J	Atanga, RA; Tankpa, V				Atanga, Raphael Ane; Tankpa, Vitus			Climate Change, Flood Disaster Risk and Food Security Nexus in Northern Ghana	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Review						food security; climate change; flood impacts; northern Ghana; nexus	DROUGHT; IMPACT; VULNERABILITY; LIVELIHOODS	This research reviews climate change, flood disasters impacts and food security nexus in northern Ghana. The impacts of climate change include flood disasters which in turn affect food production with subsequent impact on food security. While climate change impact can be positive in some regions, it can be negative in other regions as it could lead to excess or lack of water, which negatively affects food production. Most especially, flood disasters have reportedly become frequent with devastating consequences on food production. Literature further suggests that the frequency of floods and their impacts have the potential to increase in the future. Floods inundate farms, pastures and livestock, which could subsequently reduce crop yields and animal production. Floods also destroys physical infrastructure and disrupts socio-economic activities which are linked to agriculture sector and could affect food production. This eventually decreases food availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability in the region. Northern Ghana has experienced flood disasters with increased frequency, which are related to climate change impacts. Although there is research on climate change, flood disasters, and food security issues in northern Ghana, the literature thus far indicates no clear focus of studies that focuses on the nexus of climate change, flood disasters, and food security of the study site. Thus, this research seeks to review the nexus of climate change, and flood disaster impacts on food security in northern Ghana with their implications on food security in the region. This study has two main research objectives. The first objective of this research is to identify and understand the potential impacts of climate change and flood disasters on food production in the study site. The second research objective is to explain the connection between climate change and flood disasters and the implications of this relationship on food security in the study site. This review study focuses on climate change, flood disasters, and food production to understand the critical impacts of climate change and flood disasters on food security in the northern part of Ghana. The aim of this research is to contribute to literature and discussion of the nexus of climate change, flood disaster impacts and food security sub-Saharan Africa.

Greenhouse gases as well as global surface temperatures have increased causing more frequent and intense heat and cold waves, wildfires, floods, drought, altered rainfall patterns, hurricanes, thunderstorms, air pollution, and windstorms. These extreme weather events have direct and indirect effects on the immune system, leading to allergic disease due to exposure to pollen, molds, and other environmental pollutants. In this review, we will focus on immune mechanisms associated with allergy and asthma-related health risks induced by climate change events. We will review current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the changing environment mediates these effects.

Nature-based solutions in mountain catchments reduce impact of anthropogenic climate change on drought streamflow	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							WOODY PLANT ENCROACHMENT; WATER YIELD; FLOOD RISK; ATTRIBUTION; ADAPTATION; WEATHER; ENGLAND; CARBON; VALIDATION; MITIGATION	Adapting to climate change through Nature-Based Solutions can reduce the severity of hydrological droughts caused by human influence on the climate, according to a multi-model joint-attribution of climate and landscape-vegetation states developed in South Africa. Quantifying how well Nature-based Solutions can offset anthropogenic climate change impacts is important for adaptation planning, but has rarely been done. Here we show that a widely-applied Nature-based Solution in South Africa - invasive alien tree clearing - reduces the impact of anthropogenic climate change on drought streamflow. Using a multi-model joint-attribution of climate and landscape-vegetation states during the 2015-2017 Cape Town "Day Zero" drought, we find that anthropogenic climate change reduced streamflow by 12-29% relative to a counterfactual world with anthropogenic emissions removed. This impact on streamflow was larger than corresponding reductions in rainfall (7-15%) and reference evapotranspiration (1.7-2%). Clearing invasive alien trees could have ameliorated streamflow reductions by 3-16% points for moderate invasions levels. Preventing further invasive alien tree spread avoided potential additional reductions of 10-27% points. Total clearing could not have offset the anthropogenic climate change impact completely. Invasive alien tree clearing is an important form of catchment restoration for managing changing hydroclimatic risk, but will need to be combined with other adaptation options as climate change accelerates.

J	Debernardi, C; Seeber, M; Cattaneo, M				Debernardi, Carlo; Seeber, Marco; Cattaneo, Mattia			Thirty years of climate change research: A fine-grained analysis of geographical specialization	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; Geographic specialization; Developing countries; Natural language processing; Bibliometrics	BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; COLLABORATION; SCIENCE; VULNERABILITY; CONTROVERSY; ADAPTATION; NETWORKS; IMPACT; IPCC	Bibliometric overviews of climate change research typically focus on the main topical trends and few countries with the largest share of the scientific production. These are important limitations: most of the world's population live in countries that are heavily affected by climate change but have a relatively small scientific production, so that their topics of interest might be neglected. This contribution aims to address both limitations by investigating variations across countries in climate change research specialization. We employ a combination of state-of-the-art language modelling techniques to gain a fine-grained representation of the research topics on climate change, considering abstracts of 193,471 publications from 1990 to 2020. The analysis reveals the existence of five major country blocks, with distinct research specializations. Countries' research specialization is driven by the specific challenges posed by climate change, such as extreme precipitation and floods and food, as well as the level of resources at disposal, so that research into the phenomenon of climate change and its global solutions is more important in affluent western countries. Less affluent countries - which host several billion people - develop distinct research focuses on local problems' causes and mitigation strategies, but typically have limited resources to address these challenges. Hence, leading scientific countries should possibly contribute even more to addressing such issues.

Thus, assessing the effect of future climate change on urban flooding and adopting effective flood management measures is becoming increasingly important. In this study, an urban rainstorm model and a scenario simulation method were applied to central Shanghai, China. We first examined the risks of flooding in the study area under the impact of future climate change using a simulation with different rainfall return periods. We then evaluated the benefits of traditional drainage system adaptation measures and Low Impact Development (LID) practices on alleviating the current urban flood hazard. Finally, we explored the effectiveness of using an integrated flood management scheme to adapt to climate change. The results show that the urban flood volume increases nonlinearly with increasing rainfall intensity under climate change. The maximum flooding area also increases accordingly, and is much more sensitive to smaller rainfall events. Both traditional drainage system adaptation measures and LID practices can effectively alleviate flooding, while an integrated flood management scheme that emphasizes the combination of the two methods is shown to be the most effective in reducing flooding under future climate change.

Climate Change Risk Evaluation of Tsunami Hazards in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea	WATER			English	Article						natural hazard; climate change; sea level rise; earthquake triggered tsunami; social and economic risk assessment; Monte Carlo analysis	LEVEL RISE; FLOOD RISK; VULNERABILITY; MAGNITUDE; EXPOSURE; LOSSES; MODEL	Climate change impacts on social and economic assets and activities are expected to be devastating. What is as important as the analysis of climate change triggered events is the analysis of a combination of climate change related events and other natural hazards not related to climate change. Given this observation, the purpose of this study is to present a coastal risk analysis for potential earthquake triggered tsunamis (ETTs) coupled with the sea level rise (SLR) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. For this purpose, extensive stochastic analysis of ETTs, which are not related to climate change, are conducted considering the effects of climate change related SLR projections for this century. For the combined analysis, economic and social risks are evaluated for two regions in the Eastern Mediterranean Coastline, namely the Fethiye City Center at the Turkish Coastline and the Cairo Agricultural Area near Egypt. It is observed that ignoring SLR will hinder realistic evaluation of ETT risks in the region. Moreover, spatial evaluations of economic and social risks are necessary since topography and proximity to the earthquake zones affect inundation levels due to ETTs in the presence of SLR.

In addition, the appropriateness of the budgets allotted by the Korean government for these two policies in 2021 was examined by comparing them with the benefits to the people at the national level. The average annual WTP per household was estimated to be approximately KRW 27,457 and 25,854 for these two policies. The WTP was found to increase with adverse effects caused by extreme weather conditions; as people developed an interest in climate change, their income level increased and hence they showed preferences for policies by the ruling party. In addition, the benefits of the two policies at the national level were estimated to be worth KRW 573.6 and 540.1 billion, respectively. When the benefits were compared with the amount allotted in the budgets for them, the ratio of the budget to the benefit was found to be 77.55% for flood control in preparation for climate change and 4.46% for the reinforced protection of populations vulnerable to climate change. This confirms that the acceptability of the policy by the populations vulnerable to climate change is high, but the budget is not allocated as per the need.

These rapid changes coupled with a transparent world that enjoys access to information mean that today's population is more aware and attentive about the progress of climate change. The purpose of this study is to discover attitudes towards new gained consciousness and the term Eco-anxiety. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines eco-anxiety as a 'chronic fear of environmental doom'. To investigate this phenomenon, we use Q-methodology to analyse discourses on the topic. Thirty-nine people from four different stakeholder groups were surveyed. Five distinct discourses were generated covering the connection between environmental awareness and psychological well-being, coming to terms with emotional response to climate change, importance of climate change, awareness about eco-anxiety leading to a more positive outlook, and disbelief that eco-anxiety and climate change can affect mental well-being.

The Effect of Climate Change and Urbanization on the Demand for Low Impact Development for Three Canadian Cities	WATER			English	Article						climate change; urbanization; low impact development; stormwater; urban runoff; Toronto; Montreal; Vancouver; flooding; geospatial modeling	RIVER-BASIN; RUNOFF; STORMWATER; BIORETENTION; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; COVER; RISK; PART	Climate change and urbanization are increasing the intensity and frequency of floods in urban areas. Low Impact Development (LID) is a technique which attenuates runoff and manages urban flooding. However, the impact of climate change and urbanization on the demand or need for LID in cities for both current and future conditions is not known. The primary goal of this research was to evaluate the demand for LID under different climate change and urban growth scenarios based on a physical-based geospatial framework called the hydrological-hydraulic index (HHI). To do this, 12 scenarios considering four climate change and three urbanization conditions were developed. The HHI for three cities in Canada (Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver) were estimated, evaluated, and compared for these scenarios. The results show that both urbanization and climate change increase the demand for LID. The contribution of climate change and urbanization on LID demand, measured using HHI, varies for each city: in Toronto and Montreal, high rainfall intensity and low permeability mean that climate change is dominant, whereas, in Vancouver, both climate change and urbanization have a similar impact on LID demand. Toronto and Montreal also have a higher overall demand for LID and the rate of increase in demand is higher over the study period. The results of this study provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the effect of climate and urbanization on the demand for LID, which can be used for flood management, urban planning, and sustainable development of cities.

Continuing sea level rises, more intense and frequent cyclones, flooding and landslides are regular occurrences in Vanuatu, challenging the population to adapt. These experiences are made more intense by the knowledge that ni-Vanuatu circumstances are the result of greenhouse gas emissions occurring elsewhere, in countries with higher gross domestic products (GDPs). In this paper, we focus on the experiences of women in Vanuatu to build a greater understanding of the impacts of climate change on women's lives in one of the most disaster risk countries in the world. In focus groups conducted in 2021 with women in five communities across Vanuatu, women shared their experiences in dealing with climate change, the impacts on food production and food security and the gendered societal expectations that shape the complexity of women's experiences. We note the way gender relations build on climate change impacts to shape the lives of Vanuatu women. In so doing we highlight the expressed desire of women to bring their experiences of climate change to the international community and to be part of the critical global conversation on climate change.

However, their results leave an important void with respect to the impact of physical risks and the associated costs of climate change for Canada, such as the loss of biodiversity, sea-level rise, and infrastructure damage due to fires and floods, etc. We fill this void by updating the Dynamic Integrated Climate and Economy model developed by 2018 Nobel Laureate William Nordhaus to project physical damages due to climate change for Canada. Our results illustrate stark differences in physical costs under various warming scenarios, highlighting the importance of taking action to mitigate climate change. We find that undertaking the required investments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions more than pays for itself in terms of avoided physical damage alone.

In the realm of sustainable citriculture, climate change poses a notable challenge by inducing abiotic stresses within citrus-producing regions. Projections suggest rising air temperatures by 2.2-5.1 degrees C, heightened instances of temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C during dry spells, freezing events, a reduction in rainfall by at least 4%, and amplified monsoonal precipitations. Such changes will inevitably affect citrus tree physiology and yield quality. The intricate connection between external climatic conditions and crucial physiological processes underscores the profound influence of climate change. Temperature fluctuations can disrupt leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, flower and fruit development, fruit sugar production, coloration, abscission, carbohydrate accumulation, and ultimate fruit yield. This comprehensive review delves into the specific repercussions of climate change on citrus cultivation, focusing on variables like temperature variations, water availability, light intensity, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and salinity stress. Our exploration elucidates the adverse impact of these stressors on citrus crops, while highlighting innovative tactics and emerging technologies, including advanced monitoring systems, precision irrigation, automated climate regulation, molecular priming through biostimulants, shade netting, and particle film technologies. By mitigating the adverse effects of environmental stressors, these strategies empower citrus growers to navigate challenges like excessive solar radiation, temperature fluctuations, soil moisture management, erosion prevention, and enhanced soil quality. These combined efforts forge a path toward a more resilient citriculture capable of effectively countering the abiotic stresses stemming from climate change.

Large cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bharu, and George Town are experiencing rapid urbanization processes, resulting in unpredictable changes in temperature and weather, which consequently impact community livelihoods. Many believe that the recent flooding in urban residential areas in Peninsular Malaysia has been worsened by climate change. Hence, this paper explores and discusses recent community perceptions of the climate change issue in Peninsular Malaysia. A group of 350 community members from different states in Peninsular Malaysia gave their views and opinions related to climate change via an online quantitative survey questionnaire. Their perception of the urbanization process and its impact on the increase in temperature was descriptively analyzed using the frequency analysis technique and mean score, while their suggestions in verbatim form on reducing the effects of climate change were analyzed thematically. The respondents perceived the climate change issue as attributable to the factors of urbanization, namely the manufacturing industry, population density, and private motor vehicles. Respondents provided suggestions for reducing the effects of climate change, ranging from government policies to community actions.

J	Roy, S; Sims, K				Roy, Sajal; Sims, Kearrin			Climate change mitigation and adaptation in Bangladesh: The need for community-based approaches	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article						Bangladesh; climate change; climate finance; climate mitigation; community knowledge	ENERGY SECTOR; SYSTEM	Climate change is a leading threat to sustainable socio-economic development in Bangladesh. Adverse impacts of climatic disasters including flash floods, recurrent cyclones and erratic rainfall patterns are already causing hardship for both rural and urban people and are expected to accelerate into the future. The aim of this research note is to identify the core contributing economic sectors to climate change in Bangladesh, and to consider effective mitigation strategies. Following the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report (2014), in this paper, we argue that comprehensive mitigation measures are required in the energy, transport, buildings, industry and land-use sectors to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Our findings indicate that it is crucial that government and non-government mitigation efforts engage with community knowledge practices in order to most effectively reduce GHG emissions and combat the adverse impacts of climate change.

Here we conduct climatology-hydrodynamic modeling to quantify the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and TC climatology change (under RCP 8.5) on late 21st century flood hazards at the county level along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. We find that, under the compound effects of SLR and TC climatology change, the historical 100-year flood level would occur annually in New England and mid-Atlantic regions and every 1-30 years in southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico regions in the late 21st century. The relative effect of TC climatology change increases continuously from New England, mid-Atlantic, southeast Atlantic, to the Gulf of Mexico, and the effect of TC climatology change is likely to be larger than the effect of SLR for over 40% of coastal counties in the Gulf of Mexico.

Climate change and upstream dam construction are the two main driving factors in altering the hydrology in the Mekong River Basin. Cambodian floodplain is located in the vulnerable flood zone to be affected by climate change and upstream dam development. This study investigated the potential impacts of future climate change and dam construction on flood hazards and agricultural damages in the Cambodian floodplain of the Mekong River. Climate outputs from MRI-AGCM3.2S under different sea surface temperature (SST) scenarios and a large ensemble climate dataset (d4PDF) under 4 K increasing scenario were used as input to a fully distributed rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model for future projection of flood in the Lower Mekong Basin. New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicated that the changes in extreme flood events (25-year flood) showed an increase of agricultural flood damages under climate change impact by 18-28% under different SST scenarios. These increases would be only 5-13% under integrated impacts from future climate change and dam construction. Under the 4 K increasing scenario, the agricultural damages for extreme flood events of 10-year, 50-year, and 100-year return periods would increase by 32%, 38%, and 39% for climate change impact alone and 17%, 29%, and 31% for combined climate change and dam development scenario, respectively. The climate change impacts would have more influential on increasing the magnitude of extreme floods than the reduction caused by dam reservoir constructions in the future projection in the Cambodian floodplain of the Mekong River Basin. The impact of dam constructions tends to have greater impact on reducing smaller extreme events; however, their impacts are relatively smaller for larger extreme flood events (i.e., 100-year flood).

Climate Change Effects on Hydropower in Mozambique	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						renewable energy; hydropower; climate change effects; flow regimes	ZAMBEZI	The impact of climate change on the production of hydropower in Mozambique is reviewed and regression analysis is applied to evaluate future climate scenarios. The results show that climate change will cause increased variability of precipitation and create flooding that can damage infrastructure such as hydropower dams. Climate change can also cause drought that will decrease surface water and reduce hydroelectric generation in Mozambique. Electricity generation is to a major extent performed through large-scale hydropower in Mozambique. To fulfill the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and an increased demand for electricity, several large and many small hydropower projects are planned and were built in the country. The economic lifetime of a hydropower plant is typically 100 years, meaning that the hydrologic regimes for the plants should be evaluated for at least this period. Climate change effects are rarely included in present feasibility studies. Economic implications associated with climate change phenomena are higher in Mozambique than in neighboring countries as its future electricity demand to a large extent is forecasted to be met by hydropower. The large hydropower potential in Mozambique should as well be considered when investing in new power plants in southern Africa.

Current understanding of the impact of climate change on mental health within UK parliament	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						mental health; climate change; UK parliament; anxiety; flooding; eco-anxiety; climate policy	ANXIETY	There is growing evidence that climate change is linked to adverse mental health outcomes, with both direct and indirect impacts already being felt globally, including within the United Kingdom (UK). With the UK parliament tasked with passing legislation to mitigate against and adapt to climate change, it is well placed to take a lead in implementing policies that reduce the impact of climate change on mental health and even provide mental health benefits (e.g., by increasing access to green space). The extent to which the UK parliament considers the relationship between climate change and mental health in its decision-making was previously unknown. We report, through quantitative thematic analysis of the UK Hansard database, that the UK parliament has only infrequently made links between climate change and mental health. Where links have been made, the primary focus of the speeches were around flooding and anxiety. Key mental health impacts of climate change reported in the academic literature, such as high temperature and suicides, or experiences of eco-anxiety, were found to be missing entirely. Further, policies suggested in UK parliament to minimise the impact of climate change on mental health were focused on pushing adaptation measures such as flood defences rather than climate mitigation, indicating potential missed opportunities for effective policies with co-benefits for tackling climate change and mental health simultaneously. Therefore, this research suggests a need to raise awareness for UK policymakers of the costs of climate inaction on mental health, and potential co-benefits of climate action on mental health. Our results provide insight into where links have and have not been made to date, to inform targeted awareness raising and ultimately equip policymakers to protect the UK from the increasingly large impacts of climate change on mental health.

We apply the mean group estimator and separate short-run from long-run impacts. The results indicate long-run relationships between the housing/insurance market and climate change, although no significant impacts of climate change on these markets appear in the long-run. In the short-run, we find significant negative impacts of fire occurrences on housing prices and mortgage rates, and significant positive impacts of flooding on insurance markets. Further analysis of states exposed to severe climate risks indicates no short- or long-run impacts of climate change. Thus, while realtors and insurance providers may price some climate-risks into mortgage and insurance in the short-run, they do not in the long-run.

Due to the uncertainty of climate change, the responses of urban drainage systems to climate change are becoming more complicated. This complexity makes it difficult for decision makers to assess whether urban infrastructure is sufficiently resilient to cope with flood risks. In this study, the Xiao Zhai area, a high-density urban area of China, was used as an example. A quantitative method for assessing these risks and the resilience of urban drainage systems to future urban stormwater was developed. First, based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), the variation and uncertainty of future rainfall in the study area were analysed. A high-fidelity hydro-hydraulic model was developed to analyse the influence of climate change on future urban stormwater. Finally, the relationship between urban flood risk and the resilience of urban drainage systems was evaluated. The results show that the temporal distribution of future rainfall from 2023 to 2100 is relatively uniform. However, the number of heavy rainfall events increases significantly during this period. The flood risk caused by future rainfall was one level higher than the historical flood risk. For example, the flood risk caused by future 5a rainfall is equal to the flood risk from historical 10a rainfall. The correlations between the spatial distributions of flood risk and resilience are 0.49-0.63. Urban drainage systems urgently need to be improved and refined in areas with flood risk and low resilience to become more resilient to climate change. Rational planning of grey-green rainwater facilities in flood risk and low resilience areas can improve the rainwater system's resilience to 0.67-0.95 for climate change.

Inequities in the distribution of flood risk under floodplain restoration and climate change scenarios	PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Article						climate change; distributional equity; flood risk; floodplain restoration; height above nearest drainage; Lake Champlain Basin	NEAREST DRAINAGE; WETLAND LOSS; DAMAGE; HAND; HEIGHT; IMPACT	1. The combined impacts of climate change and ecological degradation are expected to worsen inequality within society. These dynamics are exemplified by increases in flood risk globally. In general, low-income and socially vulnerable populations disproportionately bear the cost of flood damages. Climate change is expected to increase the number of people exposed to fluvial flood risk and cause greater property damages. Floodplain restoration has the potential to mitigate these impacts, but the distribution of future risks among different types of property owners under these altered conditions is often unknown. 2. Here, we develop a simple probabilistic approach for estimating flood risk to property owners under floodplain restoration and climate change scenarios for a range of flood recurrence intervals. We apply this approach in the Vermont, USA portion of the Lake Champlain Basin. 3. Over a 100-year time horizon, we estimate that the value of property damages caused by flood inundation is approximately $2.13 billion under the baseline scenario. Climate change is expected to increase damages to $5.29 billion, a 148% increase; however, floodplain restoration has the potential to reduce these impacts by approximately 20%. 4. For all scenarios, a larger proportion of lower-value properties, specifically mobile homes, face greater flood risk compared to higher-value properties. Climate change is expected to cost higher-value properties and commercial properties more than other types of properties, but these same groups are also expected to benefit most from floodplain restoration. 5. In general, these results raise concern that those least able to prepare for and recover from flood damages are also the people who face the greatest threats. In response, public policy interventions must consider not only where flood risk is most severe, but also the vulnerability of people exposed to such risk.

Through interviews conducted in different provinces and regions, the research explores how gender influences climate change sensitivity, impacts on women, and the effectiveness of adaptation measures. The results show significant health disparities between men and women, with women suffering more from heat waves, cold snaps, and droughts. Livestock sectors face challenges such as water and pasture scarcity, affecting rural women's livelihoods. In agriculture, women encounter economic hardships, limited resources, and social barriers, amplifying climate change's adverse effects on their livelihoods. Food and water scarcity pose critical concerns, leading to malnutrition and health risks for women. In rural areas, energy crises force women to rely on harmful fuel sources, impacting their respiratory health, while urban settings restrict women's access to essential services. The study emphasizes the need for gender-responsive policies and women's participation in climate decision-making processes to build resilient communities. Policy implications include adaptation measures, women's inclusion, investment in rural livelihood support, disaster management, and promoting gender equality in climate governance. Raising awareness and education about climate change's gendered impacts is crucial for fostering resilience.

J	Li, HC; Hsiao, YH; Chang, CW; Chen, YM; Lin, LY				Li, Hsin-Chi; Hsiao, Yi-Hua; Chang, Chia-Wei; Chen, Yung-Ming; Lin, Lee-Yaw			Agriculture Adaptation Options for Flood Impacts under Climate Change-A Simulation Analysis in the Dajia River Basin	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; flood; agriculture; adaption; CBA		Adaptation to climate change has become an important matter of discussion in the world in response to the growing rate of global warming. In recent years, many countries have gradually adopted adaption strategies to climate change, with the aim of reducing the impact of climate variabilities. Taiwan is in a geographical location that is prone to natural disasters and is thus very vulnerable to climate change. To explore an appropriate method for Taiwan to adapt to climate change, this study took Dajia River Basin as the simulation site to explore the potential climate change impact in the area. An impact study was conducted to identify the trend of flooding under climate change scenarios. We used the SOBEK model to simulate downstream inundation caused by the worst typhoon event of the 20th century (1979-2003) and for typhoon events that might occur at the end of the 21st century (2075-2099) in Taiwan, according to the climate change scenario of representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) and dynamical downscaling rainfall data. Agricultural lands were found to be the most affected areas among all land types, and the flooded area was forecast to increase by 1.89 times by the end of 21st century, when compared to the end of 20th century. In this study, upland crops, which are affected the most by flooding, were selected as the adaptation targets for this site and multiple engineering and non-engineering options were presented to reduce the potential climate change impacts. With respect to the results, we found that all adaptation options, even when considering the cost, yield higher benefits than the "do-nothing" option. Among the adaptation options presented for this site, utilizing engineering methods with non-engineering methods show the best result in effectively reducing the impact of climate change, with the benefit-to-cost ratio being around 1.16. This study attempts to explore useful and effective assessment methods for providing sound scientific and economic evidence for the selection of adequate adaption options for flood impacts in agriculture in the planning phase.

Pakistan is among the most climate change affected countries having long history of floods incidence, faced major losses of lives and economic resources. Hence, it is crucial to be aware of flood risks and having climate change perception for developing adaptation strategies of climate change and feasible measures of flood risk reduction. Psychological distance and flood risk perception relating to climate change in flood-prone Bait areas of Punjab was investigated in this study. Awareness, worry and preparedness to flood were three major indicators to quantify perception of flood risk whereas uncertainty, temporal, social, geographical and psychological as five dimensions applied to measure psychological distance. This research work used the sample data of 398 flood-prone respondents and applied the Pearson's correlation, ANOVA test and chi-square test for empirical estimation of the study. Empirical estimates illustrated as in general flood risk perception and psychological distance related to climate change in high flood risk areas were moderate whereas in worry and uncertainty negative association was estimated. Home ownership illustrated positive and significant affect on flood risk perception whereas negative influence on psychological distance to climate change in the estimates of regression analysis. Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction philosophies can put together through facilitation of this study. Risk communications strategies need to develop to facilitate inhabitants to understand impacts of climate change, application of precautionary strategies and flood risks lessening measures.

Climate change impacts on cultural heritage: A literature review	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						climate change; impacts; natural hazards; risks; tangible cultural heritage	SEA-LEVEL RISE; UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE; BUILT HERITAGE; ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES; BUILDING-MATERIALS; RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; NATURAL HAZARDS; COASTAL EROSION; BEAUFORT SEA; SITES	Climate change, as revealed by gradual changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and wind intensity, as well as sea level rise and changes in the occurrence of extreme events, is already affecting cultural heritage sites. Accordingly, there is a rapidly increasing body of research reporting on the impacts of climatic stressors on cultural heritage and on the assessment of climate change impacts on cultural heritage assets. This review synthesizes the international literature on climate change impacts on tangible cultural heritage by developing hazard-impact diagrams focusing on the impacts of gradual changes in climate on: (1) the cultural heritage exposed to the outside environment, (2) the interiors of historical buildings and their collections, and (3) a third diagram associated with climate change and the impacts due to sudden changes in the natural physical environment (e.g., storm surges, floods and landslides, wildfire) in addition to sea level rise, permafrost thawing, desertification and changes in the properties of the oceans. These diagrams, which depict the relationships between various stressors and their impacts on cultural heritage, will allow other researchers, stakeholders, and potentially decision makers to determine the potential impacts of climate change on a specific cultural heritage asset without a separate examination of the literature. This review thus provides the current state-of-the-art on the impacts of climate change on the tangible, built heritage, that is, monuments, archeological sites, historical buildings, as well as their interiors and the collections they hold, highlights the limitations of previous research, and provides recommendations for further studies.

Attribution matters: Revisiting the link between extreme weather experience and climate change mitigation responses	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Climate change; Experience; Attribution; Risk perception; Extreme weather	RISK PERCEPTION; PERSONAL-EXPERIENCE; LOCAL WEATHER; TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; UNCERTAIN CLIMATE; WINTER; COMMUNICATION; IDEOLOGY; IDENTITY	The literature suggests that extreme weather experiences have potential to increase climate change engagement by influencing the way people perceive the proximity and implications of climate change. Yet, limited attention has been directed at investigating how individual differences in the subjective interpretation of extreme weather events as indications of climate change moderate the link between extreme weather experiences and climate change attitudes. This article contends that subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change is a necessary condition for extreme weather experiences to be translated into climate change mitigation responses, and that subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change is influenced by the psychological and social contexts in which individuals appraise their experiences with extreme weather. Using survey data gathered in the aftermath of severe flooding across the UK in winter 2013/2014, personal experience of this flooding event is shown to only directly predict perceived threat from climate change, and indirectly predict climate change mitigation responses, among individuals who subjectively attributed the floods to climate change. Additionally, subjective attribution of the floods to climate change is significantly predicted by pre-existing climate change belief, political affiliation and perceived normative cues. Attempts to harness extreme weather experiences as a route to engaging the public must be attentive to the heterogeneity of opinion on the attributability of extreme weather events to climate change.

Global warming is likely to cause the severe widespread emergencies: extreme heat, droughts, wildfires, water-related disasters (i.e., flooding, hurricanes and coastal storms), extreme snow, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Rising temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather events have led to secondary and tertiary consequences, e.g., social disruption, impoverishment and population displacement. Mental health risks of climate change include greater stress, stressrelated disorders, anxiety, despair, depression, and suicidal ideation. Those risks can stem from climate-related natural disasters (e.g., extreme weather events), slower moving events (e.g., drought), or concern about the phenomenon of climate change itself. A focus on the impact of climate change on mental health can help enhance the understanding of factors that strengthen psychosocial resilience and adaptation, as well as design tailor-made local interventions. Proper psychosocial adaptation strategies for the upcoming mental health challenges of climate change require development of social capital and strengthening of institutional systems.

Some castles and fortifications have a high level of structural instability due to their high exposure to changing environmental conditions, especially those in direct contact with the sea. This article focuses on identifying the level of risk posed by climate change to coastal fortifications in the Canary Islands. The methodology implemented identifies the exposure and vulnerability of these fortifications, based on a scorecard assigning values of risk to rising sea levels. Four risk categories were selected based on their exposure to either coastal flooding, coastal erosion or coastline retreat, and taking into account its sensitivity through a structural analysis of buildings. There are currently fifteen coastal fortifications from the Early Modern Period in this archipelago and two have been identified as being especially threatened by rising sea levels. Results highlight a need to increase their adaptive capacity, incorporating changes in legislation, including climate change adaptation measures as a basic strategy in cultural heritage management. Options such as the construction of submerged defenses or dikes in order to dissipate the force of the waves could be successful adaptation measures, considered from the perspective of preserving both the landscape and the environment of these historical sites. This assessment provides support to policy makers for the management of coastal fortifications in the context of climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

In a region where the main activities are fishing, farming, and livestock production, coastal flooding has led to the salinization of the Senegal River and has contaminated local land and groundwater, destroying the homes and livelihoods of local populations. Faced with this environmental degradation, migration has become a component of the inhabitants' adaptation strategy. After presenting the specific environmental and migration context of Gandiol, this article presents a typology of migration's impacts on climate change adaptation strategies. Migrant remittances are used in several ways (to diversify income sources, to optimize investments, or to protect against future risks) and provide a means for women to develop their economic activity.

Despite the large part it plays in the economy, it faces significant challenges caused by climate change, such as rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and yield losses. In Pakistan, rice, which is the second most essential food crop and livelihood source for the millions of farm households, is facing significant yield reduction due to climate change. It is pertinent to consider the vulnerabilities of farm households and related factors to create a climatic-resilient farming system. The current study is aimed at mapping the vulnerability of rice-growing communities of Punjab province while considering climatic challenges beyond temperatures and rainfall changes. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) was calculated for four rice-growing districts of Punjab province using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's three-indicator approach (sensitivity, exposition, and adaptive capacity). According to the results, farmers in the study area are highly vulnerable to climate change (CCVI 0.81). Specifically, the indices of vulnerability components showed that farmers have a high level of exposure (EVI 0.72) and susceptibility (SVI 0.59) to the climatic uncertainties with the least adaptive capacity (AVI 0.50). Further, the vulnerability analysis across different rice-growing regions showed that farmers, particularly in the low-yield region, are more vulnerable (EVI 0.73, SVI 0.61, AVI 0.49, CCVI 0.85) than the farmers in the high-yield region (EVI 0.71, SVI 0.58, AVI 0.51, CCVI 0.78). These findings imply that regional priority must be given despite the difference in farm performance to reduce production losses. Besides, climate-smart adaptation initiatives should be facilitated at the farm and regional levels through the implementation of appropriate policies and investment plans.

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Drainage modeling; Urban flooding; Diffuse pollution	COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; WATER-QUALITY; FLOOD RISK; LAND-USE; IMPACTS; URBANIZATION; POLLUTION; DRAINAGE; ADAPTATION	Climate change increases the uncertainties associated with the future urban stormwater management. This study employed the Personal Computer Stormwater Management Model to evaluate the impact of climate change on problems associated with stormwater management at the city scale. These include urban flooding, non-point source (NPS) pollution, and combined sewer overflow (CSO) pollution. Multiple methods were adopted to overcome the difficulties when building credible modellings. Time partitioning and sectional difference were used during the calibration of hydrological and hydraulic parameters. The groundwater/river infiltration was assessed via extensive monitoring. The field rainfall simulator system was used to determine NPS parameters. Promising adaptions of sponge city construction in response to climate change were further evaluated. The adaption strategies were set in strict accordance with the "Sponge City Construction Systematization Program". The results showed that future climate change will increase the urban flooding risk, both NPS and CSO pollution loads, and will worsen river water quality. Sponge city construction was demonstrated to be a no-regrets adaption strategy toward the reduction of the combined pressures induced by changing climate. However, the adaptability was insufficient and varies largely with regard to concentration pathways, rainfall intensities, and pollutants. In best case scenarios, the flooding risk as well as diffuse pollution loads can be decreased to or below their current level under future climate change. However, the current level needs to be considered, since the urban drainage function was far from sufficient and the water quality was very poor. The increased NPS pollution risk was noticed after sponge city construction. Especially, for chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids, the increased NPS loads could even offset the decreased CSO pollution loads. Thus, flexibility is suggested to be allowed in the design of storm-drainage and pollution-control measures in future urban stormwater management.

Ghana's coastal lagoons provide unique ecosystem services. However, they are highly fragile and vulnerable to natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Climate Change impacts, such as increased temperatures, sea-level rise, storm surge and increased precipitation are likely to have ecological damage to lagoon ecosystems as a result of erosion, submergence of lagoon barriers, flooding and drying of the surrounding wetlands. Field observation, Geographic Information System modeling were among the methodology applied. The paper identified that anthropogenic activities and Climate Change would combine to have a serious future impact on lagoon ecosystems. Particularly, increased rainfall-induced flooding from the hinterland may be very injurious to the lagoon ecosystem, since the flood water may carry not only nutrients but also various contaminants and solid plastic waste generated by human activities around lagoons catchment into the lagoon channels. Besides, due to the barriers across most lagoon inlets, such polluted runoff water may not be able to flush out to sea, thus impacting negatively on the water quality of the lagoons. The paper proposes some adaptation strategies and recommends the early implementation of Climate Change adaptation strategies, coastal lagoon management measures to prevent potential future destructive impacts.

Clarifying the features of climate change risks helps us to further understand and cope with climate change. There lacks a systematic review of climate change risks in terms of feature extraction and classification. The bibliometric analysis can be used to analyze and extract climate change risk features. The literature in the field of climate change was searched in the Web of Science database. Coauthors, citations, bibliographic coupling, co-citations, and keyword co-occurrence were analyzed. From five dimensions including nature, politics, economy, society, and culture, the risk features of climate change were extracted and summarized. Through text mining and cluster analysis, the climate change risk feature system was established, which is embodied in five different aspects: ecosystem and sustainability; uncertainty, vulnerability, and efficiency; behavior and decision-making; governance and management; and adaptation and mitigation. The feature system reflects that the current climate change risk presents strong variability and that the risk boundary is gradually blurred. The areas affected by risk are expanding and deepening. The strategies and governance for addressing risks are gradually diversified. This research contributes to the domain of climate change risk identification and assessment. The features of climate change indicate that we need to adjust policymaking and managerial practices for climate change in the future. Interdisciplinary cooperation, human cognition and preferences, public participation in global governance, and other unnatural factors related to climate change should be strengthened with a more positive attitude.

This paper studies different climate change adaptation strategies by analysing the measures adopted by stakeholders in charge of government policy development and implementation to minimise the impacts of climate change in the northern tropical region of Queensland, Australia. Local government organisations are responsible for taking a leading role in climate change adaptation. State and commonwealth government agencies are primarily responsible for developing climate transition policies and guidelines, as well as providing limited financial aid to help support the local government. Interviews were conducted with local government practitioners identified from different local government authorities in the study region. Although all the government bodies made some progress in developing better climate change adaptation policies, the interview participants identified that a lot more needs to be done, especially in implementation, including devising and the application of relevant action plans, economic assessments, stakeholder participations and engagement. From a local government practitioners' viewpoint, both the water sector and local economy will face the highest immediate impacts if climate change adaptation actions are not adequately implemented at local government level in the study region. There are currently no notable legal bindings to address climate change risks in the region. In addition, financial liability assessments due to climate risks and cost-share mechanisms among different levels of stakeholders and government authorities to face and prepare for climate change impacts hardly exist. Although the interview respondents recognise their high importance. As there are uncertainties in the achievements of climate change adaptation plans, from a local government practitioners' standpoint, the local authorities should take appropriate actions to integrate adaptation and mitigation works to face and prepare for climate risks rather than focusing only on adaptation. The respondents informed that some work has been done to identify flood prone areas and a few policy documents exist that accommodate sea level rise in planning practice, but these are done in fragments with no holistic implementation, monitoring or evaluation plans put in place.

All these phenological effects alert engineers, planners and administrators to be more sensitive against climate change-based risk effects on water structures. Vulnerability to natural disasters such as floods and droughts are expected to occur more frequent than past. Therefore, design and potential evaluation of water structures such as transmission channels, water wells, dams and hydraulic power generation facilities need to be re-evaluation. This re-evaluations procedure must be updated by taking into consideration climate change impacts with their risk assessments. For this purpose, the climate change-based risk levels are calculated from historically available records through possible trend tendencies, which are expressed in terms of trend slope. It has been observed that, in general, the climate change impacts are not significant on precipitation and runoff This is due to the low trend slopes in the standardized hydro-meteorological time series. This point has been documented for Yesilirmak basin, where the climate change impact is very limited.

Direct and indirect health impacts of climate change on the vulnerable elderly population in East China	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS			English	Review						climate change; East China; elderly; health impacts; flooding; heat waves	AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; JIANGSU PROVINCE; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; FOOD SECURITY; DUST STORMS; HEAT WAVES; MORTALITY; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHT; DISEASE	The latest scientific advances on the impacts of climate change on the health of the elderly in East China were reviewed consulting peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to 2017. The direct impacts of climate change result from rising temperatures, heat waves, and increases in the frequency of complex extreme weather events such as windstorms, floods, and droughts. The health and social consequences of these events are far reaching, ranging from reduced labour productivity and heat-related deaths through to direct physical injury during extreme weather events, the spread of infectious diseases, and mental health effects following widespread flooding or prolonged drought. Research has indicated that climate change will have the greatest impact on vulnerable groups of people, including the elderly population. However, there is a dearth of empirical evidence, a lack of focus on vulnerable segments of the population (especially elderly), limited understanding of how health status will change in the future, and lack of acknowledgement of how different regions in China vary in terms of the consequences of climate change. The main risk in East China that climate change may exacerbate is flooding (sea level rise, coastal and riverine, flood risk). However in some regions of East China such as in the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong the biggest climate change risk is considered to be drought. Main health risks linked to climate change are evident as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (heat stroke, exhaustion, and asthma), often caused by interactions between heat wave episodes and concurrent poor air quality.

There are still insufficient studies on rainfall, streamflow, and future floods in the Upper Nan Watershed, northern Thailand. This study examined how future climate change will affect the rainfall, streamflow, and flooding in the Upper Nan Watershed. SWAT and HEC-RAS models were utilized to assess the future streamflow and flooding in this area. The models used data from 1980-2020, which were taken from seven Upper Nan meteorological stations and two discharge stations. In this study, the impact of future climate change was predicted using three GCMs, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The historical data analyzed in this study indicated that rainfall in the study area has a positive trend. Climate change will increase further, from 18% to 19%, which will cause more fluctuations and lead to wetter conditions, both in the wet and dry seasons. Climate change delayed the hydrograph peak and the SWAT-modelled streamflow in the N1 and N64 stations by between 0.3% and 5.1%. RCP8.5 inundated all of the stations more than RCP4.5. Our models showed that in the medium future (2041-2060), the inundated area will be similar to that during the 100-year flood probability. Thus, monitoring and preparation are necessary to avoid repeating the considerable 2011 flood losses in Thailand.

This phenomenon negatively affects the resilience of ecosystem functions in the face of unexpected impacts, particularly climate change. An approach is required for combining resilience with management in a Wetland City. This study aims to model the resilience of ecosystem functions for climate change adaptation management in a Wetland City via system dy-namics from 2021 to 2100. First, we set a system boundary through expert interviews to identify the main issues in the social-ecological system of a Wetland City. Second, we constructed a social-ecological system of a Wetland City that provides ecosystem function trade-offs between flood control and wildlife habitat provisioning. Then, we simulated the resilience of ecosystem functions according to different climate change adaptative management scenarios. Finally, we determined an appropriate scenario for minimizing the impacts of ecosystem function trade-offs reinforced by climate change. As a result, we recommend that the water level should be managed such that the controlled flood water level ranges from 12 to 14 m and that 30% of the willow areas should be thinned each year. Based on these simulation results, we proposed three climate change adaptive management strategies: considering long-term plans including short-term effects, networking with multiscale community participation, and applying sustainable wetland management to urban planning. Ultimately, this study can contribute to planning and management guidelines for a Wetland City.

Design/methodology/approach A double approach, both quantitative and qualitative, of social representation theory was adopted. The data collection was undertaken in two phases. First, the content and organization of social representation of climate change (SRCC) was examined with a quantitative study of 946 participants for both countries, followed by a qualitative study of 63 participants for both countries also. Findings The study finds unicity in the SRCC for the quantitative study. In contrast, the qualitative study highlights differences at the level of the institutional anchoring of the climate change phenomenon in these two different socioeconomic and political contexts. Practical implications These results are relevant for a reflection in terms of public policies for the prevention and management of collective natural risks, as well as for the promotion of ecological behavior adapted to political and ideological contexts. Originality/value The use of a multi-methodological approach (quantitative and qualitative) in the same research is valuable to confirm the importance of an in-depth study of the social representations of climate change because of the complexity of the phenomenon.

J	Withey, P; Sullivan, D; Lantz, V				Withey, Patrick; Sullivan, Deny; Lantz, Van			Willingness to pay for protection from storm surge damages under climate change in Halifax Regional Municipality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Contingent valuation; Climate change: Sea-level rise; Storm surge: Halifax Regional Municipality	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SAMPLE SELECTION; COASTAL WETLANDS; ECONOMIC COSTS; FLOOD; REDUCTION; ESTIMATOR; VALUATION; MITIGATION; IMPACTS	Climate change poses risks to coastal cities due to sea-level rise and changes in storm surge. Using the contingent valuation method and payment card format, this paper seeks to estimate residents of Halifax Regional Municipality's willingness to pay (WTP) for protection from flooding impacts from storm surge. The contribution of this study is the application of this method in a previously unstudied region, to understand individuals' perception of risk and WTP to avoid damage, in order to inform policy aimed at protecting against damage due to sea-level rise and storm surge. WTP is estimated without and with the expectation of future climate change, and also for public vs. private goods. Data is analyzed and compared using OLS, Heckman two-step and Tobit Interval regression models. Results suggest that on average, WTP is roughly $12 per month per household over a ten-year period without the expectation of climate change, and roughly $13 per month per household assuming climate change will have negative impacts in the region. Individuals are most often willing to pay to protect against damages to public infrastructure, as well as power outages. Income and education do not play a major role in individuals WTP. Vulnerability to flooding and level of concern related to risky events have a statistically significant impact on WTP in all models, and gender and age have an impact on WTP in some models.

Characterized by worldwide alterations in weather patterns, along with a concomitant increase in the temperature of the Earth, climate change will undoubtedly have significant effects on food security and food safety. Climate change engenders climate variability: significant variations in weather variables and their frequency. Both climate variability and climate change are thought to threaten the safety of the food supply chain through different pathways. One such pathway is the ability to exacerbate foodborne diseases by influencing the occurrence, persistence, virulence and, in some cases, toxicity of certain groups of disease-causing microorganisms. Food safety can also be compromised by various chemical hazards, such as pesticides, mycotoxins, and heavy metals. With changes in weather patterns, such as lower rainfall, higher air temperature, and higher frequency of extreme weather events among others, this translates to emerging food safety concerns. These include the shortage of safe water for irrigation of agricultural produce, greater use of pesticides due to pest resistance, increased difficulty in achieving a wellcontrolled cold chain resulting in temperature abuse, or the occurrence of flash floods, which cause runoff of chemical contaminants in natural water courses. Together, these can result in foodborne infection, intoxication, antimicrobial resistance, and long-term bioaccumulation of chemicals and heavy metals in the human body. Furthermore, severe climate variability can result in extreme weather events and natural calamities, which directly or indirectly impair food safety. This review discusses the causes and impacts of climate change and variability on existing and emerging food safety risks and also considers mitigation and adaptation strategies to address the global warming and climate change problem.

The hydrologic model used in this study was the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) coupled with improved wetland modules. Model uncertainty was represented using 12 parameter sets (PARs) with acceptable model performance. Different projections of future climate conditions (eight global circulation models [GCMs] under three representative concentration pathways [RCPs]) were used to represent climate change uncertainty. The ensemble method and analysis of variance were adopted for uncertainty assessment. The results showed that monthly streamflow projections did not substantially differ with respect to individual PARs, GCMs, and RCPs; by contrast, the projected NFW water storage varied significantly. However, the changes in projected hydrological values relative to historic conditions greatly differed with regard to the PARs, GCMs, and RCPs, leading to a high uncertainty in assessing climate change impacts. The variability of GCM projections was the most significant single contributor, accounting for 46% and 49% of the total streamflow and NFW water storage projection uncertainties, respectively, followed by PARs and RCPs. Our work assessed the impacts of different uncertainty sources on NFW hydrology under climate change, suggesting careful consideration of model and climate change uncertainties for the reliable projections of NFW hydrologic behaviors.

Relationships between climate change perceptions and climate adaptation actions: policy support, information seeking, and behaviour	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change perceptions; Adaptation; Heatwaves; Information seeking; Policy support	ENGAGEMENT; METAANALYSES; DETERMINANTS; MOTIVATION; IDEOLOGY; BELIEF; RISK	People are increasingly exposed to climate-related hazards, including floods, droughts, and vector-borne diseases. A broad repertoire of adaptation actions is needed to adapt to these various hazards. It is therefore important to identify general psychological antecedents that motivate people to engage in many different adaptation actions, in response to different hazards, and in different contexts. We examined if people's climate change perceptions act as such general antecedents. Questionnaire studies in the Netherlands (n = 3,546) and the UK (n = 803) revealed that the more people perceive climate change as real, human-caused, and having negative consequences, the more likely they are to support adaptation policy and to seek information about local climate impacts and ways to adapt. These relationships were stronger and more consistent when the information and policies were introduced as measures to adapt to risks of climate change specifically. However, the three types of climate change perceptions were inconsistently associated with intentions to implement adaptation behaviours (e.g. installing a green roof). This suggests that climate change perceptions can be an important gateway for adaptation actions, especially policy support and information seeking, but that it may be necessary to address additional barriers in order to fully harness the potential of climate change perceptions to promote widespread adaptation behaviour.

Here, we aimed to evaluate and compare the hydrological alterations caused by dams and climate change throughout the Omaru River catchment, Japan, using a distributed hydrological model (DHM). First, to assess the impacts of dam and climate change independently, we performed runoff analyses using either dam discharge or future climatic data (two future periods, 2031-2050 and 2081-2100 x three representative concentration pathways). Subsequently, we derived indicators of hydrologic alterations (IHA) to quantify changes in flow alterations by comparing them to IHA under natural conditions (i.e., without dam or climate change data). We found that dams altered IHAs more than climate change. However, on a catchment-scale standpoint, climate change induced wider ranges of flow alterations, such as a further decrease in low flow metrics along the tributaries and uppermost main stem, suggesting a catchment-level shrinkage in important corridors of aquatic organisms. We also observed that the altered flow by water withdrawals was ameliorated by the confluence of tributaries and downstream hydropower outflows. Our approach using a DHM captured the various patterns of flow alterations by dams and climate change.

The frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones are affected by anthropogenic climate change. However, the effect of historical climate change on displacement risk has so far not been quantified. Here, we show how displacement can be partially attributed to climate change using the example of the 2019 Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique. We estimate the population exposed to high water levels following Idai's landfall using a combination of a 2D hydrodynamical storm surge model and a flood depth estimation algorithm to determine inland flood depths from remote sensing images, factual (climate change) and counterfactual (no climate change) mean sea level, and maximum wind speed conditions. Our main estimates indicate that climate change has increased displacement risk from this event by approximately 12 600-14 900 additional displaced persons, corresponding to about 2.7 % to 3.2 % of the observed displacements. The isolated effect of wind speed intensification is double that of sea level rise. These results are subject to important uncertainties related to both data and modeling assumptions, and we perform multiple sensitivity experiments to assess the range of uncertainty where possible. Besides highlighting the significant effects on humanitarian conditions already imparted by climate change, our study provides a blueprint for event-based displacement attribution.

J	Devendiran, DK; Banerjee, S; Mondal, A				Devendiran, Dinesh Kumar; Banerjee, Swagata; Mondal, Arpita			Impact of Climate Change on Multihazard Performance of River-Crossing Bridges: Risk, Resilience, and Adaptation	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article						Bridge; Multihazard; Climate change; Risk; Resilience; Adaptation	HYDROLOGY; FLUXES; WATER	Enhanced flood hazard due to global warming and climate change imposes an additional threat to safety and serviceability of river crossing bridges. This study proposes an integrated approach to assess how climate change might affect bridge performance under multihazard conditions involving floods and earthquakes. The approach is used for an existing bridge spanning over the San Joaquin River, California. The multihazard impact considering climate change is evaluated in terms of risk and resilience of the bridge. Future flood projections under climate change are obtained from general circulation model simulations in conjunction with a macroscale hydrological model. Enhanced intensities of future design floods are observed to cause higher expected scour at around bridge piers. This resulted in significant rise in risk (-21%) and drop in resilience (-14%) of the bridge, when compared to no climate change scenario, at a specific seismic hazard level. To reduce possible consequences, ripraps are applied around piers as a climate change adaptation measure. Size of the riprap is determined based on the maximum expected design flood flow at the bridge site over the projection period. The applied adaptive measure is observed to be cost-effective through a cost-benefit analysis performed over the remaining bridge service life. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Taylor, S				Taylor, Steven			Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead: Introduction to the special issue	JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS			English	Article						Climate change; Pandemics; Anxiety; Anxiety disorders; Resilience; Treatment		Climate change involves (1) increases in the prevalence of extreme weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, hurricanes), (2) more gradual climatic changes (e.g., rising sea levels, desertification), and (3) increased risks of pandemics and other widespread disease outbreaks. Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce one's carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.

J	Memon, MH; Aamir, N; Ahmed, N				Memon, Manzoor Hussain; Aamir, Naveed; Ahmed, Nadeem			Climate Change and Adaptation: Exploring Drivers of Community and Gender-Disaggregated Social Vulnerability	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Asia; Flood events; Climate change; Climate variability; Adaptation; Vulnerability		Climate change has forced the world into a state of emergency, but the urgency can also become an oppor-tunity to strengthen the focus on sustainable development and reduce social vulnerability. For developing economies, the first and foremost challenge regarding climate change is to address the knowledge gap on sustainable development and vul-nerability. Besides this, evidence-based inputs are needed for the policies and programs that intend to enhance the adaptive capacity and social capital from the gender perspective in comparatively more disaster-prone districts of the country. The environmental impact in terms of socioeconomic conditions specifically pertaining to rural areas of Pakistan cannot be ig-nored. Natural events such as floods and droughts have raised the question of the social and socioeconomic vulnerability of the rural communities. This paper is an attempt toward understanding that everyone who is affected will be impacted differ-ently by climate change both within the same gender and between different genders, including gender minorities. In addition, an attempt is made to identify the drivers of gender-disaggregated social vulnerability in selected disaster-prone rural commu-nities of the district of Dadu, Sindh Province, Pakistan. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques are employed to examine the differences in gender perception on climate change, experiences related to climate change, disasters, and impacts on their lives. Women and households headed by them are found to be relatively more vulnerable due to their socioeconomic and social status in the rural areas of Pakistan. The paper gives policy directives that not only address the measures for reduction in climate change impacts but also suggest the development of effective disaster management programs, policies, and strategies.

While several initiatives have addressed the impacts of climate change in parts of the EMME, here we present an updated assessment, covering a wide range of timescales, phenomena and future pathways. Our assessment is based on a revised analysis of recent observations and projections and an extensive overview of the recent scientific literature on the causes and effects of regional climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions in the EMME are growing rapidly, surpassing those of the European Union, hence contributing significantly to climate change. Over the past half-century and especially during recent decades, the EMME has warmed significantly faster than other inhabited regions. At the same time, changes in the hydrological cycle have become evident. The observed recent temperature increase of about 0.45 degrees C per decade is projected to continue, although strong global greenhouse gas emission reductions could moderate this trend. In addition to projected changes in mean climate conditions, we call attention to extreme weather events with potentially disruptive societal impacts. These include the strongly increasing severity and duration of heatwaves, droughts and dust storms, as well as torrential rain events that can trigger flash floods. Our review is complemented by a discussion of atmospheric pollution and land-use change in the region, including urbanization, desertification and forest fires. Finally, we identify sectors that may be critically affected and formulate adaptation and research recommendations toward greater resilience of the EMME region to climate change.

J	Elum, ZA; Snijder, M				Elum, Zelda Anne; Snijder, Mieke			Climate change perception and adaptation among farmers in coastal communities of Bayelsa State, Nigeria: a photovoice study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptation; Coastal; Climate change; Farmers; Photovoice; Perception; Risk	STRATEGIES; IMPACTS; RISKS	PurposeThere is an increasing need for greater awareness and understanding of the risks climate change poses to farming communities so as to inform appropriate adaptive responses. The purpose of this study is to investigate farmers' climate change impacts, awareness, risk perception and current adaptation strategies adopted to deal with the impacts of climate change on their livelihood. Design/methodology/approachThis research was undertaken with 67 farmers in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. This study used a combination of focus group discussion and quantitative survey to obtain data. Surveyed farmers were invited to an initial workshop and asked to take photos of climate change impacts on their land and the adaptation strategies being adopted. The photos were analysed and discussed with the farmers in a second workshop. Then, in a third workshop, farmers and other stakeholders came together to rank the most important consequences of climate change and shared knowledge on adaptation strategies. The survey and photovoice data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. FindingsThe results of this study showed that a majority of the farmers were knowledgeable of climate change, mostly got climate information through media. Floods and high temperatures were perceived as the most occurring climate change-related disaster risks. Majority of the farmers perceived climate change as high risk and have taken up multiple adaptation strategies in response to it, including changing planting times, mulching their land and digging irrigation pits. Farmers' responses indicated that they want to do more but are restricted by financial resources. Practical implicationsThis study outcomes provide evidence for a need to consider stakeholders' participation in planning climate change responses to effectively address the challenges posed by climate change, particularly in coastal agricultural communities. Government and relevant agencies as recommended need to support farmers to undertake needed adaptive strategies to adapt with future flooding, high temperature and drought, providing them with necessary facilities to enhance their adaptive capacities. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this was one of the first studies to use photovoice to investigate climate change awareness, impacts and adaptations strategies with majority female farmers in west Africa. This study highlights the importance of participatory approaches to capture grassroots climate adaptation approaches.

Results from the qualitative fieldwork show that climatic changes have been accompanied by increases in climate change extremes (CCEs) over the last three decades. In order to adapt, smallholder farmers use improved crop varieties and other support strategies. Paradoxically, however, CCEs have undermined these strategies in several instances, causing crop yields to fall short of their actual potential and leading to financial indebtedness. Therefore, the results showcase that overcoming non-climatic barriers to the uptake of agricultural adaptation strategies is a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving successful adaptation outcomes. This is the case since new barriers to the adaptation process are constantly emerging, and CCEs are an example of this.

Climate Change and Mental Health: A Scoping Review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						global health; climate; mental disorders; environmental health	INCREASE SUICIDE RATES; TEMPERATURES INCREASE; HEAT WAVES; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; MORTALITY; DROUGHT; NUNATSIAVUT; IMPACTS; PERSPECTIVES; SOLASTALGIA	Climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations. This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation's (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities-assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Climate change alters rainfall patterns which have a great impact on river flow. Annual flooding is an important hydrological characteristic of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and it drives the high productivity of the ecosystem and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap floodplain and the Mekong Delta. This study aims to assess the impacts of climate change on river flow in the MRB and flood inundation in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). The changing impacts were assessed by a two-dimensional rainfall-runoff and inundation model (RRI model). The present climate (1979-2003) and future projected climate (2075-2099) datasets from MRI-AGCM3.2H and MRI-AGCM3.2S models were applied with a linear scaling bias correction method before input into the RRI model. The results of climate change suggested that flood magnitude in the LMB will be severer than the present climate by the end of the twenty-first century. The increment of precipitation between 6.6 and 14.2% could lead to increase extreme flow (Q(5)) 13-30%, peak inundation area 19-43%, and peak inundation volume 24-55% in the LMB for ranging of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and sea surface temperature (SST) scenarios while there is no significant change on peak flood timing.

J	Ferencuhová, S				Ferencuhova, Slavomira			Not so<i>global</i>climate change? Representations of post-socialist cities in the academic writings on climate change and urban areas	EURASIAN GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Climate change; cities; post-socialism; urban theory	CHANGE ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; POOR; CITY; SUSTAINABILITY; VULNERABILITY; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; BUCHAREST; POLITICS	Climate change is the epitome of a global issue. Cities and their inhabitants face locally specific, yet still globally shared and interconnected problems from heat waves, storms, coastal or fluvial floods to water scarcity, all of which puts pressure on their infrastructure as well as social institutions. Yet, it has been argued that academic research on cities and climate change has so far represented the urban world fractionally, as most case studies of cities are from the developed world. Moreover, urban scholars have been criticized for not being able to fully grasp the transformations that cities are undergoing, nor being able to apply critical urban theory to this field. This article uses these stimuli to critically review current internationally published research on "post-socialist cities" in the context of climate change. It observes how empirical research in this multidisciplinary area is, first, still relatively scarce and especially very recent, and second, that it is largely disconnected from conceptual debates led in urban studies. I argue that this underdeveloped discussion not only slows down development of a more critical academic perspective on the issue that would be based in urban studies of Central and East European cities, but it can also impact how responses to climate change are thought through by local actors.

This article provides a comprehensive review on the impact of hyposalinity stress caused by torrential rains on the physiology and immunity of marine bivalves. From field observations to laboratory experiments, multiple lines of evidence have shown that marine bivalves can withstand the impact of hyposalinity stress through behavioural and biochemical responses. However, extremely low salinity stress or long-term exposure to moderate hyposalinity can have a negative impact on their reproduction and immunity. In severe cases, exceeding their lethal tolerance will lead to mass mortality of marine bivalves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most complete article to review the impact of hyposalinity stress caused by climate change on marine bivalves. This review is helpful to clarify the current state of research and determine the research direction for the impact of hyposalinity stress caused by climate change on marine bivalves in the future.

The country has experienced severe floods and droughts during recent decades. The agricultural sector in Pakistan is adversely affected by climate change. This systematic review paper set out to analyze the existing literature on adaptation measures at the farm level toward climate change in Pakistan. Adopting a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, a total of 62 articles were identified from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The review paper indicates that the main adaptation strategies adopted by farmers are as follows: changing cropping practices, changing farm management techniques, advanced land use management practices, and nonagriculture livelihood options. Further, this review shows the factors influencing the farmer's adaptation measures to climate change. Influencing factors were examined and classified into three groups: demographic, socioeconomic, and resources and institutional. Barriers hindering farmers' adaptive capacity were identified as lack of access to information and knowledge, lack of access to extension services, lack of access to credit facility, and lack of farm resources.

The 2022 report of the <i>MJA</i>-<i>Lancet</i> Countdown on health and climate change: Australia unprepared and paying the price	MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Editorial Material						Climate change; Population health; Health communication; Health financing; Health policy; Risk management; Morbidity; Mortality	MENTAL-HEALTH; QUEENSLAND; WEATHER; TRENDS	The MJA-Lancet Countdown on health and climate change in Australia was established in 2017 and produced its first national assessment in 2018 and annual updates in 2019, 2020 and 2021. It examines five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. In this, the fifth year of the MJA-Lancet Countdown, we track progress on an extensive suite of indicators across these five domains, accessing and presenting the latest data and further refining and developing our analyses. Within just two years, Australia has experienced two unprecedented national catastrophes - the 2019-2020 summer heatwaves and bushfires and the 2021-2022 torrential rains and flooding. Such events are costing lives and displacing tens of thousands of people. Further, our analysis shows that there are clear signs that Australia's health emergency management capacity substantially decreased in 2021. We find some signs of progress with respect to health and climate change. The states continue to lead the way in health and climate change adaptation planning, with the Victorian plan being published in early 2022. At the national level, we note progress in health and climate change research funding by the National Health and Medical Research Council. We now also see an acceleration in the uptake of electric vehicles and continued uptake of and employment in renewable energy. However, we also find Australia's transition to renewables and zero carbon remains unacceptably slow, and the Australian Government's continuing failure to produce a national climate change and health adaptation plan places the health and lives of Australians at unnecessary risk today, which does not bode well for the future.

Drawing on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory lens, we examine the impact of manmade actions on climate change in District "Swat" and "Malakand" of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, Pakistan using a sequential mixed methods research design. Through this research design, the results of quantitative survey were complemented with a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews. In first phase, we conducted a survey of 200 tenant farmers, followed by second wave of data collection involving 12 open-ended in-depth interviews (IDIs). The both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that farmers in both districts are affected by climate change although their crop yield had progressively increased signaling better coping and survival skills than other parts of country. Majority of respondents believed that climate change is something beyond their control in disagreement with AGW theory. Major economic losses were specifically, due to sudden alterations in weather patterns, such as floods, and hailstorms that reduce productivity as well as results in food waste with no avenues available to reclaim the energy laden in organic food waste. Besides, a productivity loss was attributed to outdated farming, lack of awareness regarding sharecropping and crop loan insurance practices. The study concludes that farmers are most vulnerable to climate change in socioeconomic terms as such changes impact their income sources; This inwardly compels cash strapped tenant farmers to delve in practice of informal credit with substantive risks attached which further deteriorates their livelihoods. The study offers understanding of how low-literate and economically marginalized indigenous tenant farmers cope to climate change and offers policy recommendations to advocate for the rights to earn sustainable livelihoods in the face of grand climate challenge.

MOENCH; FLOWERING DROUGHT TOLERANCE; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SEASON COLD TOLERANCE; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; SOIL-MOISTURE STRESS; GRAIN-SORGHUM; CARBON-DIOXIDE; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; STARCH BIOSYNTHESIS	Main conclusion Global food insecurity concerns due to climate change, emphasizes the need to focus on the sensitivity of sorghum to climate change and potential crop improvement strategies available, which is discussed in the current review to promote climate-smart agriculture. Climate change effects immensely disturb the global agricultural systems by reducing crop production. Changes in extreme weather and climate events such as high-temperature episodes and extreme rainfalls events, droughts, flooding adversely affect the production of staple food crops, posing threat to ecosystem resilience. The resulting crop losses lead to food insecurity and poverty and question the sustainable livelihoods of small farmer communities, particularly in developing countries. In view of this, it is essential to focus and adapt climate-resilient food crops which need lower inputs and produce sustainable yields through various biotic and abiotic stress-tolerant traits. Sorghum, "the camel of cereals", is one such climate-resilient food crop that is less sensitive to climate change vulnerabilities and also an important staple food in many parts of Asia and Africa. It is a rainfed crop and provides many essential nutrients. Understanding sorghum's sensitivity to climate change provides scope for improvement of the crop both in terms of quantity and quality and alleviates food and feed security in future climate change scenarios. Thus, the current review focused on understanding the sensitivity of sorghum crop to various stress events due to climate change and throws light on different crop improvement strategies available to pave the way for climate-smart agriculture.

This present research aims to explore the farm households' beliefs, risk perception, adaptive attitude and climate change adaptation measures that they currently utilize in their farms to cope with climatic risks. Further, this study analyzed effect of climate change belief, awareness and adaptive attitudes on farmers' adaptive behavior. By using structured questionnaire, the data from 816 respondents were collected from seven provinces of Vietnam. We used ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression approach to analyze farmers' belief, perception of climatic change, and risk attitude towards climatic hazards. Results revealed that farmers in the study area are using the most common climatic risk management strategies including applying new technologies, adjustment of the seasonal calendar, and diversification. Findings further revealed that that farm households were mostly concerned about the risk in soil erosion and washout, followed by the stress of prolonging dry season and droughts. The study participants also reported a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature and frequency and incidence of other extreme climatic events. A positive significant relationship was found between farm management practices and ecological communities. Risk perceptions and attitude toward climate change are essential factors among farm households of northern mountains of Vietnam. Thus, the climate strain linked with the institutional stress and socio-economic has serious insinuations for farm households' livelihood bases, a universal climate change adaptation scheme is required to endure farmers' livelihood.

CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Migration; Ecosystem services; Sea level rise; Drought; Pacific	ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; COUNTRIES	As one of the lowest-lying island nation states in the world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands is vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding and the associated impacts on soil and water salinity. Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production and access to drinking water, and heat stress is increasingly common. The number of Marshallese people residing in the USA has increased rapidly from 6650 in 2000 to an estimated 30,000 in 2018. While we know that climate change is already affecting the Marshall Islands and that there are significant migration flows, we do not know to what extent people already migrate because of climate change. This paper addresses this gap and presents findings from interdisciplinary fieldwork in the Marshall Islands and destination areas in the USA. The research team conducted a survey (N = 278), focus group discussions, expert interviews and a geo-spatial analysis of flood extent and migration rates to study the relationship between climatic events, ecosystem services and migration. The results show that respondents primarily cite education, health care, work and family visits as migration drivers, and only few mention climate impacts or environmental change. However, respondents do identify impacts of climate change on their livelihoods, health and safety, and the study finds significant correlations between climate impacts, trends in ecosystem services and migration propensities at household level. Furthermore, 62% of Marshallese respondents in the USA indicated that climate change affects their decision to return to Marshall Islands in the future.

J	Rudge, K				Rudge, Kieren			Leveraging critical race theory to produce equitable climate change adaptation	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review							COLOR-BLIND; ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE; VULNERABILITY; JUSTICE; NORTH; LAND; SECURITY; FUTURES; FLOOD; MIAMI	Climate change and adaptation are inextricably connected to justice and equity. Often, researchers and decision-makers conceptualize climate justice through frameworks of distributive and procedural justice, which have been central to environmental justice discourse for decades. However, critical race theory provides alternative perspectives. Here I identify three themes that are most salient to climate change adaptation discourse: (1) racialization and race consciousness, (2) racial capitalism and (3) intersectionality. By drawing on these themes, I articulate a framework to analyse how racialized climate injustices are reproduced and can be ameliorated. As this Perspective demonstrates, climate adaptation informed by critical race theory can effectively challenge dominant systems of marginalization in contrast to status quo adaptation practices that uphold inequitable power dynamics. Environmental justice should be a central concern in adaptation action to avoid reproducing marginalizing power structures. Critical race theory can provide novel and valuable perspectives that contribute to promoting equity in climate change adaptation research and practices.

Yemen is one of the countries facing several challenges that exacerbate the impact of climate change on multiple sectors, including water resources and agriculture. This paper documents and addresses the role of traditional techniques practiced by smallholder farmers in rural villages of the Yemeni highlands for adapting to climate change. The measures are innovative and independent of state support and can be practiced in the future to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture and water resources. The findings of future projections on the region reveal an increase in precipitation and temperature, leading to more frequent floods and higher evaporation rates. Therefore, maintenance of agricultural terraces, construction of rainwater harvesting structures, promotion of crop diversity and rotations, integration of agroforestry practices, improving irrigation efficiency, and soil conservation will be essential in the future. Additionally, education and awareness programs on climate change adaptation issues at the community level are also needed. These measures also have a significant role in improving food security and alleviating poverty in rural areas of Yemen.

To respond to the challenges of climate change, countries increasingly resort to resettling those most affected by land erosion, heat, drought, floods, and the like. In this article, I investigate to what extent resettlement can compensate for the harm that climate-induced migration brings. The first harm I identify is that to individual autonomy. I argue that climate change changes the options of those affected by it to the point that the decision to migrate can no longer count as a voluntary one. In some cases, I argue, the conditions of climate change coerce individuals. Second, I suggest that climate-induced migration severs the ties to territory, explaining the constitutive nature of such ties for accounts of individual autonomy. Third, I argue that severing ties with a traditional and historical territory challenges the capacity to imagine a future for individuals. I conclude that resettlement, even if actively planned and chosen, possibly providing gains in individual well-being and human flourishing, nevertheless harms individual autonomy interests.

It is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity, including burning fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), animal husbandry (methane from manure), industry emissions (ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide), vehicle/factory exhaust, and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth's atmosphere. Resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires, air pollution, changes in ecology, and floods. These in turn result in displacement of populations, family disruption, violence, and major impacts on water quality and availability, food security, public health and economic infrastructures, and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety. Climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well-being. Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower-income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well-being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society-wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.

This article attempts to explore the state of slums in Dehradun city and their susceptibility to climate change events, especially urban flooding. Taking the case of the state capital, we attempt to identify and demonstrate how the slum population is vulnerable to climate change events in the present and the future. Following risk-hazard approach, this article identifies and distinguishes vulnerable slums, per their sensitivity toward climate-led events using geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis. Climate change trends show increasing precipitation and temperature trends, which is in agreement with current events of such phenomena in the city. Through GIS, the slums were mapped and their proximity to streams and roads were taken into account to generate vulnerable hotspots with respect to numbers, population, and location. The article then inquires into the inclusion of such vulnerable slums in various relevant state- and national-level policies discussing challenges and issues in implementation. The article finally derives the possibilities for inclusion of such marginalized classes through ongoing Government of India missions.

Moreover, stock market investors' climate change knowledge shows a significant moderating effect on corporate climate change adaptation initiatives and investors' decisions to invest in Malaysian agricultural and plantation industry stocks.Practical implicationsThis research has significant implications for practice and policy, as it measures the stock market investors' level of awareness about climate change events and explores the companies' strategies to reduce climatic risks to their business model.Social implicationsThis study shows the way to adjust the climate change information in the stock market investment decision to improve market efficiency and sustainable stock exchanges initiative.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the pioneer one to provide a comprehensive link between climate change events and business performances at production level, business level and stock market levels by drawing inferences from empirical data on investors' behaviours. This study also added value in investment theories and financial literature by observing the climate change as an important factor to determine the investors' decisions in the stock market.

J	Ahialey, EK; Kabo-Bah, AT; Gyamfi, S				Ahialey, Emmanuel Kekle; Kabo-Bah, Amos T.; Gyamfi, Samuel			Impacts of LULC and climate changes on hydropower generation and development: A systematic review	HELIYON			English	Review						Climate change; land use land cover (LULC); Streamflow; Hydropower generation; Hydropower development	LAND USE/LAND COVER; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; RIVER-BASIN; HYDROLOGICAL RESPONSE; WATER-RESOURCES; TROPICAL HYDROPOWER; ENERGY SYSTEM; STREAMFLOW; FUTURE; RUNOFF	There is a growing concern on a global scale that the world should transition towards the utilisation of energy-efficient technologies. Hydropower plays a very significant part in the fight against climate change, and as a result, it lessens the impact that climate changewill have on our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both the effectiveness of hydro-power generation and the amount of streamflow are impacted by climate change as well as land use and land cover (LULC). Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to conduct a literature review on the topic of the past and future effects of climate, land use, and land cover changes on hydropower generation. This review will be based on the entries found in a number of reliable databases. A systematic literature review was carried out to analyse how LULC and climate change will affect hydropower generation and development. The research was based on 158 pieces of relevant literature that had been reviewed by experts and indexed in Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. The review was carried out to determine three goals in mind: the impact of climate change on hydropower generation and development; the impact of climate change on streamflow; and the combined impact of changes in climate and changes in LULC on hydropower. The findings bring to light the primary factors contributing to climate change as well as shifts in LULC which are essential to the generation of hydropower on all scales. The study identifies factors such as precipitation, temperature, floods, and droughts as examples of climate change. Deforestation, afforestation, and urbanisation are identified as the primary causes of changes in LULC over the past several decades. These changes have a negative impact on the generation and development of hydropower.

In the United States, Republicans, in particular, have expressed skepticism about the threat posed by climate change. Is this skepticism reduced by direct experience with severe weather events? Methods Using two surveys of registered voters in North Carolina, we test whether the threat of being hit by Hurricane Florence, or experiencing its effects directly through power loss, flooding, or wind damage, was associated with reduced skepticism about the impact of climate change. Results Republican voters who were the most threatened by the storm and who experienced one or more of its impacts were more likely to say climate change poses a threat to the state than their copartisans who were not threatened or impacted. However, among highly educated and motivated Republican voters, experience with Hurricane Florence was associated with increased skepticism about climate change. Conclusion Severe weather events have the potential to moderate climate change skepticism in the United States but not among the most engaged, dedicated partisans.

J	Westley, K; Andreou, G				Westley, Kieran; Andreou, Georgia			Coastal Archaeology and Climate Change in the Middle East and North Africa	NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article							CULTURAL-HERITAGE	Recent global projections of climate change highlight alarming rates of flooding and erosion on the coastlines of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Though there are indisputable links between climate change and the deterioration of maritime cultural heritage (particularly coastal archaeology), deterioration is often the result of multiple compounding factors, central among which are anthropogenic landscape alterations. In this article the authors attempt to disentangle these factors at a small scale, using the Gaza Strip, Libya, and Oman as case studies. They examine the impact of accelerating coastal erosion, flooding, and increasing frequency of tropical cyclones to question predominant discussions on the impact of climate change on heritage. They emphasize methods and practices for the identification of sites that can expand and refine climate change research (often reliant on data from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries) through the long-term perspective archaeology is uniquely placed to offer.

Extreme event attribution typically uses precipitation as proxy for flooding. However, hydrological processes and antecedent conditions make the relation between precipitation and floods highly nonlinear. In addition, hydrology acknowledges that changes in floods can be strongly driven by changes in land-cover and by other human interventions in the hydrological system, such as irrigation and construction of dams. These drivers can either amplify, dampen or outweigh the effect of climate change on local flood occurrence. Neglecting these processes and drivers can lead to incorrect flood attribution. Including flooding explicitly, that is, using data and models of hydrology and hydrodynamics that can represent the relevant hydrological processes, will lead to more robust event attribution, and will account for the role of other drivers beyond climate change. Existing attempts are incomplete. We argue that the existing probabilistic framework for extreme event attribution can be extended to explicitly include floods for near-natural cases, where flood occurrence was unlikely to be influenced by land-cover change and human hydrological interventions. However, for the many cases where this assumption is not valid, a multi-driver framework for conditional event attribution needs to be established. Explicit flood attribution will have to grapple with uncertainties from lack of observations and compounding from the many processes involved. Further, it requires collaboration between climatologists and hydrologists, and promises to better address the needs of flood risk management.This article is categorized under:Paleoclimates and Current Trends > Modern Climate ChangePaleoclimates and Current Trends > Detection and Attribution Assessing Impacts of Climate Change > Observed Impacts of Climate Change	[Scussolini, Paolo; Eilander, Dirk; Aerts, Jeroen C.

J	Hoang, HG				Hoang, Hung Gia			Vietnamese smallholders' perspectives on causes, indicators and determinants of climate change: implication for adaptation strategies	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Indicators; ICT; Determinants; Smallholders; Vietnam	FARMERS PERCEPTIONS; RICE	In order to facilitate the adoption of climate change adaptation and mitigation practices by smallholders, it is essential to understand their perspectives on climate change. However, few empirical studies have considered how smallholders perceive climate change in Central Vietnam. This research investigates the Vietnamese smallholders' views on the causes and indicators of climate change and factors that affect their perceptions of it in Central Vietnam. A sample size of 170 was drawn from a total of 297 smallholders and a structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. Descriptive, chi-square (chi(2)) and logistic regression analyses were used. The research results revealed that most smallholders perceived urbanization (93.5%), followed by deforestation (85.3%), air pollution (84.4%) and unappropriated dealing with agricultural wastes (82.4%) are the causes of climate change. A majority of smallholders perceived that excessive lightening (91.2%), followed by change in rainfall season length (90.6%), frequent droughts (90%), change in temperature (88.2%), uneven rainfall distribution (85.9%), rainfall amount (84.1%) and frequent floods (82.9%) are the most noted indicators of climate change. The success of regression model overall prediction is reported by model chi(2) = 92.69,p < 0.000, showing that the independent variables significantly explained the dependent variable. Among the independent variables, farming practice, information communication and technology (ICT) owned, community-based organisation participation, gender, type of household, credit programme participation and education level are significantly important determinants of smallholders' perception on climate change.

These impacts are expected to worsen, as climatic conditions become hotter and drier. This study estimates the impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector and household welfare in Mozambique using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. Specifically, the study investigates the impact of climate change on agricultural production, looking at implications for various crops and regions in the country. It also reports climate change impacts on both urban and rural household welfare. A probabilistic approach considering a distribution of climate shocks under two global mitigation futures (i.e. unconstrained emissions and level 1 stabilization) is used to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the economy, providing a range for the potential impact of climate change and the uncertainties related to it. Climate impacts are considered through five key channels: agriculture, roads, hydropower, sea-level rise and cyclones. The analysis shows that acute negative impacts are experienced in the agricultural sector, particularly for maize and cassava as crop yields decrease. Successful global mitigation efforts of reducing CO2 concentration to 560 ppm by 2100 (L1S) decreases the degree of uncertainty of the impact of climate change on the Mozambican economy, as the GDP is expected to increase up to USD 6.0 billion.

Therefore, effective integrated water resources management (IWRM) is key. This review examines the current condition of IWRM in Madagascar, evaluates its sustainability, and compares it with the one in Japan. The effects of climate change were analyzed using Aqueduct data. Madagascar has established an IWRM legal framework aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals; however, its application remains limited. For Japan, it was useful to establish IWRM for floods, water utilization, and environmental conservation. This study analyzes the future projections of water availability and demand for the 12 major river basins of Madagascar. Climate change will reduce water availability; the West and the East will experience water stress; the demand will be higher in the highlands, with less water available in the south. The proposed framework and Japan's experience in river basin management can contribute to solving those problems. The findings of this study serve to enhance the knowledge on IWRM and the impact of climate change in Madagascar; they also suggest actions to be taken by the Malagasy government.

Vegetables are susceptible to a number of biotic and abiotic stressors along with the cumulative pressure of climate change. Climate change is a major driver of the abiotic stress in modern-day vegetable production. Vegetable cropping systems must be resilient to climate change, so that production practices can achieve economic profitability and environmental sustainability. Environmental stressors, such as flooding, drought, and extreme temperatures, pose a severe threat to vegetable crop production, and total crop failures are common. Vegetable grafting, a plant surgical technique that is eco-friendly, rapid, and efficient, is currently the best alternative approach to climate change-resilient plant production that addresses these abiotic stressors. In this review, we document the success of this plant propagation technique using a review of vegetable grafting research results published in the scientific literature.

Efficacy Foundations for Risk Communication: How People Think About Reducing the Risks of Climate Change	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Climate change; efficacy; risk communication	PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; COLLECTIVE ACTION; POLICY SUPPORT; DETERMINANTS; BELIEFS; CARBON; FLOOD; VULNERABILITY; WILLINGNESS; PREFERENCES	Believing action to reduce the risks of climate change is both possible (self-efficacy) and effective (response efficacy) is essential to motivate and sustain risk mitigation efforts, according to current risk communication theory. Although the public recognizes the dangers of climate change, and is deluged with lists of possible mitigative actions, little is known about public efficacy beliefs in the context of climate change. Prior efficacy studies rely on conflicting constructs and measures of efficacy, and links between efficacy and risk management actions are muddled. As a result, much remains to learn about how laypersons think about the ease and effectiveness of potential mitigative actions. To bring clarity and inform risk communication and management efforts, we investigate how people think about efficacy in the context of climate change risk management by analyzing unprompted and prompted beliefs from two national surveys (N = 405, N = 1,820). In general, respondents distinguish little between effective and ineffective climate strategies. While many respondents appreciate that reducing fossil fuel use is an effective risk mitigation strategy, overall assessments reflect persistent misconceptions about climate change causes, and uncertainties about the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies. Our findings suggest targeting climate change risk communication and management strategies to (1) address gaps in people's existing mental models of climate action, (2) leverage existing public understanding of both potentially effective mitigation strategies and the collective action dilemma at the heart of climate change action, and (3) take into account ideologically driven reactions to behavior change and government action framed as climate action.

This paper attempts to assess inter-spatial and inter-temporal vulnerability to climate change using a Climate Vulnerability Index, an aggregate of the Climate Index and the Composite Social Vulnerability Index. The Climate Index represents the exposure to climate change, and the social vulnerability represented by the Composite Social Vulnerability Index consists of two subindices: Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index and Infrastructural Vulnerability Index. The indices are computed using Principal Component Analysis for three rounds of census data (1991, 2001, and 2011). The study found a significant decrease in composite social vulnerability and subindices over the decades. At the same time, the Climate Index shows a significant increase over the decades, leading to a nonsignificant increase in climate vulnerability in the recent decade. The study advocates for targeted interventions to reduce social vulnerability further to cope with the increasing exposure to climate change; hence, overall vulnerability can be reduced. Targeted interventions for livelihood diversification, education, inclusive growth, and infrastructural facilities in tribal-dominated districts will be crucial, given the likelihood of climatic variation in the future.

However, there has been limited analysis of the extent to which urban planning policy documents addresses climate change adaptation and or mitigation. There is a need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, and to be well adapted to this change (in line with the Paris Agreement). Achieving this goal will assist in limiting damage and loss to humans and the natural environment. This paper presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of urban planning documents (policy, regulation and law) in the state of Victoria, Australia, and the degree to which climate change mitigation and adaptation (with a focus on sea level rise) are addressed and integrated. Two scales of government (state and local) were analysed across three policy disciplines (urban planning, climate change and flood management). The evaluation framework contributes to the few tools for analyzing legislation, regulation and strategic policies for climate change adequacy. The findings reveal limited climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in urban planning documents. Additionally, there is limited integration of adaptation and mitigation actions. Important opportunities for better alignment of policies across disciplines and government levels in line Paris Agreement goals are identified, to ensure implementation in decisions made about land use and development. The analysis finds that urban planning policy must do more to include and integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation actions.

This is reflected notably in food and water crises across Africa. This work examines the readiness of Africa to climate change adaptation through a newly developed readiness index (ClimAdaptCap Index). In fact, this work shifts the readiness debate from emotional descriptions that currently flood academic scholarship to a more pragmatic evidence-based approach in assessing readiness. Readiness for climate change adaptation is driven by the intensity of climate forcing and adaptive capacity. The historical climate score data or precipitation and temperature for the period 1991-2016 were culled from the World Bank Climate Portal. The historical adaptive capacity score data included proxies such as poverty and literacy rates from 1991 to 2016 were collected from the World Bank and Macrotrends. The climate data were normalized using the normalization function to enhance interpretation, comparison, and fusion into the index. Missing poverty and literacy rate data were estimated by linear interpolation of the poverty and literacy rate data. The ClimAdaptCap Index was developed to compute readiness. This index is the first of its kind and will serve as a flagship for assessing readiness for climate change adaptation as it is highly adaptable to different contexts. This work's first-ever maps of readiness show that North and Southern Africa are the readiest for climate change adaptation under historical climate and literacy and poverty conditions. West Africa is the least ready while Middle and East Africa are in the middle. Consistent is that readiness has a positive correlation with literacy rates and an inverse one with poverty rates. In addition, with readiness scores of between 0.35 and 0.39 for all the regions with a maximum potential score of 1, this work has shown that the level of readiness in Africa is generally low, and there is a very small variation between the different regions. In addition, climate change adaptation will highly be influenced by both climatic and non-climatic indicators. The developed readiness index adequately simulates readiness to climate change adaptation in Africa and complements previous frameworks of adaptation preparedness.

Accounting for climate change in the water infrastructure design: evaluating approaches and recommending a hybrid framework	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; design; management; non-stationarity; water infrastructure	MANAGEMENT; STATIONARITY; SECURITY	A traditional hydrologic water infrastructure design assumes that the climate is stationary, and that historic data reflect future conditions. The traditional approach may no longer be applicable since the earth's climate is not stationary. Thus, there is a need for a new way of designing water infrastructure that accounts for the effects of climate change by shifting the current static design paradigm to a more dynamic paradigm. Researchers have proposed several approaches accounting for climate change. In this paper, we group the approaches into five groups (adaptive management, inverse climate change impact, machine learning, flood frequency analysis, and soft computing approaches), outline each approach's strengths and weaknesses, and assess their applicability to the water infrastructure design. We find that the flood frequency analysis approach is most applicable to the water infrastructure design as it is the least disruptive in terms of standard hydrological analysis methods, is cost-effective, and adaptable to most basins. However, adaptive management approaches are best suited for uncertainty reductions since they provide opportunities to constantly adjust decisions based on improved climate change data. Combining these two approaches could provide an optimal way of accounting for non-stationarity. HIGHLIGHTS center dot This study offers a summary of approaches to designing more climate-resilient water infrastructure.center dot This study extends the literature and knowledge of applicable approaches, allowing water managers to consider a broader suite of management options with stakeholders.center dot To our knowledge, this is the first comparative review of uncertainty approaches for addressing non-stationarity in water infrastructure design.

This qualitative case study was conducted on both strawberry growers and agricultural experts to explore the perceived causes, evidence and impacts of climate change, adaptation strategies used by farmers, and constraints and drivers of climate-smart agriculture development on the strawberry farms in Kurdistan province, Western Iran. Findings indicated that the causes of climate change could be divided into anthropogenic and natural forces. Decreased precipitation, increased temperature, dust storms, greenhouse gases, forest fires, spring frosts, severe hail, floods and droughts comprised the most notable climate change evidence in the region. Both groups confirmed the impacts of climate change on the reduction in strawberry yield, increasing the perishability of the fruits, poverty, migration and other social problems. Adaptation strategies used by farmers are classified into technical-agricultural, water conservation, farm smartening, and institutional adaptation practices. However, poverty, the shortage of strawberry-processing industries, insufficient financial support, the presence of intermediaries and brokers, traditional cultivation, difficulties in shipping strawberry crops to the market, the lack of storage facilities and equipment and the export terminal along with the mistrust of strawberry growers in the agricultural organization hinder climate-smart agriculture development in the study area. Finally, several drivers were proposed, which were considered the basis for providing practical suggestions for planning and policy making for climate-smart agriculture development in strawberry farms.

This review explores the potential effects of climate change stressors on aquaculture biology and resources needed to support decision-making for vulnerability assessment, planned adaptation, and strategic research development. Climate change-mediated physiochemical outcomes important to aquaculture include extreme weather, precipitation and surge-based flooding, water stress, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion, and changes to temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. Culture practices, environment, and region affect stressor exposure, and biological response between species or populations are not universal. Response to a climate change stressor will be a function of where changes occur relative to optimal ranges and tolerance limits of an organism's life stage and physiological processes; the average magnitude of the stressor over the production cycle; stressor rate of change; variation, frequency, duration, and magnitude of extremes; epigenetic expression, genetic strain, and variation within and between populations; health and nutrition; and simultaneous stressor occurrence. The effects of simultaneous stressors will frequently interact, but may not be fully additive or synergistic. Disease is a major aquaculture limiter, and climate change is expected to further affect plant and animal health through the host and/or infectious agents. Climate change may introduce further complexity to the aquaculture-wild fishery relationship, with over two-thirds of animal aquaculture production dependent on external feed inputs. Higher production costs could be an economic outcome of climate change for many aquaculture sectors. Some aquaculture practices may inadvertently reduce resiliency to climate change, such as a reduction of coastal vegetation, coastal ground-water pumping, and reduction of population variability in pursuit of consistent production traits. Information from the largest aquaculture producers such as China and the top 3 global culture species is still sparse in the literature. This potentially limits thorough understanding of climate change effects on some regional aquaculture sectors.

Due to climate change, the atmospheric content of trigger factors such as pollens and moulds increase and induce rhinitis and asthma in sensitized patients with IgE-mediated allergic reactions.Pollen allergy is frequently used to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases. Pollen allergens trigger the release of immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators and accelerate the onset of sensitization to respiratory allergens in predisposed children and adults. Lightning storms during pollen seasons can exacerbate respiratory allergy and asthma not only in adults but also in children with pollinosis. In this study, we have focalized the trigger (chemical and biologic) factors of outdoor air pollution.Recent findingsEnvironmental pollution and climate change have harmful effects on human health, particularly on respiratory system, with frequent impact on social systems.Climate change is characterized by physic meteorological events inducing increase of production and emission of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Allergenic plants produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of CO2. Climate change also affects extreme atmospheric events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, cyclones and hurricanes. These climate events, in particular thunderstorms during pollen seasons, can increase the intensity of asthma attacks in pollinosis patients.Climate change has important effects on the start and pathogenetic aspects of hypersensitivity of pollen allergy. Climate change causes an increase in the production of pollen and a change in the aspects increasing their allergenic properties. Through the effects of climate change, plant growth can be altered so that the new pollen produced are modified affecting more the human health. The need for public education and adoption of governmental measures to prevent environmental pollution and climate change are urgent. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, chemical and biologic contributors to air pollution are of critical importance. Extreme weather phenomena such as thunderstorms can trigger exacerbations of asthma attacks and need to be prevented with a correct information and therapy.

CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; nature-based solutions; wetlands; land use planning law; wetlands; urbanization; Bangladesh		Flooding is exacerbated by climate change, and the ecosystem functions of wetlands can assist in mitigating risk and contribute to climate adaptation. Nature based solutions (NbS) have emerged as an alternative to the exclusive reliance on grey infrastructure to drive climate adaptation responses to flooding. This article critically examines the role of planning law to facilitate NbS in the urban context of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The article will explore the following research question: does land use planning law in Bangladesh help facilitate the establishment and maintenance of NbS to assist in adapting to climate flood risk? This article will assess existing planning law on its ability to integrate NbS into the urban climate adaptation context while managing competing and incompatible land use and upholding strong, transparent and equitable governance. This article finds that the inability to enforce regulations and a lack of early consultation and engagement presents serious impediments to implementing NbS through planning law and development policy in Dhaka and contributes to a disconnect between high level policy documents and implementation on the ground, thereby undermining climate change adaptation interventions.

To develop generalities about climate change impacts at dryland sites, we compared broadscale patterns in climate and synthesized primary production responses among the eight terrestrial, nonforested sites of the United States Long-Term Ecological Research (US LTER) Network located in temperate (Southwest and Midwest) and polar (Arctic and Antarctic) regions. All sites experienced warming in recent decades, whereas drought varied regionally with multidecadal phases. Multiple years of wet or dry conditions had larger effects than single years on primary production. Droughts, floods, and wildfires altered resource availability and restructured plant communities, with greater impacts on primary production than warming alone. During severe regional droughts, air pollution from wildfire and dust events peaked. Studies at US LTER drylands over more than 40 years demonstrate reciprocal links and feedbacks among dryland ecosystems, climate-driven disturbance events, and climate change.

J	Choi, HI				Choi, Hyun Il			Assessment of Aggregation Frameworks for Composite Indicators in Measuring Flood Vulnerability to Climate Change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							COASTAL COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; AREA	The IPCC Third Assessment Report presents a conceptual framework for vulnerability to climate change with the three attribute components of exposure, sensitivity, and coping. Since the vulnerability assessments have been conducted mainly by the composite indicators aggregated from the IPCC's components, it is necessary to assess aggregation frameworks for constructing the composite indicators that have an influence on vulnerability assessment outcomes. This study therefore investigates the robustness of assessment outcomes for flood vulnerability to climate change through a comparative analysis of the six vulnerability indicators aggregated from the IPCC's components by the conventional aggregation frameworks. The comparative analysis has been illustrated through both the possible combinations of reference values for vulnerability attribute components and a case study on the flood vulnerability assessment to climate change for coastal areas in the Republic of Korea. The study demonstrates that there can be large fluctuations and reversals in ranking orders across the six vulnerability outcomes by different aggregation frameworks. It concludes that for flood vulnerability assessment to climate change in coastal areas, the vulnerability indicator needs to be aggregated by a multiplicative utility function from all the three assessment components with positive elasticity to vulnerability.

A long-term solution to cholera transmission is improved access to and uptake of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Climate change threatens WASH. A systematic review and meta-analysis determined five overarching WASH factors incorporating 17 specific WASH factors associated with cholera transmission, focussing upon community cases. Eight WASH factors showed lower odds and six showed higher odds for cholera transmission. These results were combined with findings in the climate change and WASH literature, to propose a health impact pathway illustrating potential routes through which climate change dynamics (e.g. drought, flooding) impact on WASH and cholera transmission. A causal process diagram visualising links between climate change dynamics, WASH factors, and cholera transmission was developed. Climate change dynamics can potentially affect multiple WASH factors (e.g. drought-induced reductions in handwashing and rainwater use). Multiple climate change dynamics can influence WASH factors (e.g. flooding and sea-level rise affect piped water usage). The influence of climate change dynamics on WASH factors can be negative or positive for cholera transmission (e.g. drought could increase pathogen desiccation but reduce rainwater harvesting). Identifying risk pathways helps policymakers focus on cholera risk mitigation, now and in the future.

Data on socio-economic characteristics, climate risk perceptions, use of indigenous knowledge-based forecasts (IFs) and scientific knowledge-based forecasts (SFs) were collected from 269 pastoralists using household surveys. The findings indicated that pastoralists using IFs only were more likely to perceive flood increase. Pastoralists using both IF and SF were more likely to perceive temperature increase, flood increase and drought increase. Apart from climate forecasts, other factors of significance included gender, education level, social capital, herd size, farm size, access to hired labour, herd mobility, agricultural extension access, access to government programmes on climate change and dissemination channels of climate change information. Pastoralists tend to put more attention on climate risks that are less likely to happen and less attention on events that are more likely to happen. Cognitive factors like education level can overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities of climate risk perceptions. Stakeholder engagement in rain-gauge management for on-farm rainfall generation and co-production of climate services can enhance climate change perceptions of pastoralists resulting in a reduction in vulnerability to climate change. Increasing the rain-gauge network in pastoral areas could promote more scientific perceptions of climate change.

J	Gezie, M				Gezie, Melese			Farmer's response to climate change and variability in Ethiopia: A review	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE			English	Review						climate change; variability; adaptation; farmer's response; Ethiopia	ADAPTATION; SYSTEMS; AFRICA	Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries experiencing drought and floods as a result of climate variability and change. Climate change in the form of higher temperature, reduced rainfall, and increased rainfall variability reduces crop yield and threatens food security in low income and agriculture-based economies. This study reviews impact of climate change and variability, and climate change adaptation strategies employed at farm level in response to perceived changes in temperature and precipitation. Climate change negatively affects agriculture, nutrition, ground water availability, soil organic matter and soil quality, health conditions, growth and poverty. The survey reveals that Ethiopian farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change. These strategies include "use of improved crop varieties," "agroforestry practices," "crop diversification," "soil conservation practices," "tree planting," "off-farm activities," "irrigation practices," "adjusting planting dates," "selling of assets," "food aid," and "permanent and temporary migration in search of employment" are the most important adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers. However, "level of education," "gender," "age," "wealth of the head of household," "access to extension and credit," "information and climate social capital," "agroecological settings," and "temperature" all influence farmer's choices; "lack of information on adaptation methods," "financial constraints," and "lack of access to land" as main barriers to adapt climate change and variability. Another investigator also revealed that farmers living in the dry lowland area perceived more change in climate than farmers in the wet lowland area.

In this Review, Rajagopalan and colleagues describe the environmental exposures associated with climate change and provide an overview of the consequences of climate change, including air pollution and extreme temperatures, on cardiovascular health and disease. Climate change is the greatest existential challenge to planetary and human health and is dictated by a shift in the Earth's weather and air conditions owing to anthropogenic activity. Climate change has resulted not only in extreme temperatures, but also in an increase in the frequency of droughts, wildfires, dust storms, coastal flooding, storm surges and hurricanes, as well as multiple compound and cascading events. The interactions between climate change and health outcomes are diverse and complex and include several exposure pathways that might promote the development of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease. A collaborative approach is needed to solve this climate crisis, whereby medical professionals, scientific researchers, public health officials and policymakers should work together to mitigate and limit the consequences of global warming. In this Review, we aim to provide an overview of the consequences of climate change on cardiovascular health, which result from direct exposure pathways, such as shifts in ambient temperature, air pollution, forest fires, desert (dust and sand) storms and extreme weather events. We also describe the populations that are most susceptible to the health effects caused by climate change and propose potential mitigation strategies, with an emphasis on collaboration at the scientific, governmental and policy levels.

Faced with these increasing risks, improved information is needed to direct limited resources toward the most cost-effective adaptation actions available. Here we leverage a newly available flood risk dataset for residential properties in the conterminous United States to calculate expected annual damages to residential structures from inland/riverine flooding at a property-level; the cost of property-level adaptations to protect against future flood risk; and the benefits of those adaptation investments assuming both static and changing climate conditions. Our modeling projects that in the absence of adaptation, nationwide damages from riverine flooding will increase by 20%-30% under high levels of warming. Floodproofing, elevation and property acquisition can each be cost-effective adaptations in certain situations, depending on the desired return on investment (i.e. benefit cost ratio), the discount rate, and the assumed rate of climate change. Incorporation of climate change into the benefit-cost calculation increases the number of properties meeting any specified benefit-cost threshold, as today's investments protect against an increasing frequency of future floods. However, because future expected damages are discounted relative to present-day, the adaptation decisions made based on a static climate assumption are very similar to the decisions made when climate change is considered. If the goal is to optimize adaptation decision making, a focus on quantifying present-day flood risk is therefore at least as important as understanding how those risks might change under a warming climate.

However, there is an emerging discourse that established schemes are becoming vulnerable to increased climate variability and change, particularly increased water stress. This paper reviews the existing knowledge on risks of climate change and variability in water supply in smallholder irrigation farming in Zimbabwe. In addition, this paper highlights adaptation options to climate change in SISs. Data for this review were collected systematically from peer-reviewed and published literature. The literature used for this study showed that SISs in Zimbabwe are beset with water stress, competing water needs and the outbreak of pests and diseases, which have been related with climate change and variability. Climate change is making Zimbabwe more arid through decreasing precipitation and warming. Droughts and floods are increasing in frequency and severity. Damage by floods is increasing exponentially, impacting environments, ecological systems and national economies. Climate change affects SISs' productivity and decimates the livelihoods of scheme farmers. The review suggests that there is a need for increased adsorptive, adoptive and transformational capacity for SISs to obtain a new state of resilience from adverse effects of increased climate variability and change. This review recommends understanding and prioritizing solutions to vulnerability to climate change in SISs.

The intersection of pediatrics, climate change, and structural racism: Ensuring health equity through climate justice	CURRENT PROBLEMS IN PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH CARE			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; LUNG DEVELOPMENT; ASSOCIATIONS	Understanding and intervening at the intersection of climate change and child health disparities require pediatric providers to broaden their competency with structural determinants of health -even in the clinic. The environmental effects of climate change at the community level intersect in complex ways with structural racism and social influences of health. Climate injustice is further evident in policies and practices that disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color through exposure to harmful pollutants from industrial plants, heavy vehicular traffic, and flooding waterways, as well as to harm from degraded civic infrastructure such as leaking water lines and unsafe bridges. To support child health, pediatric providers must recognize the environmental health harms posed to children and multiplied by climate change as well as identify opportunities to center the voices of families and communities to dismantle these inequities. In this article, three case examples demonstrate the links between structural racism, climate change and child health. We then use a healing centered engagement approach to offer specific suggestions for how pediatric providers can actively promote health and resilience, advocate for patient needs, and contribute to efforts to change structural racism in existing practices and institutions.

J	Senapati, AK				Senapati, Asis Kumar			Assessing the vulnerability of agricultural households to covariate and idiosyncratic shocks: a case study in Odisha, India	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Climate change; vulnerability; exposure; sensitivity; adaptive capacity; India; Odisha	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Households in India face various covariate shocks, including cyclones, droughts and floods, and these extreme climatic shocks have a negative impact on their welfare. Although these are likely to increase in future due to climate change, households are also taking up various coping measures to deal with these extreme climatic shocks from their past experience. Hence, assessing the impact of these covariate shocks and identifying the determinants of various adaptation options have relevant policy implications in the context of designing a disaster mitigation policy. This study aims to assess farmers' vulnerability to climatic variability and climate change taking both irrigated and rain-fed regions of the country. Vulnerability analysis was done using an econometric method of 'vulnerability as exposure to uninsured risk' (VER) in order to test the determinants of household income loss due to covariate and idiosyncratic risk. Based on a survey of 400 farmers in Odisha, India, results show that households that access weather-related information reduce their level of vulnerability to climate change and improve their overall adaptive capacity. To address climatic vulnerability, policymakers need to emphasize farmers' responses in different regions and can plan climate adaptation strategies based on the vulnerability assessment of entire regions.

J	Thomas, KA				Thomas, Kimberley Anh			Compelled to Compete: Rendering Climate Change Vulnerability Investable	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							MEKONG DELTA; LAND-USE; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; POLITICS; AID	The imperative for vulnerable populations to adapt to greater environmental variability is increasing in lockstep with the onset of wide-ranging climate change impacts. However, while critical adaptation research emphasizes the necessity of addressing the underlying drivers of vulnerability to climate change, mainstream approaches to adaptation stress economic growth as a prerequisite for climate responses. Accordingly, capital-intensive adaptation measures promote competitiveness to spur economic growth in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, where more than 18 million people face environmental hazards such as seawater intrusion, flood, drought and cyclones. This study evaluates competitiveness as a mandate for effective climate change adaptation. It finds that adaptation can advance either competition or vulnerability reduction, but it cannot logically or pragmatically pursue both.

J	Stavi, I				Stavi, Ilan			Rio (1992) to Glasgow (2021): Three decades of inadequate mitigation of climate change and its slow onset effects	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Review						climatic change feedbacks; coral bleaching; deforestation; global warming; mountain glacier; rainstorms and floods; Representative concentration pathway (RCP); Small island developing states (SIDS)	ICE-SHEET; BALANCE; REGION	This study reviews the global increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), alongside the accelerated climatic change and its slow onset effects (or events) between 1992 and 2021. The establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and the simultaneous UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, generated the international efforts to tackle climatic change. Over the years, the UNFCCC-Conference of the Parties (COP) has led the efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation, with many sequential meetings across the world. Three decades later, at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow in 2021, it is evident that climate change impacts have substantially worsened. Despite some uncertainties, it seems that over the last three decades, the climate change slow onset events, including 1) increasing temperatures, 2) glacial retreat, 3) sea level rise, 4) ocean acidification, 5) soil salinization, 6) land and forest degradation, 7) loss of biodiversity, and 8) desertification, have substantially exacerbated. Simultaneously, other (non-GHGs related) anthropogenic impacts, including habitat fragmentation, land-use and sea-use change and misuse, species overexploitation, environmental pollution, infrastructure constructions, and urbanization, have considerably increased. With the aim of achieving the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways 1.9 (SSP1-1.9) or SSP1-2.6 ultimate goals-keeping global warming in 2,100 below 1.5? or 2.0?, respectively, compared to preindustrial levels-it may still be possible to avoid climate change's irreversible tipping points. To reach this target, policymaking must become more decisive and proactive, with continuous risks assessment, frequent monitoring of outcomes and their compatibility to goals, implementing practical legislation tools, and assigning specific financial instruments, aimed at effectively tackling climate change slow onset events and related environmental issues. Substantial efforts should be invested in boosting climate change mitigation, while simultaneously targeting effective climatic change adaptation measures and promoting environmental conservation and restoration. Relying on tools such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will sustain provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services, thus improving water(-), food(-), environmental(-), energy(-), economic(-), health(-), and governance-security, while lessening the risks of social unrest, violent conflicts, mass migration, and other humanitarian catastrophes.

J	Miller, F; Dun, O				Miller, Fiona; Dun, Olivia			Resettlement and the environment in Vietnam: Implications for climate change adaptation planning	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; displacement; environmental change; resettlement; Vietnam	MEKONG DELTA; MIGRATION; DISPLACEMENT; FLOODS	Increasingly the environment, and climate risks in particular, are influencing migration and planned resettlement in Vietnam, raising the spectre of increased displacement in a country already confronting serious challenges around sustainable land and water use as well as urbanisation. Planned resettlement has emerged as part of a suite of measures being pursued as part of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies. This paper provides an historical, political, legal and environmental overview of resettlement in Vietnam identifying key challenges for framing resettlement as climate change adaptation. The paper outlines the scale of past resettlement in Vietnam, identifying the drivers and implications for vulnerability. Detailed case studies of resettlement are reviewed. Through this review, the paper reflects on the growing threat of climate change and the likelihood of increased displacement associated with worsening climate risks to identify some critical considerations for planned resettlement in climate change adaptation planning.

This research focuses on the Punjab province of Pakistan and evaluates the impacts and consequences of climate change on general public at local and divisional level. In order to cope with the impacts of climatic changes at all levels, especially divisional level, raising reliable awareness and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting measures is significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector is imperative. The impacts of climate change are observed across the country through gradual increase in temperature, human health issues, pest diseases, droughts, floods, and irregular weather patterns leading to changes in lifestyles, and these issues are likely to continue in the future. The main cause of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan, can be attributed to excessive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere due to human activities involving inefficient energy usage, rapid urban expansion, improper waste management, industrial development, increasing transportation, agricultural activities, and livestock mismanagement. The findings of this study revealed that transportation sector is the major source of GHG emissions in the country, followed by industrialization and waste, at national, as well as divisional, level. The extent of impacts of climate change at divisional level is distinguishable and displayed a direct relationship with climate, geography, variation of effects, and modes of production in various regions of Punjab. The study strategically investigated all nine divisions of the province for comprehensive understanding of climate change phenomenon, and the results indicated that nearly three-fourths of the respondents have never indulged in taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study adopted a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) approach where the findings can act as set of guidelines for governmental authorities in formulating, assisting in preparation, instructing, and guiding policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation at national, local, and divisional levels.

This study contributes to addressing this gap by introducing an open-source, long-term, technologically-detailed water and energy resources cost-minimisation model for the Drin River Basin, built in OSeMOSYS.The analysis shows that climate change results in a 15-52% annual decline in hydro generation from the basin by mid-century. Albania needs to triple its investments in solar and wind to mitigate the risk of climate change. Changing the operational rules of hydropower plants has a minor impact on the electricity supply. However, it can spare significant storage volume for flood control.

It also remains crucial in building sustainable adaptive capacities, particularly in cities of the global north. It however remains largely unknown in urban Africa about planning agencies' perspectives on climate change adaptation-urban planning conundrum, and corresponding policy responses. This paper thus examines urban planners' perspectives and planning responses on managing climate change impacts and building adaptive capacities in Accra, Ghana. Using a review of four relevant urban planning and climate change policies, and interviews with five urban planning agencies in Accra, findings indicate that urban planning regimes are less efficient, more reactionary, and unsustainable in building resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change impacts. The findings show evidence of weak institutional and stakeholder coordination, inadequate funds and institutional logistics and human capacity, which have contributed to the inability to manage 'normal' climate change impacts such as floods and build resilience to them. The paper concludes with suggestions for building resilience to climate change impacts and incorporating adaptation concerns into urban planning efforts in Ghana.

Focusing on the impact of high temperature, low temperature, drought, and flooding, we established multi-dimensional assessment systems covering natural, economic, and social elements for cities' climate change adaptations. Based on the assessment systems, studies on adaptation to climate change were conducted in 248 cities in China using the entropy weight method, coefficient of variation method, and exploratory spatial data analysis; with the help of geographically weighted regression (GWR), the relationships between four types of urbanization and cities' adaptation to climate events were explored. The results showed the following: (1) High-administrative-level cities had higher adaptation than ordinary prefecture-level cities. (2) The differences in adaptation to the four types of climate events between cities within each of the seven regions in China presented significantly different spatial patterns. (3) Under the four types of climate events, the global spatial correlations of cities' adaptations in China were positive. The agglomeration characteristics of adaptation were mainly H-H and L-L agglomerations. (4) When analyzing the impacts of four types of urbanization on cities' adaptation to climate events, the fitting effects of GWR models were far better than those of OLS models. Population urbanization, economic urbanization, land urbanization, and industrial urbanization had different impacts on adaptation. Under the influence of social and economic development, the urbanization regression coefficients of different cities had significant spatial differences.

It examines the moderating effect of climate change perceptions on value estimates by applying choice experiments (CE). The study specifies three dam function attributes-drought management (DM), flood control (FC), and water quality monitoring (WM)-subdivided into three levels to improve the existing conditions. Survey data from 603 households living in Daejeon, Chungbuk, and Chungnam have been collected to perform the CE. Subsequently, two clusters-high-involvement and low-involvement groups-have been extracted, based on the climate change perception index. The main results of comparing the marginal willingness-to-pay between the two clusters are as follows. The attributes and price variable significantly affected the choice probability to benefit from improvements in the rational signs of the coefficients. This does not violate the independence of the irrelevant alternatives assumption. The improvement values of high-involvement and low-involvement groups are estimated as KRW 21,570 and KRW 14,572 a year per household, respectively. Both show the same value intensities in the order of WM, DM, and FC.

We used hydrologically modeled data as input for 2D hydraulic modeling. Our results show that, even though the MHQ will increase in the future (2050-2079), the erosional power of the flow will decrease on the study area. This can be attributed to the change of timing in floods from spring to autumn and winter, when the sea levels during flood peaks is higher, causing backwater effect. Even though the mean depth will not increase notably (from 1.14 m to 1.25 m) during MHQ, compared to the control period (1985-2014), the inundated area will expand by 15% due to the flat terrain. The increase in flooding may be restrained by adaptive regulations: strategies favoring ecologically sustainable and recreationally desirable lake water levels were modeled. The demands of environment, society, and hydropower are not necessarily contradictory in terms of climate change adaptation, and regulation could provide an adaptive practice in the areas of increased flooding.

Towfiqul			Assessment of characteristic changes of regional estimation of extreme rainfall under climate change: A case study in a tropical monsoon region with the climate projections from CMIP6 model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Rainfall frequency analysis; Regional precipitation analysis; CMIP6; Bangladesh; Monsoon	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; BIAS-CORRECTION; PRECIPITATION; ENSEMBLE; DESIGN; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES; PART	Climate change is perceived to be the main reason in affecting global rainfall patterns. The estimation of rainfall extremes based on historical data, hence, might undervalue the risk related to the design of water infrastructure system. Bangladesh, a tropical monsoon region, is highly vulnerable to climate change; however, little is investigated in the changes of extreme rainfall under climate change. Also, the impact of climate change on the behavioural changes of regional estimate of extreme estimation is understudied. The goal of this study is to examine the characteristic changes of regional estimate of extreme rainfall at the daily time scale under the backdrop of climate change in Bangladesh. The multi-model ensemble method consists of several global climate models (CMIP6 GCMs) and two emission scenarios were employed to assess the effect of climate change in two time horizons: 2021-2060 and 2061-2100. The regional index-flood approach comprised of index value and growth curve (estimated using generalized extreme value, GEV, distribution) was used to quantify the return period values of extreme rainfall. The above approach was applied to observed as well as simulated rainfall data to quantify the changes in extreme quantiles. There is a significant increase of index value under climate change. There is a tendency to have a higher estimate of index value in the far future than the immediate future. The higher estimate is also detected under the higher emission scenario compared to the medium emission scenario. The changes in growth curves are region specific and do not follow the same characteristics as the index value. A similar behaviour of shape of GEV is noticed at present and future conditions. Overall, an increased value of about 22% in 100-year return level is expected by the end of this century under the changing conditions of climate.

Drivers of flood and climate change risk perceptions and intention to adapt: an explorative survey in coastal and delta Vietnam	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change perception; flood risk perception; adaptive behaviour; protection motivation theory; extended parallel processing model	PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; FEAR APPEALS; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; FARMERS; VIEWS; ENVIRONMENT; EDUCATION; EFFICACY; POLITICS	This article contributes to current research about determinants of climate change and flood risk perception, and intentions to take adaptive measures. We propose a research model that distinguishes between vulnerability and severity components of perceived risks, and adds perceived adaptive capacity as a third factor to predict the intention to take adaptive measures. We used this combined model as a conceptual lens for an explorative survey among 1086 residents of coastal and delta communities in Vietnam. Pairwise analyses revealed a significant association of flood and climate change risk perceptions with individual's flood experience, climate change knowledge, frequency of community participation and socio-demographic factors. However, in multivariate analysis, the influence of most socio-demographic factors became weak or patchy. Flood experience was the most influential driver of flood-related risk perceptions but weak for climate change-related risk perceptions and behavioural intentions. Knowledge strongly increased the intention to adapt to flood and climate risks and the perceived vulnerability to and severity of climate change risks, but reduced the perceived capacity to adapt to climate risks. Frequency of community participation increased the perceived vulnerability and severity of climate change risks, the intention to adapt to both climate and flood risks and the perceived capacity to adapt to flood risks, but reduced the perceived capacity to adapt to climate risks. Our research confirms earlier findings that individuals' knowledge, place-specific experience and social-cultural influences are key predictors of both flood and climate change risk perceptions and intentions to take adaptive measures. These factors should therefore receive ample attention in climate risk communication.

Risk perception and culture: implications for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change	DISASTERS			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; culture; risk perception; vulnerability	HURRICANE KATRINA; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CHANGE BELIEFS; DISASTER; FLOOD; INFORMATION; RESILIENCE; MITIGATION; EXPERIENCE; REDUCTION	Perceptions of climate change play a critical role in determining the degree to which people are at risk throughout the world. The significance of culture in understanding why people perceive and respond to climate change in particular ways is largely ignored in mainstream climate change adaptation. This paper applies a critical realist approach to examine the sociocultural structures and causal mechanisms for inaction or (in)effective action between at-risk people and the organisations responsible for dealing with climate change. The findings reveal that there are varying context-specific sub-narratives among heterogeneous groups of people at risk and organisations that lead to inaction or (in)effective action in response to climate change, often independent of risk perceptions and with unforeseen consequences for the vulnerabilities of at-risk people. Specifically, sub-narratives may create parallel and/or conflicting climate-related perceptions and respective responses, legitimise unequal resource distribution, and justify the suppression and/or capitalisation of sub-cultural and/or individual risk perceptions.

Perceived Effects of Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events on Forests and Forest-Based Livelihoods in Malawi	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						forest dependent communities; essential forest products; sensitivity; binary regression model; forest-based livelihoods; climate change	CHANGE VULNERABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; VARIABILITY; STRATEGIES; ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; DEPENDENCE; RISK	The emerging risks and impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on forest ecosystems present significant threats to forest-based livelihoods. Understanding climate change and its consequences on forests and the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities could support forest-based strategies for responding to climate change. Using perception-based assessment principles, we assessed the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on forests and forest-based livelihood among the forest-dependent communities around the Mchinji and Phirilongwe Forest Reserves in the Mchinji and Mangochi districts in Malawi. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. The impact of erratic rainfall, high temperatures, strong winds, flooding, and droughts was investigated using logistic regression models. The respondents perceived increasing erratic rainfall, high temperatures, strong winds, flooding, and droughts as key extreme climate events in their locality. These results varied significantly between the study sites (p < 0.05). Erratic rainfall was perceived to pose extended effects on access to the forest in both Phirilongwe in Mangochi (43%) and Mchinji (61%). Climate change was found to be associated with reduced availability of firewood, thatch grasses, fruits and food, vegetables, mushrooms, and medicinal plants (p < 0.05). Erratic rainfall and high temperatures were more likely perceived to cause reduced availability of essential forest products, and increased flooding and strong winds were less likely attributed to any effect on forest product availability. The study concludes that climate change and extreme weather events can affect the access and availability of forest products for livelihoods. Locally based approaches such as forest products domestication are recommended to address threats to climate-sensitive forest-based livelihoods.	[Chisale, Harold L.

This study reviews the evolution of knowledge on climate change and tourism in Africa, examining gaps, scholarship trends and policy issues since the IPCC-AR5 in 2014. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline is used to gather and synthesise the relevant literature. The study observed increased tourism climate change risks, including higher temperatures, more severe droughts and floods, sea level rise, snow melting, coral bleaching and more frequent tropical cyclones. While knowledge of the impacts of climate change on tourism has increased, critical sector gaps remain in some regions and thematic areas. The study, therefore, makes a modest contribution to the literature on tourism and climate change in Africa.

Hydropower is a renewable, low-emission source of electricity baseload available throughout much of the world as an alternative to electricity conventionally provided by thermal combustion of fossil fuels; however, the global hydropower sector as it stands relies upon surface water flows of substantial and predictable volume. This makes it vulnerable to climate change. The impact of climate change on the hydropower sector is difficult to predict, and not globally uniform. It might be positive, negative, or inconsequential depending upon the local timing and magnitude of changes, reservoir size, allocation priority, and the energy market. The secondary effects of climate change on glacier lake outbursts floods, landslides, and sediment load are poorly understood. In addition, when planning hydropower projects for the future, attention must be given to the greenhouse gas contribution of the impounded waters behind storage dams, and the impact of dams on water temperature. In the past decade, sovereign nations and international development agencies worldwide have evaluated the potential of hydropower as a cost-effective, clean, sustainable option for baseload electricity supply. There is therefore a crucial need to assess the opportunities and risks hydropower poses across a wide range of potential future climate conditions. This review paper conducts a global survey of the literature on the effect of climate change on hydropower and identifies room for improvement in current approaches to evaluation of the net benefits of hydropower projects under climate change.

Climate change-related factors impact the skin's capacity to maintain homeostasis, leading to a variety of cutaneous diseases. Stratospheric ozone depletion has led to increased risk of melanoma and keratinocyte carcinomas due to ultraviolet radiation exposure. Atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, pemphigus, acne vulgaris, melasma, and photoaging are all associated with rising levels of air pollution. Elevated temperatures due to global warming induce disruption of the skin microbiome, thereby impacting atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, and psoriasis, and high temperatures are associated with exacerbation of skin disease and increased risk of heat stroke. Extreme weather events due to climate change, including floods and wildfires, are of relevance to the dermatologist as these events are implicated in cutaneous injuries, skin infections, and acute worsening of inflammatory skin disorders. The health consequences as well as the economic and social burden of climate change fall most heavily on vulnerable and marginalized populations due to structural disparities. As dermatologists, understanding the interaction of climate change and skin health is essential to appropriately manage dermatologic disease and advocate for our patients.

In the United States, many medical schools, the American Medical Association, and the National Academy of Sciences have published calls for physicians and physicians-in-training to develop a basic knowledge of the science of climate change and an awareness of the associated health risks. The authors-all medical students and educators-argue for the expeditious redesign of medical school curricula to teach students to recognize, diagnose, and treat the many health conditions exacerbated by climate change as well as understand public health issues. In this Invited Commentary, the authors briefly review the health impacts of climate change, examine current climate change course offerings and proposals, and describe the rationale for promptly and comprehensively including climate science education in medical school curricula. Efforts in training physicians now will benefit those physicians' communities whose health will be impacted by a period of remarkable climate change. The bottom line is that the health effects of climate reality cannot be ignored, and people everywhere must adapt as quickly as possible.

Climate change issues have become major concerns in aquaculture industry, particularly for fish hatchery productivity. Fish production in Bangladesh is mainly steered by the aquaculture sector, which is dependent on private hatchery-based fish seed production to a great extent. This review aimed to present the impacts of climate change on fish hatcheries, particularly during different stages of hatchery production, and the economic loss from the onset of disease and other impairments due to environmental causes. Geographically, most hatcheries in Bangladesh are operated within a narrow range of temperature (22.8-23.1 degrees C, equivalent to 73-73.5 degrees F) and rainfall (1750-2000 mm). Thus, slightest fluctuations in these parameters affect seed production in fish hatcheries. The broodstock, produced in natural and captive conditions, is severely affected by flash flooding, water quality deterioration, river siltation, erratic rainfall, and temperature fluctuations. Based on our review, temperature fluctuation is the main factor hampering maturation and breeding performances of broodstock. Temperature has also been reported to affect embryonic development and cause stunted growth of larvae and juvenile. In shrimp and prawn hatcheries, fluctuations in temperature, pH, and salinity are responsible for post-larval disease outbreaks. In some instances, storms and heavy rainfall wash away reared broodfish and fish seed from the hatcheries, causing massive socioeconomic losses. This review presents indisputable negative impacts of climate change on hatchery production. As of now, no cost-effective proven strategies have been developed to minimize the effects of climate change on Bangladesh's fish hatchery production, on which the aquaculture industry is inextricably dependent. For sustainable fish hatchery production, basic research on climate impacts on hatcheries is inevitable, as well as improving capacity of hatchery owners are needed for resilient hatchery operations in Bangladesh and similar environments worldwide.

Quantification of Expected Changes in Peak Flow Quantiles in Climate Change by Combining Continuous Hydrological Modelling with the Modified Curve Number Method	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Floods; Curve number; Climate change; Soil moisture; Bias correction; Peak flow	MIXED PROCEDURE; GLOBAL CLIMATE; CHANGE IMPACTS; PROJECTIONS; RUNOFF; EUROPE; FLOODS; PRECIPITATION; DISCHARGE; HAZARD	Climate projections point to modifications in the magnitude, frequency and timing of floods in the future. However, robust methodologies to quantify how climate change will modify the catchment response in flood events are required. Continuous hydrological modelling usually smooth magnitudes of extreme events. This paper proposes a methodology to improve the assessment of flood changes in the future driven by climate change. Climate change projections of the EURO-CORDEX programme obtained under the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) supplied are used. Four catchments located on the Douro River Basin have been considered as case studies. Precipitation and temperature projections have been bias corrected to reduce errors with observations in the control period (1971-2004). The HBV continuous hydrological simulation model has been used to simulate the soil moisture content on the day of occurrence of the maximum annual rainfalls in the four catchments. The modified curve number method has been utilized to obtain the changes expected in the future in flood magnitudes, considering the initial soil moisture contents estimated with the HBV model and the expected changes in annual maximum rainfalls. The methodology has been applied to the control period (1971-2004) to check the validity of the process. Then, the methodology has been applied to the future period (2011-2095), to quantify the changes expected in the future in flood magnitudes under climate change conditions. The combined use of the HBV continuous hydrological simulation with the modified curve number method improves the results provided by the HBV model. The proposed methodology allows a better characterization of the response of catchments in flood events. It also considers the expected variation in the antecedent moisture content in catchments in the future, driven by increasing temperatures and decreasing mean annual precipitations in the future. The results show that flood quantiles will increase in three of the four catchments considered.

Such competition makes everything including the environment subservient to 'technology'. As a consequence, they are faced with extreme weather events and are therefore important in the context of responding to climate change. They are increasingly being recognised as having unique climate risks and specific vulnerabilities due to higher concentration of people and activities. Adaptation seems to be indispensable though mitigation still will help avoiding future impacts. Urban authorities in poor countries encounter specific realities, such as occupancy in low-lying, often flood-prone, coastal locations that lack adequate protection in addition to possible vector-borne infections. In this backdrop, this paper analyzes specific factors likely to shape climate change responses of urban authorities in poorer countries who have to find ways to tackle impacts of climate change in tune to their specific institutional and social contexts and compulsions.

The adverse effect of climate change is expected to aggravate in future due to increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. The aim of the study was to portraythe spatial response of maize productivity under changing climate over Tamil Nadu. For this purpose, HadGEM2-AO general circulation model generated future climate under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios were used in DSSAT-CERES - Maize crop model. The simulated results of DSSAT-CERES - Maize model showed the marked variation in maize productivity across the different agro climate regions of Tamil Nadu. Among all zones, maize yield varied much in North Western Zone (NWZ) n present climate with the yield variation from 903 to 5254 kg ha(-1). The lowest yield variation (2586 to 4957 kg ha(-1)) was observed in North Eastern Zone (NEZ). Maize productivity is predicted to decline in end century than near and mid century. Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ) exhibited relatively higher impact on maize productivity by climate change and the yield reduction was less in Western Zone (WZ) of Tamil Nadu.

To determine the future natural forcing impacts on land use in New York City, this study highlights the need for integrating spatiotemporal modeling analyses, such as a statistical downscaling model driven by climate change with remote sensing and GIS to support urban growth assessment. The research findings indicate that the mean rainfall will increase in the future and sea levels will rise near New York City; however, open space is expected to decrease by 1.51% and 2.51% and the urban area is expected to expand by about 1.36% and 2.63% in 2030 and 2050 respectively, taking into account the climate change and sea level rise.

In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), extended dry spells, heavy rainfall, flooding, and tropical storms have driven a large percentage of the population to a severe food crisis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a potential comprehensive solution whose adoption can mitigate climate change and its ramifications on the state of food security in the region. CSA combines innovation, the use of technology, extensive research, stakeholder involvement, and data to increase food production, optimize resource allocation and utilization, and enhance the region's ability to feed its population. The adoption of CSA has succeeded in increasing agricultural productivity in several parts of SSA and will help towards the building of resilience food systems across the region amid constant and unpredictable climate change and its far-reaching impacts in the region. For the sustained and universal adoption of CSA within the region, there is a need for more stakeholder involvement in its development and adaptation to the needs of specific communities. Furthermore, it is necessary to leverage the positive impact of the approach by expanding its scope beyond climate change mitigation to prevention and control, and ultimately help in achieving the United Nations SDG 2 and 13.

The study contributes to existing literature by incorporating risk interactions and failure propagation through a Travel Demand Modeling process. The analysis follows a three-step analytical approach, including identifying climate change scenarios, modeling climate stressors, and analyzing transportation system response. The results show potentially severe climate change threats, leading to 0.23 - 1.24% of trips underserved and 2.74 - 15.11% of roadway links on the southern coast operating at a speed of fewer than 10 mph. Moreover, the analysis reveals clear spatial patterns in climate change impacts, with the northern coast experiencing more inaccessibility and the southern coast facing greater congestion. The results show a non-linear and dynamic response of roadway system to climate change. The study highlights four policy implications, including increasing system redundancy, protecting critical infrastructure, acknowledging spatial disparities, and considering potential relocation strategies. The analysis also sheds lights on the mechanism behind roadway system response, showing the possible existence of a tipping point.

J	George, A; Sharma, P; Pradhan, KC				George, Alinda; Sharma, Pritee; Pradhan, Kalandi Charan			Rural-urban disparities in spatiotemporal pattern of vulnerability to climate change: a study of Madhya Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Social vulnerability; Climate change; Spatiotemporal pattern; Rural; Urban; Madhya Pradesh	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; NATURAL HAZARDS; FLOOD RISK; DISTRICT; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; EVENTS; TRENDS; IMPACT	This paper aims to assess the disparities in vulnerability to climate change among the rural and urban population by taking the case of Madhya Pradesh, the central state of India. Madhya Pradesh is highly exposed to climate change, as evident by the historical and projected changes in climatic parameters. The impacts of climate change vary as per the dependence of the population on natural resource-intensive sectors and the relative socioeconomic development. The higher disparities in population composition, livelihood, infrastructural access, and other socioeconomic characteristics among rural and urban populations can influence their relative vulnerability to climate change. In this context, this study tries to understand how the spatiotemporal pattern of vulnerability to climate change differs in the rural and urban areas in three decades (1991, 2001 and 2011), using two sub-indices viz. Composite Social Vulnerability Index (CSVI) and Climate Index (CI). The CSVI is a weighted average of the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index and Infrastructural Vulnerability Index. The CSVI is a weighted average of the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index and Infrastructural Vulnerability Index. The results indicate that rural areas possess more social vulnerability than urban areas and, thus, are more vulnerable to climate change. CSVI scores and score of its subindices have reduced over time for both rural and urban population. However, the overall climate vulnerability has slightly increased from 2001 to 2011 due to the increase in mean CI in 2011. The study points out more targeted interventions for livelihood diversification, education, and infrastructural facilities in rural areas, especially in tribal dominated districts, in the context of increased climate change exposure in recent decades.

On the one hand, forest ecosystems are exposed to and threatened by climate change, but on the other hand, forests can influence the course of climate change by regulating the water regime, air quality, carbon sequestration, and even reduce climate extremes. Therefore, it is crucial to see climate change not only as a risk causing forest disturbances and economic consequences but also as an opportunity for innovative approaches to forest management, conservation, and silviculture based on the results of long-term research. We reviewed 365 studies evaluating the impact of climate change on European forest ecosystems, all published during the last 30 years (1993-2022). The most significant consequences of climate change include more frequent and destructive large-scale forest disturbances (wildfire, windstorm, drought, flood, bark beetle, root rot), and tree species migration. Species distribution shifts and changes in tree growth rate have substantial effects on ecosystem carbon storage. Diameter/volume increment changed from -1 to +99% in Central and Northern Europe, while it decreased from -12 to -49% in Southern Europe across tree species over the last ca. 50 years. However, it is important to sharply focus on the causes of climate change and subsequently, on adaptive strategies, which can successfully include the creation of species-diverse, spatially and age-wise structured stands (decrease drought stress and increase production), prolongation of the regenerative period, or the use of suitable introduced tree species (e.g., Douglas fir, black pine, and Mediterranean oaks). But the desired changes are based on increasing diversity and the mitigation of climate change, and will require significantly higher initial costs for silviculture practices. In conclusion, the scope and complexity of the topic require further comprehensive and long-term studies focusing on international cooperation. We see a critical gap in the transfer of research results into actual forest practice, which will be the key factor influencing afforestation of forest stands and forest growth in the following decades. What our forests will look like for future generations and what the resulting impact of climate change will be on forestry is in the hands of forest managers, depending on supportive forestry research and climate change policy, including adaptive and mitigation strategies.

Hydrological sentinels and the relative emergence of climate change signals in New Zealand river flows	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Article						S; Archfield; K; Ryberg; climate change; time of emergence; sentinel; river flows; national	MANAGEMENT; REGIMES; TRENDS; UNCERTAINTIES; EXTREMES; IMPACTS; MODEL; LAKES; TIME	Hydrological impacts of climate change are prompting water resource and flood hazard management to adapt to non-stationary conditions. Among the factors influencing these policy decisions is the question of timing: when are we likely to see climate change effects? Using a national climate-hydrology model cascade over the 21(st) century, times and extents of emergence of six hydrological metrics are evaluated across New Zealand rivers. While the stringency of the emergence criteria has a significant effect on timing and extent, emergence for all metrics generally occurs after mid-century, if at all, and in the country's South Island. Looking at the first emerging metrics, in contrast, allows us to sidestep the high uncertainties of the time of emergence, revealing mean winter flows to be the most extensive sentinel of climate change in New Zealand rivers among the metrics considered. This has implications for hydrological monitoring to inform timely climate change adaptation.	[Collins, Daniel B. G.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Collins, Daniel B.

In this narrative review, we summarize the current global evidence regarding the effects of climate change on mental health. Methods: A systematic literature search concerning the direct effects of acute extreme weather events (floods, storms, fires) and chronic stresses (heat, drought) due to climate change, as well as the indirect effects of climate change (food insecurity, migration), on the diagnoses of mental disorders, psychological distress, and psychiatric emergency admissions was carried out in PubMed and PsychInfo, and supplemented by expert selection. 1017 studies were identified, and 128 were included. Results: The heterogeneity of study methods does not permit any overall estimate of effect strength. The available evidence shows that traumatic experiences due to extreme weather events increase the risk of affective and anxiety disorders, especially the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. Heat significantly increases the morbidity and mortality attributable to mental illness, as well as the frequency of psychiatric emergencies. Persistent stressors such as drought, food insecurity, and migration owing to climate change can also be major risk factors for mental illness. Conclusion: The consequences of climate change are stress factors for mental health. Therefore, as global warming prog-resses, an increasing incidence and prevalence of mental illness is to be expected. Vulnerable groups, such as the (already) mentally ill, children, and adolescents, need to be protected. At the same time, there is a need for further systematic research on the mechanisms of action and effects of climate change on mental function.

A study has been conducted to quantify the influence of climate change on the hydrologic process in the Tao'er River Basin (TRB), one of the most prominent regions in northeast China for water contradiction. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated and validated with observed land use and hydro-climatic data and then employed for runoff simulations at upper, middle and lower reaches of the river basin for different climate change scenarios. The results showed that a gradual increase in temperature and decrease in annual precipitation in the basin was projected for the period 2020-2050 for both representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The climate changes would cause a decrease in annual average runoff at basin outlet by 12 and 23 million m(3) for RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The future runoff in the upstream and midstream of the basin during 2020-2050 would be -10.8% and -12.1% lower than the observed runoff compared to the base period for RCP4.5, while those would be -5.3% and -10.7% lower for RCP8.5. The future runoff will decrease at three hydrology stations for the assumed future climate scenarios. The results can help us understand the future temperature and precipitation trends and the hydrological cycle process under different climate change scenarios, and provide the basis for the rational allocation and management of water resources under the influence of future climate change in the TRB.

Numerous studies have been explored droughts and floods from various points of view, however few have pointed the variations in the patterns induced by climate change. The precipitation data of Central England in the UK was gathered from 1931 to 2020. The analysis was performed by application of fractal dimension, noise variance, Lyapunov exponent, approximate entropy, extreme climate indices, and Standard Precipitation Index. The cross-correlation results indicated the study area warming owing to CO2 emissions on a global and local scale, implicating the climate change in the study area. Moreover, the mean maximum and minimum temperatures were affected by CO2 emissions on global and local scales, respectively. The nonlinear dynamic analysis indicated that the duration and intensity of the dry and wet spells were increased due to climate change. In other words, the droughts' intensity and duration were augmented. However, the number of annual droughts and wetness's have remained unaffected by climate change. The results signified a weakening in the flash floods possibility and an increment in the flash floods severity owing to climate change. Moreover, climate change brought about an intensification in the rivers' inundation (fluvial floods) probability. The findings of the present study contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of climate change impacts on droughts and floods (flash, pluvial, and fluvial) patterns and furnished references for nonlinear dynamic studies of droughts and floods patterns.

Quantifying and assessing the risk potentially induced by climate change has great significance for cities to undertake positive climate adaptation and risk prevention. However, most of the previous studies focus on global, national or regional dimensions, only a few have attempted to examine climate change risk at an urban scale and even less in the case of a recent literature review. As a result, a quantitative assessment of climate change risk for cities remains highly challenging. To fill this gap, the article makes a critical review of the recent literature on urban-scale climate change risk assessment, and classifies them into four major categories of studies which jointly constitute a stepwise modelling chain from global climate change towards urban-scale risk assessment. On this basis, the study summarizes the updated research progresses and discusses the major challenges to be overcome for the seamless coupling of climate simulation between different scales, the reproduction of compound climate events, the incorporation of non-market and long-lasting impacts and the representation of risk transmission insides or beyond a city. Furthermore, future directions to advance quantitative assessment of urban-scale climate change risk are highlighted, with fresh insights into improving study methodology, enriching knowledge of climate change impact on city, enhancing abundance and accessibility to data, and exploring the best practice to provide city-specific climate risk service.

Climate change-related disasters (e.g., wildfires, floods) disrupting healthcare access can complicate management of any allergic-immunologic disease. Climate change disproportionately affects some communities, which can exacerbate disparities in climate-sensitive diseases like asthma. Public health efforts include implementing a national strategic framework to help communities track, prevent, and respond to climate change-related health threats. Healthcare professionals can use resources or tools to help patients with asthma and allergic-immunologic disease prevent climate change-related health impacts.Climate change can affect people with asthma and allergic-immunologic disease and exacerbate health disparities. Resources and tools are available to help prevent climate change-related health impacts at the community and individual level.

This paper aims to reveal the debates about climate change and extreme weather events. It considers Bangladesh as a case to understand the debates, the impacts of climate change on people's livelihoods. This paper used secondary sources to select and scrutunize recent literatures about climate change, extreme events, the impacts of climate change on livelihood patterns and future trends. Increase of minimum and maximum temperature and average rainfall are evident in this country along with the future projection regarding increase of temperature and precipitation. As a result sea level will rise and flood events will frequently occur in the future. The intensity, severity and extent of flooding will also be higher in the near future. It is evident that the negative impacts of extreme events will bring difficulties and challenges for people living in vulnerable areas and consequently will cause a lot of damage and loss of life. That demands paying more attention to climate change and context based adaptation strategies and integrative policy.	[Haq, Shah Md.

Disentangling the concepts of global climate change, adaptation, and human mobility: a political-ecological exploration in Vietnam's Mekong Delta	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Political ecology; human mobility; adaptation regimes; Mekong Delta; climate change; environmental migration	ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES; MIGRATION; FLOODS; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; FUTURE; LAND	The complex relationship between human mobility and global climate change remains contested. In this viewpoint, the themes of human mobility, adaptation and climate change are explored from a political ecology perspective. A framework of political ecology of human mobility in relation to climate change is applied to the context of Vietnam's Mekong Delta (MKD). The Vietnamese government, popular media and academic studies often present the MKD in dystopian ways in which there is sometimes no more place for poor and landless farmers as a direct result of climate change. In 2019 and 2020, the MKD faced one of its most severe droughts in recent history largely tied to upstream hydropower development. In this viewpoint article, we contend that future studies can no longer establish a direct and causal relationship between climate change and human mobility, especially in light of these recent events. The underlying drivers as well as the broader context, which are shaped by political economy, market structures and forces, power relations, government policy, geopolitics, and transboundary water issues deserve a more prominent role in the analysis of human mobility patterns in the MKD and beyond.

An assessment of the potential for natural flood management to offset climate change impacts	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate impacts; flood risk; Great Britain; NFM	PROBABILISTIC IMPACTS; SENSITIVITY	Natural Flood Management (NFM) aims to work with natural processes to reduce flood risk, and can potentially contribute to integrated flood risk management (alongside engineering solutions) by providing landscape-based resilience to climate change impacts. Here, two approaches are used to assess the extent to which NFM could offset the impacts of climate change on floods in Great Britain. The first looks at specific catchments where there is quantitative evidence for the effect of NFM measures on peak flows. The second takes a broad-brush national view, assuming two potential levels of NFM reductions in peak flows. Both approaches use flood impacts derived from climate change projections for a range of future time-slices and emissions scenarios. The results show that NFM measures are much less likely to be able to offset the impacts of climate change for later time-slices and for higher emissions scenarios, but also that the chance of offsetting the impacts of climate change in any individual catchment will depend on its type (how sensitive it is to climatic changes) and its location (due to spatial variation in climatic changes). Confounding factors in the analysis include any time lag associated with the NFM reduction in peak flows, and different effects of NFM on peak flows of different return periods. It is also unclear whether there is any relationship between a catchment's type and its practical potential for implementing NFM, or the level of peak flow reduction that NFM could achieve; any such relationship could be critical in determining the overall potential for NFM to offset climate change impacts in different catchments. Although the focus here is Great Britain, a similar approach could be applied internationally.	[Kay, A. L.; Old, G. H.; Bell, V. A.; Davies, H. N.; Trill, E.

The Indian subcontinent has experienced many regional and local climatic changes in its past. There is overwhelming geological evidence of global climatic changes which are associated with extinctions and new life form adaptations. The Indian subcontinent is governed by monsoonal precipitation inextricably linked with the socioeconomic conditions of its citizenry. The subcontinent has a long coastline which is prone to sea level changes having potential to displace millions of people. The agriculture, dependent on the monsoonal precipitation, is already showing signs of disarray. Floods and droughts have been visiting regions that were hitherto immune to these hazards. The fast-eroding green cover and forests has unleashed extinctions of life forms that are so vital to the well-being of the environment. In climate change dynamics, many variables, and not a single one, have a role to play. Humans have the capacity to tackle this situation, and all the nations need to come together to fight the menace of climate change, that is part natural and part man-made. The technological innovations are long overdue to mitigate the hazards faced.

Climate change hotspots and implications for the global subsea telecommunications network	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Climate change; Sea -level rise; Natural hazards; Subsea cables; Compound hazards	SEDIMENT DENSITY FLOWS; LARGE SUBMARINE LANDSLIDES; TURBIDITY CURRENTS; WAVE CLIMATE; FLUVIAL SEDIMENT; NORTH-SEA; TROPICAL CYCLONES; OCEAN CURRENTS; CHANGE IMPACTS; INNER SHELF	A global network of subsea telecommunications cables underpins our daily lives, enabling >95% of global digital data transfer, $trillions/day in financial trading, and providing critical communications links, particularly to remote, low-income countries. Despite their importance, subsea cables and their landing stations are vulnerable to damage by natural hazards, including storm surges, waves, cyclones, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides and ice scour. However, the likelihood or recurrence interval of many of these types of events will likely change under future projected climate change scenarios, compounded by sea-level rise; potentially increasing hazard severity, creating previously unanticipated hazards, or hazards may shift to new locations during the 20-30-year operational life of cable systems. To date, no study has assessed the wide -reaching impacts of future climate change on subsea cables and landing stations on a global scale. Here, for the first time we synthesize the current evidence base, based on published peer-reviewed datasets, to fill this crucial knowledge gap, specifically to assess how and where future climate change is likely to impact subsea cables and their shore-based infrastructure. We find that ocean conditions are highly likely to change on a global basis as a result of climate change, but the feedbacks and links between climate change, natural processes and human activities are often complicated, resulting in a high degree of geographic variability. We identify climate change 'hotspots' (regions and locations likely to experience the greatest impacts) but find that not all areas will be affected in the same manner, nor synchronously by the same processes. We conclude that cable routes should carefully consider locally-variable drivers of hazard frequency and magnitude. Consideration should be given both to instantaneous events (e.g. landslides, tropical cyclones) as well as longer-term, sustained impacts (e.g. seabed currents that circulate even in deep water). Multiple factors can combine to increase the risk posed to subsea cables, hence a holistic approach is essential to assess the compounded effects of both natural processes and human activities in the future.

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, rigorous and replicable methodology that is flexible to data limitations and spatially prioritizes the vulnerability of agriculture and rural livelihoods to climate change. We have applied the methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three contrasting developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. We conceptualize vulnerability to climate change following the widely adopted combination of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. We used Ecocrop and Maxent ecological models under a high emission climate scenario to assess the sensitivity of the main food security and cash crops to climate change. Using a participatory approach, we identified exposure to natural hazards and the main indicators of adaptive capacity, which were modelled and analysed using geographic information systems. We finally combined the components of vulnerability using equal-weighting to produce a crop specific vulnerability index and a final accumulative score. We have mapped the hotspots of climate change vulnerability and identified the underlying driving indicators. For example, in Vietnam we found the Mekong delta to be one of the vulnerable regions due to a decline in the climatic suitability of rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought. However, the region is marked by a relatively high adaptive capacity due to developed infrastructure and comparatively high levels of education. The approach and information derived from the study informs public climate change policies and actions, as vulnerability assessments are the bases of any National Adaptation Plans (NAP), National Determined Contributions (NDC) and for accessing climate finance.

J	Hugel, S; Davies, AR				Hugel, Stephan; Davies, Anna R.			Public participation, engagement, and climate change adaptation: A review of the research literature	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						citizen engagement; climate change adaptation; public engagement; public participation	FLOOD RISK GOVERNANCE; PSYCHOLOGICAL ADAPTATION; CITIZEN COPRODUCTION; COMMUNITY; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS; PARTNERSHIPS; INFORMATION	There is a clear need for a state-of-the-art review of how public participation in climate change adaptation is being considered in research across academic communities: The Rio Declaration developed in 1992 at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) included explicit goals of citizen participation and engagement in climate actions (Principle 10). Nation states were given special responsibility to facilitate these by ensuring access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. Since then the need for public participation has featured prominently in calls to climate action. Using text analysis to produce a corpus of abstracts drawn from Web of Science, a review of literature incorporating public participation and citizen engagement in climate change adaptation since 1992 reveals lexical, temporal, and spatial distribution dynamics of research on the topic. An exponential rise in research effort since the year 2000 is demonstrated, with the focus of research action on three substantial themes-risk, flood risk, and risk assessment, perception, and communication. These are critically reviewed and three substantive issues are considered: the paradox of participation, the challenge of governance transformation, and the need to incorporate psycho-social and behavioral adaptation to climate change in policy processes. Gaps in current research include a lack of common understanding of public participation for climate adaptation across disciplines; incomplete articulation of processes involving public participation and citizen engagement; and a paucity of empirical research examining how understanding and usage of influential concepts of risk, vulnerability and adaptive capacity varies among different disciplines and stakeholders. Finally, a provisional research agenda for attending to these gaps is described.

The global burden of food-borne diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for both food borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged children. There is a need to better anticipate the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases and fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and multi-sectoral collaborations for integrated interventions at schools, community and household levels. The paper calls for giving priority to improving the environmental conditions affecting food-borne and water-borne infectious diseases under climate change.

Such adverse climate change effects may result in a greater incidence of crop pests, loss of soil moisture content, rapid soil nutrient depletion and substantial decreases in crop productivity and yields. These effects in combination with lack of access to improved, high-yielding crop varieties, limited agricultural extension services and poor access to irrigation infrastructure could further threaten access to food, limit export earnings and markedly lower net crop revenue. Several definitions, assessment approaches and methods for the concepts related to "vulnerability" and "adaptation" exist due to complex nature of climate impact and strategies used to deal with them. Based on the context of such studies, this paper reviews climate change risks, people's vulnerability to such risks as well as synthesize different approaches, methods and models used to assess vulnerability and adaptation in the area of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. As climate change effects are complex and site-specific, the understanding of several concepts, approaches and methods provides detailed information on farmers' vulnerability and adaptation process. Such information would be useful to inform adaptation interventions and agricultural policies that build farmers' resilience.

Here, we consider climate change applications, and review the ability of AI technologies to better quantify climate change-induced hazards, impacts and risks, and address key challenges in this domain. We focus on three application areas: data-driven modeling, enabling uncertainty quantification, and leveraging geospatial big data. For these, we provide examples from flood-related applications to illustrate the advantages of AI, in comparison to alternative methods, whilst also considering its limitations. We conclude that by streamlining the process of translating weather and climate data into actionable information, facilitated by a suitable technology framework, AI can play a key role in building climate change resilience.

The climate is a complex system and scientists are striving to predict, prevent, and address the aforementioned issues in order to avoid reaching tipping points. The threat to humankind is not only physical (ie, heat waves, floods, droughts) but also psychological, especially for some groups. Insecurity, danger, chaos, and an unstable system due to climate change have both short- and long-term psychological effects. In this scenario, the need for new psychological categories is emerging, namely, eco-emotions and psychoterratic syndromes which include eco-anxiety, ecological grief, climate worry, and climate trauma. This paper focuses on these new categories, presenting a summary of each one, including definitions, hypotheses, questions, and testological evaluations, as a useful tool to be consulted by researchers and clinicians and to help them in the therapeutic work. Also, this paper endeavors to distinguish between a psychological stress resulting in a positive outcome, such as pro-environmental behavior, compared to a stress that leads to a psychopathology. Prevention and intervention strategies including social and community support are fundamental to help cope with and mitigate the effect of climate change on mental health. In conclusion, the climate crisis has led to an enormous increase in research on climate change and its consequences on mental health. Researchers and clinicians must be prepared to assess this complex phenomenon and provide help to those who cannot cope with anxiety and climatic mourning.

J	Qi, W; Feng, L; Yang, H; Liu, JG				Qi, Wei; Feng, Lian; Yang, Hong; Liu, Junguo			Warming winter, drying spring and shifting hydrological regimes in Northeast China under climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Snow; Northeast China; Climate change; Water resources	GLACIER MELTWATER; SNOWMELT RUNOFF; FLOOD RISK; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; AGRICULTURE; TRENDS	As an important agriculture production area in the world and a flood prone area, future hydro-climate changes in winter and spring in Northeast China could have remarkable influence on spring water resources and flood. Yet, studies on future hydro-climate variations with special considerations of snow influences remain limited so far in the region. Here, we studied future winter and spring hydro-climate changes to the end of the century with special considerations of snow variations under the RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios in Northeast China. A water and energy budget-based distributed biosphere hydrological model with improved snow physics was implemented. We find that winter and spring are warming 0.08 degrees C and 0.06 degrees C annually under 30 years moving average in RCP8.5. Air temperature increasing rate in winter is approximately two times higher than that in spring in 2030-2059. In this period, snow melt contribution to spring average runoff and maximum runoff decrease by at least 39% and 23%, respectively, and spring soil moisture decreases by 7%. The spring snow melt runoff peak will move from April to March under the warmest climate condition (i.e., 2070-2099 in RCP8.5). The earlier snow melt renders the snow melt contribution to total runoff decrease to almost zero in May, which could increase drought severity. This study sheds some lights on changes in hydrological regimes under climate change with a focus on snow melt and the influences in the entire Northeast China for the first time, and is helpful for adaption to future climate change.

This paper is among the first to present the causality of agriculture and climate change (status, mitigation, and perspectives) in general and in light of the European Green Deal for the Western Balkan territory. Main text Agricultural production is a leading industry in the Western Balkan. Climate change and predictions that temperatures will increase by 4 degrees C in the coming decades pose a risk not only to agricultural production but also to the safety of the population, because agriculture is the main source of income for a significant part of it. Uncontrolled floods and droughts caused by climate change are a particular danger for agriculture and human existence. This paper demonstrates that agriculture in the WB can be considered critically affected by climate change. Conclusions Unless appropriate measures are taken and risk management for water resources and agriculture is improved, there will be a further decrease in precipitation and an increase in dry days by 20%. Such a scenario endangers not only the already vulnerable climate sustainability and biodiversity of the region but also the existence of a population employed in agriculture and the contribution of the agricultural sector to the gross domestic product. However, future planning based on the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and European Green Deal, the adoption of a related regulatory framework, the establishment and regular monitoring of supporting financing mechanisms, regional cooperation, and improving risk management (with emphasis on the local level) can mitigate the present impact and decrease the expected negative impact of climate change on agriculture and biodiversity in the WB region.

Climate change has become particularly susceptible to this kind of politicization. In this article, we report the results of a survey experiment in which we manipulated text frames and visual imagery associated with two types of environmental hazards linked to climate change-sea level rise with associated flooding and increased heat levels with associated drought and wildfires. We present evidence that the use of visual imagery can counter the effects that science politicization has on climate change beliefs and behaviors.

A systematic review and analysis of the topic are presented for the first time to identify physiological, biochemical, and molecular factors that may confer tolerance to climate change in Musa spp. Searches were conducted in six databases using pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria (Web of Science, PubMed Central, SAGE, Google Scholar, Wiley, and Scopus Journals). A previously established process and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to avoid publication bias. This systematic review was specifically focused on the Musa spp. production to climate change, the number of studies included was limited to only 76 articles. This indicates the need for additional research in this area and a potential change in research trends toward other strategies for mitigating the effects of climate change in bananas. Based on the review outcomes, we found a connection between changes in several climatic factors, which impacted banana production, and the cultivation of bananas in various geographic locations. Recently, few comprehensive studies on the effects of water stress on bananas have been conducted, however, they have yet to address the impacts of flood stress. Research gaps were identified addressing the characteristics of banana production and how this varies with location, elevation, and management factors, as well as the effects of changes in drought, water stress, and temperature. Evidence-based innovations are needed to reduce the effects of climate change in banana production.

The Buyuan River, the largest tributary of the Upper Mekong River, is one of the regions with the strongest climate change in the Mekong River Basin, and its cross-border impact on water resources has received increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the runoff responses to future climate change in the Buyuan River Basin (BRB). In this study, the MIKE SHE model was applied to estimate the runoff of the BRB, based on climate-change scenarios from the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM1-1) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The simulations predicted a slight decrease in the mean annual runoff of the BRB under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (2020-2049) compared with the reference period (1959-2012), with an increase in the magnitude of inter-annual variation, leading to increased deficit and surplus during dry and wet years. The simulations predicted the earlier maximum monthly runoff and a more evenly distributed annual distribution of the runoff under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios as compared to the reference period. The arrival of the flood season in the BRB was advanced by a month under future climate-change scenarios. The results showed that the average annual runoff of the BRB does not change significantly under future climate-change scenarios. However, there are obvious changes in the inter-annual and intra-annual distribution of the runoff.

In simulating daily streamflow, monthly total nitrogen (TN) loads, and monthly total phosphorous (TP) loads of the basin, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model utilizing hourly rainfall inputs was found to perform considerably better than the model utilizing daily rainfall inputs. For climate change impact assessment, the hourly weather generator AWE-GEN was calibrated based on historical hourly rainfall records from 1970 to 1999 in the basin. Evaluation of its performance have indicated that the AWE-GEN could reasonably characterize the main features of monthly, daily, and hourly rainfall in the basin. The outputs of eight GCMs under a total of four climate change scenarios were then downscaled with the AWE-GEN to produce synthetic future hourly rainfall series to drive the hourly rainfall SWAT model for climate change impact assessment. The ensemble of SWAT simulation results have suggested that future streamflow, TN loads and TP loads were all likely to increase in the flood season in the Ru River Basin. Since the Ru River has already been afflicted with nutrient enrichment issues, the projected increase in nutrient loads due to climate change necessitates the enforcement of additional nutrient abatement measures to offset the adverse impacts imposed by climate change.

Assessment of hydrological response in Subarnarekha river basin under anticipated climate change scenarios	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL			English	Article						GCM; hypothetical climate change; ArcSWAT; SUFI-2; Subarnarekha river basin	UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; WATER-RESOURCES; CHANGE IMPACT; MODEL OUTPUT; PART 1; SENSITIVITY; STREAMFLOW; PRECIPITATION; CALIBRATION	Two hydrological climate modelling techniques, general circulation model (GCM) and hypothetical climate change scenarios, were used to analyse the hydrological response to the anticipated climate change scenarios in the Subarnarekha river basin in Eastern India. Both models verified individually for the same river basin and a comparative performance of the models was evaluated to relate the two models for the near (2014-2040) period climate. The hydrological response under the anticipated climate change in the Subarnarekha river basin is well assessed by GCM under the RCP 8.5 scenarios compared to the RCPs 4.5. Results indicate GCM best suited over the hypothetical climate change scenarios as GCM has demonstrated their potential in accurately reproducing the past observed climatic changes. The strong performance of the hypothetical climate change scenarios model, particularly for warming climate scenarios, suggests that it may have distinct advantages for the analysis of water balance components in the river basin. The monthly streamflows of Subarnarekha river basin was simulated using a total of 14 years (2000-2013) daily observed streamflow data in the ArcSWAT model integrated with model calibration and uncertainty analysis by means of SUFI-2 algorithm. The results indicate during the calibration the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) were reported as 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, while during the validation the R-2 and NSE were obtained as 0.94 and 0.94, respectively, confirms the hydrological model performance was very good both in calibration and validation. The obtained climate change water impact index (I-CCWI) values reveal the Subarnarekha river basin is more responsive to climate change. The reduction in precipitation along with the significant warming under the projected future climate is likely to reduce availability of water substantially in the study region. This work would be useful for the effective management of water resources for sustainable agriculture and in mitigating natural hazards such as droughts and floods in the study region.

Climate Change Concerns of Saudi Arabian Farmers: The Drivers and Their Role in Perceived Capacity Building Needs for Adaptation	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; concern; indicator; Saudi Arabia; adaptation	PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; FLOOD RISK; DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; WATER-RESOURCES; DROUGHT; IMPACTS; PERCEPTIONS; KNOWLEDGE; DETERMINANTS; INFORMATION	Climate change is a serious threat to the sustainability of global agriculture and food supply that necessitates taking appropriate action for building resilient food production systems and preserving rural economies. In this regard, farmers' beliefs and concerns about the effects of climate change on agriculture may influence their adoption of adaptation and mitigation practices to address this emerging issue. This work was undertaken to evaluate farmers' level of concern about climate change in the Jazan province of Saudi Arabia. The study also explored the role of various socioeconomic indicators in shaping farmers' concerns and highlights various capacity-building initiatives that can be applied at the community level for effective adaptation. Ordered logistic regression was used to study the relationship between farmers' level of concern and their need for capacity-building initiatives to tackle climate change. Results indicated that insect infestation is the farmers' top concern, followed by higher crop-diseases incidence and drought. Regression analysis revealed that farmers' income is a major factor that reduces their concern for insect infestation and crop disease while increases concern for drought. Credit access and information availability have a mixed impact on the farmers' concern level. Capacity-building initiatives deemed necessary included establishing frequent contacts with extension personnel, timely warnings on droughts and other natural hazards, the training of farmers and extension workers, easy credit facilities, improvement in rural infrastructure and creation of awareness to address specific concern stimulus.

J	Elliott, R				Elliott, Rebecca			Insurance and the temporality of climate ethics: Accounting for climate change in US flood insurance	ECONOMY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Flood insurance; climate change; risk; maps; ethics; temporality		How is knowledge about future climate change operationalized in governance of the present? This paper addresses this question by examining efforts to repurpose the US National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for climate change adaptation. Policymakers and officials initially imagined the challenge to be principally a technical one of accounting for uncertainty in risk assessments and insurance tools. But the conduct and outcome of their efforts reflected instead politically charged normative tensions related to the temporality of climate ethics. NFIP policyholders, constituted as a 'risk public' by the instruments of flood insurance, exposed these tensions in mobilizations targeting practices of risk governance. The case shows that practices of 'accounting for' climate change and governing it through insurance work out-in however tentative or provisional a fashion-larger moralized disputes over the distribution of burdens, benefits and responsibilities over time.

However, climate-based education efforts in the Midwestern United States may need a slightly different approach since this region lacks obvious indicators, such as sea level rise and melting glaciers. Interpretation, an informal communication process designed to transmit scientific information to visitors in leisure-based settings, could be a useful strategy for engaging visitors in climate change discussions. Few studies have assessed perceptions of interpreters on this topic, much less, their willingness to communicate such information. To address this issue, a mixed methods approach (surveys, interviews, photovoice) was used to examine interpreters' perceptions of climate change and its impacts in Missouri State Park and Historic Sites. Although nearly 70% of interpreters were either alarmed or concerned about climate change, many of them were unsure about its causation. Interpreters report observing impacts such as flooding, earlier plant blooming, high temperatures, extreme weather, and invasive species, but were uncertain about attributing these impacts to climate change. Interpreters did not believe that visitors would be responsive to climate-based education per se but thought the topic could be addressed in pre-existing programs and activities. Rather than discussing complex science with visitors, interpreters felt more comfortable with conveying the significance of resources at their sites. Implications from this study include acknowledging multiple viewpoints, framing strategic messages, and developing place-based educational materials.

This paper aims to provide a new method used to predict flood risk of cultural heritage sites while considering the impact of climate change. Using a GIS-based Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, we assessed the risk of flooding at cultural heritage sites in Shanxi Province by the end of 21st century under three different climate change scenarios, namely SSP119, SSP245, and SSP585. The results show that 268 sites are currently at risk from a 100-year storm event. By 2099, about 100 additional cultural heritage sites are projected to be threatened by flooding. The cultural heritage sites protected at the city and county level are generally more vulnerable to climate change. In addition, those along the Fen River in Taiyuan City, the Qin and Dan rivers in Jincheng City, and the upstream region of the Zhuozhang River in Changzhi City also have relatively high flood risks. These findings can provide insights for climate change adaptive action and cultural heritage conversation in Shanxi Province.

Climate change and health vulnerability in Nepal: A systematic review of the literature since 2010	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						climate change; vulnerability; health; Nepal	ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; WATER-RESOURCES; AIR-POLLUTION; IMPACTS; FRAMEWORK; RISKS; COMMUNITIES; LIVELIHOODS; ADAPTATION; DROUGHT	The Nepali population is among those most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. We conducted a systematic literature review to document the health effects of climate change in Nepal and identify knowledge gaps by examining vulnerability categories related to health. Three databases were searched for journal articles that addressed health and vulnerability related to climate change in Nepal from 2010 onwards. Of the 1063 articles identified, 37 were eligible for inclusion. The findings suggested the health of the population was affected mostly by food insecurity, floods, droughts, and reduced water levels. Studies revealed both morbidity and mortality increased due to climate change, with the most impacted populations being women, children, and the elderly. At greatest risk for impacts from climate change were those from poor and marginal populations, especially impoverished women. The public health sector, healthcare, and potable water sources were some of the least mentioned vulnerability subcategories, indicating more research is needed to better understand their adaptation capacities. We propose that identifying vulnerabilities and areas of limited research are critical steps in the prioritization of health policy and interventions for the most vulnerable populations in Nepal.

J	Plänitz, E				Plaenitz, Erik			Neglecting the urban? Exploring rural-urban disparities in the climate change-conflict literature on Sub-Sahara Africa	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Review							NATURAL DISASTERS; FOOD PRICE; ARMED-CONFLICT; UNREST; INEQUALITY; MIGRATION; SHOCKS	African cities are facing challenges arising from climate change. Increased severity of rainfall threaten huge parts of urban settlers living in flood prone areas. Coincidently, projections of population trends suggest that urbanization rates will remain at high levels. The impacts such climate change conditions can have on local livelihoods already under socio-economic stress, may contribute to the onset of urban violence. In sharp contrast to these possible developments, contemporary scholarship on the relation between climate change and conflict has a strong rural focus. A novel systematic literature review of academic articles looking at trends and patterns of the climate change-conflict nexus was conducted to explore whether there is an urban neglect in the literature. The results suggest that scholarly attention on the urban is very limited and focus rather on rural dynamics. A second main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a conceptual framework on the climate change-conflict nexus in urban areas. It combines existing streams of literature into a single model to further theorize and understand dynamics of the climate change-urban violence linkages. Finally, the paper argues for more research on multi-causal pathways leading from adverse climate conditions to urban political violence.

While climate change perturbs the streamflow and affects flood events, reservoir operation may mitigate or aggravate this impact. Therefore, quantitative assessment of the climate change impact and reservoir effect on the LMRB is a vital prerequisite for future hydropower development and environmental protection. This study aimed to estimate the variation of the streamflow and flood characteristics affected by climate change and reservoir operation within the LMRB. A reservoir module was incorporated into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to simulate the streamflow susceptible to the reservoirs. It was found that the reservoirs had a substantial influence on the streamflow during 2008-2016, when many reservoirs were constructed in the LMRB. The reservoirs across the Lancang River (the upper Mekong River located in China) reduced the annual average streamflow by 5% at Chiang Sean station (northern Thailand) in 2008-2016, whereas their influence became undetectable downstream of Vientiane station (northern Laos). The streamflow changes downstream of Mukdahan station at southern Laos (including the stations in Cambodia and southern Vietnam) were mainly attributed to the local reservoirs and climate change. Compared with the baseline period of 1985-2007, the upstream reservoir operation dramatically affected streamflow at the midstream stations with higher dry season streamflow (+15% to +37%), but lower wet season streamflow was less affected (-2% to -24%) in 2008-2016. Climate change increased the magnitude and frequency of the flood by up to 14% and 45%, respectively, whereas the reservoir operation reduced them by 16% and 36%, respectively. Our findings provide insights into the interaction between climate change and reservoir operation and their integrated effects on the streamflow, informing and supporting water management and hydropower development in the LMRB.

However, the relative contribution of these factors to flood risk over the long-term is uncertain. In response to this knowledge gap, this study quantifies how urbanization and climatological trends influenced flooding in the greater Houston region during Hurricane Harvey. The region-characterized by extreme precipitation events, low topographic relief, and clay-dominated soils-is naturally flood prone, but it is also one of the fastest growing urban areas in the United States. This rapid growth has contributed to increased runoff volumes and rates in areas where anthropogenic climate changes has also been shown to be contributing to extreme precipitation. To disentangle the relative contributions of urban development and climatic changes on flooding during Hurricane Harvey, we simulate catchment response using a spatially-distributed hydrologic model under 1900 and 2017 conditions. This approach provides insight into how timing, volume, and peak discharge in response to Harvey-like events have evolved over more than a century. Results suggest that over the past century, urban development and climate change have had a large impact on peak discharge at stream gauges in the Houston region, where development alone has increased peak discharges by 54% (28%) and climate change has increased peak discharge by about 20% (3%). When combined, urban development and climate change nearly doubled peak discharge (84% 35%) in the Houston area during Harvey compared to a similar event in 1900, suggesting that land use change has magnified the effects of climate change on catchment response. The findings support a precautionary approach to flood risk management that explicitly considers how current land use decisions may impact future conditions under varying climate trends, particularly in low-lying coastal cities.

J	Jardine, A; Selby, K; Higgins, D				Jardine, Alexander; Selby, Katherine; Higgins, David			A multidisciplinary investigation of Storms Ciara and Dennis, February 2020	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Storms; Mixed methods; Catastrophe; Media; Climate change; Government policy	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL FLOOD; RISK; UK; ROBUSTNESS; NEWSPAPERS; GOVERNANCE; MEDIA	High magnitude storms have periodically impacted the communities of Western Britain and this storm threat is predicted to increase with climate change. Understanding the factors that con-tribute to storm catastrophe is essential to mitigate the effects of future storms. This multidiscipli-nary study collectively analyses meteorological, tidal gauge and newspaper data from Storms Ciara and Dennis in February 2020 to assess the environmental, social and political impacts and causes of the catastrophe in Western Britain. The analysis shows that although the storm period comprising Ciara and Dennis was a meteorological climate anomaly and short-term local author-ity and community responses were effective, shortcomings in governmental policies likely en-hanced storm impacts. The study findings suggest that substantive changes to UK government coastal and fluvial management policies and the wider long-term climate change strategy are re-quired to address climate change risk and reduce community storm vulnerability in Western Britain. The key roles of the media in enhancing public hazard preparedness and raising aware-ness of the impacts of climate change catastrophes and the wider climate crisis are exhibited. A multidisciplinary mixed methods analysis combining quantitative meteorological and tidal data, qualitative newspaper data and peer-reviewed research is shown to identify the likely cause of catastrophe and can inform future climate change vulnerability mitigation.

Forage grass growth under future climate change scenarios affects fermentation and ruminant efficiency	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; WATER-STRESS; METHANE PRODUCTION; RUMEN; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; EMISSIONS; GAS; PLANTS; METABOLOMICS	With an increasing human population access to ruminant products is an important factor in global food supply. While ruminants contribute to climate change, climate change could also affect ruminant production. Here we investigated how the plant response to climate change affects forage quality and subsequent rumen fermentation. Models of near future climate change (2050) predict increases in temperature, CO2, precipitation and altered weather systems which will produce stress responses in field crops. We hypothesised that pre-exposure to altered climate conditions causes compositional changes and also primes plant cells such that their post-ingestion metabolic response to the rumen is altered. This "stress memory" effect was investigated by screening ten forage grass varieties in five differing climate scenarios, including current climate (2020), future climate (2050), or future climate plus flooding, drought or heat shock. While varietal differences in fermentation were detected in terms of gas production, there was little effect of elevated temperature or CO2 compared with controls (2020). All varieties consistently showed decreased digestibility linked to decreased methane production as a result of drought or an acute flood treatment. These results indicate that efforts to breed future forage varieties should target tolerance of acute stress rather than long term climate.

Kenyan Women Bearing the Cost of Climate Change	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						intimate partner violence; climate change; women; Kenya; severe weather; floods; environmental health; IPUMS-DHS	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE	Climate change-induced crises can aggravate intimate partner violence (IPV); the loss of income when weather affects the agricultural industry can exacerbate violence at home. In Kenya, climate change has increased precipitation during the rainy season and raised temperatures during the dry season, resulting in floods and droughts. For 75% of Kenyans, agricultural activities are their primary source of income. This research aims to assess patterns in IPV and severe weather events (SWE). We examined Integrated Public Use Microdata Series-Demographic Health Survey (IPUMS-DHS) data from 2008 and 2014 for IPV severity and frequency. We used Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) data along with GPS coordinates to identify SWEs (defined as any flood >10 days) by county in Kenya. Overall, women were more likely to experience IPV if their spouse worked in agriculture (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.10-1.36). There was a 60% increase in the odds of reporting IPV in counties that experienced an SWE as compared to counties that did not experience an SWE (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.35-1.89). This analysis further supports the growing body of research that suggests a relationship between climate change-related weather events and violence against women.

Variation in climate adversely affects agriculture sector, ground water, nutrition, soil quality and soil organic matter, health conditions, and poverty. The main purpose of this study is to review the impact of climate change and adaptation strategies used at farm level in response to variation in temperature and precipitation. As per literature, Pakistani farmers adopt several adaptation strategies in response to climate change, like change in fertilizer, change in crop variety, pesticide, seed quality, water storage, farm diversification, plant shade trees, irrigation practices, off-farm activities, permanent and temporary migration, and selling of assets. Literature also showed that farmers living wetland area perceived less variation in climate than farm households living in dry area.

Strategies based on the rehabilitation of green infrastructures in coastal municipalities, such as renaturalization of seafronts, are considered adaptive to the effects of climate change but may cause misconceptions that could lead to social conflicts between the tourist sector and the society. A survey was carried out to study user perceptions on the effects of climate change, preferences for adaptation strategies, and the assessment of projects of dune reconstruction. We find that while beach users recognize the benefits of NBS for environmental conservation and storm protection, they show little concern about possible effects of climate change on recreational activity and have limited understanding about the protective capacity of NBS. Thus, a greater effort must be made to better explain the effects of climate change and the potential benefits of NBS in coastal risk management.

However, the long-term sensitivity of floodplain water signatures to climate change remains elusive. We examined how the integrated hydrological model HydroGeoSphere and the Hydraulic Mixing-Cell method could help us understand the long-term impact of climate change on water signatures and their spatial distribution in the protected Biebrza River Catchment in northeastern Poland. Our model relied on 20th century Reanalysis Data from 1881 to 2015 and an ensemble of EURO-CORDEX simulations for representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 from 2006 to 2099. The historical component of the simulations was subjected to extensive multiple-variable validation from 1881 to 2019. The results show that the extents of water sources were rather stable in the floodplain in the 1881-2015 period. The projected future impacts were variable with each analyzed RCP, but in all cases, different significant trends were present for the spatial distribution of water sources and for the river-floodplain mixing. However, the total volume of water from different sources was less sensitive to climate change than the dominant sources and spatial distribution of water. The simulation results highlight the impact of climate change on the extent of water sources in temperate zone wetlands with significant implications for ecological processes and management. These results also underscore the urgent need to leverage such modeling studies to inform protective and preservation strategies of floodplain wetlands.

However, adaptation planning and implementation may be delayed where people perceive a lack of urgency and put forward competing priorities such as economic development. Here, we assess perceptions of climate change and adaptation in Saint-Pierre-and Miquelon, a subarctic archipelago located south of Newfoundland, Canada. We performed and analysed a social survey reaching 289 individuals out of a population of 6260, through a questionnaire conducted both faceto-face and online. We show that inhabitants of Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon generally have a clear understanding of climate change and perceive adaptation as urgent for a number of vulnerable coastal sites. Despite some disagreements on adaptation options and the timing for implementation, it is noteworthy that even relocation action is mentioned and sometimes requested. We show that perceptions of climate change and of adaptation within Saint-Pierre-and-Miquelon are heavily influenced by place attachment, personal experience of coastal hazards and environmental awareness. From a methodological point of view, our results highlight the relevance of using online surveys in well-connected but geographically isolated communities. From an adaptation perspective, our results suggest that people's perceptions and beliefs are not only a barrier, but rather offer in some cases opportunities for adaptation planning and implementation. Such favourable attitudes toward adaptation do not exist across all small islands, so our results may be useful in determining the conditions under which people's perceptions are conducive to adaptation.

The results show that urban area would expand dramatically from 4.4% to 12.63%, which mainly occupy the forest-grass and agriculture land. The LUCC will decrease low flow index as well as increase high flow index, annual maximum 1-day and 5-day streamflow. Extreme precipitation indices all exhibit trends toward an increase in future occurrence. Furthermore, in testing the response of extreme hydrological events to climate change, most extreme hydrological indices are predicted to become greater than they were throughout the 1970s. The combined effects of LUCC and climate change would increase all extreme hydrological indices. Moreover, the climate change would contribute > 50% of these hydrological impacts. These findings indicate that the XRB will experience more severe extreme hydrological events in both flooding and drought due to climate and land-use change. It is advised that disaster mitigation measures must be updated accordingly to respond to this changing situation.

Moreover, climate change may result in changes to wind speeds and directions, consequently resulting in contributions to variations in wind-wave components, wave heights and directions. In this research, climate change scenarios were used to assess the coastal vulnerability to the Chabahar port area due to global sea level rise, significant wave height changes and tidal regime effects. These three items were calculated separately using numerical models and the impacts of possible climate change scenarios were applied to estimate possible changes to these items by 2100. Significant wave heights for 25, 50 and 100-year return periods were evaluated. Based on statistical analysis, the maximum significant wave heights for the A2 and A1 B scenarios were estimated at approximately 13.7 and 7.6, respectively. Since the main aim of this research was to assess the coastal zones at higher flood risk, therefore the mean global sea level rise, extreme values of significant wave heights and tidal heights were investigated. The height of sea during sea storms and for the most extreme case was calculated as 17.3 m and 11.2 m for A2 and the A1B scenarios, respectively. According to output maps of inundation areas, large coastal zones in the Chabahar port area are at risk due to the sea storms and possible climate change.

In this study, we investigated the influence of climate change on streamflow in a heavy snowfall area of mountainous central Japan using hydrological model simulations driven by climate projections obtained from the d4PDF database. We projected an increase in snowmelt discharge during winter and a decrease in spring, along with a general decrease in water resources and an increase in the frequency of annual maximum daily discharge during winter because of increasing future snowmelt. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were then applied using atmospheric data to study the linkage between streamflow and weather regime patterns (WPs) in future and present climate scenarios. The SOM analysis suggested that the impacts of climate change on streamflow varied by WP. The increase in future winter discharge was due to the strengthening of impacts of certain WPs, causing snowmelt. However, the decrease during spring could be due to changes in the predominant discharge-related WPs resulting from a decreasing snowpack. The obtained results can be useful information for considering adaptation strategies for sustainable management of water resources in heavy snowfall areas that must meet both economic and environmental demands.

Modeling the effects of land-use and climate change on the performance of stormwater sewer system using SWMM simulation: case study	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						Al-Najaf; climate change; flooding; rainfall intensity; stormwater drainage system; SWMM simulation	URBAN FLOOD SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT	Flooding of stormwater drainage system represents a major problem in developing urban areas that could be influenced by land-use and climate change. Flooding problems can be assessed using simulation models such as stormwater management model (SWMM). In this study, the generation of intensity duration frequency curves (IDF) that integrates climate change effect was conducted for Al-Najaf Governorate in Iraq for the first time. In addition, the effects of land-use and climate change on the stormwater sewer system of Al-Ameer District was simulated using SWMM. The results indicated that by increasing the sub-catchment area from 50 to 100%, an increment in total surface runoff from 20,380 to 37,350 m(3), and total flooding from 10,513 to 26,032 m(3) have occurred, respectively. As a response to climate change, changing the return period from 2 to 5 years has increased the total surface runoff from 14,120 and 27,110 m(3) (representing 48% of raise), and total flooding increased from 5,914 to 17,591 m(3) (accounting 72% of increment). To conclude, flooding locations and magnitude were identified, whilst the system fail to discharge surface runoff at critical conditions, whereas the effect of climate change on the stormwater drainage system was more adverse than the effect of land-use.

J	Inman, EN; Hobbs, RJ; Tsvuura, Z				Inman, Emilia N.; Hobbs, Richard J.; Tsvuura, Zivanai			No safety net in the face of climate change: The case of pastoralists in Kunene Region, Namibia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ECOSYSTEM-BASED ADAPTATION; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; STRATEGIES; VARIABILITY; AGRICULTURE; PERCEPTIONS; RESPONSES; POVERTY	Over the past decade, pastoralists in Kunene Region, Namibia, have endured recurrent drought and flood events that have culminated in the loss of their primary form of livelihood-pastoralism. Most pastoralists are finding it difficult to sustain their livelihoods, and their communities have fallen into extreme poverty. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) approaches are increasingly acknowledged as having the potential to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities. The first step is to develop an understanding of how affected communities live, their perceptions of and how they respond to climate change and the biophysical impacts of climate change in their communities. This study aims to collect this information in order to explore the use of EbA to help pastoralists adapt to climate change. We examined an isolated pastoral Himba community, to understand their perceptions, experiences and understanding of climate change and its related impacts on their livelihoods. A nested mixed-methods approach using structured interviews was employed to address the study objectives. Interview results revealed that pastoralists lack scientific knowledge of climate change, and they have no access to climate change information. Though pastoralists have coping and adaptation approaches at the community level (such as making gardens, fishing, etc.), these have become ineffective as climatic uncertainty and change persist. Furthermore, pastoralists no longer get benefits from the environment, such as food and fodder. Despite this, there are currently no biodiversity interventions at the community level to address the impacts of climate change. Pastoralists have indicated their adaptation needs, particularly the provision of water supply to grow food. This is an open avenue to explore EbA approaches, specifically ecological restoration, while still addressing the need of the pastoralists. There is an urgent need to develop new practical adaptation strategies, including restoration options that will strengthen their adaptive capacity.

J	Dau, QV; Kuntiyawichai, K				Dau, Quan V.; Kuntiyawichai, Kittiwet			Identifying Adaptive Reservoir Operation for Future Climate Change Scenarios: A Case Study in Central Vietnam	WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						reservoir operation; climate change; HEC-HMS; HEC-RAS; flood control		The assessment of flood risk under climate change impacts is necessary for sustainable flood management strategies at national level. Referring to the aforesaid statement, this research aims to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on reservoir operations in the Huong River Basin, Vietnam. To enable further representation of climate change impacts, the HadGEM3-RA Regional Climate Model (RCM) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 climate change scenario was used in this study. For assessing the level of flood risk posed to the study area, a coupled HEC-HMS hydrologic model and HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model was used to represent the behaviour of flow regimes under climate change impacts in the Huong River Basin. The key results demonstrated that the mean temperature and mean annual rainfall would be increased in the future from 0.2-0.8 degrees C, and 4.8-6.0%, respectively. Consequently, the mean annual runoff and mean water level would also be increased from 10-30%, and 0.1-0.3 m above mean sea level, respectively. Moreover, the proposed reservoir operation rules corresponding to flood control warning stages was also derived to reduce peak flows downstream during the rainy season. Finally, the main findings of this study can be a good example for future planning of flood control reservoir systems in Vietnam.

Beyond Spiritual Focus: Climate Change Awareness, Role Perception, and Action among Church Leaders in Nigeria	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Agriculture; Deforestation; Disease; Flood events; Societal impacts	CHANGE ADAPTATION; RISK PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT	This study explored the role of church leaders in addressing climate change with a focus on Catholic, Anglican, and Pentecostal churches in Nigeria. The study adopted a semistructured face-to-face interview with 30 church leaders drawn from the selected denominations (i.e., 10 church leaders from each denomination). These participants were spread across five states in five geopolitical zones in Nigeria. A descriptive narrative approach was employed in the thematic organization and analysis of data. Findings showed that while all the participants across the three denominations-Catholic, Anglican, and Pentecostal churches-agreed to have heard of climate change, their perceptions of the causes of the phenomenon were narrow and varied along religious denominational lines. More Catholic participants expressed belief in anthropogenic climate change than did Anglicans and Pentecostals. Awareness creation, charity for disaster victims, and prayer were identified by the participants as the roles churches can play in addressing climate change. Although climate change action was generally poor among participants, Catholics engaged more in organizational action than did Anglicans and Pentecostals. In contrast, climate change actions were more on a personal level than on the organizational/church level within Pentecostal churches. The implications of the findings for the Church/church leaders, policy, and future research are discussed.

Understanding vulnerability and building resilience in small-scale fisheries: the case of Davao Gulf, Philippines	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article; Early Access						Climate change impacts; Davao Gulf; Fisheries management; Resilience; Small-scale fisheries (SSF)	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; COASTAL COMMUNITIES; FOOD SECURITY; FISH KILL; IMPACTS; AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; PRIORITIES; PROVINCE	Global fisheries face a significant crisis, including overexploitation of fishing grounds, marine pollution, and climate change impacts. This paper aims to assess the effects of climate change impacts and the resilience of small-scale fishers (SSF) in Davao Gulf. It investigates the effects of climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, and resilience of small-scale fishers in Governor Generoso, Lupon, Malita, Sta Maria, Don Marcelino, and Davao City using focus group discussion (FGDs) (N = 9) to identify and understand climate change resilience among participants (N = 135). The results showed that all small-scale fishing communities experienced at least two to three climate hazards i.e. northeast monsoon (Amihan), southwest monsoon (Habagat), and typhoons, which bring fierce winds and heavy rains that cause flooding. Moreover, due to the availability of an alternative non-fishing income such as driving and construction work, carpentry, or other manual labour opportunities, fishers are able to recover and recoup the days lost fishing due to climate-related hazards. The policy analysis suggests that the government should provide social benefits, such as free medical check-ups, medicines, decent housing, and water, to keep fishers and fishing communities productive and healthy. In addition, local government should create seasonal jobs and replacement of fishing gear should be given to fishers to increase their resilience.HighlightsSmall-scale fishing communities experienced two to three climate-related hazards annually e.g. northeast monsoon (Amihan), southwest monsoon (Habagat), and typhoons; these hazards bring flooding which can result in illness e.g. dysentery, leptospirosis;Fishing communities are disrupted by these hazards and clamour for alternative jobs to ensure their livelihoods, and more inclusive social benefits from the government could deliver large benefits;Community resiliency can be enhanced as a solution to cope with climate change impacts by raising awareness, training and disaster preparedness; stronger local policies can empower affected people and communities to act in a timely way.

Data were collected across ten counties in Hubei province in 2019. Given that spatial dependency is present in social and economic systems, we accounted for the spatial autocorrelation of TE. We estimated both a one-step nonspatial stochastic frontier model and a spatial stochastic frontier model. We verified that spatial spillovers were present in the TE of rice farmers, suggesting that the nonspatial stochastic frontier model underestimated TE. Results showed that adopting climate change adaptation strategies significantly affected TE. These effects, however, varied in directionality by the different adaptation measures evaluated in this study. Overall, adjusting preparation dates, improving irrigation systems, and increasing cultivated areas positively affected TE at 1%, 0.1%, and 5% significance levels. In contrast, the coefficients for both using flood-tolerant rice varieties and adjusting sowing dates were negative and significant at 5% and 10% significant levels. Interestingly, the effects of using high-yield rice varieties and adjusting fertilizer use were not significant.

Based on these results, we discussed implications for future climate-smart agriculture programs addressing the adverse effects of climate change on agricultural production in China.

The impacts of climate change onto the regional enterprises are complex and differ sectorwise and according to geographical factors. In this paper, we take a differentiated look at climate change impacts and adaptation efforts in nine of the region's most affected sectors: agriculture, forestry & wood processing, food & beverage industries, water supply, logistics, winter tourism, manufacturing industries and the building sector. Framed by risk concepts we evaluate 157 interviews with company representatives and an additional online survey (n = 100) among small and medium-sized enterprises. The interviews and the online survey were carried out within the Interreg projects Clim'Ability and Clim'Ability Design during the years 2016-2021. We present an overview of sector-specific patterns of climate change impacts and adaptation efforts. Furthermore, we investigate the affected business units and fields of action for adaptation measures in a cross-sector perspective. Our results show that heat is the most relevant climatic stressor for a majority of the regional enterprises, followed by general warming and droughts. Extreme weather events like heavy rain, floods, thunderstorms or hail also play a considerable role, but adaptation to those phenomena appears to be less developed. This is an important starting point for future adaptation strategies and sector-specific recommendations for policy makers and local stakeholders.

Climate and the Nephrologist The Intersection of Climate Change, Kidney Disease, and Clinical Care	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Review						clinical nephrology; climate	HEAT-WAVE; CARBON FOOTPRINTS; DIALYSIS; HEMODIALYSIS; STRESS; HOME	Climate change is upon us, and it will have a major effect on both kidney disease and the nephrology practice. But the converse is also true: our treatment of kidney disease has an effect on the climate. Much attention has focused on how rising temperatures can lead to acute and CKD and health exacerbations in patients with established kidney disease. Climate change is also associated with rising air pollution from wildfires and industrial wastes and infectious diseases associated with flooding and changing habitats, all of which heighten the risk of acute and CKD. Less well recognized or understood are the ways nephrology practices, in turn, contribute to still more climate change. Hemodialysis, although lifesaving, can be associated with marked water usage (up to 600 L per dialysis session), energy usage (with one 4-hour session averaging as much as one fifth of the total energy consumed by a household per day), and large clinical wastes (with hemodialysis accounting for one third of total clinical medicine?associated waste). Of note, >90% of dialysis occurs in highly affluent countries, whereas dialysis is much less available in the poorer countries where climate change is having the highest effect on kidney disease. We conclude that not only do nephrologists need to prepare for the rise in climate-associated kidney disease, they must also urgently develop more climate-friendly methods of managing patients with kidney disease.

To identify a cost-effective adaptive GSI network, planners need to evaluate flood mitigation capabilities of industrial properties through time and understand key characteristics informing when, where, and how GSI should be implemented for maximum effect. We applied the Hydrology-based Land Capability Assessment and Classification (HLCA+C) methodology to a catchment in Christchurch, New Zealand, to evaluate the capabilities of industrial properties clustered into Storm Water Management (SWM) zones under different climate change scenarios. SWM zone potentials and limitations were assessed to develop the most capable adaptive flood mitigation network with climate change. We prioritised six of twenty SWM zones for inclusion in the network based on their substantial flood mitigation capabilities. To maximise their capabilities through time, we orchestrated, and implemented GSI in zones incrementally, using different implementation approaches based on key characteristics determining their capability. The results indicated that the most capable zone could mitigate climate change-induced flooding, by itself, up to the end of this century under the moderate climate change scenario. However, if its capability was combined with that of five others, together they could mitigate flooding just shy of that associated with the major climate change scenario up to the end of this century. The resulting adaptive industrial GSI network not only provides substantial flood protection for communities but allows costly investments in flood mitigation structures, such as barriers and levees, to be safely delayed until their cost-effectiveness has been confirmed under increased climate certainty.

The aim is to: (i) identify the state-of-the-art scientific approaches of adaptation of urban drainage networks to climate change; (ii) assess whether or not these approaches incorporated monetization of the adaptation practices and the assodated costs/benefits; and ( iii) define a novel approach (Blueprint) for the future development and assessment of urban drainage network adaptation to climate change and other drivers. First, the motivation is provided that makes urban drainage adaptation a globally relevant issue. Second, the main impacts of climate change on precipitation, flooding and urban drainage systems are discussed. Then, current practices are described. Finally, a blueprint for an integrated urban adaptation framework to climate change and other drivers is proposed. Our research indicated that future quantity and quality of urban runoff is not widely addressed in the scientific literature. The Storm Water Management Model is the most widely used software in modeling adaptation options. Solutions such as plans of maintenance and rehabilitation, public awareness, flood forecasting and warning, mobility measures and insurance measures are not widely reflected in the literature. Uncertainties of climate projections and bias correction methods are still significant, and uncertainties of socio-economic scenarios, hydrologic and hydrodynamic models, and adaptation options are not fully addressed. Finally, environmental cost and benefits associated with the ecosystem services provided by the adaptation options are not fully addressed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Incorporating uncertainty associated with both climate change and the range of possible adaptation measures is essential for projecting the evolving exposure to coastal flooding and erosion, as well as associated community vulnerability through time. A spatially explicit agent-based modeling platform, that provides a scenario-based framework for examining interactions between human and natural systems across a landscape, was used in Tillamook County, OR (USA) to explore strategies that may reduce exposure to coastal hazards within the context of climate change. Probabilistic simulations of extreme water levels were used to assess the impacts of variable projections of sea-level rise and storminess both as individual climate drivers and under a range of integrated climate change scenarios through the end of the century. Additionally, policy drivers, modeled both as individual management decisions and as policies integrated within adaptation scenarios, captured variability in possible human response to increased hazards risk. The relative contribution of variability and uncertainty from both climate change and policy decisions was quantified using three stakeholder relevant landscape performance metrics related to flooding, erosion, and recreational beach accessibility. In general, policy decisions introduced greater variability and uncertainty to the impacts of coastal hazards than climate change uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty across a suite of coproduced performance metrics can help determine the relative impact of management decisions on the adaptive capacity of communities under future climate scenarios.

J	Guthrie, G				Guthrie, Graeme			Real options analysis of climate-change adaptation: investment flexibility and extreme weather events	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation; Real options; Cost-benefit analysis; Learning	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; BENEFITS; COSTS; WATER	Investments in climate-change adaptation will have to be made while the extent of climate change is uncertain. However, some important sources of uncertainty will fall over time as more climate data become available. This paper investigates the effect on optimal investment decision-making of learning that reduces uncertainty. It develops a simple real options method to value options that are found in many climate-change adaptation contexts. This method modifies a binomial tree model frequently applied to climate-change adaptation problems, incorporating gradual learning using a Bayesian updating process driven by new observations of extreme events. It is used to investigate the timing, scale, or upgradable design of an adaptation project. Recognition that we might have more or different information in the future makes flexibility valuable. The amount of value added by flexibility and the ways in which flexibility should be exploited depend on how fast we learn about climate change. When learning will occur quickly, the value of the option to delay investment is high. When learning will occur slowly, the value of the option to build a small low-risk project instead of a large high-risk one is high. For intermediate cases, the option to build a small project that can be expanded in the future is high. The approach in this paper can support efficient decision-making on adaptation projects by anticipating that we gradually learn about climate change by the recurrence of extreme events.

The cause of this evolution in sediment transport which may be due to human activities (dam, pollution), climate variability and natural events has been investigated from a paleo-hydrological approach. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses of slackwater flood deposits are used to assess the impact of a dam installed in 1974 and the climate change on the evolution of sediment transport during about 60 years. Higher accumulation rate of about 3,64 cm/year is observed between 1950 and 1978, whereas it was much lower about 0,41 cm/year between 1990 and 2017. This strong decrease in sediment rate appears much more due to the impact of dam construction rather than to climate change, however climate change in an increasing concern for the future.

These have impacted water and fuel sources, habitats, human health, and economic productivity. Poorer populations and particularly females are more affected. The main objective of this study is therefore to assess gender inequalities in employment resultant from the effects of climate change and extreme climatic events. The study employs binary, ordered, and multinomial logistic models to analyse the effects on employment, intensity of employment and the effects in economic sectors, respectively. The study computes temperature deviations from its long-run mean as climate change variable and uses the Keetch-Byram Drought Index and number of heatwave days per year as proxies for extreme climatic events. Data for the work are from the South African Weather Services database and the National Income Dynamic Survey. The findings suggest that climate change reduces the probability of being employed more for males than females, but extreme events have more negative effects on female employment than males. We suggest that while climate change mitigations and adaptation measures geared towards the labour market should take priority in general, when extreme climate events occur, labour market support measures should weigh more towards females.

Flooding in Senegal was found to be viewed primarily as an urban planning concern rather than a climate change issue, with actions to address the impacts focussing on current vulnerabilities of urban communities without considering changing climate risks. While stakeholders thought event attribution might be useful to inform about climate change impacts and future risks of extreme events, it is unclear whether there would be an opportunity for this at present, due to the limited role climate information has in adaptation decision-making. While addressing vulnerability to extremes is necessary whether or not the risk is climate change-related, if long-term planning is to be resilient then knowledge about future changes in risks of extremes will need to be considered, even if individual events are not attributed to climate change.

As climate change intensifies, climate change adaptation strategies, such as flood insurance, energy taxes, and other risky financial strategies, have drawn worldwide attention and discussion. Risk control methods have been widely used to mitigate the impact of climate change on past flood losses, but past risk control strategies on climate change have not focused on the exploration of the relationship between environment, society, and humans. Based on the theoretical model of pro-environmental behavior, this study compares and analyzes four theoretical models and proposes a modified competitiveness model to effectively predict the pro-environmental behavior of college students with partial least squares (PLS) manner. Social norm could play a dominant role of mediator between risk perception, place attachment, and pro-environmental behavior. Although risk perception and local attachment are positively related to risk financial strategy, the promotion of social norms will increase the intention of risk financial strategy. For intention of risk financial strategies within pro-environmental behavior, the efficiency of enhancing local attachment was higher than that of risk perception.

Effect of climate change and urbanisation on flood protection decision-making	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						annual expected loss; climate change; flood protection; graduality; MCDA; urban projections	RISK-MANAGEMENT; URBAN; VULNERABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTIONS; RAINFALL; MODEL	The changing climate and the rapid urbanisation may alter flood severity and influence the decision-making process for flood management. In this study, a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework for optimal decision-making in flood protection is developed and applied to a central flood-prone basin of Jakarta, Indonesia. Specifically, the decisions are on levees corresponding to protection under different rainfall return periods (RP), considering climate change and associated uncertainties, urbanisation, and evolving socio-economic features of the flood plain. Three cases were studied to analyse future (year 2050) conditions (i) future rainfall/current urban, (ii) current rainfall/future urban and (iii) future rainfall/future urban. Future climate change projections from the NASA Earth Exchange are used to obtain information about changes in rainfall, whereas Landsat derived imperviousness maps along with the population projections are used for future urban conditions. Annual Expected Loss, Graduality, upgrade Construction cost and Net-Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index are the criteria used in the MCDA. It is found that climate change has a higher impact compared to urbanisation on the flood protection decisions. For the basin studied, the extreme future case of increased rainfall and urbanised conditions have the optimal decision in levee protection level corresponding to 250 years RP under current rainfall which corresponds to similar to 60 years RP under future rainfall.

We documented climatic changes on water systems observed by Indigenous Shawi and resultant impacts on health and livelihoods, and explored adaptation options and challenges in partnership with two Indigenous Shawi communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Qualitative data were collected via PhotoVoice, interviews, focus group discussions, and transect walks, and analyzed using a constant comparative method and thematic analysis. Quantitative data were collected via a household survey and analyzed descriptively. Households observed seasonal weather changes over time (n = 50; 78%), which had already impacted their family and community (n = 43; 86%), such as more intense rainfall resulting in flooding (n = 29; 58%). Interviewees also described deforestation impacts on the nearby river, which were exacerbated by climate-related changes, including increased water temperatures (warmer weather, exacerbated by fewer trees for shading) and increased erosion and turbidity (increased rainfall, exacerbated by riverbank instability due to deforestation). No households reported community-level response plans for extreme weather events, and most did not expect government assistance when such events occurred. This study documents how Indigenous peoples are experiencing climatic impacts on water systems, and highlights how non-climatic drivers, such as deforestation, exacerbate climate change impacts on water systems and community livelihoods in the Peruvian Amazon.

J	Addis, TL; Birhanu, BS; Italemahu, TZ				Addis, Tigezaw Lamesgin; Birhanu, Belay Simane; Italemahu, Tesfaye Zeleke			Factors Affecting Climate Change Governance in Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate-change adaptation; coordination; actors; political willingness; policy	MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; URBAN-POLITICS; CITIES; POLICY; AFRICA	Climate change in Ethiopia's capital city of Addis Ababa is characterized by an increase in rainfall and subsequent flooding and severe temperature with more heat waves. The city government has now recognized climate change as a serious threat, including it being a reason for loss of life and livelihoods. Even though governance has become a key mechanism to address a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and vulnerability to climate change, the practice of climate-change governance has been undermined by different factors. Thus, this study examined factors affecting climate-change governance in the city. The research adopted a mixed research design and depends on primary and secondary data sources. The binary logistic regression model and descriptive statistics were both used to analyse the quantitative data, while the descriptive method was used for the qualitative data. The results reveal that a lack of coordination, political will and leadership are the major factors that hinder the practice of governance in the city, followed by inadequate finance, policy, strategy, and regulation. In addition, a shortage of knowledgeable experts, lack of access to information and technologies had their own contributions to the ineffectiveness of climate-change governance. Thus, the city administration should place emphasis on climate change, giving it comparable weight to other crosscutting issues, and enabling the functioning of the steering committee with a strong accountability system. In addition, the city administration should take aggressive measures, including revising or formulating new policy, strategy or regulation, and even creating an independent institution for climate-change issues. Furthermore, the Addis Ababa City environmental protection and green development commission should create an enabling environment to attract non-state actors, in general, and NGOs, in particular, and should assign one directorate to mobilise finance, following the approach taken by the federal environmental protection commission. The commission should implement a mechanism to efficiently utilize the budget by applying continuous monitoring and evaluation. The commission should also provide continuous training and capacity building for leaders and experts at sub-city and Woreda levels.

Attribution of Extreme Events to Climate Change	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES			English	Review						extreme events; attribution; climate change; climate vulnerability	CHANGE LITIGATION; WEATHER; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; FLOOD; MODEL	Within the past decade, the attribution of extreme weather events and their impacts has enabled scientists, the public, and policymakers alike to connect real-world experiences of extreme weather events with scientific understanding of anthropogenic climate change. Attribution studies of recent extreme weather events have formed a new and important line of evidence in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report understanding present-day impacts of climate change. IPCC studies using different methods of event attribution have been assessed together, highlighting that these differences are smaller than the academic discourse on the methods suggests. This development raised two important research questions the science needs to answer: First, how do we formally combine attribution statements using highly conditional methods with probabilistic assessments of how climate change alters the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events? Second, under what circumstances are individual attribution studies still necessary and to what extent do existing attribution studies provide enough information to answer societal questions? Furthermore, the scientific development still leaves important gaps, particularly in countries of the Global South, leading to ethical questions around the need and requirement of attribution of extreme events in policy contexts, informing adaptation and loss and damage and the role of vulnerability.

This phenomenon can present direct threats to the assets as well as significant indirect effects for those relying on the services those assets deliver. Such threats are path-dependent and place-specific, as they strongly depend on current and future climate variability, location, asset design life, function and condition. One key question is how climate change is likely to increase both the probability and magnitude of extreme weather events under different scenarios of climate change. To address this issue, this paper investigates selected effects of climate change and their consequences on structural performance, in the context of evolving loading scenarios in three different continental regions: Europe, North America, and Asia. The aim is to investigate some main place-specific changes of the exposure in terms of intensity/frequency of extreme events as well as the associated challenges, considering some recent activities of members of the IABSE TG6.1. Climate change can significantly affect built infrastructure and the society by increasing the occurrence and magnitude of extreme events and increasing potential losses. Therefore, specific relationships relating hazard levels and structural vulnerability to climate change effects should be determined.

Network-Level Risk-Based Framework for Optimal Bridge Adaptation Management Considering Scour and Climate Change	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation planning; Bridge management; Optimization; Transportation network	DAMAGE RISKS; LOCAL SCOUR; OPTIMIZATION; PRECIPITATION; RELIABILITY; IMPACTS; HAZARD	Transportation networks, as an essential ingredient of civil infrastructure, are subjected to various natural hazards over their service life. Failure of bridges may severely disrupt the serviceability of transportation networks, causing considerable economic and social losses. Recently, climate change has been found to be liable for the increasing bridge vulnerability due to intensification of extreme hydrologic events (e.g., floods, sea level rise, and hurricanes). With the limited resources for infrastructure management and the growing risk compounded by climate change, effective risk-informed management for bridge adaptation actions is imperative for the safety and serviceability of transportation networks. This paper formulates a network-level, risk-based framework that determines the optimal adaptation schedules for bridges in a transportation network considering climate change effects. Bridge scour, one of the most common failure modes for bridges under floods, is investigated. The proposed framework (1) evaluates the consequences of bridge failure at the transportation network level, (2) considers climate change effects related to bridge scour using hydrologic modeling under different climate change scenarios, and (3) investigates the effects of budget availability and risk perception on the decision-making process. The proposed framework is demonstrated using an existing highway bridge network located in the Lehigh River watershed in Pennsylvania.

J	Lewellyn, C; Wadzuk, B				Lewellyn, Conor; Wadzuk, Bridget			Evaluating the Risk-Based Performance of Bioinfiltration Facilities under Climate Change Scenarios	WATER			English	Article						risk; green infrastructure; bioinfiltration; climate change; stormwater	BIORETENTION	Many communities throughout the world are utilizing green infrastructure practices to mitigate the projected impacts of climate change. While some areas of the world are anticipating droughts, other areas are preparing for an increased flood risk, due to changes in precipitation volume and intensity. Cities rely on practices such as bioinfiltration to sustainably capture stormwater runoff and provide resilience against climate change. As cities aim to increase resilience and decrease climate-change-associated risks, a greater understanding of these risks is needed. A risk-based approach was used to evaluate bioinfiltration design and performance. Climate projections from the Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 were used to create near-term (2020-2049) and long-term (2050-2079) climate datasets for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, using two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5). Both near-term and long-term climate models demonstrated increased precipitation and daily temperatures, similar to other areas in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Great Plains, and Alaska. Climate data were used to model bioinfiltration practices using continuous simulation hydrologic models. Overflow events and cumulative risk increased from bioinfiltration sites when compared to the baseline scenario (1970-1999). This study demonstrates how to apply a risk-based approach to bioinfiltration design using climate projections and provides recommendations to increase resilience in bioinfiltration design.

It is a serious threat to the global agriculture and its overall impact on global agriculture is yet not clear. A rise of 2.5-4.5 degrees C is expected in the global temperature until the end of 21st century. The amount of greenhouse gases particularly CO2 is increasing at an alarming rate and is enhancing the plant photosynthesis and productivity. However, this increase in productivity is counteract by the more negative effects of climate change on agriculture like increased evapotranspiration, drought, floods, changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall, higher pest infestations and more irrigation demand. Climate change also affects the nutrients availability and efficiency by influencing microbial activities and population in the soil. Therefore, adaptation of agriculture sector to the changing climate is indispensable because of its sensitivity and size. This review is aimed to document the possible impacts of climate change on agriculture, its causes and future projections. Some strategies are also advised to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases, to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture and to make new policies keeping in view their broader consequences on agriculture.

The global and regional impacts of climate change under representative concentration pathway forcings and shared socioeconomic pathway socioeconomic scenarios	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; hazard; drought; flood; heatwave; agricultural impacts; ScenarioMIP	DEGREES-C; PROJECTIONS; LEVEL; POLICY; DAMAGE	This paper presents an evaluation of the global and regional consequences of climate change for heat extremes, water resources, river and coastal flooding, droughts, agriculture and energy use. It presents change in hazard and resource base under different rates of climate change (representative concentration pathways (RCP)), and socio-economic impacts are estimated for each combination of RCP and shared socioeconomic pathway. Uncertainty in the regional pattern of climate change is characterised by CMIP5 climate model projections. The analysis adopts a novel approach using relationships between level of warming and impact to rapidly estimate impacts under any climate forcing. The projections provided here can be used to inform assessments of the implications of climate change. At the global scale all the consequences of climate change considered here are adverse, with large increases under the highest rates of warming. Under the highest forcing the global average annual chance of a major heatwave increases from 5% now to 97% in 2100, the average proportion of time in drought increases from 7% to 27%, and the average chance of the current 50 year flood increases from 2% to 7%. The socio-economic impacts of these climate changes are determined by socio-economic scenario. There is variability in impact across regions, reflecting variability in projected changes in precipitation and temperature. The range in the estimated impacts can be large, due to uncertainty in future emissions and future socio-economic conditions and scientific uncertainty in how climate changes in response to future emissions. For the temperature-based indicators, the largest source of scientific uncertainty is in the estimated magnitude of equilibrium climate sensitivity, but for the indicators determined by precipitation the largest source is in the estimated spatial and seasonal pattern of changes in precipitation. By 2100, the range across socioeconomic scenario is often greater than the range across the forcing levels.	[Arnell, N. W.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Lowe, J.

This comprehensive review intends to examine firstly the probable consequences of climate change on extreme weather events such as drought, flood and wildfire. This review subsequently examines the release and transformation of contaminants in terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric environments in response to extreme weather events driven by climate change. While drought and flood influence the dynamics of inorganic and organic contaminants in terrestrial and aquatic environments, thereby influencing their mobility and transport, wildfire results in the release and spread of organic contaminants in the atmosphere. There is a nascent awareness of climate change's influence of climate change-induced extreme weather events on the dynamics of environmental contaminants in the scientific community and decision-making processes. The remediation industry, in particular, lags behind in adopting adaptive measures for managing contaminated environments affected by climate change-induced extreme weather events. However, recognizing the need for assessment measures represents a pivotal first step towards fostering more adaptive practices in the management of contaminated environments. We highlight the urgency of collaboration between environmental chemists and climate change experts, emphasizing the importance of jointly assessing the fate of contaminants and rigorous action to augment risk assessment and remediation strategies to safeguard the health of our environment.

J	Yun, XB; Tang, QH; Sun, SA; Wang, J				Yun, Xiaobo; Tang, Qiuhong; Sun, Siao; Wang, Jie			Reducing Climate Change Induced Flood at the Cost of Hydropower in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						reservoirs; climate change; the Lancang-Mekong River Basin; tradeoffs	SOUTHEAST-ASIA; WATER; MODEL; IMPACTS; PRECIPITATION; OPERATIONS; DRIVERS; MONSOON	Hydropower dams are proliferating in the riparian countries of the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB) driven by the pursuit of renewable electricity and societal resilience to flooding. However, the tradeoffs between hydropower production and flood control are unclear in a changing environment. Here, we use a hydrological variable infiltration capacity model combined with a reservoir module to quantify the relative effects of climate change and reservoir operation on flood and hydropower generation in LMRB. Results show that while climate change would increase flood magnitude and frequency, adaptive reservoir operation can reduce flood magnitude by 5.6%-6.4% and frequency by 17.1%-18.9% at the cost of 9.8%-14.4% of basin-wide hydropower generation. Particularly, upstream reservoirs suffer more hydropower loss (5.4 times) than downstream ones when flood control is prioritized in reservoir regulation. Our findings have implications for integrated water and energy management at the transboundary river basin under climate change. Plain Language Summary Dams and reservoirs provide two important services, i.e., flood control and hydropower generation. In this study, we seek to understand the future tradeoff between these two services provided by reservoir regulation in the transboundary Lancang-Mekong River Basin. Using a modeling based approach, we find that climate change will likely lead to more frequent and larger flood events, but reservoir operation, by regulating water discharges and levels in streams, can effectively reduce flood frequency and magnitude at the expense of hydropower generation. Our results highlight the importance of coordinating water and energy management across countries in this transboundary river basin. Key Points Reservoir can mitigate future flood risk from climate change at the cost of reducing hydropower generation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin Reservoir regulation can delay the timing when flood risk exceeds the historical baseline by at least 20 years in Laos and Thailand Flood control measures would reduce hydropower at a magnitude of 5.4 times in China than downstream countries	[Yun, Xiaobo; Tang, Qiuhong; Wang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yun, Xiaobo; Tang, Qiuhong; Sun, Siao; Wang, Jie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Siao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS	Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Tang, QH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.	tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn	Sun, Siao/GMX-1603-2022	Wang, Jie/0000-0003-2520-2920; Sun, Siao/0000-0002-6860-3639; YUN, XIAOBO/0000-0002-8591-771X	National Natural Science Foundation of China [41730645]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060402]; International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [131A11KYSB20180034]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences	This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41730645), Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA20060402), and International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 131A11KYSB20180034).		65	11	12	14	75	AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION	WASHINGTON	2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA	0094-8276	1944-8007		GEOPHYS RES LETT	Geophys.

However, the lack of quantitative and objective analyses to ensure the stability and development of agroecosystems increases the complexity of agro-climatic mechanisms, which leads to uncertainty and undesirable consequences. In this paper, we review the characteristics of climate change in China (1951-2020), reveal the mechanisms of agroecosystem structure in response to climate, and identify challenges and opportunities for future efforts in the context of research progress. The aim is to improve the scientific validity and relevance of future research by clarifying agro-climatic response mechanisms. The results show that surface temperature, precipitation, and frequency of extreme weather events have increased to varying degrees in major agricultural regions of China in 1951-2020. And they have strong geographic variation, which has resulted in droughts in the north and floods in the south. Moreover, climate change has complicated the mechanisms of soil moisture, Net Primary Productivity (NPP), soil carbon pool, and crop pest structure in agroecosystems. This lends to a reduction in soil water holding capacity, NPP, soil carbon content, and the number of natural enemies of diseases and insects, which in turn affects crop yields. However, human interventions can mitigate the deterioration of these factors. We have also realized that the methodology and theory of historical research poses a great challenge to future agroecosystem. Historical and projected climate trends identified current gaps in interdisciplinary integration and multidisciplinary research required to manage diverse spatio-temporal climate change impacts on agroecosystems. Future efforts should highlight integrated management and decision making, multidisciplinary big data coupling, and numerical simulations to ensure sustainable agricultural development, ecological security, and food security in China.

Overcoming barriers to adapt rice farming to recurring flash floods in haor wetlands of Bangladesh	HELIYON			English	Article						Haor wetland; Agricultural system; Flash flood; Boro rice; Climate change; Adaptation to climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD SECURITY; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; AREAS; AGRICULTURE; COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY; CHALLENGES	Climate change resultant hazards have become a major threat to farming, food production sys-tems and agricultural sustainability globally. Like many other countries, Bangladesh is also the prey of climate change extremities. Haor wetlands of this country, a major rice growing area, are subjected to extreme climate tremors where millions of inhabitants lose their boro rice production due to recurring flash flood events. This study examined the barriers to adapt rice farming to recurring flash floods in the haor wetlands of Bangladesh. The ways of overcoming barriers to adapt rice farming to recurring flash floods in the haor wetlands of Bangladesh were also explored during the research work. The research was conducted in the Sunamganj district of Bangladesh and data was collected through a mixed-method approach. A survey was conducted with 115 haor farmers and FGD and key informant interviews were conducted with 32 and 4 respondents respectively. The results showed that the lack of availability of submergence tolerant variety (a rice variety that can survive and continue growing after being completely submerged in water for several days) is the major barrier to farmers' adaptation to flooding events followed by limited market access and lack of access to inputs. A total of 85% of respondents reported encountering moderate to severe barriers to adapt to flash flooding. Besides, some socio-economic traits, including annual family income, extension media exposure, and perception on climate change have been identified to be influencing farmers' adaptation behaviour to adapt their rice farming system to recurring flash flood events. This study elaborated pathways and suggested policy recommendations to adapt to flash flooding and to ensure sustainability in the agricultural system in the haor wetlands of Bangladesh.

Climate change, characterized by changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is anticipated to increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as drought, heat waves, and flooding. Potentially, climate change could severely compromise future forage crop production and should be considered a direct threat to food security. This review aimed to summarize our current understanding of the physiological and metabolic responses of temperate grasses to those abiotic stresses associated with climate change. Primarily, substantial decreases in photosynthetic rates of cool-season grasses occur as a result of high temperatures, water-deficit or water-excess, and elevated ozone, but not CO2 concentrations. Those decreases are usually attributed to stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. Additionally, while membrane instability and reactive oxygen species production was a common feature of the abiotic stress response, total antioxidant capacity showed a stress-specific response. Furthermore, climate change-related stresses altered carbohydrate partitioning, with implications for biomass production. While water-deficit stress, increased CO2, and ozone concentrations resulted in higher carbohydrate content, the opposite occurred under conditions of heat stress and flooding. The extent of damage is greatly dependent on location, as well as the type and intensity of stress. Fortunately, temperate forage grass species are highly heterogeneous. Consequently, through intra- and in particular inter-specific plant hybridization (e.g., Festuca x Lolium hybrids) new opportunities are available to harness, within single genotypes, gene combinations capable of combating climate change.

Coastal hazards have the potential to cause significant damage to coastal communities. Nevertheless, various other climate-related hazards also pose imminent threats. This review paper examines the impacts of climate change on ten European coastal cities by means of a participatory process involving the coastal cities and the review of existing literature. Local expertise is included through the novel concept of Coastal City Living Lab. The study also leverages bibliometric analysis of the Scopus and Web of Science databases, along with a desk review of climate-change related institutions and agencies at international, national, regional and local levels. By combining scientific literature analysis with insights from local experts, this research provides a comprehensive overview of the current situation of these diverse cities in relation to multiple climate-related hazards, which can be extrapolated to other cities. There is a scarcity of scientific data for some of the cities, hence collaboration with the CCLLs was crucial. Results serve as a valuable baseline for future works, introducing detail studies focusing on various climate-related challenges. This paper not only contributes novel insights by including the perceptions of local partners but also offers a unique perspective on the complex nature of climate change impacts at city level.

We focus on discerning whether and to what extent reservoirs can mitigate the risk of hydrologic extremes from the perspective of historical and future climate change.New hydrological insight for the region: We found that coupling reservoir operations into basin hydrological simulation can efficiently improve model capacity to capture both flood and hy-drological drought characteristics. The Nierji Reservoir contributed largely to reducing historical flood and drought risks in the NRB. However, the risk of floods and hydrological droughts will increase under future climate change, and reservoir operations cannot completely eliminate the increasing risks of future floods and hydrological droughts. The annual probability of flooding under different future scenarios will exceed 48%, much higher than the 22.2% for the historical period. The frequency of droughts is anticipated to increase by 139.20% under the Shared So-cioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 370 scenario. To mitigate the increase of flood and drought risks caused by future climate change, it is necessary to further optimize reservoir scheduling princi -ples, thereby improving the basin's resilience to hydrological extremes.

Climate change projections were obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), and their impacts on the hydrology of the catchment were investigated using HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS software. Results reveal that changes in LULC types, specifically an increase in proportions of agricultural and built-up areas and a decrease in forest cover, as undergone between years 1985 and 2018, have increased peak discharge following a storm, thereby causing an increase in spatial extent of floods of different return periods. Moreover, downscaled climate change scenarios from two General Circulation Models were used to determine potential changes in river discharge according to two GHG emission scenarios from the latest IPCC: SSP245 and SSP585. The projections indicate that peak discharge and the spatial extent of flooded areas will increase for floods with return periods ranging from two to 100 years. This study demonstrates the important influence that changes in LULC have had on the susceptibility of the BRB to flooding, with climate change projected to further enhance the risk of flooding as the century progresses.

Although climate change adaptation is being mainstreamed in Thailand, a well-organized overview of the impacts of climate change and potential adaptation measures has been unavailable to date. Here we present a comprehensive review of climate-change impact studies that focused on the Thai water sector, based on a literature review of six sub-sectors: riverine hydrology, sediment erosion, coastal erosion, forest hydrology, agricultural hydrology, and urban hydrology. Our review examined the long-term availability of observational data, historical changes, projected changes in key variables, and the availability of economic assessments and their implications for adaptation actions. Although some basic hydrometeorological variables have been well monitored, specific historical changes due to climate change have seldom been detected. Furthermore, although numerous future projections have been proposed, the likely changes due to climate change remain unclear due to a general lack of systematic multi-model and multi-scenario assessments and limited spatiotemporal coverage of the study area. Several gaps in the research were identified, and ten research recommendations are presented. While the information contained herein contributes to state-of-the-art knowledge on the impact of climate change on the water sector in Thailand, it will also benefit other countries on the Indochina Peninsula with a similar climate.

It plays a role in shaping the preparedness, adaptation, response, and resilience of vulnerable communities. However, the literature suggests that risk perception is contextually sensitive. There are limited studies that offer insights on the risk perception of climate change and related disaster events in an integrated manner. This study investigates the climate change and associated glacial lake outburst floods risk perceptions of the remotely located vulnerable communities in the northern mountainous region of Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. The study employed the quantitative method of household surveys in vulnerable communities for data collection. An extensive literature review was conducted to select the key indicators to determine the risk perception in the selected communities. Indexing and multiple regression analyses were performed to draw the results of the study. GLOF risk perception has been found higher as compared to the climate change risk perception. Fear has been found as the most significant determinant of the GLOF risk perception, whereas socio-economic variables of gender, education, duration of living, and past hazard experiences have been found to be predictors of climate change risk perception. Also, most people did not believe in a link between climate change and GLOF events. The study also provides an important finding for an effective policy formulation that communities are aware of the lifethreatening impacts of GLOFs, which may be used to increase community resilience against GLOFs through risk communication, preparedness campaigns, and climate change adaptation measures.

Assessing climate change-related losses and damages and adaptation constraints to address them: Evidence from flood-prone riverine communities in Southern Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Climate hazards; Floods; Loss and damage; Livelihoods; Riverine households	FARMERS PERCEPTIONS; FOOD SECURITY; ANAMBRA STATE; HOUSEHOLDS; CHALLENGES; RISK; AREAS	Rising evidence over the years reveal that reduction in greenhouse gases emission and adaptation to climate change effects have been unable to resolve the issue of climate change impacts, resulting to losses and damages. This has been attributed to natural, technical and economic constraints. In Nigeria, extreme climate events such as precipitation extremes and floods have been increasingly observed resulting in losses and damages in flood-prone communities. This study was aimed at assessing climate change-related losses and damages due to floods among farm households in riverine areas of Southern Nigeria. A multistage sampling procedure was utilized in selecting 240 households within eight riverine communities in Southern Nigeria. A mixed method research approach was used in eliciting responses from the respondents. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The market cost approach was used to value the losses and damages due to climate change. The respondents identified flooding as the major climate change hazard in the study location. The major effects of flooding on the livelihood of the respondents were loss of crops (98.6%), rise in food prices (92.8%) and poor health (75.6%). In response to increased climatic threats, farmers adopted various adaptation measures such as altering inputs such as varieties/species, income diversification and chemical fertilizer and pesticide use. The estimated average monetary value of losses and damages in community infrastructure, employ-ment, personal properties, crops and livestock were $28,409.09, $3095.23, $1583.52, $824.60 and $224.16, respectively. Perceived barriers to the respondents' taking adaptation actions in response to climate change-related losses and damages are inadequate government support, poor income of the respondents, high cost of transportation to purchase inputs for climate change adaptation and inadequate knowledge/information on climate change adaptation measures. We recommend that early warning mechanisms and alternative livelihood strategies should be pro-moted in vulnerable areas in order to reduce losses and damages due to climate change.	[Amaechina, E.

An unfavourable nexus between solid waste management issues and extreme hydrological events is examined mainly through extensive field investigation and literature research, which is an emerging issue affecting food safety and security whilst still being overlooked so far. The findings not only reveal the significance of the emerging issue but also support our proposed recommendations in the policy/legislation and technology sphere. This interdisciplinary research employs a holistic lens that covers diverse perspectives, including systemic problems, wastewater treatment, and environmental neuroscience, to explore the relationship between food, climate change, water management, and waste pollution, and to achieve novel discoveries for the practical adaptations of Egypt's challenges.

The influence of climate change advisory bodies on political debates: evidence from the UK Committee on Climate Change	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Climate change advisory bodies; climate change governance; UK climate policy; Committee on Climate Change		Climate change advisory bodies are rapidly proliferating around the world, often with statutory underpinning. While they are argued to be an important component of effective climate governance, few studies have systematically assessed their political influence. Using the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) as a case, this paper investigates how such bodies influence political debates on climate change. To do so, we build an original dataset of all CCC mentions in UK Parliamentary proceedings from 2008-2018. We find that CCC analysis is used by all major political parties, that its influence has grown over time and that it has influenced policy debates both within its statutory remit (carbon budgets) and more broadly (energy policy and flood defence spending). Furthermore, most politicians have been supportive of the CCC. They have utilized the information it produces to hold government accountable and to argue for more ambitious policy. We find little evidence that CCC analysis is politicized or that it merely functions as a 'legitimiser', providing justification for the government's pre-decided policy choices. Instead, we find that the CCC functions primarily as a knowledge broker, offering trusted information to policymakers, and at times as a policy entrepreneur. Overall, the CCC experience demonstrates that climate change advisory bodies can play a key role in climate governance. Key policy insights The information and analysis produced by the CCC is widely cited by Parliamentarians across the political spectrum and is often used as the technical basis for political arguments calling for greater ambition. CCC evidence has substantial influence in areas that are directly covered by its core statutory mandate, but also wider climate change-related Parliamentary debates, indicating knowledge spillovers. The UK experience shows that an expert advisory body can strengthen climate governance by serving as an impartial knowledge broker, contributing to more evidence-based and ambitious policymaking.

Traditional agricultural knowledge in land management: the potential contributions of ethnographic research to climate change adaptation in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Review						Local traditional knowledge; ethnographic research; climate change adaptation; soil fertility; soil erosion; food security	EROSION	Land supplies multiple goods and services vital to humans and the environment. In the last decades, increasing evidence of growing land degradation are made apparent. A limited and depleting resource base, the reliance on climate-sensitive sectors and its large population, make South Asia highly vulnerable to climate change. Observed changes in climate include increases in temperature and increased monsoon variability and rainfall pattern leading to drought and flooding. Projected changes include increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, increasing cyclonic activity and higher variability of rainfall, all having enormous impacts on farming communities. At the same time, the region is rich in traditional agricultural knowledge (TAK), specialized in managing local agroecosystems to ensure food availability, tackling climatic risks and other ecological uncertainties. Particularly relevant is TAK related to land management to preserve soil fertility and avoid soil erosion. Ethnographic research is a valuable source of TAK, although this is rarely analysed with a climate change perspective. Based on a qualitative systematic review, and an expert's on-line survey, in this paper we review land management TAK and assess its potential for climate change adaptation. The review shows there is a vast amount of untapped TAK ethnographic research with potential for climate change adaptation.	[Rivera-ferre, M.

SIDS have been quite vocal in calling attention to the challenges they face from climate change and advocating for greater international ambition to limit global warming. Here, we unpack factors that are helpful in understanding the relationship between climate change and SIDS through a review of studies that span disciplines and methodologies. We assess patterns of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability; impacts and risks; awareness and knowledge; adaptation planning and implementation; mitigation; loss and damage; and climate justice to provide an overarching review of literature on climate change and SIDS.

Indeed, the intensification of the water cycle occurring in different areas of the world can dramatically affect the incidence of extreme events and, consequently, the flow in rivers or artificial channels, increasing the probability of disastrous floods. In this context, the criteria for the assessment of flood risk need to be improved to take into account the variability of rainfall due to climate change. In this study, a Bayesian procedure was used to update the parameters of the depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curves and quantify the uncertainty related to their assessment in some climate change scenarios. The critical storm obtained from these updated DDF curves was used as input for the FLO-2D hydraulic model, in order to investigate the effects of climate change on flood risk. The area of study was an urban catchment in Piazza Armerina, a small town located in Southern Italy. Results showed that rainfall variations remarkably affect not only the magnitude of flood events, but also the flood susceptibility of the study area.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of climate change on farmland value in Bangladesh using the Ricardian model. Household-level data collected from seven selected agroecological zones in Bangladesh were used to estimate the relationships among farmland value and long-term climate, farm household, and policy variables. The results showed that the current land values of farmers are sensitive to climate. A new variable called "flooding" was added to the Ricardian model, and the results indicated that floods are responsible for reductions in farmland value, especially in lowland areas. Among the socio-economic variables, the availability of extension services and access to irrigation facilities were positively correlated with farmland value. The estimated marginal impact results suggested that increases in temperature were associated with losses in small farmland value, whereas the precipitation levels in both seasons positively influenced farmland value. Selected global climate models predicted that climate change would have a negative impact on land value depending on the climate model and source of farm income. The empirical findings obtained from this study are expected to contribute to the formulation of sustainable adaptation strategies to maintain farm productivity and farmland value in Bangladesh in the context of climate change.

Based on primary data, the authors examine major themes related to climate change and disasters as conveyed by individuals in a small agricultural region in Eastern Uganda. Specifically, we focus on the effects of living in constant threat of flooding and landslides. Results show that water is a major source of loss for most people, ranging from crop loss to contaminated water. Findings also point to the chronic nature of dealing with water issues, as opposed to acute. Further, our results indicate that disasters are a great equalizer among affected populations, with only neighbors to depend on in the aftermath.

Human activities have changed ecosystems hence it is important to determine ways to predict these consequences to enable the preservation and restoration of these key areas. Furthermore, extreme events attributed to climate change are becoming more frequent, aggravating the entire scenario and introducing ulterior uncertainties on the accurate and efficient management of these areas to protect the environment as well as the health and safety of people. In actual fact, climate change is altering rain patterns and causing extreme heat, as well as inducing other weather mutations. All these lead to more frequent natural disasters such as flood events, erosions, and the contamination and spreading of pollutants. Therefore, efforts need to be devoted to investigate the underlying causes, and to identify feasible mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce negative impacts on both the environment and citizens. To contribute towards this aim, the selected papers in this Special Issue covered a wide range of issues that are mainly relevant to: (i) the numerical and experimental characterization of complex flow conditions under specific circumstances induced by the natural hazards; (ii) the effect of climate change on the hydrological processes in mountainous, river, and coastal environments, (iii) the protection of ecosystems and the restoration of areas damaged by the effects of climate change and human activities.

In many cases, natural systems are converted into agricultural land to feed the growing population. However, despite climate change being a major focus nowadays, the impacts of these conversions on water resources, which are essential for agricultural production, is still often neglected, jeopardizing the sustainability of the socio-ecological system. This study investigates historic land use/land cover (LULC) patterns as well as potential future LULCC and its effect on water quantities in a complex tropical catchment in Tanzania. It then compares the results using two climate change scenarios. The Land Change Modeler (LCM) is used to analyze and to project LULC patterns until 2030 and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is utilized to simulate the water balance under various LULC conditions. Results show decreasing low flows by 6-8% for the LULC scenarios, whereas high flows increase by up to 84% for the combined LULC and climate change scenarios. The effect of climate change is stronger compared to the effect of LULCC, but also contains higher uncertainties. The effects of LULCC are more distinct, although crop specific effects show diverging effects on water balance components. This study develops a methodology for quantifying the impact of land use and climate change and therefore contributes to the sustainable management of the investigated catchment, as it shows the impact of environmental change on hydrological extremes (low flow and floods) and determines hot spots, which are critical for environmental development.

Climate change effects, such as increasing temperatures, drought and flooding, have already occurred, and are projected to worsen. Climate velocity, a metric that accounts for spatial heterogeneity in climate, can help identify contiguous areas under greater climate stress and potential climate refuges in addition to traditional temporal trends. Here, we examined the relative contribution of climate changes to forest loss in India during the period 2001-2018, at two spatial (regional and national) and two temporal (seasonal and annual) scales. This includes, for the first time, a characterization of climate velocity in the country. Our findings show that annual forest loss increased substantially over the 17-year period examined (2001-2018), with the majority of forest loss occurring in the Northeast region. Decreases in temporal trends of temperature and precipitation were most associated with forest losses, but there was large spatial and seasonal variation in the relationship. In every region except the Northeast, forest losses were correlated with faster velocities of at least one climate variable but overlapping areas of high velocities were rare. Our findings indicate that climate changes have played an important role in India's past forest loss, but likely remain secondary to other factors at present. We stress concern for climates velocities recorded in the country, reaching 97 km year(-1), and highlight that understanding the different regional and seasonal relationships between climatic conditions and forest distributions will be key to effective protection of the country's remaining forests as climate change accelerates.

While the literature highlights the need for involving both public and private actors, little is still known of how citizens perceive their own and others' responsibility, let alone the moral groundings for such perceptions. In this paper, we report the results of a survey regarding people's attitudes towards different ways of distributing responsibility for climate change adaptation. The survey was distributed to citizens in six Swedish municipalities and completed by 510 respondents. A large number of respondents wanted to assign responsibility for making decisions about and implementing adaptation measures to local governments, but also to property owners, whereas the national government was raised as responsible for setting decision boundaries and for financial support. The most preferred principles for a fair distribution of responsibility among the respondents were desert, ability, efficiency and need, while the principle of equal shares found less support. All principles received some support, indicating that it is necessary to consider several principles when distributing responsibility for climate change adaptation. Compared to earlier studies, this study shows more nuanced perceptions on who should be responsible and on what moral grounds.

Modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's statistics were used to examine climate parameters. Using climate factors and MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, regression analysis was used to study a 20-year (2001-2020) spatiotemporal climate-vegetation relationship. Landsat 5 and 7 NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) data, as well as SRTM DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data, were used to map extreme weather events such as floods caused by climate change. For mapping and data processing, ArcGIS and R tools were used. The findings revealed significant trends in climate parameters, which has led to climate change in the area, affecting NDVI and water cycles. The NDVI showed a generally good trend, however some places were damaged. Monsoon rain patterns and rates have been substantially disrupted, resulting in flash and fluvial floods. The risk of future floods owing to the Kabul and Indus rivers was shown through watershed delineation, which is compounded by climate change and anthropogenic activities. It is advised that government officials and policymakers establish climate change mitigation plans for regional sustainable development and vegetation restoration.

The mental health literature broadly characterises negative emotional reactions to extreme weather experiences as undesirable impacts on wellbeing. Yet, other research in psychology suggests that negative emotional responses to extreme weather are an important motivation for personal action on climate change. This article addresses the intersection of mental health and functional perspectives on negative emotions, with a specific focus on the potential that reduced negative emotional responses to extreme weather may also translate to diminished motivation to undertake climate change mitigation actions - which we term the 'resilience paradox'. Using survey data gathered in the aftermath of severe flooding across the UK in winter 2013/2014, we present new evidence indicating that self-appraised coping ability moderates the link between flooding experience and negative emotions and thereby attenuates the indirect link between flooding experience and climate change mitigation intentions. We conclude that support for flood victims should extend beyond addressing emotional, physical and financial stresses to include acknowledgement of the involvement of climate change and communication of the need for action to combat future climate risks.

It is highly vulnerable to climate change, affecting the wetland ecosystem and its associated fisheries. In the face of data deficiency, this article presents an alternative approach to assess the vulnerability of wetland fisheries to climate change. A total of 15 wetlands from a wetland-fisheries-rich area of West Bengal, India, were selected to illustrate the methodology. The proposed method mainly relies on stakeholders' perceptions of the wetland fisheries vulnerability. Elicitation stakeholders' response iteratively screened the indicators of fisheries vulnerability. The hybrid method of index-based vulnerability comprises two types of indicators: climate indicators with long-term quantitative data and stakeholder perceived vulnerability indicators specific to wetland fisheries. The high level of consensus (92%) among respondents provided strong evidence of climate change in last 15 years, which has also been validated through long-term data analysis. The Principal Component Analysis extracted five synthesized vulnerability indicators, explaining 83.35% variability of the original 14 indicators. The wetlands were further grouped according to differential vulnerability for prioritizing the wetlands for strategic planning. Climate change, reduction in species richness and adaptive capacity were the key components responsible for differential vulnerability. The study also revealed some indigenous climate-smart mitigation strategies of wetland fisheries to climate change.

Recent advances suggest that the frequency and intensity of destructive flood events on the Argentinian Pampas will increase under pressure from climate change. This paper provides bottom-up insight into the flood risk for soybean production systems under climate change and the suitability of adaptation strategies in two of the most flood-prone areas of the Pampas region. The flood risk perceptions of soybean producers were explored through interviews, translated into climatic indicators and then studied using a multi-model climate data analysis. Soybean producers perceived the present flood risk for rural accessibility to be of the highest concern, especially during the harvest and sowing seasons when heavy machinery needs to reach soybean lots. An analysis of climatic change projections found a rising trend in annual and harvest precipitation and a slight drying trend during the sowing season. This indicates that the flood risk for harvest accessibility may increase under climate change. Several adaptation strategies were identified that can systemically address flood risks, but these require collaborative action and cannot be undertaken by individual producers. The results suggest that if cooperative adaptation efforts are not made in the short term, the continued increase in flood risk may force soybean producers in the case study locations to shift away from soybean towards more robust land uses.

Determinants of climate change adaptation strategies and its impact on the net farm income of rice farmers in south-west Nigeria	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Rice production; Climate change; Adaptation strategies; MVP; ESRM	ENDOGENOUS SWITCHING REGRESSION; CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGY; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; DROUGHT-PRONE; ADOPTION; AGRICULTURE; SOIL; DIVERSIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT	A multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyse the determinants of strategies adopted for adapting to climate change in a sample of smallholder rice farmers in south-west Nigeria. An efficient endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) was used to estimate the impact of climate change adaptation strategy on the net income of rice farmers. The MVP results show that the socio-economic factors, the institutional factors, and locational variables of some households statistically influenced the choice of climate change adaptation strategies employed. Complementarities among all the adaptation strategies used by the farmers were revealed by the positive pair-wise correlation matrix of the MVP model. The study also indicated that farmers affected by prolonged drought and incidences of flood were more likely to adopt adaptation strategies on their farmlands. The ESRM treatment effect indicated that the average net income per rice farm of those who adopted the strategies was significantly higher than that of those who did not. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations related to agricultural extension systems and climate change education through information and communication technologies. This investment in education is essential for development and would encourage farmers to adopt appropriate climate change adaptation strategies.	[Ojo, T. O.; Baiyegunhi, L. J.

A systematic and critical review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Historic urban areas; Extreme events; Risk assessment; Vulnerability assessment; Exposure	CULTURAL-HERITAGE; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; FLOOD VULNERABILITY; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CITIES; SITES	It is worldwide accepted that climate change is affecting cities and that the conservation of the cultural heritage contributes to sustainable development. However, despite the high level of interest and research in climate change risks on socioeconomic, urban and natural systems, studies that assess climate change impacts on urban cultural heritage and contribute to a holistic understanding on the subject present noticeable gaps in knowledge. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to assess the state -of-the-art of cultural heritage risk assessment methodologies within urban systems in the context of climate change, specifically historic urban areas. For this purpose, a systematic search was applied using Web of Science and Scopus. The search identified and characterized existing methodologies on vulnerability and risk assessment for cultural heritage in a changing climate following the PRISMA protocol, and it synthesized knowledge gaps to be addressed in the near future. This study aims to bring risk assessment methodologies closer to urban planners for more efficient climate change adaptation policies. The research concluded that there is an unbalance between the amount of methodologies for the different climate change derived hazards and their impacts on historic urban areas. The amount of methodologies focused on flooding highlights that further research is needed for other relevant hazards, like heat and cold waves, that contribute to a holistic perspective.

Foremost among these challenges is securing potable water for the urban population, while at times, mitigating flood risks. This article presents research on urban water issues in the rapidly growing city of Dhulikhel in Nepal within a global purview of climate change processes and impacts on urban water. The vulnerabilities to climate change are extremely high in Himalayan cities. New theoretical approaches are required to accurately define problems, causation and potential solutions. Our research has experimented with and developed the concept of Critical Urban Water Zones (CUWZs), which integrates vertical and horizontal elements of the physical environment with social, political and cultural considerations over time. CUWZ enables the identification of critical water management issues in local areas and provides a foundation for future urban water management policy and practices that are climate adaptive and equitable.

J	Mickovski, SB				Mickovski, Slobodan B.			Re-Thinking Soil Bioengineering to Address Climate Change Challenges	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						soil bioengineering; nature-based solutions; climate change adaptation; landslides; erosion	STABILITY	Soil bioengineering includes the sustainable use of vegetation for civil engineering purposes, including addressing climate change challenges. Previous research in this area has been focused on determination of the strength and stability that vegetation provides for the soil it grows in. The industry, on the other hand, has concentrated on mainly empirical approaches in the design and construction of nature-based solutions. The aim of this paper is to attempt a reconciliation of the scientific and technical aspects of soil bioengineering with a view of proposing broad guidelines for management of soil bioengineering projects aimed at combatting climate change and achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). More than 20 case studies of civil engineering projects addressing climate change challenges, such as erosion, shallow landslides, and flooding, were critically reviewed against the different project stages and the UN SDGs. The gaps identified in the review are addressed from civil engineering and asset management perspectives, with a view of implementing the scientific and technical nexus in the future. Recommendations are formulated to help civil engineers embrace the multidisciplinary nature of soil bioengineering and effectively address climate change challenges in the future.

Property-level analysis shows that individuals are more likely to terminate flood insurance after unanticipated premium increases if they do not perceive climate change as a risk. We use the heterogeneous impact of widening partisan polarization on climate change beliefs to rule out alternative explanations.

J	Hasan, MK; Kumar, L				Hasan, Md Kamrul; Kumar, Lalit			Perceived farm-level climatic impacts on coastal agricultural productivity in Bangladesh	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Farm productivity; Farmer perception; Coastal agriculture; Climatic hazard	LOCAL PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; SALINITY; COMMUNITIES; SYSTEMS; RISK; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; MODELS	Coastal farmers are the first group of people who feel climate-related calamities most severely, such as sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, coastal flooding, tidal surges and tropical cyclones. They are operating agricultural activities under these climatic conditions that affect farm productivity. This study explores farmer perceptions of changes in farm productivity and perceptions of causes of decreased farm productivity (if any) over the past 10 years compared with more than 10 years back. We partitioned the causes of decreased farm productivity into climatic and non-climatic based on the primary data collected through household survey in ten coastal subdistricts along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. We visited 381 households during September-October 2018 using a pre-tested structured interview schedule. Average monetary farm productivity in the study area was 1.98. A small proportion (11%) of the sampled farmers mentioned that farm productivity had decreased over the past years. A majority (64%) of them believed that climate change was responsible for such decreases in farm productivity. The farmers who thought that climate change was causing the decreased farm productivity were characterized by greater education, more awareness of climate change, less communication with extension agents, stronger belief in decreased cyclone and salinity, and weaker belief in decreased flood. The farmers perceived that dry period salinity, flood and coastal inundations were the major products of climate change to adversely affect crop productivity. Since agricultural adaptation to climate change requires clear understanding of the climatic impacts on farm productivity, and more than one-third of the farmers failed to identify climatic impacts on decreased farm productivity, their improvement of climate change awareness is essential. Extension organizations and other agents should promote updated climate knowledge among farmers to make them more aware of climate change issues, so that they can adapt to climate change through their agricultural activities.

However, climate change will alter rainfall patterns, increase the incidence and severity of extreme events, and gradually increase temperatures which will all modify terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems. Our comprehensive review of reported climate change impacts in New Zealand indicates that most measured impacts to date are due to indirect impacts (such as exacerbation of invasive species impacts) and most are in the marine realm. Ocean acidification and marine heatwaves are particularly problematic for calcareous organisms and algae respectively. Other notable impacts include thermal squeeze in the alpine zone and impacts of drought on freshwater fish. Very small populations of rare and threatened species can be very vulnerable to extreme events (e.g. fire, floods). While the evidence for climate change impacts is sparse in some regions and for some ecosystems, we encourage ongoing monitoring to identify processes of decline that may need to be mitigated. We identify five key research needs to improve our understanding of the threat of climate change to the biodiversity of Aotearoa New Zealand.

A remaining question is whether the experience of an extreme weather event increases climate change concern via experiential learning or reinforces existing views via motivated reasoning. Building on this work, we explore the relationship between personal experience and climate change policy preferences using surveys in 10 communities that experienced extreme weather events (3 tornadoes, 3 floods, 2 wildfires, 1 hurricane and 1 landslide). We find that self-reported personal harm aligns with objective measures of event impacts and that personal harm (i.e., experience) is associated with higher levels of policy support. However, we do not find that objective measures of event impacts are related to policy support. Though political ideology (i.e., motivated reasoning) dominates our model of policy support in predictable ways, personal harm moderates this relationship suggesting that conservatives reporting higher levels of personal harm from the event are, on average, more likely to express support for climate policy than those reporting lower levels of harm. We postulate that while extreme weather events may serve as teachable moments on climate change, their lessons may only reach conservatives who feel personally harmed, even in the communities most affected.

Comparing individual properties in the same zip code with similar elevation and proximity to the coast, houses exposed to sea level rise (SLR) are increasingly more likely to be owned by Republicans and less likely to be owned by Democrats. We find a partisan residency gap for even mod-erately SLR exposed properties of more than 5 percentage points, which has more than doubled over the past six years. Findings are unchanged controlling flexibly for other indi-vidual demographics and a variety of granular property characteristics, including the value of the home. Residential sorting manifests among owners regardless of occupancy, but not among renters, and is driven by long-run SLR exposure but not current flood risk. Antic-ipatory sorting on climate change suggests that households that are most likely to vote against climate friendly policies and least likely to adapt may ultimately bear the burden of climate change.Published by Elsevier B.V.

Data was collected using photovoice, visual art, journal reflections, and group discussions. During the study, youth expressed a strong connection with nature for their development or wellbeing. Issues such as environmental degradation and climate change were identified as causes for concern. They discussed human responsibility for environmental stewardship both in their local communities and globally. Climate change hazards such as flood and fire, human action leading to environmental pollution, and human responsibility for environmental stewardship surfaced as issues for their development. Youth expressed a felt responsibility to act on climate change and to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the Earth. Based on youth voices, we conclude that attempts to engage youth in climate action without considering their psychosocial wellbeing, may overburden them.

There is limited understanding of how heritage narratives mediate local dialogue about climate resiliency. We conducted in-depth interviews with residents of varying socioeconomic status, race, length of residence, and climate change beliefs in two localities impacted by severe flooding. Heritage narratives influenced perspectives of some residents in Detroit, Michigan (n = 20) and Waterbury, Vermont (n = 15) regarding causes of recent record-setting floods, and appropriate solutions to mitigate future flooding. Some agreement on solutions emerged, with notable exceptions. Those who blamed government mismanagement desired specific government actions, while those who blamed climate change emphasized emissions reductions. In Waterbury, income affected residents' feelings of disconnection and associated communication needs. In Detroit, race influenced perspectives in key ways. Implications for ways to improve environmental justice of climate change mitigation policies and dialogue are provided.

Climate change and the 'heat island effect' have increased the frequency of extreme precipitation. Affected by the backwardness of drainage facilities and the lack of drainage capacity, many cities have experienced large-scale waterlogging in low-lying areas, and ocean-like phenomena appear in cities. The public infrastructure was damaged and caused a lot of economic losses. Therefore, it is important to investigate the adaptability of drainage systems to the future in a changing environment. The Sixth International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) were used to quantify the impact of climate change on Beijing's waterlogging under different rainstorm scenarios for the future 40 years. The quantile delta mapping method of daily precipitation based on frequency (DFQDM) is proposed to correct the daily precipitation of the climate model and which is proved to be feasible. After the annual precipitation and extreme precipitation index are corrected, percent bias (PBIAS) is significantly reduced. The PBIAS of the extreme precipitation index of the corrected model is all controlled within 6%. The corrected accuracy of CanESM5 is the best. The total flood volume (TFV) of the node increases with the aggravation of climate change. The TFV of SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 increased by 45.43 and 20.8% in the 100-year return period, respectively, and more than 94% of the conduits reached the maximum drainage capacity in different return periods. After the low impact development (LID) was installed, the improvement effect on the outflow with a smaller return period was significant, decreasing by about 50%. The LID can effectively reduce the overflow of the drainage system. The results of this study can provide suggestions for the reconstruction of the drainage system and the management of flood risk for Beijing in the future.

Although the efficiency of the protected area network of the Amazon basin may be jeopardized by climate change, floodplains are exposed to important consequences of climate change but are omitted from species distribution models and protection gap analyses. The present and future (2070) distribution of the giant bony-tongue fish Arapaima spp. (Arapaimidae) was modelled accounting for climate and habitat requirements, and with a consideration of dam presence (already existing and planned constructions) and hydroperiod (high- and low-water stages). The amount of suitable environment that falls inside and outside the current network of protected areas was quantified to identify spatial conservation gaps. We predict that climate change will cause a decline in environmental suitability by 16.6% during the high-water stage, and by 19.4% during the low-water stage. About 70% of the suitable environments of Arapaima spp. remain currently unprotected. The gap is higher by 0.7% during the low-water stage. The lack of protection is likely to increase by 5% with future climate change effects. Both existing and projected dam constructions may hamper population flows between the central, Bolivian and Peruvian parts of the basin. We highlight protection gaps mostly in the south-western part of the basin and recommend the extension of the current network of protected areas in the floodplains of the upper Ucayali, Jurua and Purus rivers and their tributaries. This study has shown the importance of integrating hydroperiod and dispersal barriers in forecasting the distribution of freshwater fish species, and stresses the urgent need to integrate floodplains within the protected area networks.

J	Rasool, S; Rana, IA; Ahmad, S				Rasool, Samavia; Rana, Irfan Ahmad; Ahmad, Shakil			Linking flood risk perceptions and psychological distancing to climate change: A case study of rural communities along Indus and Chenab rivers, Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Awareness; Climate change adaptation; Preparedness; Worry	PERSONAL-EXPERIENCE; PERCEIVED RISK; VULNERABILITY; DISASTER; PREPAREDNESS; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; EXPOSURE; HEALTH	Climate change contributes to the increasing frequency and severity of floods around the globe. Developing countries are being dispmportionally affected. In 2010, Pakistan witnessed one of the worst floods in its history. One-fifth of the country was severely affected, leading to major economic losses and casualties. Thus, it is imperative to understand climate change and flood risk perception for designing flood risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies. This study examines flood risk perception and psychological distance to climate change of rural communities along the Indus and Chenab rivers in Muzaffargarh district, Pakistan. Flood risk perception was measured using three main components, i.e., awareness about floods, worry (about floods), and preparedness. Psychological distance to climate change was quantified using five dimensions, i.e., psychological, geographic, social, temporal, and uncertainty. Yamane sampling method was used, and 365 samples were collected. The data was collected using household surveys from rural communities. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, ANOVA-test, and Pearson's correlation were performed. Results indicate that overall flood risk perception and psychological distance to climate change was moderate in a high flood risk area. A negative correlation was also observed between uncertainty and worry. Regression analyses indicate a strong positive influence of homeownership on flood risk perception and the converse impact on the psychological distance to climate change. This study can help integrate the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The paper also highlights the need to improve risk communication strategies to help people understand climate change and its impacts, adopt precautionary measures, and reduce flood risks.

It is well known that the Himalayas region is affected by climate change, as reflected in the basic knowledge of farmers in the region. A questionnaire-based survey involving a total of 747 households was conducted to gather information on climate change and its impact, where the survey addressed four physiographic regions of the trans-boundary Koshi River Basin (KRB). Moreover, climatic data were used to calculate climatic trends between 1980 and 2018. The Mann-Kendall trend test was performed and the Sen's slope calculated to analyze the inter-annual climatic trends over time. The survey noted that, for the basin, there was an increase in temperature, climate-induced diseases of crops, an increase in the frequency of pests as well as drought and floods and a decrease in rainfall, all which are strong indicators of climate change. It was perceived that these indicators had adverse impacts on crop production (89.4%), human health (82.5%), livestock (68.7%) and vegetation (52.1%). The observed climatic trends for all the physiographic regions included an increasing temperature trend and a decreasing rainfall trend. The rate of change varied according to each region, hence strongly supporting the farmers' local knowledge of climate change. The highest increasing trend of temperature noted in the hill region at 0.0975 degrees C/a (p = 0.0002) and sharpest decreasing trend of rainfall in the mountain region by -10.424 mm/a (p = 0.016) between 1980 and 2018. Formulation of suitable adaptation strategies according to physiographic region can minimize the impact of climate change. New adaptation strategies proposed include the introduction of infrastructure for irrigation systems, the development of crop seeds that are more tolerant to drought, pests and disease tolerance, and the construction of local hospitals for the benefit of farming communities.

Existing AM projects are at risk from climate change, and current AM guidance does not provide adequate methods to deal with this risk. Climate change adaptation (CCA) is an approach to plan and implement actions to reduce risks from climate variability and climate change, and to exploit beneficial opportunities. AM projects could be made more resilient to extreme climate events by applying the principles and procedures of CCA. To test this idea, we analyze the effects of extreme climatic events on five existing AM projects focused on ecosystem restoration and species recovery, in the Russian, Trinity, Okanagan, Platte, and Missouri River Basins. We examine these five case studies together to generate insights on how integrating CCA principles and practices into their design and implementation could improve their sustainability, despite significant technical and institutional challenges, particularly at larger scales. Although climate change brings substantial risks to AM projects, it may also provide opportunities, including creating new habitats, increasing the ability to quickly test flow-habitat hypotheses, stimulating improvements in watershed management and water conservation, expanding the use of real-time tools for flow management, and catalyzing creative application of CCA principles and procedures.

El Colli presents three diverse ways of inhabiting the space (informal settlements, consolidated popular neighborhoods, and closed subdivisions). Also, El Colli shows that the increasingly occurrence of risks such as floods is immersed not only in climate change but also in the processes of transformation and degradation of the territory linked to urbanization patterns. That said, the question that guides the research is, how is social vulnerability to climate change configured from the experience of families that live in contexts of socio-spatial segregation? To provide an answer, I carried out an ethnographic study guided by the differences in social vulnerability to flood risk. Furthermore, I propose a theoretical framework aimed at denaturalizing climate change. For this, the contributions of studies on the social construction of risk from the social vulnerability approaches were taken as a reference. In conclusion, the case of El Colli shows that ignoring the structural causes of social vulnerability to risk events, such as floods, can promote situations of environmental injustice, especially for indigenous and migrant populations residing in irregular settlements.

Fossil fuel consumption produces CO2, and trapping heat is the major reason for a rapid increase in global temperature, and electricity generation is responsible for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and their adverse impact have become the focus of efforts to mitigate climate change vulnerability. This study explores empirical determinants of vulnerability to climate change such as ecosystem, food, health and infrastructure. The sustainable use of energy is necessary for development, and a source of response to climate change. The present study focuses on renewable energy consumption to determine climate vulnerability in G7 countries between 1995 and 2019. The panel ARDL approach showed that the renewable to non-renewable energy mix showed a quadratic effect on vulnerability, whereby a minimum threshold of renewable energy is required to witness a reduction in food, health and infrastructure vulnerability. Other results indicate that trade openness and development expenditures reduce health vulnerability. Development expenditures also decrease ecosystem vulnerability, while trade openness increases it. However, both of these variables increase infrastructure vulnerability. Avoiding severe food and water crises requires investment to tackle climate change, conserve energy and water resources, reform global trade and food markets, and adapting and adopting climate-resilient responses to change.

Report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change: implications for the mental health policy of children and adolescents in Europe-a scoping review	EUROPEAN CHILD & ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Climate change; Global warming; Mental health; Children and adolescents; Psychological consequences	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; FOOD INSECURITY; AIR-POLLUTION; IMPACT; INFLAMMATION; EXPOSURE; DEPRESSION; DISASTERS; SCHOOL; FLOOD	Climate change is a worldwide challenge. Its consequences do encompass severe threats not only for the existence and somatic health, but also for the mental health of children and adolescents. Mental health can be impaired by three types of consequences. Direct consequences of climate change, such as natural disasters and indirect consequences, such as loss of land, flight and migration, exposure to violence, change of social, ecological, economic or cultural environment. Moreover, the increasing awareness of the existential dimension of climate change in children and adolescents can influence their well-being or challenge their mental health. Consequences of climate change for somatic health may interact with mental health or have psychological sequelae in children and adolescents. Based on the estimates by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have summarized current data on these differential pathways as to how climate change affects the mental health of children worldwide through selective literature research on Pubmed. Mental health sequelae of direct and indirect consequences of climate change, increased awareness and physical health problems caused by climate change are presented. We give insights into special vulnerabilities of children and adolescents and identify high-risk groups. As the "Fridays for Future" movement has been initiated in northern Europe, we will discuss these results with a focus on children and adolescents in Europe. The results indicate that climate change is a serious threat to children and adolescent mental health. Children ' s rights, mental health and climate change should not continue to be seen as separate points; instead, they need to be brought together to address this major challenge determining the future of our children and their descendants.

Based on representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, the future (2030-2050) waterlogging was assessed for the DHC basin and combined with future design rainfall. The delta change factors were projected using the regional climate model, RegCM4.6, and the annual maximum one-day rainstorm was modified to develop the annual maximum value method. By combining the delta change and annual maximum value methods, a future short-duration design rainstorm formula is developed in this study. The Chicago hyetograph shapes indicated that the peak rainfall intensity and amount both increase in the five return periods with two RCP scenarios. The InfoWorks ICM urban flood model is used to simulate the hydrological response. The results show that climate change will exacerbate urban waterlogging in DHC Basin. The maximum inundation volume and number of inundation nodes were expected to increase in the five return periods under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The submerged area is increasing due to climate change. This study highlights the link between climate change and urban drainage systems, and suggests that the effect of climate change in extreme rainfall should be considered in urban waterlogging management and drainage system design.

J	Lucertini, G; Di Giustino, G				Lucertini, Giulia; Di Giustino, Gianmarco			Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture as a Tool for Food Security and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation: The Case of Mestre	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban and peri-urban agriculture; food security; climate change; multifunctionality; edible green infrastructure	HEAT-ISLAND; VEGETABLE PRODUCTION; PRODUCTION CAPACITY; POTENTIAL IMPACT; CROP PRODUCTION; CITY; GARDENS; SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIES; SERVICES	Urban and peri-urban areas are subject to major societal challenges, like food security, climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency, land management, social cohesion, and economic growth. In that context, Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture (UPA), thanks to its multifunctionality, could have a high value in providing social, economic, and environmental co-benefits. UPA is an emerging field of research and production that aims to improve food security and climate change impact reduction, improving urban resilience and sustainability. In this paper, a replicable GIS-based approach was used to localize and quantify available areas for agriculture, including both flat rooftop and ground-level areas in the mainland of the city of Venice (Italy). Then, possible horticultural yield production was estimated considering common UPA yield value and average Italian consumption. Climate change mitigation, like CO2 reduction and sequestration, and climate change adaptation, like Urban Flooding and Urban Heat Island reduction, due to the new UPA areas' development were estimated. Despite the urban density, the identified areas have the potential to produce enough vegetables for the residents and improve climate change mitigation and adaptation, if transformed into agricultural areas. Finally, the paper concludes with a reflection on the co-benefits of UPA multifunctionality, and with some policy suggestions.

A systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the impact of droughts, flooding, and climate variability on malnutrition	GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						Climate change; malnutrition; droughts; flooding; climate variability; wasting; underweight; stunting	CHRONIC ENERGY DEFICIENCY; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; CHILD MALNUTRITION; WESTERN RAJASTHAN; HEALTH; CONSEQUENCES; PREVALENCE; MORTALITY; ADULTS; TRENDS	Background Both the World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change project that malnutrition will be the greatest contributor to climate change-associated morbidity and mortality. Although there have been several studies that have examined the potential effects of climate change on human health broadly, the effects on malnutrition are still not well understood. We conducted a systematic review investigating the role of three climate change proxies (droughts, floods, and climate variability) on malnutrition in children and adults. Methods and findings We identified 22 studies examining the effects of droughts, floods, and climate variability on at least one malnutrition metric. We found that 17 out of 22 studies reported a significant relationship between climate change proxies and at least one malnutrition metric. In meta-analysis, drought conditions were significantly associated with both wasting (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.05-2.04) and underweight prevalence (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.11). Conclusions Given the long-term consequences of malnutrition on individuals and society, adoption of climate change adaptation strategies such as sustainable agriculture and water irrigation practices, as well as improving nutritional interventions aimed at children aged 1-2 years and older adults, should be prioritised on global policy agendas in the coming years.

By the example of three neighbouring Alpine regions (Switzerland, Southern Germany and Austria), the study strives to shed further light on how flood risk governance regimes embrace the possible impacts of climate change. It builds on the assumption that flood risk management, as a technical' policy field, is strongly influenced by scientific evidence and that differences in how countries incorporate climate change can be explained by the way science and policy are brought together in the respective national arenas. We structure the empirical analysis along three dimensions: (i) dynamics of knowledge creation; (ii) institutionalization of the science-policy interface; and (iii) pathways of influence of expertise on policy development. We find that there is a mixed, though increasing influence of climate change on flood risk governance in the three selected Alpine regions. Climate adaptation has become an important issue of flood policy in all three study areas, and this shift has been strongly supported by evidence-based arguments.

The Impact of Climate Change on Vaccine-Preventable Diseases: Insights From Current Research and New Directions	CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS			English	Article						Environment; Climate change; Modeling; Vaccine-preventable diseases	HEPATITIS-A VIRUS; EL-NINO; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; CHOLERA INCIDENCE; TROPICAL PACIFIC; ROTAVIRUS; TRANSMISSION; SEASONALITY; BANGLADESH; TEMPERATURE	Purpose of Review Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a major public health concern globally. Climate is a key driver of the dynamics of many infectious diseases, including those that are vaccine preventable. Understanding the impact of climate change on vaccine-preventable diseases is, thus, an important public health research priority. Here, we summarize the recent literature and highlight promising directions for future research. Recent Findings Vaccine-preventable enteric diseases, such as cholera, exhibit sensitivity to precipitation and flooding events. The predicted increase in extreme weather events as a result of climate change could exacerbate outbreaks of these pathogens. For airborne pathogens, temperature and specific humidity have been shown to be the most important environmental drivers, although the impact of climate change on disease burden and dynamics remains unclear. Finally, the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases are dependent on both temperature and precipitation, and climate change is expected to alter the burden and geographic range of these diseases. However, understanding the interacting effects of multiple factors, including socioeconomic and ecological factors, on the vector-borne disease ecosystem will be a crucial step towards forecasting disease burden under climate change. Recent work has demonstrated associations between climate and transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases. Translating these findings into forecasts under various climate change scenarios will require mechanistic frameworks that account for both intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of transmission, and the non-linear effects on disease burden. Future research should also pay greater attention to uncertainty in both the climate modeling processes as well as disease outcomes in the context of vaccine-preventable diseases.

However, the systematic analysis of climate risks and the associated costs of tackling them, particularly from a quantitative perspective, is still at an embryonic phase due to the kaleidoscopic nature of climate change impacts and lack of precise climatic data. To cope with such challenges, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is applied in this paper to understand climate threats of the railway system. This model ranks climate risks under high uncertainty in data and comprehensively evaluates these risks by taking account of infrastructure resilience and specific aspects of severity of consequence. Through conducting a nationwide survey on the British railway system, it dissects the status quo of primary climate risks. The survey implies that the top potential climate threats are heavy precipitation and floods. The primary risks caused by the climate threats are bridges collapsing and bridge foundation damage due to flooding and landslips. The findings can aid transport planners to prioritise climate risks and develop rational adaptation measures and strategies.

Assessing the effectiveness of Sustainable Land Management for large-scale climate change adaptation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Rainfed agriculture; Soil erosion; Hydrological impact; Water security	SOIL-EROSION; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CATCHMENT SCALE; EURO-CORDEX; CHECK-DAMS; RUNOFF; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION	Climate change will strongly affect essential ecosystem services, like the provision of freshwater, food production, soil erosion and flood control. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices are increasingly promoted to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, but there is lack of evidence at scales most relevant for policymaking. We evaluated the effectiveness of SLM in a large Mediterranean catchment where climate change is projected to significantly reduce water security. We show that the on-site and off-site impacts of climate change are almost entirely reversed by the large-scale implementation of SLM under moderate climate change conditions, characterized by limited reductions in annual precipitation but significant increased precipitation intensity. Under more extreme reductions of annual precipitation, SLM implementation reduces the impacts on water security, but cannot prevent significant increased plant water stress and reduced water availability. Under these conditions, additional adaptation measures are required considering their interactions and trade-offs regarding water security. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Eekhout, J. P.

Climate change has become an issue that must be faced by humans today and in the future. One of the impacts of climate change can be found in coastal areas. Tsunamis and tidal floods repeatedly occur in coastal areas. One of the efforts to overcome sea level rise that causes tsunamis, erosion, and tidal flooding is mangrove forests. This study aims to determine public awareness of the occurrence of tidal flooding and tsunami and to find an easy and inexpensive way to overcome it. This research is integrated using the partial least square (PLS) approach and the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) approach to mangrove forests. The results showed that the awareness and assessment of the community to carry out mangrove forest restoration to overcome disasters caused by climate change must be managed and handled with a co-management approach..

In Pakistan, severe impacts of climate change have become evident in the recent past. Large-scale floods in the Indus river system have caused massive damages in the past decade. Also, frequent droughts and heatwaves are among other consequences of the changing climate in the country. Understanding the perspective of local communities regarding climate change adaptation strategies is pivotal to effective policymaking. We surveyed the rural community in the Indus Basin, in southern Punjab, Pakistan, to assess the climate change adaptations currently practiced. We found that the respondents perceive droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks (which are frequently followed by flooding events) as major climate change-induced threats. The respondents used flood and drought-resistant crop varieties, field boundaries (spate irrigation), migration to safe places, and loans as key adaptation strategies. We also assessed the socioeconomic determinants of climate change adaptation behaviour using a binary logistic regression model. Gender, occupation, and education influenced the adaptations to climate change. The present study highlights the need for monetary support to flood-prone communities, better medical facilities, provision of drought and flood-resistant crop varieties, and awareness campaigns to enhance adaptive capacity in the study area.

An application to afforestation as a flood management measure in the Scottish Borders	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Economic appraisal; Real options; Flooding; Afforestation	WATER; RISK; SYSTEMS; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES; VALUATION; FOREST	Climate change uncertainty makes decisions for adaptation investments challenging, in particular when long time horizons and large irreversible upfront costs are involved. Often the costs will be immediate and clear, but the benefits may be uncertain and only occur in the distant future. Robust decision-making methods such as real options analysis (ROA) handle uncertainty better and are therefore useful to guide decision-making for climate change adaptation. ROA allows for learning about climate change by developing flexible strategies that can be adjusted over time. Practical examples of ROA to climate change adaptation are still relatively limited and tend to be complex. We propose an application that makes ROA more accessible to policy-makers by using the user-friendly and freely available UK climate data of the UKCP09 weather generator, which provides projections of future rainfall, deriving transition probabilities for the ROA in a straightforward way and demonstrating how the analysis can be implemented in spreadsheet format using backward induction. The application is to afforestation as a natural flood management measure (NFM) in a rural catchment in Scotland. The applicability of ROA to broadleaf afforestation as a NFM has not been previously investigated. Different ROA strategies are presented based on varying the damage cost from flooding, fixed cost and the discount rate. The results illustrate how learning can lower the overall investment cost of climate change adaptation but also that the cost structure of afforestation does not lend itself very well to ROA.

For climate change adaptation, it is essential to quantify the public's perceptions of climate change. This study employs the concept of risk perception and psychological distance to understand the role of the built environment in shaping public perception. An index-based approach was used to quantify climate change risk perception and psychological distance using indicators from disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation literature. Risk perception was constructed using three dimensions, i.e., fear, attitude, and trust, while for psychological distancing, four dimensions were used, i.e., geographic, social, temporal, and uncertainty. Local climate zone (LCZ) using WUDAPT procedure was used to identify five different built environments of Islamabad, Pakistan. Statistical tests were performed to find differences between the selected indicators and dimensions. Pearson's correlation was used to establish the link between risk perception and psychological distancing. Results showed that there was a significant difference in risk perception and psychological distancing indicators among the LCZs. A strong negative correlation was found between risk perception and psychological distancing to climate change indexes. This study advocates the importance of the built environment in shaping public perceptions of climate change risks. This pivotal study can help in integrating the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.

The Himalaya, one of the biodiversity hotspot regions and provider of ecosystem services to billion of people all across the world. Present study reviewed and synthesized climate change studies in the Himalayan region in general and Indian Himalayan region (IHR) in particular. Analysis of the literature indicates exponentially increase in climate change studies 2005 onward in the IHR, and maximum are from Jammu and Kashmir (105) followed by Uttarakhand (100) and Himachal Pradesh (77). Among the subject types, maximum climate change impact was studied on water resources/glacier retreat (141 studies) followed by agriculture (113) and forests/biodiversity (86). Increasing temperature, frequent drought spells, erratic rainfall and declining snowfall are commonly reported indicators of climate change. For instance, temperature is reported to increase by 1.5 degrees C in the Himalaya than an average increase of 0.74 degrees C globally in last century; however, it varied in eastern (0.1 degrees C per decade and western Himalayas (0.09 degrees C per decade. An increase in temperature between 0.28 and 0.80 degrees C per decade was reported for North-western Himalaya and 0.20-1.00 degrees C per decade for Eastern Himalaya. The higher altitude of Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan zone are reported to be warming at higher rates. Many of the glaciers were reported to be retreating in both eastern and western Himalaya. Heavy rainfall is becoming very common in the region often accompanied by cloudbursts that aggravate flood situation many times. Perception-based studies of the region reported to provide firsthand and detailed descriptions of climate change indicators and impacts from rural and remote areas, where no instrumental data are available.

J	Hielkema, TW; Schipper, CA; Gersonius, B				Hielkema, Titus W.; Schipper, Cor A.; Gersonius, Berry			Global nature conservation and the apparent ineffective adaptation to climate pressures	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nature-based solutions; climate change; global warming; flooding; drought; sea level rise; adaptation; resilience; biodiversity; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; sustainable development goals		The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects climate change effects based on several scenarios and highlights the potential regional changes of bioclimatic pressures up until 2100. Understanding the effects of climate change on the ecosystems is of utmost importance for nature conservation; biodiversity in riverine and coastal areas is threatened by temperature increase by weather-related events like floods and droughts. This study evaluates the impact of climate change on the performance of a given nature-based solution and nature conservation management plan's success (or failure) to account for climate change. For the purpose of the evaluation, management plans are analysed against the UN Sustainable Development Goals targets. The case studies analysed include twelve nature-based solution sites in riverine and coastal areas, distributed across Europe, Oceania and North America. Their sustainable development goals performance is analysed quantitatively for the Sustainable Development Goals-Sustainable Index Score, open-source indicator data and qualitatively for the nature conservation management plans. Sustainable development goals considered include the following: clean water and sanitation (6); industry, innovation & infrastructure (9); sustainable cities and communities (11); responsible consumption and production (12); climate action (13); life below water (14); life on land (15). The International Panel on Climate Change projections under the Shared Socio-economic Pathways1-2.6 and Shared Socio-economic Pathways5-8.5 scenarios are used to gain evidence of the role nature-based solutions and nature conservation management plans can play in adaptation trajectories for climate change and biodiversity conservation. The results highlight that most nature conservation management plans and the nature-based solution they typically rely upon, do not pay sufficient attention to climate change. The evidence suggests that the studied nature-based solution sites are not on track to achieve selected sustainable development goals when climate change impacts under the Shared Socio-economic Pathways1-2.6 and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways5-8.5 scenarios are factored in. Through this evaluation, riverine conservation areas are identified as requiring more rigorous climate adaptation strategies and nature conservation planning to enhance resilience and to have the potential of fulfilling the addressed SDGs.

Over a 25-year period (1997-2021) we examined in French Guiana the impact of different climatic parameters on the most frequent social wasp, Polybia bistriata (Polistinae). As it commonly nests on Clusia grandiflora (Clusiaceae), its nests are easily found. Heavy rainfall, particularly during the 1999-2000 La Nina episode, negatively affected this social wasp species as the percentage of Clusia sheltering an active P. bistriata nest decreased from approximate to 40% during the pre-2000 period to zero in 2021. We conclude that extreme wet seasons related to climate change translated into the decline of this species and likely were detrimental to many other polistine wasps of north-eastern Amazonia.

However, data from our case study in Metro Vancouver, Canada, suggests that municipal-level climate change practitioners have conflicting views regarding their professional responsibility to advocate for action on climate change. We contend these tensions stem from twentieth-century planning debates, which oscillate between rational-comprehensive planning versus calls to advocate, in one form or another, for various public interests. Overall, we find that transforming barriers into enablers of action on climate change must include critical engagement with planning theory and education.

From "atmosfear" to climate action	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate extremes; Future scenarios; Policy implementation; Risk communication	FLOOD-RISK; COLLECTIVE ACTION; FEAR; EUROPE; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; GOVERNANCE; MANAGEMENT; FUTURE; HAZARD	Recent studies argue that the scientific communication of climate change overly emphasizes climate extremes. This, in turn, leads to a universal "atmosfear" as an association of anthropogenic climate change with frightening future scenarios. We analyze the factors driving such kinds of atmosfear, concerning the particular cases of hot extremes (heatwaves) and wet extremes (floods). Can uncertainty or fear motivate resilience or even initiate action to cope with potential future challenges? A transition is needed in the current public discourse on climate change: from atmosfear to orchestrated global climate action to rapidly induce the social and behavioral changes that are fundamental to meet climate policy objectives. The current climate change debate is largely framed in terms of risks and damages. However, we argue that positive messages could serve climate action better. We list several positive examples resulting from action against climate change: co-benefits, win-win or multiple-win opportunities, that climate action might entail.

A mixed-method approach was employed, consisting of a survey of 400 fisherfolk households and 20 interviews with stakeholders. Changes in rainfall pattern, decreasing rainfall, stronger waves and storms that increase coastal erosion and cause persistent flooding were found to be the main effects of climate change on the livelihoods of small-scale coastal fisherfolk. Transnational fishing practices by fisherfolk in response to climate change contributed to the building of resilience of fishing households, while other adaptation strategies appeared to be insufficient in the long run. Coastal communities are not homogenous with respect to climate change impacts and corresponding adaptation strategies. Based on the empirical results, policy implications are suggested related to early warning systems and multiscalar marine planning.

This study assesses ethics and attitudes in an African context for coping with climate change. This assessment takes place within an ethical-practical framework functioning within the mutuality model of interreligious dialogue. Christianity and Shona religion are brought into dialogue with one another to create a conversation on how to deal with ecology. As the main source of livelihood in Zimbabwe and the whole of Africa, agriculture has been affected by climatic changes. Disease outbreaks, floods, and droughts are on the rise since the world is experiencing severe temperature rise. In addressing the ecological crisis religious considerations must be taken into account. The pivotal role of religion in issues of climate change and environmental conservation hinges on religious ethics and religion's ability to inspire its adherents to have environmentally friendly attitudes. Christianity and Shona religion can collaborate on addressing ecological problems since they have shared sets of ethics.

Therefore, there is a need to have an accurate and reliable means to model the response of urban catchments under extreme precipitation events produced by Climate Change. This research aimed at optimizing the stormwater modelling of urban catchments using Design of Experiments (DOE), in order to identify the parameters that most influenced their discharge and simulate their response to severe storms events projected for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) using a statistics-based Climate Change methodology. The application of this approach to an urban catchment located in Espoo (southern Finland) demonstrated its capability to optimize the calibration of stormwater simulations and provide robust models for the prediction of extreme precipitation under Climate Change.

Around the world, land is being degraded due to various natural and anthropogenic factors such as flooding, wind erosion, agriculture and human settlement, and anthropogenic climate change. While significant research has been conducted on the separate dyads of: (1) anthropogenic climate change and land degradation and (2) land degradation and health, limited consideration has been given to the cause-and-effect relationships between anthropogenic climate change-triggered land degradation and planetary health consequences. Using a systematic literature review and the driving force, pressure, state, exposure, effect (DPSEE) framework, this study synthesizes the complex causal relationships of anthropogenic climate change-triggered land degradation and its planetary health consequences. Our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic climate change has induced and accelerated natural and anthropogenic land degradation through an array of pathways, resulting in planetary health consequences that can be grouped into six categories: (1) food and nutritional insecurity, (2) communicable and noncommunicable diseases, (3) livelihood insecurity, (4) physical and mental health, (5) health hazards related to extreme weather events, and (6) migration and conflict. Interlinkages exist between these six planetary health impact categories, adding to the complexity of the causal pathways. These collective impacts are hampering the realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals around the world. The findings of this study and our DPSEE framework can help policymakers identify and integrate actions to better manage the planetary health impacts of climate change-induced land degradation.

Lucia; Broad, Kenneth			Detecting local environmental change: the role of experience in shaping risk judgments about global warming	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; risk perception; Florida; national survey	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERSONAL-EXPERIENCE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; WEATHER; BELIEF; TEMPERATURE; VULNERABILITY; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS	Anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events (e.g. flooding, heat waves, and wildfires). As a result, it is often reasoned that as more individuals experience unusual weather patterns that are consistent with changing climate conditions, the more their concern about global warming will increase, and the more motivated they will become to respond and address the problem effectively. Social science research evaluating the relationships between personal experiences with and risk perceptions of climate change, however, show mixed results. Here, we analyze a representative statewide survey of Floridians and compare their risk perceptions of five-year trends in climate change with local weather station data from the five years preceding the survey. The results show that Floridians are unable to detect five-year increases in temperature, but some can detect changes in precipitation. Despite an inability to detect the correct direction of change, respondents were significantly more likely than not to correctly identify the season in which most change occurred. Nevertheless, compared to local experience, risk perceptions of climate change were more strongly predicted by subjective experiences of environmental change, personal beliefs about climate change, and political ideology. Results from the study suggest that long-term changes in climate patterns and extreme weather events need to be interpreted by weather and climate experts within the context of climate change; individuals cannot be expected to detect or comprehend such complex linkages directly.

Four simulation scenarios were developed to demonstrate the changes in the flooding volume and adequacy of existing systems. Moreover, the effectiveness of three low-impact developments: rain barrels, rain gardens, and a combination of both practices as a mitigation strategy in reducing flooding volume were investigated.New hydrological insights for region: The trend of landuse change showed that the increased peak flow and flooding volume of junctions increased from 45.13 to 68.72 m3/s and 35,418-50,106 x 106 Ltr respectively, due to the imperviousness increasing from 10% to 70%. Similarly, in response to climate change, the simulated peak runoff increased by 46.9%, 34.8%, and 37.5% for, RCA4, RACMO22T, and REMO2009, respectively. This findings showed that if the current landuse and climate changes continue in the coming years, the study area threatened by the increased flooding due to the drainage systems will fail to accommodate increased peak runoff. The present study suggests the adopted LIDs can be significantly reduced the effects of flooding problems in the town.

Therefore, a lack of knowledge about the most essential variables made these concepts more complex for decision-making and highlighted the need for credible decision support methods. Here, we aim to develop an accurate tool by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to explore the priority indicator of food security under climate change in Iran and social network analysis (SNA) to support decisions. The following steps were conducted for the AHP approach: a literature review, a Likert questionnaire and experts' interviews for variable selection and the variables' weight determination and prioritization by pairwise comparison questionnaire, designed based on the hierarchy matrix of the criteria and sub-criteria of food security and climate change. The SNA was employed to understand the robustness of the informants' points of view for indicator selection. After the analysis, 61 criteria were extracted. Sustainability was the important criterion, weighted 0.248. The most important sub-criteria (indicators): groundwater sources, household income, underweight adolescent ratio, food wastage and an annual average of precipitation, weighted 0.095, 0.091, 0.125, 0.227 and 0.236, respectively. The SNA showed that professionals with academic origins focused on the sustainability component. The AHP tool is a credible technique to distinguish the most important criteria. The results might be employed to estimate or predict food security under climate change and simplify decision making in Iran.

Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. Change in climate and the correlated global warming affects the quantity, intensity, and frequency of precipitation type as well as the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, and hurricanes. Respiratory health can be particularly affected by climate change, which contributes to the development of allergic respiratory diseases and asthma. Pollen and mold allergens are able to trigger the release of pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators that accelerate the onset the IgE-mediated sensitization and of allergy. Allergy to pollen and pollen season at its beginning, in duration and intensity are altered by climate change. Studies showed that plants exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and reproductive effects and produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Mold proliferation is increased by floods and rainy storms are responsible for severe asthma. Pollen and mold allergy is generally used to evaluate the interrelation between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases, such as rhinitis and asthma. Thunderstorms during pollen seasons can cause exacerbation of respiratory allergy and asthma in patients with hay fever. A similar phenomenon is observed for molds. Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have positive health benefits.

A simple tree planting framework to improve climate, air pollution, health, and urban heat in vulnerable locations using non-traditional partners	PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET			English	Article						air pollution; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem services; human health; population exposure; trees; urban heat island	HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; REMOVAL	Societal Impact Statement Planting trees is considered an effective method for climate change adaptation and mitigation. This framework provides a replicable blueprint to improve health, urban heat, flooding, and air pollution via a multisectoral, collaborative, environmental data-driven approach. Native tree species with targeted ecosystem services are selected, and sites are strategically identified based on environmental and health benefits, with the intent of engaging community involvement through education and large-scale tree plantings. Including non-traditional partners in the framework provides heightened awareness of the relationship between climate change and health, thus catalyzing decision-making regarding sustainable actions that reduce effects of climate change. This native tree planting framework is highly adaptable in other cities. A multidisciplinary framework is presented for a data-driven, climate change adaptation and climate change and air pollution mitigation project. This framework leverages heightened awareness of the connections between climate change, air pollution, and health to expand the cadre and societal impacts of those working to intervene in resilience planning and implementation. The framework, implemented in Houston, Texas, USA, beginning in 2019, consists of three parts: (1) identification of optimal native tree species for climate change adaptations and air pollution mitigation around variables important locally; (2) selection of large-scale native tree planting locations where populations are already disproportionately experiencing flooding, increased heat, and air pollution-related health effects that could be further exacerbated from climate change; and (3) engagement of multisectoral leadership broadened beyond those traditionally working on climate change resilience through heightening awareness of the link to human health. Native tree species were identified that had the highest combination of absorption of carbon dioxide, other air pollutants, and water absorption (aiding in flood adaptation and air pollution/heat mitigation). Thousands of the top tree species were planted in locations that experience substantial flooding during large rain events, have high rates of health effects exacerbated by air pollution (e.g., cardiac arrest and asthma attacks), and experience multiple days of elevated heat and air pollution. This multidisciplinary framework addresses a critical need to provide interventions accessible to the community; educate on the connection between climate change adaptation, air pollution mitigation, and health; and foster multisectoral leadership to accelerate local resilience actions.

To gain insight into associations between climate change and mangroves, we conducted bibliometric research on the global indexed database of the Web of Knowledge, Core Collection. A total of 4458 literature were analyzed based on bibliometric information and article metadata through a scientometric analysis of citation analysis as well as a cluster analysis. Results suggest that coastal countries such as the USA, Australia, China, India, and Brazil are showing the recent influential mangrove-related keywords such as blue carbon and carbon stock. Interestingly, the "carbon stock", "Saudi Arabia", "range expansion" and "nature-based flood risk mitigation" is among the top cluster networks in the field of climate change and mangrove forest. The present research is expected to attract potential leaders in research, government, civil society, and business to advance progress towards mangrove sustainability in the changing climate meaningfully.

Whether it is due to rising sea levels or the increase in recurrence and intensity of extreme events, island territories are increasingly vulnerable. These impacts are expected to affect marine and terrestrial biodiversity, human occupation (infrastructure) and other activities such as agriculture and tourism, the two economic pillars of French Polynesia. While the current and future impacts of climate change on island territories are generally accepted, data acquisition, modeling, and projections of climate change are more complex to obtain and limitedly cover the island territories of the Pacific region. This article aims to develop methodologies for the acquisition and exploitation of data on current and future climate risks and their impacts in French Polynesia. This work of acquisition and valorization is part of a research project for the development of an observatory of resilience to climate risks in the perspective of building a spatial decision support system.

The aim of the study was to determine the amount of renewable resources in the Middle Vistula valley, in the region of the Kampinos National Park, central Poland. The amount of renewable resources was calculated on a hydrodynamical model for three variants, as the average, the lowest and the highest infiltration recharge rate for a specified period of 1999-2013. The modelling research was conducted in a strongly differentiated hydrogeological valley unit, in which several geomorphological units could be delineated: the floodplain, over-flood terraces and the plain area. The hydrodynamic modelling results were verified by comparing the obtained data with both the amount of drainage in the valley zone and the underground streamflow. The assessment of renewable groundwater resources in three distinctive variants was the basis for calculating the groundwater footprints, defined as a quantitative assessment of the groundwater use in climate change conditions.

A study was conducted in Odisha to find out contrast in resilience of agriculture to climate change in coastal and non-coastal district. Agricultural scenario was studied through a composite agricultural scenario index (ASI) during 2001 to 2014. The coastal district Balasore showed a relatively better resilience in the years of climatic disasters maintaining the ASI value at a higher level as compared to non-coastal district Khurda due to better agricultural and irrigation water resources scenario in Balasore district. However, Balasore is more vulnerable than Khurda in all the seasons; vulnerability of Balasore and Khurda districts is found highest in monsoon and pre-monsoon period, respectively. About 90 percent of sampled farm households possess irrigated land in Balasore district and rainfed land in Khurda district. A remarkable dent in crop productivity is seen during calamity years, which are more severe in Khurda district during heat waves and cyclone than Balasore district, which faces a decline during cyclone and flood.

However, the hydrodynamic simulation under climate change conditions suffers from the uncertainty of the downstream water level boundary. In this study, an effective approach was developed by integrating an advanced machine learning algorithm and a process-based watershed hydrological model to predict the lake level under climate change. The developed approach was validated in a vital conservation wetland in the Ramsar Convention, the Poyang Lake floodplain wetland in China and utilized to simulate the hydrological regime in climate change. We found that the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) performed relatively well in the simulation of water level, with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.94 and 0.83 in the training and testing periods, respectively. The mean cumulative flooding time in the future period was slightly less than that in the baseline period, with a decreased range of 1.01 -12.05 days/year. The highest and mean water levels rose significantly in the wet season, with a risen range of 1.01 -3.3 and 1.56 -2.44 m, respectively, and the appearance of extreme flood events became more frequent. The maximum, minimum, and mean inflows for Poyang Lake in the dry season exhibited a remarkable reduction trend, especially for the minimum inflow, with a reduced range of 59.37%-79.22%, indicating that more serious extreme drought events would appear in Poyang Lake. The developed approach has good performance for water level simulation and extreme runoff prediction, thus providing a viable way for future water resources management in floodplain wetlands.

Climate Change Impacts on Reservoir Inflow in the Prairie Pothole Region: A Watershed Model Analysis	WATER			English	Article						swat; prairie pothole region; climate change; lake of the prairie; uncertainty; sufi-2; fill-spill hydrology	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; FUTURE CLIMATE; HYDROLOGY; SWAT; UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTIONS; RESOLUTION; QUALITY	The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is known for its hydrologically complex landscape with a large number of pothole wetlands. However, most watershed-scale hydrologic models that are applied in this region are incapable of representing the dynamic nature of contributing area and fill-spill processes affected by pothole wetlands. The inability to simulate these processes represents a critical limitation for operators and flood forecasters and may hinder the management of large reservoirs. We used a modified version of the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model capable of simulating the dynamics of variable contributing areas and fill-spill processes to assess the impact of climate change on upstream inflows into the Shellmouth reservoir (also called Lake of the Prairie), which is an important reservoir built to provide multiple purposes, including flood and drought mitigation. We calibrated our modified SWAT model at a daily time step using SUFI-2 algorithm within SWAT-CUP for the period 1991-2000 and validated for 2005-2014, which gave acceptable performance statistics for both the calibration (KGE = 0.70, PBIAS = -13.5) and validation (KGE = 0.70, PBIAS = 21.5) periods. We then forced the calibrated model with future climate projections using representative concentration pathways (RCPs; 4.5, 8.5) for the near (2011-2040) and middle futures (2041-2070) of multiple regional climate models (RCMs). Our modeling results suggest that climate change will lead to a two-fold increase in winter streamflow, a slight increase in summer flow, and decrease spring peak flows into the Shellmouth reservoir. Investigating the impact of climate change on the operation of the Shellmouth reservoir is critically important because climate change could present significant challenges to the operation and management of the reservoir.

The world's largest country is warming faster than Earth as a whole, occupies more than half the Arctic Ocean coastline, and is waging a carbon-intensive war while increasingly isolated from the international community and its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Officially, the Russian government argues that, as a major exporter of hydrocarbons, Russia benefits from maintaining global reliance on fossil fuels and from climate change itself, because warming may increase the extent and quality of its arable land, open a new year-round Arctic sea route, and make its harsh climate more livable. Drawing on the collective expertise of a large group of Russia-focused social scientists and a comprehensive literature review, we challenge this narrative. We find that Russia suffers from a variety of impacts due to climate change and is poorly prepared to adapt to these impacts. The literature review reveals that the fates of Russia's hydrocarbon-dependent economy, centralized political system, and climate-impacted population are intertwined and that research is needed on this evolving interrelationship, as global temperatures rise and the international economy decarbonizes in response.This article is categorized under: Policy and Governance > National Climate Change Policy Trans-disciplinary Perspectives > National Reviews Trans-disciplinary Perspectives > Regional Reviews	[Javeline, Debra; Wengle, Susanne] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Orttung, Robert] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC USA; [Robertson, Graeme] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Arnold, Richard] Muskingum Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Concord, OH USA; [Barnes, Andrew] Kent State Univ, Sch Multidisciplinary Social Sci & Humanities, Kent, OH USA; [Henry, Laura] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Govt & Legal Studies, Brunswick, ME USA; [Holland, Edward] Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR USA; [Omelicheva, Mariya] Natl Def Univ, Natl War Coll, Washington, DC USA; [Rutland, Peter] Wesleyan Univ, Govt Dept, Middletown, CT USA; [Schatz, Edward] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Schenk, Caress; Semenov, Andrei] Nazarbayev Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Sperling, Valerie] Clark Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Worcester, MA USA; [McIntosh Sundstrom, Lisa] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Troitskiy, Mikhail] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Twigg, Judyth] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Richmond, VA USA; [Wengle, Susanne] Uppsala Univ, Inst Russian & Eurasian Studies, Uppsala, Sweden	University of Notre Dame; George Washington University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University System of Ohio; Muskingum University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent; Bowdoin College; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; National Defense University - USA; Wesleyan University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Mississauga; Nazarbayev University; Clark University; University of British Columbia; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Virginia Commonwealth University; Uppsala University	Javeline, D (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.	javeline@nd.edu	Holland, Edward/I-9536-2012	Holland, Edward/0000-0003-3914-0505; Orttung, Robert/0000-0002-0190-9246; Sundstrom, Lisa/0000-0003-0056-9646; Javeline, Debra/0000-0003-0847-8140; Robertson, Graeme/0000-0003-1255-218X; Arnold, Richard/0000-0002-1350-0210; Rutland, Peter/0000-0002-0379-6302; Henry, Laura/0000-0001-7112-7568; Barnes, Andrew/0009-0001-4817-1787	Program on New Approaches to Research and Security in Eurasia; George Washington University, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Francis A.

Climate change is considered the greatest health threat of our time, and children are especially at risk. This review is timely and relevant as it provides an overview of the current literature on the effects of climate change on children's respiratory health, and the implications of these findings for clinical practice and research.Recent findingsThe findings of this review suggest that climate change has a significant impact on children's respiratory health, with temperature, humidity, air pollution, and extreme weather events being key contributory factors. Increases in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires, floods, droughts, hurricanes and dust storms all cause the health of children's respiratory system to be at increased risk.The findings of this review suggest that climate change has a significant impact on children's respiratory health, and that mitigation and adaptation strategies are necessary to protect children from the harmful effects of climate change and improve their respiratory health. Overall, a comprehensive and integrated approach is necessary to protect children from the increasing impacts of climate change.

J	Huang, SL; Lee, YC; Chiang, LY				Huang, Shu-Li; Lee, Ying-Chieh; Chiang, Li-Yang			Assessing the synergies and trade-offs of development projects in response to climate change in an urban region	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Synergy/trade-offs; Systems approach; Urban development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Flood risk; Taipei	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CHANGE MITIGATION; ADAPTATION; MODEL; INTEGRATION; EMISSIONS; DENSITY; SYSTEMS; CARBON; TAIPEI	A synthesis of the complex relationships, including synergies and trade-offs, between urban development projects and climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives can ensure that all these relationships are taken into consideration. We used a systems approach and applied an impact matrix and chain effect analysis methods to projects in the highly urbanized Taipei metropolitan region to identify the influences and effects between urban development projects and climate change objectives. Three types of urban plans and projects were analyzed: flood control, transportation, and urban planning. The magnitudes of the influences and effects between these projects and plans were derived through interviews with experts familiar with Taipei's urban development. This pilot study found no synergy in the response to climate change mitigation and adaptation for the urban development projects analyzed. The current standalone policies and plans related to urbanization in Taipei have resulted in trade-offs for flood control and public transit projects because they contribute positively toward one climate objective but negatively impact another. A high-level policymaking mechanism that ensures coordination and collaboration between different sectors is needed to supervise sectoral policies. Prior to the approval and implementation of a plan, policymakers should request the assessment of synergies and trade-offs between plans and projects to ensure a synergistic effect to climate change issues. This study confirms that the strategy from individual sector in a metropolitan region will result in trade-off between climate change issues is a global problem. This paper also strengthens the concept that the assessment of synergy/trade-offs between policy and plans should be conducted using systemic approach.

Given that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been characterized as the region with the highest poverty levels over the years, people living in the region are more susceptible to the adverse implications of climate change relative to other world regions. Based on a micro-level dataset from 33 SSA countries, we examine how climate hazards (drought and flooding) affect various forms of deprivation (food, fuel, income, and water) to offer fresh insights into the poverty-impact of climate change. Using instrumental variable ordered probit and multilevel models, we show that the severity of drought and flooding significantly increase individuals' likelihood of experiencing the various forms of deprivation. However, water deprivation appears not to be a consequence of flooding. Considering locational heterogeneity, the severity of drought and flooding on deprivation outcomes is more deleterious for rural dwellers compared to their urban counterparts. By and large, we provide evidence to argue that the individuals' experiences of food, fuel, income, and water deprivation can be attributed to the incidence and severity of hazards induced by climate change.

To develop the maps, several scenarios representing the individual and compounding effects of the models' input and parameters uncertainty were defined. Hydrologic model calibration and validation were performed using a Dynamically Dimensioned Search algorithm. A generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method was used for quantifying uncertainty. To draw on the potential benefits of the proposed methodology, a flash-flood-prone urban watershed in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, was selected. The developed floodplain maps were updated considering climate change impacts on the input uncertainty with rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) projections of RCP8.5. The results indicated that the hydrologic model input poses the most uncertainty to floodplain delineation. Incorporating climate change impacts resulted in the expansion of the potential flood area and an increase in water depth. Comparison between stationary and non-stationary IDFs showed that the flood probability is higher when a non-stationary approach is used. The large inevitable uncertainty associated with floodplain mapping and increased future flood risk under climate change imply a great need for enhanced flood modeling techniques and tools. The probabilistic floodplain maps are beneficial for implementing risk management strategies and land-use planning.

Impacts of Climate Change Induced Sea Level Rise, Flow Increase and Vegetation Encroachment on Flood Hazard in the Biobio River, Chile	WATER			English	Article						flood hazard; climate change; sea level rise; riparian vegetation encroachment	RIPARIAN VEGETATION; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; CHANNEL; LESSONS; CITY	River flooding is one of the most widespread natural disasters. Projections indicate that climate change will increase flood hazard in many areas around the world. In this study, we investigate the individual and combined effects of sea level rise, flow increase and riparian vegetation encroachment on flood hazard in the lower Biobio River, Chile. Results show that each has the potential to individually increase flood hazard in certain areas, and that individual effects can compound. Encroachment of riparian vegetation onto previously sparsely vegetated areas of the floodplain, likely a result of the Chilean megadrought, causes higher flow resistance and increased flooding during large events. Somewhat counterintuitively, drought has therefore led to an increase in flood hazard in the study area. Drought risk for most land areas across the globe is expected to increase with climate change. Potential future vegetation encroachment should therefore be included as a key variable in riverine flood hazard studies.

As the climate warms due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, extreme weather events, such as floods, fires, and heatwaves, will drive up demand for healthcare. Delivering healthcare also contributes to climate change, accounting for similar to 5% of the global carbon emissions. To rein in healthcare's carbon footprint, clinicians and health policy makers must be able to measure the GHG contributions of healthcare systems and clinical practices. Herein, we scope potential informatics solutions to monitor the carbon footprint of healthcare systems and to support climate-change decision-making for clinicians, and healthcare policy makers. We discuss the importance of methods and tools that can link environmental, economic, and healthcare data, and outline challenges to the sustainability of monitoring efforts. A greater understanding of these connections will only be possible through further development and usage of models and tools that integrate diverse data sources.

The role of human-induced climate change in heavy rainfall events such as the one associated with Typhoon Hagibis	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Extreme weather attribution; Heavy rainfall; Typhoon Hagibis; Multi-method; Attributable economic costs	EC-EARTH	Around October 12, 2019, torrential rainfall from Typhoon Hagibis caused large-scale flooding in a large area around the metropole region of Tokyo leading to large-scale destruction including losses of lives, livelihoods, and economic losses of well over $10 bn US dollars. In this paper we use a multi-method probabilistic event attribution framework to assess the role of human-induced climate change in the heavy rainfall event responsible for a large proportion of the damages. Combining different observational datasets and various climate model simulations, we find an increase in the likelihood of such an event to occur of 15-150%. We use this assessment and the calculated fraction of attributable risk (FAR) to further estimate the economic costs attributable to anthropogenic climate change based on the insured economic losses. Our conservative estimate is that similar to$4bn of the damages due to the extreme heavy rainfall associated with Typhoon Hagibis are due to human-induced climate change.

Estimation of changes in extreme values under climate change thus plays an important role in disaster risk assessment and management. However, the different changes in extremes in two distinct regions: inland and coast under climate change are yet to be investigated meticulously. This study is intended to assess the changes in frequency of rainfall and temperature extremes under the impact of climate change in two distinct locations: coast and inland of Bengal delta, a region highly vulnerable to climate change. The multi-model ensemble (projections from CMIP6 framework) technique with the application of frequency analysis was employed to appraise the impact in two future time horizons. Results suggest that the inland estimate of extreme rainfall by the end of this century is barely able to exceed the coastal estimate of extreme rainfall in present conditions. The rate of increase of warm extremes is almost similar; however, with the cold extreme, the increase rate is a little higher inland than on the coast. In both regions, a greater rise in climate extremes is expected in the far future than in the near future. Overall, the coastal area is expected to be more vulnerable to flooding while the inland to drought under climate change in the Bengal delta region.

The case of Jangwani Ward in Dar es Salaam City, Tanzania	HELIYON			English	Article						Assessment; Exposure; Coping strategies; Adaptation strategies; Elements at risk; Climate change; Flooding; Urban areas	VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT	Urban areas are the engines of socioeconomic growth and the homes of billions of people around the globe. In a changing climate, urban areas are inexorably from vulnerability to climate hazards including flooding which deters their social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The main objective of this paper was to explore exposure to elements at risk due to climate change-induced flooding in urban areas. In addition, the paper analyses the coping and adaptation strategies practiced at the community and national levels and recommends appropriate policy measures for enhanced climate resilience in urban areas. The study adopted purposeful sampling in which n = 95 households were selected for the study. Data collection methods involved household interviews with structured questionnaires, focused group discussions, documentary reviews, transect walks, surveys, and observations. Data analysis was done with a statistical package for social sciences. The results revealed that the elements at risk of exposure to climate change-induced flooding in the study area were physical infrastructures, socio-economic activoities, livelihoods, and ecosystems. The study recommends enhancing resilience of elements at risk to climate change-induced flooding at national and local levels in urban areas. This is through promoting flood policies, strategies, laws, planning and management measures; enhance non-structural actions including flood forecasting, mapping, emergency evacuation plans and land use zoning and structural measures namely dams, dikes, storm surge barriers for adaptation to urban flooding.

This paper reviews the effects of current and future climate change on rice production in China. In recent decades, thermal resources have increased during the rice growing season, while solar radiation resources have decreased, and precipitation heterogeneity has increased. The increasing frequency of high-temperature stress, heavy rainfall, drought, and flood disasters may reduce the utilization efficiency of hydrothermal resources. Climate change, thus far, has resulted in a significant northward shift in the potential planting boundaries of single- and double-cropping rice production systems, which negatively affects the growth duration of single-, early-, and late-cropping rice. Studies based on statistical and process-based crop models show that climate change has affected rice production in China. The effects of climate change on the yield of single rice (SR), early rice (ER), and late rice (LR) were significant; however, the results of different methods and different rice growing areas were different to some extent. The trend of a longer growth period and higher yield of rice reflects the ability of China's rice production system to adapt to climate change by adjusting planting regionalization and improving varieties and cultivation techniques. The results of the impact assessment under different climate scenarios indicated that the rice growth period would shorten and yield would decrease in the future. This means that climate change will seriously affect China's rice production and food security. Further research requires a deeper understanding of abiotic stress physiology and its integration into ecophysiological models to reduce the uncertainty of impact assessment and expand the systematicness of impact assessment.

J	Sun, JQ; Yan, HF; Bao, ZX; Wang, GQ				Sun, Jinqiu; Yan, Haofang; Bao, Zhenxin; Wang, Guoqing			Investigating Impacts of Climate Change on Runoff from the Qinhuai River by Using the SWAT Model and CMIP6 Scenarios	WATER			English	Article						climate change; CMIP6; hydrological response; runoff simulation; SWAT model; the Qinhuai River Basin	PERFORMANCE; HYDROLOGY; BASIN; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTION	This paper looks at regional water security in eastern China in the context of global climate change. The response of runoff to climate change in the Qinhuai River Basin, a typical river in eastern China, was quantitatively investigated by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the ensemble projection of multiple general circulation models (GCMs) under three different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) emission scenarios. The results show that the calibrated SWAT model is applicable to the Qinhuai River Basin and can accurately characterize the runoff process at daily and monthly scales with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (NSE), correlation coefficients (R), and the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) in calibration and validation periods being above 0.75 and relative errors (RE) are +/- 3.5%. In comparison to the baseline of 1980-2015, the mean annual precipitation in the future period (2025-2060) under the three emission scenarios of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 will probably increase by 5.64%, 2.60%, and 6.68% respectively. Correspondingly, the multiple-year average of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures are projected to rise by 1.6-2.1 degrees C and 1.4-2.0 degrees C, respectively, in 2025-2060. As a result of climate change, the average annual runoff will increase by 16.24%, 8.84%, and 17.96%, respectively, in the period of 2025-2060 under the three SSPs scenarios. The increase in runoff in the future will provide sufficient water supply to support socioeconomic development. However, increases in both rainfall and runoff also imply an increased risk of flooding due to climate change. Therefore, the impact of climate change on flooding in the Qinhuai River Basin should be fully considered in the planning of flood control and the basin's development.

Historical rainfall and temperature data of forty years (1978-2017) obtained from Ethiopian Meteorological Agency and household questionnaire survey (n=150) were used to assess the climate trend of Jimma city. Descriptive statistics have been used to assess people's perceptions towards climate change. Rainfall and temperature variability were analyzed using standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), rainfall anomaly index and standard precipitation index. The magnitude of the linear trends is estimated using the Sen's slope estimator, and Mann-Kendall test to check the statistical significance of the trends. Findings revealed that average maximum and minimum temperature showed statistically significant trend. The magnitude of increasing trends of monthly maximum temperature varies between 0.033 and 0.045 degrees C/year in January and April, respectively. For minimum temperature the magnitude of trends vary between 0.081 degrees C/year in November and 0.025 degrees C/year in April. Annual rainfall variability is relatively stable with 11% CV, while monthly rainfall variability was found to be very high in December, January, and February with CV 115, 80, and 75, respectively. The result from household survey shows that 85% perceived the increasing trends of temperature. The community perceived that climate change is having an impact on vector-borne diseases. Our results indicate that climate-borne disease and pests, food insecurity, frequent drought and flooding appear to have a significant relationship with climate change withpvalue 0.000, 0.029, 0.010, and 0.047, respectively. Thus, it is crucial to plan for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to minimize the potential impacts of climate change in the study area.

Identifying and prioritising climate change adaptation actions for greater one-horned rhinoceros (<i>Rhinoceros unicornis</i>) conservation in Nepal	PEERJ			English	Article						Adaptation action; Adaptive capacity; Biodiversity; Climate refugia; Connectivity; Protected area; Resilience	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; VULNERABILITY; POPULATION; STRATEGIES; ECOLOGY; SCIENCE; THREATS	Climate change has started impacting species, ecosystems, genetic diversity within species, and ecological interactions and is thus a serious threat to conserving biodiversity globally. In the absence of adequate adaptation measures, biodiversity may continue to decline, and many species will possibly become extinct. Given that global temperature continues to increase, climate change adaptation has emerged as an overarching framework for conservation planning. We identified both ongoing and probable climate change adaptation actions for greater one-horned rhinoceros conservation in Nepal through a combination of literature review, key informant surveys (n = 53), focus group discussions (n = 37) and expert consultation (n = 9), and prioritised the identified adaptation actions through stakeholder consultation (n = 17). The majority of key informants (>80%) reported that climate change has been impacting rhinoceros, and more than 65% of them believe that rhinoceros habitat suitability in Nepal has been shifting westwards. Despite these perceived risks, climate change impacts have not been incorporated well into formal conservation planning for rhinoceros. Out of 20 identified adaptation actions under nine adaptation strategies, identifying and protecting climate refugia, restoring the existing habitats through wetland and grassland management, creating artificial highlands in floodplains to provide rhinoceros with refuge during severe floods, and translocating them to other suitable habitats received higher priority. These adaptation actions may contribute to reducing the vulnerability of rhinoceros to the likely impacts of climate change. This study is the first of its kind in Nepal and is expected to provide a guideline to align ongoing conservation measures into climate change adaptation planning for rhinoceros. Further, we emphasise the need to integrating likely climate change impacts while planning for rhinoceros conservation and initiating experimental research and monitoring programs to better inform adaptation planning in the future.

An Investigation of the Dhaka Megacity in Bangladesh	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						peri-urbanization; urban growth boundary demarcation; climate change; climate migrants; natural hazards; flooding; land use and land cover; night-time light data; Dhaka; Bangladesh	URBAN; CLASSIFICATION; MIGRATION; IMPACTS; AREA	This paper aims to scrutinize in what way peri-urbanization triggers climate change vulnerabilities. By using spatial analysis techniques, the study undertakes the following tasks. First, the study demarcates Dhaka's-the capital of Bangladesh-peri-urban growth pattern that took place over the last 24-year period (1992-2016). Afterwards, it determines the conformity of ongoing peri-urban practices with Dhaka's stipulated planning documents. Then, it identifies Dhaka's specific vulnerabilities to climate change impacts-i.e., flood, and groundwater table depletion. Lastly, it maps out the socioeconomic profile of the climate change victim groups from Dhaka. The findings of the study reveal that: (a) Dhaka lacks adequate development planning, monitoring, and control mechanisms that lead to an increased and uncontrolled peri-urbanization; (b) Dhaka's explicitly undefined peri-urban growth boundary is the primary factor in misguiding the growth pockets-that are the most vulnerable locations to climate change impacts, and; (c) Dhaka's most vulnerable group to the increasing climate change impacts are the climate migrants, who have been repeatedly exposed to the climate change-triggered natural hazards. These study findings generate insights into peri-urbanization-triggered climate change vulnerabilities that aid urban policymakers, managers, and planners in their development policy, planning, monitoring and control practices.

These exposures, in turn, can affect risks for a variety of human diseases and health outcomes. Climate epidemiology plays an important role in informing policy related to climate change and its threats to public health. Climate epidemiology leverages deep, integrated collaborations between epidemiologists and climate scientists to understand the current and potential future impacts of climate-related exposures on human health. A variety of recent and ongoing developments in climate science are creating new avenues for epidemiologic contributions. Here, we discuss the contributions of climate epidemiology and describe some key current research directions, including research to better characterize uncertainty in climate health projections. We end by outlining 3 developing areas of climate science that are creating opportunities for high-impact epidemiologic advances in the near future: 1) climate attribution studies, 2) subseasonal to seasonal forecasts, and 3) decadal predictions.

In the past 10 years, the central government has implemented the Rural Regeneration Project (RRP) aimed at revitalization and sustainable development in rural Taiwan. During the project's implementation, communities have faced several disasters as a result of climate change-induced extreme rainfall events. Perceptions and adaptation practices of climate change-induced extreme events are critical to community sustainability and resilience. The gap between perceived and actual risks that communities experience creates challenges for policy-makers in achieving sustainability goals. This study aims to evaluate the perceived climate change-induced flooding hazard perceptions compared to the scientific projection and actual hazard events in 287 rural communities implementing the RRP. This study revealed consistency in risk perception, in that communities facing high potential exposure to extreme rainfall showed higher awareness of various impacts of climate change. However, when comparing climate actions, communities exposed to low-potential hazard areas had a relatively higher degree of recognition of the benefits of adaptation to climate change. Moreover, 59 rural communities with low awareness and exposed to high potentials of extreme events were widely distributed among hills of western, southern, and northern Taiwan, where compound disasters such as mudslides can occur. This research suggests that there is a need to integrate climate change planning and work with communities to bridge the gap between perceived and actual climate risks. In particular, capacity training, counseling services, and implementation of adaptation practices should be integrated into institutional planning and management for providing assistance in disaster prevention, relief, and post-event restoration; also, encouraging climate actions can directly improve community resilience toward climate change. While investing in the sustainable development of rural communities is largely based on revitalizing economic development, this study revealed the link to ensure resilience and social-ecological sustainability in rural communities under climate change impacts.

Racial Disparities in Climate Change-Related Health Effects in the United States	CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS			English	Review						Global warming; Environmental justice; Health disparities; Environmental racism; Health equity	EXTREME-HEAT; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; HURRICANE KATRINA; SAN-DIEGO; ASSOCIATION; VULNERABILITY; IMPACT; EVENTS; VISITS; EQUITY	Purpose of Review Climate change is causing warming over most parts of the USA and more extreme weather events. The health impacts of these changes are not experienced equally. We synthesize the recent evidence that climatic changes linked to global warming are having a disparate impact on the health of people of color, including children. Recent Findings Multiple studies of heat, extreme cold, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires find evidence that people of color, including Black, Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Asian communities are at higher risk of climate-related health impacts than Whites, although this is not always the case. Studies of adults have found evidence of racial disparities related to climatic changes with respect to mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, mental health, and heat-related illness. Children are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, and infants and children of color have experienced adverse perinatal outcomes, occupational heat stress, and increases in emergency department visits associated with extreme weather. The evidence strongly suggests climate change is an environmental injustice that is likely to exacerbate existing racial disparities across a broad range of health outcomes.

It is quite complex and difficult to quantify the consequences of climate change on railway infrastructure because of the inherent nature of the railway itself. Hence, the main aim of this work is to qualitatively identify and assess the impact of climate change on railway infrastructure with associated risks and consequences. A qualitative research methodology is employed in the study using a questionnaire as a tool for information gathering from experts from several municipalities in Sweden, Swedish transport infrastructure managers, maintenance organizations, and train operators. The outcome of this questionnaire revealed that there was a lower level of awareness about the impact of climate change on the various facets of railway infrastructure. Furthermore, the work identifies the challenges and barriers for climate adaptation of railway infrastructure and suggests recommended actions to improve the resilience towards climate change.

In the dearth of comprehensive climate data and limited research endeavors, Bhutan's 69% of the total population, depending on agriculture and livestock farming, is apparently vulnerable to climate change adversities. Notably, those dwelling within the precincts of the Biological Corridors (BCs), recognized as custodians and conservation partners, have been relatively neglected in aspects of climate change impact studies. In the year 2019, our pioneering study in the northern biological corridors of Bhutan aimed to (i) comprehend people's sensitivity to climate change; (ii) discern people's perceptions on the severity of climate change impacts on livelihood, natural resources, and wildlife patterns; and (iii) help formulate appropriate strategies and policy transformation in climate adaptation interventions. We conducted a semi-structured questionnaire survey, applying random sampling (n = 136) of 435 households from western, central, and eastern Bhutan. Study revealed that farmers' sensitivity and perception of the impact of climate change vary spatiotemporally, demographically, and occupationally. Not more than 76.7% of respondents noticed the changing climate patterns over the last ten years, while landless households (3%) noticed no discernible impacts. A rise in temperature is the most sensitive variable reported, followed by erratic precipitation, a change in plant phenology, and a shift in wildlife occupancy patterns. A total of 48% of respondents reported drought, scanty rain, floods, and diseases that moderately affected agriculture crops and livestock, while 42% of respondents perceive that climate change is a driving factor for human-wildlife conflict because of increasing wild animal movement towards their region. About 51% of respondents indicated adopting new adaptation strategies, which involved transitioning to different cattle breeds and altering agricultural cropping patterns and crop varieties. We recommend political support for inducing climate-smart agriculture and livestock practices. Urgent research is recommended for the shift of habitats and wildlife due to climate change to better understand and help formulate pragmatic climate adaptation measures in the face of rising human-wildlife conflict.

This is even more pronounced in Kenya, given their over-reliance on rain-fed crops and the frequency of floods and droughts in the country. Through qualitative interviews, this study set out to establish how climate change not only affects the food security, production and consumption of rural women farmers in Kakamega County, Kenya, but their response to climate shocks. Using resilience theory as a lens, we established that women use different pathways to mitigate the effects of climate change on their livelihoods. The study found that initially women adopt coping strategies that are reactive and not sustainable, but soon adapted their farming strategies, using their indigenous knowledge to exercise some control over both their food security and food sovereignty. Besides this, they use their human and social capital to expand their networks of support. By linking up to other organizations and gaining access to government support, they are able to challenge patriarchal relations that perpetuate poverty and inequality and bring about more transformative and sustainable responses to climate change.

J	Patashnik, J				Patashnik, Jeremy			THE TROLLEY PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE: SHOULD GOVERNMENTS FACE TAKINGS LIABILITY IF ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE?	COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW	Faced with potentially staggering human and economic costs, governments around the world are beginning to plan and implement adaptive measures designed to stem the effects of climate change. Some of these adaptations will likely benefit certain property owners and communities at the expense of others. For example, seawalls intended to save valuable parcels of land from sea-level rise could wind up forcing seawater onto neighboring parcels that would not have flooded otherwise. One day in the not-too-distant future, societies will have to grapple with the question of whether the government is responsible for harms it causes in its attempts to save livelihoods and land threatened by climate change. This Note seeks to address that question by analyzing the extent to which a government in the United States would face takings liability if its adaptive measures to address sea-level rise-one of the most salient property harms that will result from climate change-save certain parcels but harm others. Despite a long line of case law under which the government is liable for a taking when it intentionally floods private property, this Note concludes that, under certain circumstances, climate change adaptations could present the type of emergency situation that American courts have frequently held exempts the government from takings liability. This Note nonetheless argues that broader government takings liability may lead to more efficient and equitable climate change adaptation. It also considers some undesirable outcomes that could result from broader government takings liability and discusses potential solutions to minimize those problems.

Impacts of Climate Change and Remote Natural Catastrophes on EU Flood Insurance Markets: An Analysis of Soft and Hard Reinsurance Markets for Flood Coverage	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; flood (re)insurance; unaffordability; market penetration; capital markets; vulnerability; remote impacts	MITIGATION MEASURES; DAMAGE MITIGATION; RISK; PROTECTION; SCENARIOS; DATABASE; FUTURE	The increasing frequency and severity of natural catastrophes due to climate change is expected to cause higher natural disaster losses in the future. Reinsurance companies bear a large share of this risk in the form of excess-of-loss coverage, where they underwrite the most extreme portion of insurers' risk portfolios. Past experience has shown that after a very large natural disaster, or multiple disasters in close succession, the recapitalization need of reinsurers could trigger a "hard" reinsurance capital market, where a high demand for capital increases the price charged by investors, which is opposed to a "soft" market, where there is a high availability of capital for reinsurers. Consequently, the rising costs of underwriting are transferred to insurers, which ultimately could trigger higher premiums for natural catastrophe (NatCat) insurance worldwide. Here, we study the vulnerability of riverine flood insurance systems in the EU to global reinsurance market conditions and climate change. To do so, we apply the "Dynamic Integrated Flood Insurance" (DIFI) model, and compare insurance premiums, unaffordability, and the uptake for soft and hard reinsurance market conditions under an average and extreme scenario of climate change. We find that a rising average and higher variance of flood risk towards the end of the century can increase flood insurance premiums and cause higher premium volatility resulting from global reinsurance market conditions. Under a "mild" scenario of climate change, the projected yearly premiums for EU countries, combined, are euro1380 higher under a hard compared to a soft reinsurance capital market in 2080. For a high-end climate change scenario, this difference becomes euro3220. The rise in premiums causes problems with the unaffordability of flood coverage and results in a declining demand for flood insurance, which increases the financial vulnerability of households to flooding. A proposed solution is to introduce government reinsurance for flood risk, as governments can often provide cheaper reinsurance coverage and are less subject to the volatility of the capital markets.

However, due to climate change, they have begun to face numerous problems with their water quality and quantity. Furthermore, general circulation models (GCMs) show future climate change with a reduction in rainfall and increase in temperature. The aim of the current study is to present an application where GCMs and state-of-the-art hydrological modelling system MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 are combined for assessing the response of a Greek lake in terms of its water balance and water level under climate change. Four general circulation models (GCMs; GFDL-CM3, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-LR) for the extreme climate change scenario of RCP8.5 were used in the basin of Lake Zazari in Greece as a case study. Results showed that, by keeping the irrigated demands (the main water user) unchanged in the future, the lake exhibited a lower water level for all GCMs, fluctuating from -0.70 to -1.8 m for the mean (min) water level and from -0.30 to -1.20 m for the mean (max) water level. Instead of the above and by preserving the amount of withdraw water n from the lake at a certain percentage of inflows, the irrigated area should be reduced from 54.1% to 64.05% depending on the circulation model.

Here, the impact of climate change on the magnitude and frequency of high flows is analysed for Great Britain (GB) to provide the first spatially consistent GB projections to include both climate ensembles and hydrological model parameter uncertainties. We use the latest high-resolution (12 km) regional climate model ensemble from the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). These projections are based on a perturbed-physics ensemble of 12 regional climate model simulations and allow exploration of climate model uncertainty beyond the variability caused by the use of different models. We model 346 larger (>144 km(2)) catchments across GB using the DECIPHeR hydrological modelling framework. Generally, results indicated an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high flows (Q10, Q1, and annual maximum) along the western coast of GB in the future (2050-2075), with increases in annual maximum flows of up to 65 % for western Scotland. In contrast, median flows (Q50) were projected to decrease across GB. Even when using an ensemble based on a single regional climate model (RCM) structure, all flow projections contained large uncertainties. While the RCM parameters were the largest source of uncertainty overall, hydrological modelling uncertainties were considerable in eastern and south-eastern England. Regional variations in flow projections were found to relate to (i) differences in climatic change and (ii) catchment conditions during the baseline period as characterised by the runoff coefficient (mean discharge divided by mean precipitation). Importantly, increased heavy-precipitation events (defined by an increase in 99th percentile precipitation) did not always result in increased flood flows for catchments with low runoff coefficients, highlighting the varying factors leading to changes in high flows. These results provide a national overview of climate change impacts on high flows across GB, which will inform climate change adaptation, and highlight the impact of hydrological model parameter uncertainties when modelling climate change impact on high flows.

Quantifying the impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regime is essential for water resources management and environmental protection. However, previous studies have rarely separated the effects of two factors on flow regimes, and the individual impact of each remains insufficient to date. Moreover, the existing methods have not fully captured the characteristics and temporal changes of flow regimes. In this study, we propose a new framework that integrates a streamflow reconstruction technique, indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA), indicators of intra-annual flow variations, a revised range of variability approach to assessing the climate change and dam-induced impacts on the flow regime. The Upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) was selected as the study area. The results show that climate change significantly reduces the monthly flow, extreme water conditions and the intra-annual indicators, and advances the Julian date of annual maximum flow. Dam construction delays the Julian date of annual maximum flow that opposes climate change impact, reduces the monthly flow in the flood season and the annual maximum flow, but increases the monthly flow in the dry season and annual minimum flow. Changes in flow regimes in the UYRB are found to be mainly due to climate change albeit there exists a cascade of dams. Based on the range of variability approach (RVA), fifteen of forty indicators are moderately changed. While the number increases to thirty-seven when considering the temporal order alteration of flow regime. The case study demonstrates that the developed framework can serve as a useful tool to evaluate the impact of climate change and dam construction on flow regimes.

Hydrological events associated with climate change, i.e. floods and droughts, have reached extreme levels in recent years. Researchers warn that these phenomena will continue to intensify. According to recent reports, the number of extreme weather events, including hydrological phenomena, has increased by 60% in Europe over the last three decades. Both water shortages and water surpluses affect the soil environment and its functions. This in turn has a direct impact on crops and agriculture. For example, in the US alone, droughts and floods were responsible for more than 70% of the decline in cereal yields in 2011 alone. However, the soil environment is a complex ecosystem that is not yet fully understood, making it difficult to predict the impact of climate change on its quality and functioning. In this paper, we discuss the effects of floods and droughts on the soil microbiome and the implications of these changes for agriculture. We suggest that changes in soil moisture are an important factor affecting crop growth and yield, which is of great importance for global food security.

Therefore, the ramifications of climate change, an imminent threat to the Everglades ecosystem, are going to affect these ecosystem services drastically. The climate-induced changes to the ecosystem services are going to affect people's lives and livelihoods in the region. Thus, understanding public perception and preferences is an important step in addressing the impending risk. In this study, we used an online survey to assess residents' perceptions about the risk of climate change and their views on mitigating potential consequences. We find that people's perceptions and preferences are shaped by their level of education, age, participation in outdoor recreational activities, and elevation and distance from the shoreline of their residential location from the mean sea-level. In general, people who are concerned about the flooding risk and people who tend to prioritize environmental conservation are more likely to agree with the potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise and more likely to support proposed measures for adaptation. We discuss the policy implications for developing socially acceptable plans based on the findings regarding people's perception and preferences for adaptation in this region.

J	de Bruin, WB; Dugan, A				de Bruin, Wandi Bruine; Dugan, Andrew			On the differential correlates of climate change concerns and severe weather concerns: evidence from the World Risk Poll	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Public perceptions of climate change; Education	PERSONAL-EXPERIENCE; DAILY TEMPERATURE; FLOOD EXPERIENCE; PEOPLE KNOW; PERCEPTIONS; LEVEL; ATTITUDES; IMPACT; BELIEF; FLUCTUATIONS	Global climate action will likely be motivated by public concerns about climate change and severe weather, to the extent that they are different. Public perception researchers have been debating whether or not people conflate climate and weather. If climate change concerns and severe weather concerns are different, then they should be formed in different ways. Here, we compare how climate change concerns and severe weather concerns around the world are correlated with key predictors of risk concerns: (1) higher education, which facilitates risk understanding, and (2) experiences and perceptions of severe weather, which increase feelings of concern. We analyze data from the 2019 Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, which was conducted in 142 countries. We find that people who have a college or high-school degree (vs. at most completed elementary school) are more concerned about climate change, but education is unrelated to severe weather concerns. People with experiences and perceptions of severe weather events are more likely to report climate change concerns and severe weather concerns, but the relationships with severe weather concerns are stronger. Thus, climate change concerns and severe weather concerns seem to be formed differently. Findings hold when controlling for household income, other individual characteristics, and country characteristics. They also hold in separate analyses for each World Bank country-income category and continent. These findings suggest that climate change communications should aim to be understandable to audiences at all educational levels and facilitate connections to personal experiences and perceptions of severe weather to climate change.

Previous research has identified that climate change adaptation in cities requires the development of blue-green infrastructure (BGI), and it is expected that cities can leapfrog to a water-sensitive state by implementing BGI. However, leapfrogging is context-dependent, and little is known about how governance factors affect leapfrogging, particularly in midsize cities. This paper addresses this knowledge gap, providing empirical insights into leapfrogging by assessing the governance factors that support or restrict BGI implementation in Zwolle (the Netherlands) towards becoming a water-sensitive state. For the analysis, we employ a governance assessment tool and three catalytic factors that promote leapfrogging. The results show that the governance context supports leapfrogging at a moderate to high level. This means that while the governmental levels and stakeholder networks collaborate to support climate change adaptation of the city, new legislation on BGI and citizens' involvement in climate change adaptation projects could increase the leapfrog possibilities for Zwolle in achieving its goal of becoming climate-proof by 2050.

Although it is clear that climate change is resulting in warmer temperatures, more erratic rainfall, deeper and more prolonged droughts, pervasive landslides and frequent floods and forest-fires, the effects are varied at the district level. The community forests of Tanahu are less resilient as they have limited elevational and bioclimatic range, and forest plant species and habitats, and are vulnerable to forest fire and overgrazing, whereas that of Kaski district cover a wide range of altitude and bioclimate, harboring a diverse range of plant species, habitats and traditional culture and, consequently, are highlighted for conservation by the forest authority. In order to make community forestry more resilient, embracing local adaptation is suggested with the aim of enhancing traditional forest management practices, lessening climate change hazards and increasing conservation trade-offs through strengthening the ownership of local communities and improving the circularity of forest service generation and consumption.

Specifically, the devastating floods coupled with the looming spectre of drought are argued to explain cross-country differences in food security. While the debate continues and uncertainties about the precise influence of climate change on food security linger, the question of whether climate change plays a pivotal role in increased hunger and food insecurity across countries remains unanswered. This study presented new evidence of the role of climate change in Africa's food security. We utilised the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator to analyse climate change trends. We also employed the pooled mean group technique and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality test to investigate the effect of climate change on food security in 15 African countries between 1970 and 2016. Our empirical findings revealed three things. First, rainfall plays a decisive role in Africa's food security when examined broadly. However, the significance of the effect of rainfall varied substantially across the 15 countries. Second, we find no robust impact of temperature on food security in the long run. However, the short-run results showed that extreme temperatures impede food security, with varying magnitudes across countries. Third, except for rainfall, a bidirectional causality exists between food security and temperature in Africa. Given the risks associated with rain-fed agriculture, we argue that African countries need to limit their dependence on rain-fed agriculture to boost food production.

We find that TC-CPU can predict future US climate uncertainty and attention measures while US measures do not predict Chinese climate change measures. Moreover, TC-CU (TC-CPU) negatively predicts equity returns of small (value) firms. Finally, we find a decline in CO2 emissions in response to shocks to TC-CU.

This study presented an integrated framework for assessing climate change impact on extreme rainfall and urban drainage systems by incorporating a number of statistical and modelling techniques. Starting from synthetic future climate data generated by the stochastic weather generator, the simple scaling method and the Huff rainfall design were adopted for rainfall disaggregation and rainfall design. After having obtained 3-min level designed rainfall information, the urban hydrological model (i.e., Storm Water Management Model) was used to carry out the runoff analysis. A case study in a tropical city was used to demonstrate the proposed framework. Particularly, the impact of selecting different general circulation models and Huff distributions on future 1-h extreme rainfall and the performance of the urban drainage system were investigated. It was revealed that the proposed framework is flexible and easy to implement in generating temporally high-resolution rainfall data under climate model projections and offers a parsimonious way of assessing urban flood risks considering the uncertainty arising from climate change model projections, downscaling and rainfall design.

From these, the ones of greatest importance are those which endanger human settlements as well as socioeconomic activities. This is the case of Tamuin city, settled in the shore of Tampaon River, in Mexico. In this work, we performed a detailed numerical modelling of the hydrodynamics of the zone, considering in situ topographic and bathymetric data as well as hydrodynamic parameters. Severe rainfall scenarios were simulated in order to determine the zones which are prone to flooding, as well as the potential periods of time between the beginning of the rainfall up to the flooding, considering the potential effects of climate change in the precipitation rate.

J	Acharibasam, JB; Datta, R				Acharibasam, John Bosco; Datta, Ranjan			Enhancing community resilience to climate change disasters: Learning experience within and from sub-Saharan black immigrant communities in western Canada	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						black; capacity; climate change; disaster risk; equity; resilience-building; sub-Saharan African immigrants; western Canada	PHENOMENOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; RISK	Enhancing community capacity towards resilience is key to reducing climate disaster risk, especially in Black immigrant communities in Canada. While there are many extreme climate change events occurring, such as hailstorms, floods, snowstorms, forest fires, droughts, and heat waves in western Canada, there is no known study that has explored resilience within sub-Saharan African immigrant communities to climate disaster risks in western Canada. All these extreme climate change events have devastated Black populations threatening their ability to cope with disaster risks. Following a decolonial phenomenology methodological framework research approach; our study explores sub-Saharan African immigrant communities' adaptation strategies to address climate disaster risk in western Canada. In this research, our main purpose was to investigate whether community resilience strategies implemented by the two provinces (Saskatchewan and Alberta) meet the unique needs of sub-Saharan African Immigrants. By exploring local communities' perspectives on climate change, we highlighted the relevance of inclusivity in climate capacity building to reduce disaster risk and cope with climate change-related disasters in the localities. Our findings revealed that personal experiences with climate change risks significantly influenced communities' strength and resilience and contributed to their resilience strategies. We view this paper as a first step in developing a community-led climate change resilience research agenda that will have a practical application for the community in the face of climate change in Canada.

However, little in-depth theoretical and empirical research has been conducted in relation to the link between exposure to climate change and SCR and the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions that explicate this relationship. Using time-lagged data drawn from 260 firms in the Australian food supply chains, we examined how exposure to climate change influences SCR in the face of extreme events, and whether intra-and inter-firm social capital and network complexity affect this relationship. Our analysis revealed that exposure to climate change events has a direct positive-albeit not statistically sig-nificant-influence on SCR to extreme events. Nevertheless, we found that exposure to climate change signifi-cantly and positively influences SCR to extreme events through the mediation of intra-and inter-firm social capital. Additionally, we uncovered that network complexity does not influence the effect of intra-firm social capital on SCR to extreme events, whereas it does negatively influence that of inter-firm social capital. The reliability and validity of our results were confirmed by means of robustness tests. Our study, which has several theoretical and practical implications, makes specific contributions to the United Nations Development Goals.

A Scientometric Study on Urban Green and Blue Infrastructure and Climate Change-Induced Public Health Effects	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; urban heat island; health effects; urban blue green infrastructure; scientometric analysis	EMERGING TRENDS; AIR-POLLUTION; DISEASE RISK; VEGETATION; REDUCTION; SCIENCE	Climate change causes global effects on multiple levels. The anthropogenic input of greenhouse gases increases the atmospheric mean temperature. It furthermore leads to a higher probability of extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves, floods) and thus strongly impacts the habitats of humans, animals, and plants. Against this background, research and innovation activities are increasingly focusing on potential health-related aspects and feasible adaptation and mitigation strategies. Progressing urbanization and demographic change paired with the climate change-induced heat island effect exposes humans living in urban habitats to increasing health risks. By employing scientometric methods, this scoping study provides a systematic bird's eye view on the epistemic landscapes of climate change, its health-related effects, and possible technological and nature-based interventions and strategies in order to make urban areas climate proof. Based on a literature corpus consisting of 2614 research articles collected in SCOPUS, we applied network-based analysis and visualization techniques to map the different scientific communities, discourses and their interrelations. From a public health perspective, the results demonstrate the range of either direct or indirect health effects of climate change. Furthermore, the results indicate that a public health-related scientific discourse is converging with an urban planning and building science driven discourse oriented towards urban blue and green infrastructure. We conclude that this development might mirror the socio-political demand to tackle emerging climate change-induced challenges by transgressing disciplinary boundaries.

Consequently, assessing the effects of climate change on hydrological systems has become critical. The goal of this study is to analyze the impact of climate change on the water balance in the Nyabugogo catchment by downscaling 10 global climate models (GCMs) from CMIP6 using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method. To apply climate change signals under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (low and high emission) scenarios, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used. For the baseline scenario, the period 1950-2014 was employed, whereas the periods 2020-2050 and 2050-2100 were used for future scenario analysis. The streamflow was projected to decrease by 7.2 and 3.49% under SSP126 in the 2020-2050 and 2050-2100 periods, respectively; under SSP585, it showed a 3.26% increase in 2020-2050 and a 4.53% decrease in 2050-2100. The average annual surface runoff was projected to decrease by 11.66 (4.40)% under SSP126 in the 2020-2050 (2050-2100) period, while an increase of 3.25% in 2020-2050 and a decline of 5.42% in 2050-2100 were expected under SSP585. Climate change is expected to have an impact on the components of the hydrological cycle (such as streamflow and surface runoff). This situation may, therefore, lead to an increase in water stress, calling for the integrated management of available water resources in order to match the increasing water demand in the study area. This study's findings could be useful for the establishment of adaptation plans to climate change, managing water resources, and water engineering.

Meanwhile, demand for hydropower generation is expected to increase and future hydropower developments will be important for mitigating climate change. Yet, climate change will affect the natural flow regimes, which will undoubtedly impact hydropower operations (e.g., storages and releases), and in turn the impact of altered hydropower operations on the discharge and consequence to fish that live in these regulated systems. Here, we synthesize the current knowledge of climate-induced alterations to hydropower operations and the expected impacts of altered hydropower operations on riverine fishes. We also consider what is needed to adapt to the way environmental threats will change over the typical 50-100 year lifespan of such facilities. Based on our synthesis, we anticipate the impact on native riverine fishes will increase in severity moving forward. Fortunately, we can take proactive measures to mitigate the adverse, yet synergistic, impacts of hydropower and climate change on aquatic ecosystems. Doing so will require extensive foresight, planning, and incorporating novel mitigation strategies into hydropower development. We also call for greater involvement of fisheries professionals in such processes to ensure that fish are not an afterthought. Failure to better consider how to future-proof hydropower in the context of climate change threatens not only fish populations but also the humans that depend on them for livelihoods, nutrition, and socio-cultural benefits.

Here, we simulate the AR that contributed to the Oroville Dam crisis in early February 2017 under global climate conditions representing preindustrial, present-day, mid-, and late-21st century environments. This event consisted of two distinct AR pulses: the first snowy, westerly, and cool followed by a southwesterly and warm pulse resulting in copious rain-on-snow. We estimate that climate change to date results in similar to 11% and similar to 15% increase in precipitation over the Feather River Basin in Northern California for the first and second pulses, respectively, with late-21st century enhancements upwards of similar to 21% and similar to 59%, respectively. Although both pulses were enhanced by the imposed climate changes, the thermodynamic response and subsequent precipitation increases were most substantial during the second pulse. The disparate changes demonstrated here highlight that not all ARs will respond similarly in a warmer world.

J	Alharbi, FR; Csala, D				Alharbi, Fahad Radhi; Csala, Denes			Gulf Cooperation Council Countries' Climate Change Mitigation Challenges and Exploration of Solar and Wind Energy Resource Potential	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Review						GCC countries; renewable energy; transition towards sustainability; CO2 emissions; climate change mitigation	HIGH-RESOLUTION ASSESSMENT; RENEWABLE ENERGY; DUST STORMS; GCC COUNTRIES; ARABIAN PENINSULA; POWER-GENERATION; RED-SEA; POLICY; COST; RADIATION	Climate change mitigation is one of the most critical challenges of this century. The unprecedented global effects of climate change are wide-ranging, including changing weather patterns that threaten food production, increased risk of catastrophic floods, and rising sea levels. Adapting to these impacts will be more difficult and costly in the future if radical changes are not made now. This review paper evaluates the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries' potential for solar and wind energy resources to meet climate change mitigation requirements and assesses the ability of the GCC region to shift towards low-carbon technologies. The review demonstrates that the GCC region is characterized by abundant solar energy resources. The northwestern, southeastern, and western mountains of the region are highlighted as locations for solar energy application. Oman displays the highest onshore wind speed range, 3-6.3 m s(1), and has the highest annual solar radiation of up to 2500 kWh/m(2). Kuwait has the second highest onshore wind speed range of 4.5-5.5 m s(1). The western mountains and northwestern Saudi Arabia have a wind speed range of 3-6 m s(1). The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has the second highest annual solar radiation, 2285 kWh/m(2), while Saudi Arabia and the state of Kuwait have equal annual solar radiation at 2200 kWh/m(2). This review demonstrates that abundant offshore wind energy resources were observed along the coastal areas of the Arabian Gulf, as well as a potential opportunity for wind energy resource development in the Red Sea, which was characterized by high performance. In addition, the GCC countries will not be able to control and address the interrelated issues of climate change in the future if they do not eliminate fossil fuel consumption, adhere to the Paris Agreement, and implement plans to utilize their natural resources to meet these challenges.

Forming one-fifth of the world population, the region increasingly faces climate-induced disasters such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, cyclones etc. This region also has one of the world's poorest people who struggle to cope with the rapidly changing climatic conditions. Agriculture still employs many people in the region, one of the worst-hit sectors. Agriculture will become untenable in some parts of the region due to climate change. Monsoon patterns have changed, and agriculture does not guarantee sustainable income for the vast majority. Many climate change adaptations have been initiated in the region in response to the threat of climate change. Scholars and practitioners feel that these adaptations must be transformative to be effective. In this paper, we examine eight such adaptations from three South Asian Countries - Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, from the lens of transformative adaptation. We found that no single adaptation initiative meets all the criteria for sustainable socio-ecological transformations. However, there is a significant overlap between different typologies of transformation as envisaged in the paper and literature. We conclude that the concept of socio-ecological transformation is new for South Asia, so integrating it into the programmes and policies is the need of the hour.

Low Impact Development (LID) techniques have a high potential to mitigate their impacts. This study investigates the consequences of climate change and urbanization on the urban runoff in the Risvollan catchment in Trondheim, Norway, and the effects of LID implementation and the influence of LID spatial distributions on their performance. A SWMM model of Risvollan was implemented, along with different scenarios of urbanization and climate change. The performance of various spatial distributions of LID infrastructures in the catchment was investigated, using the outflow volume and the peak runoff at the outfall as indicators. The rainfall event-based simulation results confirmed the negative effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff. These effects were partially mitigated by a homogenous LID implementation. The different spatial distributions of LID had little impact on volume reduction but targeting the most downstream zones of the model was more efficient in reducing the peaks at the catchment's outlet. These findings confirm that the spatial configuration of LID might be a determinant parameter towards an efficient design of LID infrastructure in urban settings, depending on the local stakes and criteria of urban water management.

This paper aims to evaluate the impacts of land use change and climate change on flooding in the Segamat River Basin, Johor, Malaysia, with 1D-2D hydrodynamic river modeling, using InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Modeling (ICM). The study involved the development of flood maps for four different scenarios: (1) future land use in 2030; (2) the impacts of climate change; (3) three mitigation strategies comprising detention ponds, rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs), and permeable pavers; and (4) a combination of these three mitigation strategies. The obtained results show increases in the flood peaks under both the land use change and climate change scenarios. With the anticipated increase in development activities within the vicinity up to 2030, the overall impact of urbanization on the extent of flooding would be rather moderate, as the upper and middle parts of the basin would still be dominated by forests and agricultural activities (approximately 81.13%). In contrast, the potential flood-inundated area is expected to increase from 12.25% to 16.64% under storms of 10-, 50-, 100-, and 1000-year average recurrence intervals (ARI). Interestingly, the simulation results suggest that only the detention pond mitigation strategy has a considerable impact on reducing floods, while the other two mitigation strategies have less flood reduction advantages for this agricultural-based rural basin located in a tropical region.

This research aims to identify the impact of climate change (floods) to determine residential economic attributes that could affect the value for residential property in flood risk areas. The case study covers all residential housing schemes in Langat River Basin area, which has been considered as the highest flood risk area in the State of Selangor, Malaysia. The methodology of this research is based on the conceptual analysis from previous studies from local and international scenarios. The systematic analysis of previous literature of real estate valuation theory consists of economic attributes such as structural, locational and environmental attributes involved in residential property valuation in relation to flooding. The findings reveal that the economic attributes' response to flood hazards for residential properties can be divided into three conditions, and they are: positive, negative or no effect on the climate change factor.

Frequent floods and droughts in the past decades indicate the susceptibility of the region to climate variability. Although there are multiple studies investigating the basin's future water availability, most of those are based on limited climate change scenarios despite the wide range of uncertainties in different climate model projections. This study aims to provide a better estimation of projected future streamflow for a combination of 18 climate change scenarios. We develop a hydrologic model of the basin and simulate the future water availability based on these climate change scenarios. Our results show that the simulated mean annual, mean seasonal and annual maximum streamflow of the basin is expected to increase in future. By the end of the 21st century, the projected increase in mean annual, mean dry season, mean wet season, and annual maximum streamflow is about 25, 178, 11, and 22%, respectively. We also demonstrate that this projected streamflow can be expressed as a multivariate linear regression of projected changes in temperature and precipitation in the basin and would be very useful for policy makers to make informed decision regarding climate change adaptation.

The households which were dependent on agriculture for their livelihood were badly affected by this extreme weather event. The female-headed households are likely to be more vul-nerable to climate change. Their livelihood is derived chiefly from informal sources like agricul-ture which are climate-sensitive. Therefore, more intensive research is needed to illuminate the interaction between climate change and gender inequalities. The study attempts to relate the livelihood vulnerability of economically deprived farmers in relation to the gender of the house-hold head of the family. Mala and Vellangallur blocks were selected for the study. In order to cal-culate the vulnerability, primary and secondary data were combined and then the Livelihood Vul-nerability Index (LVI) was employed. The results revealed that female-headed households were more vulnerable to extreme weather events when compared to male-headed households. Women showed greater vulnerability than men in all the major components considered in the LVI, i.e., so-cio-demographic profile, economic status, social networks, health, food, water, extreme weather events.

Based on their tolerances of extreme ambient conditions, we also calculated safety margins using abiotic monitoring data. The two most terrestrial species, Minuca rapax and Leptuca panacea, exhibited submersion tolerances of from 22 to 40 h, and desiccation tolerances of from 30 to 55 h; LC50's were approximate to 45 parts per thousand S and UT50's were approximate to 40 degrees C. The two least terrestrial species, M. vocator and L. speciosa, were less tolerant of all experimental challenges, showing submersion and desiccation tolerances of <6 h, and LC50's of 36 parts per thousand S and UT50's of 38 degrees C.

Mitigation of emerging implications of climate change on food production systems	FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Congress on Bioactive Compounds (ICBC)	NOV 22-23, 2018	Campinas, BRAZIL			Sensitivity of food to climate; Reduced yields; Increased irrigation; Planting and harvesting changes; Decreased arability; More pests; Risks to fisheries	GREENHOUSE-GAS MITIGATION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; EXTREME WEATHER; PEST-MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; WATER; SECURITY; STRATEGIES; EMISSIONS; NITROGEN	Crops, livestock and seafood are major contributors to global economy. Agriculture and fisheries are especially dependent on climate. Thus, elevated temperatures and carbon dioxide levels can have large impacts on appropriate nutrient levels, soil moisture, water availability and various other critical performance conditions. Changes in drought and flood frequency and severity can pose severe challenges to farmers and threaten food safety. In addition, increasingly warmer water temperatures are likely to shift the habitat ranges of many fish and shellfish species, ultimately disrupting ecosystems. In general, climate change will probably have negative implications for farming, animal husbandry and fishing. The effects of climate change must be taken into account as a key aspect along with other evolving factors with a potential impact on agricultural production, such as changes in agricultural practices and technology; all of them with a serious impact on food availability and price. This review is intended to provide critical and timely information on climate change and its implications in the food production/consumption system, paying special attention to the available mitigation strategies.

The mental health effects of climate change are multifaceted, with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression predominant. This paper aims to describe the impact of climate change on mental health conditions, including risk and protective factors related to the expression of mental health conditions post-disaster, as well as a discussion of our local experience with a devastating wildfire to our region within Canada. The risk of the development of mental health conditions post-disaster is not equally distributed; research has consistently demonstrated that specific risk factors (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status and education, pre-existing mental health symptomatology), are associated with increased vulnerability to mental health conditions following natural disasters. There are multiple strategies that must be undertaken by communities to enhance adjustment and coping post-disaster, including improved access to care, inter-agency cooperation, enhanced community resiliency, and adequate preparation.

Systematic review of climate change effects on reproductive health	FERTILITY AND STERILITY			English	Review						Climate change; reproductive health; pregnancy; air pollution; infertility	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; HEAT-STRESS; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; MAJOR ROADWAYS; ZIKA VIRUS; RISK; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; FERTILITY; BIRTH	Climate change is a major risk factor for overall health, including reproductive health, and well-being. Increasing temperatures, due mostly to increased greenhouse gases trapping excess heat in the atmosphere, result in erratic weather patterns, wildfires, displacement of large communities, and stagnant water resulting in vector-borne diseases that, together, have set the stage for new and devastating health threats across the globe. These conditions disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, including women, pregnant persons, young children, the elderly, and the disabled. This review reports on the evidence for the adverse impacts of air pollution, wildfires, heat stress, floods, toxic chemicals, and vector-borne diseases on male and female fertility, the developing fetus, and obstetric outcomes. Reproductive health care providers are uniquely positioned and have an unprecedented opportunity to educate patients and policy makers about mitigating the impact of climate change to assure reproductive health in this and future gen-erations.

J	Wu, SH; Liu, LL; Gao, JB; Wang, WT				Wu, Shaohong; Liu, Lulu; Gao, Jiangbo; Wang, Wentao			Integrate Risk From Climate Change in China Under Global Warming of 1.5 and 2.0 °C.	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						global warming; climate change; integrate risk; extreme events; vulnerability	AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT RISK; TEMPERATURE; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; CMIP5	Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards (including hazardous events and trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems. Despite the commitment of the Paris Agreement, the integrate research on climate change risk combining risk-causing factors and risk-bearing bodies, the regional differences in climate impacts are still missing. In this paper we provide a quantitative assessment of hazards and socioeconomic risks of extreme events, risks of risk-bearing bodies in China under global warming of 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C based on future climate scenarios, and quantitative evaluation theory for climate change risk. For severe heat waves, hazards might significantly intensify. Affected population under 2.0 degrees C warming might increase by more than 60% compared to that of 1.5 degrees C. Hazards of severe droughts and floods might strengthen under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Economic losses might double between warming levels of 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C, and the population affected by severe floods might continuously increase. Under the integrate effects of multiple disasters, the regions with high population and economic risks would be concentrated in eastern China. The scope would gradually expand to the west with socioeconomic development and intensification of extreme events. High ecological risks might be concentrated in the southern regions of the Yangtze River Basin, while the ecological risk in northern China would expand. High agriculture yield risks might be distributed mainly in south of the North China Plain, the Sichuan Basin, south of the Yangtze River, and west of Northwest China, and the risk levels might continuously increase. Plain Language Summary. Based on the climate and socioeconomic scenario data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project and International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, risks from climate change were identified under different warming levels, considering socioeconomic damage and ecosystem and food production losses. The relatively developed areas of eastern China exhibit high risks, and the risks show a westward and northward expansion trend. Socioeconomic damage, natural ecosystem, and food production losses would increase with socioeconomic development and intensification of global warming. We believe that a quantitative assessment of climate change risk should integrate climate-related hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems. These results can provide decision-making support for governments and a database for adapting to climate change.

J	Shao, YS; Xu, YJ				Shao, Yisheng; Xu, Yijian			Challenges and countermeasures of urban water systems against climate change: a perspective from China	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Editorial Material						Climate change; Urban water system; Resilience; Adaptation; Mitigation		Urban water systems are facing various challenges against climate change, impacting cities' security and their sustainable development. Specifically, there are three major challenges: submersion risk of coastal cities as glaciers melt and sea level rises, more and severe urban flooding caused by extreme weather like intensified storm surge and heavy precipitation, and regional water resource patterns challenged by alteration of spatial distribution of precipitation. Regarding this, two strategies including proactive adaptation and positive mitigation were proposed in this article to realize the reconstruction and optimization of urban water systems, to enhance their resilience, and eventually increase their adaptability and coping ability to climate change. The proactive adaptation strategy consists of 1) construction of sponge cities to accommodate the increased regular rainfall and to balance the alterations of spatial redistribution of precipitation; 2) reconstruction of excess stormwater discharge and detention system to increase capability for extreme precipitation events based on flood risk assessment under future climate change; 3) deployment of forward-looking, ecological, and integrated measures to improve coastal protection capability against inundation risks caused by climate change and sea level rise. The positive mitigation strategy is to employ the systematic concept in planning and design and to adopt advanced applicable energy-saving technologies, processes, and management practices, aiming at reduction in flux of urban water systems, reinforcement in energy conservation and carbon reduction in both water supply systems and wastewater treatment systems, and thus a reduction of greenhouse gas emission from urban water systems.

Potential implications for tourism in the Kruger National Park	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Kruger national parks; South Africa; Climate change; Tourism	TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY	The study investigates the evidence and impact of climate variability and climate change on the Kruger National Park in South Africa. The mixed methods research design was used as the strategy of inquiry, and both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were employed. Results show that the climate is changing, as indicated by significant trends in annual average temperatures (P = 0.000; alpha = 0.05). Rainfall patterns show high inter-annual variability and a declining trend, although this is not statistically significant. Results further indicate that the changing climate has imposed considerable costs on wildlife, the environment and the national budget. Extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and extreme heat in the Kruger National Park have led to the loss of flora and fauna and infrastructure that supports tourism and has disrupted tourists' activities. The study concludes that there is evidence of climate change and given this, appropriate climate change adaptations and mitigation interventions should be made to ensure the sustainable utilisation of the Kruger National Park in line with the dictates of Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal 13 on climate change action. The study further recommends a revision of land use planning, retrofitting and redesigning of some of the national park facilities and infrastructure to ensure climate resilience and sustainable tourism. Continued investment into research and innovation in national parks is also recommended to foster the protection of natural heritage.

To reduce the impacts of such acute climate-change hazards and safeguard development, national decision-makers require evidence on where and how hazards affect SDG achievement to better inform adaptation. Here, we develop a systems methodology that spatially models the impacts of climate-change hazards across a nation's entire built and natural environment assets and its interdependent influences on the SDG targets to inform national adaptation. We apply our methodology in Saint Lucia through a participatory approach with decision-makers across 18 government ministries, academia, and the private sector. Results reveal that acute climate-change hazards can affect half of Saint Lucia's assets across 22 sectors, which can influence 89% of all SDG targets. Application of our methodology provided evidence on where and how to prioritise adaptation, thereby helping to add spatial granularity to 52 measures under Saint Lucia's National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as well as specificity on how limited capacity for cross-sectoral coordination can be directed to safeguard SDG targets. Adaptation does not necessarily imply investing in physical asset protection: results show the need to protect critical natural environments which provide important adaptation services to the built environment. As more nations develop and revise their NAPs and Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, strategic planning across sectors - as demonstrated in Saint Lucia - will be critical to facilitate adaptation that safeguards SDG achievement.

The impact of climate change on groundwater recharge: National-scale assessment for the British mainland	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Recharge; Model; Climate Change; British mainland	DISTRIBUTED RECHARGE; WATER; CATCHMENT; AQUIFER; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; BASEFLOW; DROUGHT; ENGLAND; EXAMPLE	Groundwater systems provide an important source of water supply as well as contributing baseflow to rivers, lakes and dependent ecosystems and so the impact of climate change on these systems needs to be understood. Calculating recharge to groundwater systems is, therefore, necessary to quantify what is typically one of the largest components of the groundwater balance. This study uses the national-scale recharge model developed for the British mainland and the 11 ensemble members from the Hadley Centre for rainfall and potential evaporation created by the Future Flows and Groundwater Levels (FFGWL) project to investigate the impact of future climate on groundwater resources. Changes to seasonal and monthly recharge for the 2050s and 2080s time slices have been produced for the whole modelled area and for river basin districts for England and Wales. Areal summaries and monthly time series of recharge values show a generally consistent trend of increased recharge in winter, decreased recharge in summer, and mixed pattern in autumn and spring. The work shows that increased winter rainfall is the main factor in increasing recharge. Water balance calculations reveal that over the 2050s and 2080s, the climate change "signal" predominates over the annual variability, which results in a clearer pattern of more recharge being concentrated in fewer months. This finding should prove useful for water resources planners to assess the resilience of groundwater resources to climate change. Further work is recommended to understand the sequencing of flooding and drought events and to the effects of soil health and land cover changes in the future analysis.

The climate change effects on lake hydrology in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of China remain unclear. Lake Dianchi, the Plateau's largest lake subject to human interference, was selected for the study. Algorithms based on historical meteorological data produced high-resolution climate change scenarios describing climate characteristics at a local watershed scale. Integrated river and lake hydrological models simulated changes in inflow, lake volume, and hydrological extremes under different scenarios. Results showed that Lake Dianchi Basin (LDB) inflow would decrease by 1.88 similar to 2.21% if air temperature increased by 1 similar to 2 degrees C but increase by 1.23 similar to 16.1% if precipitation increased by 5 similar to 20%. Lake volume would change minimally (decrease of 0.87 similar to 1.15%) if air temperature increased 1 similar to 2 degrees C and if precipitation increased 5 similar to 20% (increase of 0.04 similar to 4.12%); thus, the hydrological regimes of LDB are more sensitive to precipitation than air temperature. Changes to 3-day and 7-day maximum hydrological extremes were double those of 3-day and 7-day minimums, indicating precipitation-affected maximum extreme hydrological events during wet season more than minimum extreme hydrological events during dry season. In conclusion, both unevenly distributed precipitation and increasing air temperature will increase wet season floods and dry-season droughts in plateau lakes like Lake Dianchi.

J	Albright, EA; Crow, D				Albright, Elizabeth A.; Crow, Deserai			Beliefs about climate change in the aftermath of extreme flooding	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							WEATHER EVENTS; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; LOCAL WEATHER; EXPERIENCE; VIEWS; RISK; VULNERABILITY; AVAILABILITY; PROXIMITY; RESPONSES	When faced with natural disasters, communities respond in diverse ways, with processes that reflect their cultures, needs, and the extent of damage incurred by the community. Because of their potentially recurring nature, floods offer an opportunity for communities to learn from and adapt to these experiences with the goal of increasing resiliency through reflection, modification of former policies, and adoption of new policies. A key component of a community's ability to learn from disaster is how community members perceive the causes of extreme flood events and whether there is risk of future similar events. Perceptions of causes of flooding, including climate change, may be influenced by experiencing a flood event, along with individual preferences for various policies put in place to help a community recover. Using data collected from two rounds of public surveys (n = 903) across six Colorado communities flooded in 2013, we investigate whether there is variation across causal understanding of flooding, and whether this variation can be linked to differences in proximity of damages experienced (personal property, neighborhood, or community). By analyzing these variables, along with other variables (time since flood, political affiliation, and worldview), this study improves our understanding of the factors that drive our beliefs about potential causes of floods, focusing on climate change. The findings suggest that the extent of damage experienced at the neighborhood and community levels can have a significant effect on the perceptions of climate change held by the public. In turn, these beliefs about climate change are positively associated with perceptions of risks of future flooding.

Here, we examine vegetation resilience in coastal wetlands of subtropical Australia to altered salinity and flooding regimes likely to occur with climate change. We conducted field surveys and glasshouse experiments to examine plant diversity and regeneration responses of understorey and canopy species across four habitats. Vegetation composition, but not richness, varied between seaward and inland habitats while soil seed bank diversity was greatest in more inland sites. Experimental salinity and flooding treatments strongly influenced emergence from seed banks with most species germinating under fresh, waterlogged conditions and very few in saline treatments. Composition of emerging seedling assemblages was similar across habitats and treatments but differed considerably from the extant vegetation, indicating a relatively minor role of soil seed banks in sustaining current vegetation structure in this wetland. An exception to this was Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) which was common in both the vegetation and seed banks suggesting a high capacity for this species to re-establish following disturbances. Seedlings of dominant canopy species also reacted strongly to increased salinity treatments with decreased survivorship recorded. Overall, our findings suggest a high probability of constrained vegetation regeneration in this wetland in response to key projected climate change disturbances with implications for vegetation diversity at a landscape scale including declines in the extent and diversity of more landward vegetation communities and expansion of salt-tolerant marshes dominated by Sporobolus virginicus.

Design/methodology/approach The study used semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to collect data from 344 farmers, 64 participants in focus group discussions and 6 agriculture extension officers (key informants) from 10 districts in the Pra River Basin of Ghana. Findings Results showed several differences in how climate change is perceived and tackled by male and female genders. In the perception of male farmers, for example, they were found to be more vulnerable to increased temperature, and changes in rainfall and growing season, whereas female farmers on average were considered to be less resilient to floods and droughts for different reasons. Moreover, floods posed higher risks to farming than other climate change impacts. Gender roles had a significant correlation with the type of adaptation strategies practised. Men adopted agrochemicals more often than women, as an adaptation strategy. Research limitations/implications Gender-differentiated interventions should be incorporated in the national climate change action plan for sustainable development in a rain-fed agricultural economy such as Ghana. The study recommends several actions to promote gender equity in the assessed region. Originality/value This research assessed the gender differentials in climate trends, impact, vulnerability and adaptation based on primary data collected between April and May 2019 and compared the results with climate data in the basin for the period 1991-2014. It is an empirical study focused on primary data analysis obtained in loco by authors, involving approximately 400 participants.

This research describes the influence of headwater reservoirs on projections of climate change impacts and flood frequency, and how riparian countries can benefit from storing of floodwaters for use during dry seasons. Six climate change scenarios and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are used in three periods of a quarter-century each. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to assess how the proposed reservoirs will reduce flooding by similar to 38% during the wet season, reduce the flood frequency from five to 25 years return period, and increase low flows by similar to 110% during the dry season, which reflect an similar to 17.5% reduction in the glacier-covered area by the end of the century. The risks and benefits of reservoirs are highlighted in light of the developmental goals of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

One reason for this disagreement is that it is difficult to mentally simulate the effects of a process as complex as climate change and to have a concrete representation of the impact that our individual actions will have on our own future, especially if the consequences are long term and abstract. To overcome these challenges, we propose to use cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to develop an interactive personalized visualization tool, the AI climate impact visualizer. It will allow a user to enter an address-be it their house, their school, or their workplace--and it will provide them with an AI-imagined possible visualization of the future of this location in 2050 following the detrimental effects of climate change such as floods, storms, and wildfires. This image will be accompanied by accessible information regarding the science behind climate change, i.e., why extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and what kinds of changes are happening on a local and global scale.

Medical anthropologists are poised to document the human costs of floods, fires, droughts and other catastrophic events, as well as the slowly shifting supplies of fresh water, clean air, and adequate food. Our anthropological eyes on the ground are needed for contextual, local, and critical understandings of how human lifestyles of the twenty-first century are creating climate change.

Adaptation of Animal and Human Health Surveillance Systems for Vector-Borne Diseases Accompanying Climate Change	JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS			English	Article								Anthropogenic climate change is causing temperature rise in temperate zones resulting in climate conditions more similar to subtropical zones. As a result, rising temperatures increase the range of disease-carrying insects to new areas outside of subtropical zones, and increased precipitation causes flooding that is more hospitable for vector breeding. State governments, the federal government, and governmental agencies, like the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of USDA and the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lack a coordinated plan for vector-borne disease accompanying climate change. APHIS focuses its surveillance primarily on the effect of illness on agricultural production, while NNDSS focuses on the emergence of pathogens affecting human health. This article provides an analysis of the current framework of surveillance of, and response to, vector-borne infectious diseases, the impacts of climate change on the spread of vector-borne infectious diseases, and recommends changes to federal law to address these threats.

The increasing variations in heavy monsoon rains in South Asia have been primarily linked to this human-induced phenomenon. Torrential rains in the monsoon season cause regular flash flooding in many urban areas of Pakistan. Poor infrastructure, weak governance, and lack of corrective disaster risk reduction have exacerbated climate risk and vulnerabilities. Thus, it is pertinent to undertake preparedness and adaptation measures to safeguard lives and reduce economic damages. Numerous methodologies have been developed to identify factors affecting such actions. This study proposes a novel methodology by integrating the statistical and artificial intelligence techniques to identify determinants of disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation, i.e., the three-step neural approach. The methodology was tested in two monsoon-affected areas of Lahore metropolitan, Pakistan. Using the Yamane sampling method, 400 samples were collected through household questionnaires. Data regarding monsoon flood risk perception, psychological distance to climate change, preparedness, and adaptation measures were collected. Regression analysis was used to shortlist the influential socioeconomic indicators. A multi-layer perceptron neural network was then used to reconfirm the influence of these indicators. The prediction testing shows the high accuracy of this approach. The proposed methodology was found robust and operational for successfully predicting the socioeconomic determinants. It can be easily modified and streamlined for testing in the context of other natural hazards and regions.

The fundamental links between climate change and marine plastic pollution	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Policy; Ocean; Ecosystems	MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION; PROTECTED AREAS; LAND-USE; SEA; DEBRIS; LIFE; ENVIRONMENT; ENTANGLEMENT; COMMUNITIES; ORGANISMS	Plastic pollution and climate change have commonly been treated as two separate issues and sometimes are even seen as competing. Here we present an alternative view that these two issues are fundamentally linked. Primarily, we explore how plastic contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the beginning to the end of its life cycle. Secondly, we show that more extreme weather and floods associated with climate change, will exacerbate the spread of plastic in the natural environment. Finally, both issues occur throughout the marine environment, and we show that ecosystems and species can be particularly vulnerable to both, such as coral reefs that face disease spread through plastic pollution and climate-driven increased global bleaching events. A Web of Science search showed climate change and plastic pollution studies in the ocean are often siloed, with only 0.4% of the articles examining both stressors simultaneously. We also identified a lack of regional and industry-specific life cycle analysis data for comparisons in relative GHG contributions by materials and products. Overall, we suggest that rather than debate over the relative importance of climate change or marine plastic pollution, a more productive course would be to determine the linking factors between the two and identify solutions to combat both crises.

J	Wang, DY; Wang, DG; Mo, CX; Du, Y				Wang, Dayang; Wang, Dagang; Mo, Chongxun; Du, Yi			Risk variation of reservoir regulation during flood season based on bivariate statistical approach under climate change: a case study in the Chengbihe reservoir, China	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Risk analysis; Climate change; Design flood hydrographs; Copula function; Dam extreme risk; Dam overtopping risk	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RETURN PERIOD; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; DAM; DESIGN; PRECIPITATION; COPULA; STREAMFLOW; RAINFALL; SYSTEM	The risk analysis of reservoir regulation in the flood season is crucial and provides the valuable information for reservoir flood control, safety operation, and decision making, especially under climate change. The purpose of this study is to propose a framework for reasonably estimating the variation of reservoir regulation risk including the dam extreme risk and the overtopping risk during the flood season under climate change. The framework consists of an integrated diagnostic system for detecting the climate abrupt change time, a copula function-based bivariate statistical approach for modeling the dependence between the flood peak and flood volume, a Monte Carlo simulation for generating numerous random flood peak-volume pairs, and a risk calculation model for routing the design flood hydrographs to obtain the frequency curve of the maximum water level reached in front of dam and evaluating the reservoir regulation risk. The methodology was implemented in the Chengbihe reservoir in south China by using the 55-year (1963-2017) hydrometeorological data, including temperature, evaporation, precipitation, and streamflow, in the flood season. Results show that the hydrometeorological series during the flood season changed abruptly in 1992 and the entire data can be divided into two periods (1963-1992 and 1993-2017). The dam extreme risk and overtopping risk during the two periods are assessed, respectively, and a comparison analysis is made based on different flood limit water-level schemes (185.00-188.50 m). It demonstrates that both the dam extreme risk and the dam overtopping risk increase under the influence of climate change. The dam extreme risk increases by 22.91-95.03%, while the climate change-induced increase in the dam overtopping risk is between 38.62 and 123.59%, which indicates that the dam overtopping risk is more sensitive to climate change than the dam extreme risk. The risk evaluations in the study are of great significance in the safety operation and risk management of reservoirs under future climate change.

However, little is known about the impact of climate change on human health and effective adaptation methods in informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to identify, characterize, and summarize research evidence on the impact of climate change on human health in informal settlements and the available adaptation methods and interventions. Method: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. The four bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched. Eligibility criteria were all types of peer-reviewed publications reporting on climate change or related extreme weather events (as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), informal settlements (as defined by UN-Habitat), low- and middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) and immediate human health impacts. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined form. Results: Out of 1197 studies initially identified, 15 articles were retained. We found nine original research articles, and six reviews, commentaries, and editorials. The articles were reporting on the exposures flooding, temperature changes and perceptions of climate change with health outcomes broadly categorized as mental health, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases. Six studies had a geographical focus on Asia, four on Africa, and one on South America, the remaining four articles had no geographical focus. One article investigated an adaptation method for heat exposure. Serval other adaptation methods were proposed, though they were not investigated by the articles in this review. Conclusion: There is a paucity of original research and solid study designs. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the impact, the most effective adaptation methods and to inform policy making.

Interaction of climate change and marine pollution in Southern India: Implications for coastal zone management practices and policies	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Synergistic effects; Climate change; Plastics; Litter; Climate resilience; Coastal zone management; Indian Ocean; Tamil Nadu; Kerala; Malabar Coast; Gulf of Mannar Reserve	LONGSHORE SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; MANNAR BIOSPHERE RESERVE; PLASTIC DEBRIS; WATER-QUALITY; SOUTHWEST COAST; RAINFALL EVENTS; STATE KERALA; FLOOD RISK; MICROPLASTICS; GULF	Climate change and marine litter are inextricably linked, and their interaction manifests differently depending on the specific environmental and biological characteristics, and other human activities taking place. The negative impacts resulting from those synergistic interactions are threatening coastal and marine ecosystems and the many goods and services they provide. This is particularly pervasive in the coastal zone of the Indian subcontinent. India is already experiencing severe climate change impacts, which are projected to worsen in the future. At the same time, the country is gripped by a litter crisis that is overwhelming authorities and communities and hindering the country's sustainable development goals. The coastal environment and communities of the southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. While these state governments and authorities are stepping up efforts to improve the management of their coastal zones, the scale and severity of these issues are mounting. Here we review the combined effects of climate change and marine litter pollution in Southern India, focusing on the Gulf of Mannar Reserve in Tamil Nadu and the Malabar Coast in Kerala. Finally, we discuss effective management options that could help improve resilience and sustainability.

Toxicity travels in a changing climate	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Toxicity; Climate change; Flooding; Adaptation; Contamination	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SUPERFUND SITES; HURRICANE SANDY; NEW-YORK; FLOOD; HOUSTON; IMPACT; COASTS; AREAS; FEMA	Climate change is imposing substantial consequences across physical and social infrastructures. The extent of social disruption and risk to human health are, however, potentially much broader than these general consequences, taken individually, would suggest. To address this gap, we assess the distribution of contaminated sites in the United States (US) and then estimate the impact that flood hazards in urban areas will have on these contaminated sites. Using these measures, we draw inferences about the risk of contamination from climate impacted extreme weather events, climate adaptation at the local level, social risk and how it is distributed, and a broader understanding of the potential global consequences of climate change. In this paper we address three critical points: 1) the role classification of contaminated sites on our understanding of risk due to climate change; 2) the relationship between contaminated sites and flood risk; and 3) the potential for climate adaption strategies to mediate this risk. We estimate that of the roughly one-third of the US population living in urban areas, up to 3,338,518 people, are living in high-risk flood zones near contaminated sites. Our results suggest severe potential implications for estimates of the negative consequences from climate change and contamination and provide critical insights into the relationship between climate change and the built environment for urban planners and environmental policy makers and managers alike.

A systematic map	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE			English	Article						Flooding; Flood risk management; Environmental Impact Assessment; Climate change adaptation; River catchments; Nature-based solutions; Natural Flood Management		BackgroundThis systematic map principally sought to understand the different forms of effectiveness that existing studies evaluate in relation to Natural Flood Management (NFM) in the UK with a supplementary question of whether studies engaged with climate change and future flood risk. NFM measures seek to protect, enhance, emulate, or restore the natural function of rivers as part of approaches to flood risk management (FRM). While there is agreement in both academic and practice/policy literature that NFM should be part of a holistic FRM strategy to address current and future flood risk, the specifics of how to expand the application of and consistently implement NFM successfully in practice are less well known. A core focus of this study is on how the effectiveness of NFM measures is evaluated in different studies based on approaches drawn from the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) literature: procedural, substantive, transactive and normative. The systematic map also examines how studies account for climate change, which is a crucial issue given the connections between NFM and climate change adaptation and resilience.MethodsWe searched 13 bibliographic databases, Google scholar as a web-based search engine, and 21 organisational sites. Articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text based on defined eligibility criteria. Checks were performed for consistency amongst reviewers. Forms of effectiveness were coded on the basis of the included studies in the systematic map. The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence are summarised with the frequencies of effectiveness forms for each NFM measure are presented in heat maps.Review findingsA total of 216 articles reported eligible studies that were coded as part of the systematic map. Overall, the systematic map shows that the majority of studies considered at least one approach to effectiveness; however, very few studies considered multiple forms of effectiveness. The systematic map also demonstrates that climate change is considered systematically by around one-quarter of studies although many studies make claims about NFM's effectiveness in the face of future climatic change.ConclusionsNFM can be effective in several different ways owing to their multiple benefits; however, there are evidence gaps around understanding these different forms of effectiveness. This is particularly marked for studies considering transactive and normative effectiveness. Interdisciplinary studies are more likely to consider multiple forms of effectiveness. This systematic map also found that whilst 75% of studies mention future climate change in their studies, only 24.1% contain a systematic consideration of the issue through, for example, using climate change projections. NFM is also at risk of climate change (e.g. through drought) and therefore it is imperative that study designs seek to incorporate consideration of effectiveness under future climate change. Policymakers should be made aware of the lack of understanding of how NFM measures perform under future climate change.

J	Laino, E; Iglesias, G				Laino, Emilio; Iglesias, Gregorio			Scientometric review of climate-change extreme impacts on coastal cities	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Climate change extreme impacts; Coastal flooding; Coastal erosion; Coastal cities; Bibliometric analysis; Scientometric analysis	SEA-LEVEL RISE; ADAPTATION; 21ST-CENTURY; TEMPERATURE; PROJECTIONS; ECOSYSTEMS; SHORELINE; SEDIMENT; EROSION; LOSSES	The generalised sea level and temperature rise, along with the increasing frequency and intensity of storms and temperature extremes, trigger a variety of climate-change-related impacts on coastal communities, such as coastal flooding and erosion, pluvial and river flooding, heat waves, cold spells, droughts, and landslides. These events can rapidly cascade into additional challenges and have a profound impact on the coastal zone. Many studies have focused on the causes and consequences of climate change for coastal cities in the past decades. As a result, the number of forecasts, risk assessments, literature reviews, and methodologies has increased. This comprehensive review comprises the key findings of a systematic analysis of the scientific literature on extreme impacts of climate change on coastal cities. After a bibliometric analysis, which yields 2321 papers in 470 journals from 1976 to 2021, a scientometric analysis is carried out. There is wide geographical diversity, with publications from 97 countries. In terms of numbers and nationalities, the USA was followed by China, UK, Australia, and Indonesia. The scarcity of papers from developing countries is apparent. "Storm" and "risk assessment" are the top keywords regarding frequency of occurrence and relationships with other keywords. The main research areas for this topic are risk assessment, climate-change-related hazards and their drivers, modelling tools, disaster control and prevention measures, climate change policies and urban planning. Finally, research gaps are identified, and future research directions proposed, e.g., emerging integrated coastal zone management tools and the impacts on climate change on developing countries.

J	Koessler, AK; Heinz, N; Engel, S				Koessler, Ann-Kathrin; Heinz, Nicolai; Engel, Stefanie			Perspective-taking with affected others to promote climate change mitigation	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						perspective-taking; pro-environmental behavior; climate change; empathy; experiment	FLOOD RISK; EMPATHY; ATTITUDES; SHOES; HELP	Prior evidence suggests that perspective-taking may promote pro-environmental behavior, at least for low-cost behaviors or local environmental problems. Climate change, however, requires costly mitigation efforts and is a global problem. Thus, in this study, we examine whether perspective-taking in the context of climate change is effective in promoting mitigation behaviors, including actual and/or costly behaviors, the mechanisms through which perspective-taking works, and if the distance to the person adversely affected by climate change matters for the effect. We conducted an online experiment with a non-student sample from Germany (n = 557), utilizing a 2 x 2 factorial design, to investigate the impact of perspective-taking and distance on three outcome measures: a climate donation, signing a petition, and approval of mitigation policies. We find that perspective-taking does not promote these mitigation behaviors, yet it raises the degree perspective-takers value and - for close others - feel connected with the affected person. Exploratory analysis shows that dispositional perspective-taking and empathic concern are correlated with mitigation behaviors.

The Power of Resilience: Local Institutions, Local Experience, and Adaptation to Climate Change in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; adaptation; local institutions; resilience; agriculture; Nigeria	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; VULNERABILITY	This study uses evidence from three rural agricultural communities in Nigeria to examine the role and relevance of local institutions and knowledge with regard to climate change adaptation. It argues that the formal climate change response framework has failed to incorporate local institutions as critical components of adaptation strategies, even though local institutions and people have age-old niches and decades of experience in confronting adverse weather events. The findings indicate that these communities have over the years developed critical norms around ensuring agricultural production and stemming the impacts of adverse climatic conditions without government support. The study underpins the resilience of these institutions in climate change adaptation and finds that, despite long bouts with gully erosion and flooding, these communities have over time developed practices and roles that ensure survival. Thus, these communities possess bastions of creativity and experience that may be useful in formal adaptation and resilience strategies to climate change in Nigeria.	[Anugwom, Edlyne E.

Case Study of Reinosa in the Ebro River Basin	WATER			English	Article						climate model projections; flood risk; flood hazard; Reinosa; climate change prioritization		Floods are one of the natural hazards that could be most affected by climate change, causing great economic damage and casualties in the world. On December 2019 in Reinosa (Cantabria, Spain), took place one of the worst floods in memory. Implementation of DIRECTIVE 2007/60/EC for the assessment and management of flood risks in Spain enabled the detection of this river basin with a potential significant flood risk via a preliminary flood risk assessment, and flood hazard and flood risk maps were developed. The main objective of this paper is to present a methodology to estimate climate change's effects on flood hazard and flood risk, with Reinosa as the case study. This river basin is affected by the snow phenomenon, even more sensitive to climate change. Using different climate models, regarding a scenario of comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5), with daily temperature and precipitation data from years 2007-2070, and comparing results in relative terms, flow rate and flood risk variation due to climate change are estimated. In the specific case of Reinosa, the MRI-CGCM3 model shows that climate change will cause a significant increase of potential affected inhabitants and economic damage due to flood risk. This evaluation enables us to define mitigation actions in terms of cost-benefit analysis and prioritize the ones that should be included in flood risk management plans.

Exhaustive case studies must be reported to understand the impact of climate change in a local area. However, there have been some difficulties in presenting all procedures used to derive the impact of climate change. Therefore, the current study presents a local case study of how a local small basin is prepared to mitigate the effects of climate change on extreme rainfall events. From the case study, the full procedure to produce an intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve regarding a number of future global circulation model (GCM) daily precipitation scenarios is described in detail. The major portion of this work is focused on simply estimating extreme rainfall intensity with an IDF curve considering climate change scenarios from a GCM ensemble. From all available GCMs (19), the IDF ensemble is estimated with the following procedure: (1) daily GCM outputs obtained from the grid point that is closest to the target area were bias-corrected with gamma distribution after checking the suitability of the distribution model; (2) the bias-corrected daily precipitation data were downscaled; and (3) the IDF curves for the future scenarios were estimated and an ensemble was used to produce the final IDF curve. The result indicates that the IDF curve of future scenarios effectively inherits the behaviors of the original GCM daily precipitation outputs. The future IDF estimate will be employed to prepare for the effects of future climate change on extreme rainfall events on a local scale. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews with 73 respondents from three different areas of Bangladesh and subsequently analyzed. The results show that there are similarities and differences between respondents from regions with different vulnerabilities in terms of their views and perceptions about what climate change is its causes, the consequences of EWEs, and the strategies they adopt to cope with their effects. Respondents understood climate change based on their own local experiences of climate change and EWEs. A main finding is that people in all three areas are driven to borrow money in the face of these events as a survival strategy and to be able to continue to support their families. As the climate is set to change rapidly and EWEs to occur more frequently and regularly, it will become routine for those most vulnerable to them to have to cope and live with their impacts. Increased reliance on borrowing risks leading to a debt spiral for already vulnerable people. They are thus subject to a "double whammy": on the one hand the direct effects of climate change and EWEs on their lives and livelihoods and on the other getting caught in a debt spiral sparked by times of crisis.

This will definitely contribute to the improvement of the city's resilience to the effects of climate change. In this paper, the projections of a subset of climate change models from both the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; with a total of 5 simulations) and Euro-CORDEX (for a set of 51 simulations) have been adjusted to the municipality of Alicante (in the southeast of Spain), using the Climadjust tool (). These projections contain different climatic variables. The rainfall variable has been used to derive a new framework of boundary conditions to help design more resilient infrastructure for torrential rainfall events and urban flooding. The projections corresponding to three climate change scenarios (CMIP6: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5; and Euro-CORDEX: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) are considered with daily resolution and, by applying statistical techniques of temporal disaggregation (by means of a cascade model), hourly (and sub-hourly, reaching 30-min resolution) disaggregation. The results at hourly and 30-min resolutions are used to construct IDF curves of future climate, grouped into short-term (years 2015 to 2040), medium-term (years 2041 to 2070) and long-term (years 2071 to 2100) sub-scenarios. The selected future climate IDFs for an adverse climate change scenario (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) show increases in rainfall intensities, higher the shorter the rainfall duration, for return periods greater than or equal to 25 years, whereas for return periods under 25 years the current IDFs can be representative of future scenarios. Current calculations and future projection of the torrentiality index for severe climate change scenarios, as well as the climate change factors, show an increase in the frequency and magnitude of the heaviest rainfall. This fact corroborates the hypotheses of greater general torrentiality in future rainfall in this specific area of the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

Its geomorphology is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, which has had a significant impact on historical riverbed development through runoff and sedimentation processes. However, there is limited research combining climate change, sedimentology, and chronology with river dynamics to investigate riverbed evolution patterns in geological-historical time scales and their changes in overland flow capacity. In the current study, the evolution of a representative portion of the river channel in the Nangqian basin in the Lancang River headwaters was investigated to explore the reaction of the riverbed to climatic change during the geological period via field surveys, riverbed drilling, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and bankfull channel geometry parameters. The generalized channel section of the historical period was obtained by linking sedimentary layers of the same age on the distribution map of borehole sections, and the bankfull area of the river was computed accordingly. The restored bankfull areas can effectively reflect the ability of historical river channels to transport water and sediment, thus reflecting the climate change at that time. The findings showed that river morphology in the mounded river section could be successfully reconstructed using OSL dating and sedimentary records and that the conceptual sections of the historical warm periods at 2000 years (2 ka) and 0.7 ka can be recovered. Based on the reconstruction, the calculated bankfull areas during the two warm events were larger than present by factors of 1.28 and 1.9, respectively, indicating a stronger capacity for transporting water and sediments. This is the first trial in the Lancang headwaters to investigate the response of river morphology to climate change on a geological time scale.

Employing the ArcSWAT model, an attempt was made to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the Nicolet River watershed's seasonal and annual streamflow, particularly that portion affected by snowmelt. Calibrated and validated against observed streamflow data for the periods of 1986-1990 and 1991-2000, respectively, the model reliably predicted daily streamflow (e.g., percent bias within +/- 15%, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency > 0.50, and the ratio of root mean square error to the standard deviation <= 0.70). In an effort to investigate the impacts of climate change on streamflow, future climate datasets were generated for 2053-2067 by implementing the eleven sets of existing Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations produced for the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) in the ArcSWAT model. The ArcSWAT model's hydrological responses were closely tied to changes of climate variables: a strong correlation existed between simulated runoff and precipitation, and between temperature and predicted evapotranspiration, snowfall, and winter snowmelt. Projected future climate data showed increases in both average temperature (+2.5 degrees C) and precipitation (+21%). Significant greater total precipitation was forecasted for the winter season, while total snowfall was projected to decrease by 6%. However, the snowmelt showed an increasing trend for the late winter and earlier spring period. Streamflow was expected to increase annually and in most seasons except spring. Annual peak flows volumes would increase by 13% in the future and the occurrence of peak flows would shift to the winter (vs. the spring), indicating a greater risk of winter flooding in the future. The individual impact of temperature and precipitation on peak flows showed that increases in peak flows were mainly tied to increased precipitation, while the shift in their timing was mostly tied to warming temperatures.

Among the many aspects of climate change, one of the most pressing concerns has been identified as the impact on the terrestrial water cycle, which has a direct impact on human settlement and ecosystems. The paper begins by reviewing previous studies, and then identifies their flaws and future research directions. The effects of climate change on surface water resources in the Dhidhessa Sub-basin, Abbay Basin, Ethiopia, were studied as practices. For future potential climate change, the results of global climate models (GCMs) and high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) from multiple climate models were combined with data from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from the CCAFS Data Distribution Center web page. To evaluate the impacts on water resources, various distributed hydrologic models based on local underlying surfaces were developed. The future potential climate change of the Dhidhessa Sub-basin Province was evaluated by integrating RCP outputs, whereas the climate change of the Dhidhessa River was directly derived from the results of different RCP. Dhidhessa stream flow will decrease in the future compared to the baseline era. The predictions of future discharge (stream flow) were based on climate scenarios data from 1991 to 2020 and for the future with two time windows, 2044 (2030-2059) and 2084 (2070-2099), on a monthly time-step after bias correction to both precipitation and temperature in the future climate described in the under each RCP. According to model results, the quantity of surface water resources in the Dhidhessa river region will decrease over the next 100 years, the percent decrease in mean annual stream flow by 10%, in 2044, and 6.3% in 2084, respectively, making the impact of temperature increase on runoff greater than that of precipitation. The distribution of runoff would be more even across years but more uneven across years in the long-term window, implying a higher possibility of drought and flooding. In general, this study discovered that any effect on this river that results in a decrease in flow will have a direct impact on the area's ongoing water resource development and socioeconomic development.

J	Su, QM				Su, Qingmu			Long-term flood risk assessment of watersheds under climate change based on the game cross-efficiency DEA	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Climate scenario simulation; Flood disaster; Risk assessment; Data envelopment analysis	DECISION-MAKING; CHANGE IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY	Climate change has significantly increased extreme precipitation and altered regional hydrological cycle, aggravating flood in the watershed. The effective measurement of the risk brought by climate change is an effective way to cope with flood hazard in the future. At the same time, the quality of the simulation of climate change scenarios will also affect the accuracy of flood risk assessment. Therefore, a comprehensive method is needed to measure the long-term disaster risk. However, the current method of subjectively assigning indicator weights is still subjective and difficult to be promoted and applied. So a new model for assessing watershed risk is constructed in this study. Based on the game cross-efficiency data envelopment analysis method and the combination of simulations of climate scenarios, the model can determine the input factors of the assessment and the influencing level of the input factors by using the Principal Component Analysis and Tobit model. The model comprehensively evaluates the flood risk level in the watershed with the results of the simulation of hazard in different climate scenarios, hazard exposure and social vulnerability as input factors, and the degree of disaster loss as the output factor. Results: (1) the hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability are spatially mismatched; (2) the overall risk in the watershed presents such a pattern: upstream (0.751) > downstream (0.418) > midstream (0.362); (3) the long-term flood hazard may be reduced under the influence of climate change. The research is helpful to formulate long-term flood mitigation strategies in the future.

The influence of climate change on the frequency of ROS events in Japan was investigated using climate projections obtained from the Database for Policy Decision making for Future climate change (d4PDF). The projected future climate in the regional model simulations showed an increase in the ROS events over the mountainous areas in Hokuriku (Sea of Japan side of Central Japan) and Hokkaido (Northern Japan) regions, where a higher amount of snowfall will still occur in the future. Characteristics of ROS events such as rainfall, snowmelt, and related runoff were also enhanced in these regions. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were applied using the surface atmospheric circulation data to determine the dominant ROS-related weather patterns (WPs) in the present and future climate. The SOMs showed that some WPs had a significant effect on the cause of the ROS events. The differences in the impacts of climate change between the WPs were evaluated to understand the future changes in runoff and snowmelt associated with ROS events. The SOM analysis suggests that the increase in the occurrence of ROS events and the resultant enhancement in their characteristics in the future-climate projection can be attributed to the changes in the dominant ROS-related WPs (from cyclonic to cold-surge type) corresponding to variations in the freezing point line. These findings can inform water hazard and water resource management plans that aim to withstand regional climate change.

The results show that the runoff of the watershed has significantly decreased in the past 60 years, in which the contribution rate of climate change is 36.2% and that of human activities is 63.8%. Among the climate change factors, precipitation is the main contributing factor and canal diversion is the main contributing factor among human activities. In addition, with the decrease in precipitation during the flood season and the increase in the crop planting area in the catchment, the distribution of canal water diversion has also changed, and the water consumption of summer crops has gradually become the main factor affecting canal water diversion.

The Health Effects of Climate Change on Children: Pediatricians Must Be Part of the Solution	INDIAN PEDIATRICS			English	Article						Child; Advocacy; Heat; Flood; Air pollution		Climate change is already impacting children's health in a variety of ways. Indian children are among the most severely affected; they are experiencing respiratory illnesses from air pollution, heat-related illnesses, malnutrition, vector- and water-borne diseases; and mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder from weather disasters. There is a need to increase awareness and capacity building among paediatricians for understanding the impact of climate change on the health of children and educating parents about preventive measures. Detailed environmental history taking will help to identify risk factors. To address climate change issues, professional paediatric associations should increase their advocacy with government agencies. It is essential to ask policymakers to immediately reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing the burning of coal and other fossil fuels and moving to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind will reduce India's carbon emissions and decrease environmental illness among children. The pediatricians of India should declare that climate change is a child health emergency.

In this work, we used monitoring data (salinity, sediment and taxa occurrence), simulated saline intrusion and Species Distribution Model to predict the spatial distribution of families in the estuary at two levels of SLR (0.5 m and 1 m) for two scenarios (moderate and extreme). For the simulation, we used the ensemble method applied to five models (MARS, GLM, GAM, RF and BRT). High AUC and TSS values indicated "good" to "excellent" accu-racy. RF and GLM obtained the best and worst values, respectively. The model predicted local extinctions and new colonization in the upper estuarine zones. With the effects of climate change intensifying, it is extremely important that managers consider the use of predictive tools to anticipate the impacts of climate change on a local scale on species migration.

The community's adaptation is more important than before. Community-based adaptation (CBA) is now gaining worldwide attention. Taiwan has promoted disaster prevention communities (DPC) for many years. Although the communities' promotion can increase their capacity to promote efficiency, the top-down job designation may not adequately meet the community's needs. This research aims to establish a community adaptation model and focus on building community adaptation capabilities from the bottom-up due to climate change. We design a community adaptation model that integrated climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). A disaster reduction and climate adaptation (DRCA) risk template was illustrated and adopted in the study. The 2D flooding model using future rainfall simulates the flooding depth for the hazard for it. This information is offered for discussing possible countermeasures with residents during the participatory risk analysis process. An urban laboratory concept is also adopted in this study. The Zutian community, Tucheng District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, a flood-prone community, served as a case study area to illustrate those concepts and tools. The proposed adaptation model could then strengthen the community's resilience to cope with future impacts due to climate change.

The article is premised on the realisation that women and men experience climate change differently, as persisting gendered inequities affect women's adaptive capacity to climate change impacts. The study adopted a qualitative approach to research. Twenty-five local Black African women from four localities in Durban and five key informants from eThekwini municipality participated in the study through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. A qualitative content analysis approach was employed to elicit analytical themes and interpretations from the interview manuscripts in light of the research questions and the study's contexts. Findings from the study show that despite the experiences of poverty, lack of access to information, and persistent gender inequity in the study's contexts, the women's situated knowledge and agency have transformed lives and livelihoods and increased climate resilience and overall well-being. We conclude that a much more appropriate and intentional approach to local Black women's adaptation needs can yield much more effective, successful, equitable, and long-term climate change adaptation.

Among them, special attention is being paid to the low-impact development (LID) technique. This study measured the annual maximum daily rainfall data from 2019 to 2100 by climate change scenario, which is the annual maximum daily rainfall series observed for rainfall stations, and tested the hydrological data using statistical analysis. After determining whether the data could be analyzed, the probability distribution was selected, and the parameters of the selected probability distribution were calculated using the L-moment method for each rainfall station. The probabilities of rainfall data were derived using GEV distribution, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), a runoff simulation program, was used to compare and analyze the runoff reduction rate before and after the installation of a permeable pavement as an LID facility. The results of the analysis showed that representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 had the effect of reducing the runoff for more than 100 years at a 30% reduction rate compared with before installation.

This paper presents an effective methodology that combines two well-known methods to optimize the drainage network design. The methodology uses the Harmony Search algorithm to identify the best solution for the drainage network and the simulations obtained through the Storm Water Management Model to verify the respect of the hydraulic constraints. The methodology is applied to the literature case study of Anytown, showing a significant reduction of 34.5% of the drainage network design cost compared with the common Rational Method. Moreover, the methodology is able to identify the optimum allocation and volumes of detention ponds for runoff control in case of variations in rainfall regime. The methodology allowed to prevent floods, by decreasing the channel filling degree.

Urban policy adaptation toward managing increasing pluvial flooding events under climate change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cloudbursts; pluvial flooding; urban policy; green infrastructure; stormwater	MANAGEMENT; CITIES; RISK	Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events. In urban areas, these cloudbursts cause localized flooding and disrupt urban life. However, there is no universal method for urban rainfall adaptation. Here, we demonstrate that while six developed cities; New York City, Vancouver, Sydney, Auckland, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, each present a different management approach toward cloudburst events, these six cities also use a mixture of five common policy alternatives to manage stormwater runoff. Thus, while individual cities might pursue different management approaches toward pluvial flooding, the repetition of the policy alternatives across these six cities indicates the foundation of a global consensus toward the policy adaptation techniques available. As climate change continues to impact our urban environments, it is important to identify and understand policy tools for effective adaptation, ensuring knowledge can be transferred across all cities facing an unpredictable future.

Therefore, this article discusses water dimensions, security, and governance for these different regions, i.e., non-arid Canada and arid Qatar, that distinctly respond to their water-related challenges. Limitations of the article include lesser water-related literature availability for Qatar than for Canada. Canada's water resources appear vulnerable to climate change as it is projected to face >0.6 degrees C above the global average of 1.6 degrees C for the 20th-century temperature. Qatar is extremely vulnerable to dust storms, and rising sea levels, with the maximum temperature approaching 50 degrees C during the summer, and flooding during the winter. The sustainable use of water resources needs to address social, economic, political, climate change, and environmental dimensions of water. Other than climate change impacts and high per capita consumption of water, Qatar faces challenges of a rise in population (similar to 29 million as of now), acute shortage of freshwater from rainfall (similar to 80 mm per annum), high evapotranspiration (similar to 95% of the total rainfall), depletion of groundwater, and low agricultural productivity due to infertile lands and water scarcity, all leading to food insecurity. The sustainable use of water resources requires improved regulations for water governance and management. Comparisons of water sustainability issues, dimensions, security, and governance facilitate discussions to improve water governance structures for resource sustainability, food security, and climate change adaptability, and show how one country could learn from the experiences of the other.

J	Hussain, W; Khan, MA				Hussain, Wahid; Khan, Muhammad Ammad			Climate change-induced Glacial Lake Outburst Floods in Hunza Valley of Pakistan: an assessment of indigenous farming community perceptions and adaptation	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						Climate change; Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs); Indigenous communities; Awareness; Perceptions; Adaptation	RISK-ASSESSMENT; STRATEGIES; AWARENESS	Climate change is an emerging challenge that is triggering natural variabilities and disasters globally. In Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) region of Pakistan, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) have been occurring frequently due to glacier surges, increasing the vulnerability of mountain communities, particularly small farmers. This research aims to investigate the climate change-induced GLOFs of the Shishper glacier in Hunza valley of GB with the intent of studying the farming activities; local awareness and perceptions toward climate change; impacts of climate change and GLOFs on agriculture; and adaptation mechanisms based on indigenous knowledge. Mixed-methods research approach was employed for a field survey in two villages inhabited by farmers of the Burusho community. Quantitative data were gathered from a sample of 180 respondents by using a structured questionnaire, whereas field observation coupled with photography and spot interviews were undertaken to accumulate qualitative data. Results revealed that many farmers lost their fertile land, and their crops and fruit orchards were severely damaged as a result of the devastating effects of climate change and recent GLOFs in 2019 and 2020, resulting in low crop yield and agricultural income. Local communities typically respond to GLOFs through self-help strategies and indigenous methods to sustain their livelihoods. However, our findings suggest that current adaptation practices are insufficient in light of rising climate risks. Thus, there is an urgent need to assist mountain communities by providing maximum support and interventions to enhance their resilience to future GLOFs and to increase people's adaptive capacity by strengthening their socioeconomic conditions.

In this study, we focused on environmental changes, that is, natural disasters and human activities, in the Poyang Lake Basin over the past 2000 years, to analyze interactions between land use cover changes and human activities from the perspective of regional sustainable development. We collected historical records of climate and hydrology, floods and droughts, and rivers and lakes in the Poyang Lake area, and established time sequences for the floods and droughts, lake water level and lake area, amount of farming land, and population, in order to discuss interactions between changes in the environment and the climate, with emphasis on the impacts of extreme events on lake and river basin environment changes. The following results were obtained. First, climate changes in historical periods had wide-ranging and far-reaching impacts on agricultural production, especially disasters caused by climate change. Among the changes in the Poyang Lake basin environment, including river network systems, lake water levels, etc., changes in lake water volume are direct evidence of climate change, adaptation to climate change, and obvious phased characteristics. Second, in the process of changes to the lake and river network in the Poyang Lake Basin, social and economic development is accompanied by evolution of the lake. Increases and decreases in population, the scale of agricultural production, and lake environment changes have direct and significant interactions. Third, the Poyang Lake basin's environmental changes during the historical period are mainly reflected in the pressure feedback mode of "population-agriculture" in the lake environment.

Impacts of climate change and adaptations in shrimp aquaculture: A study in coastal Andhra Pradesh, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coastal area; inland area; Shrimp farming; climate change impact index; production loss; economic risk rating; adaptation measures	TEMPERATURE; RAINFALL; GROWTH; TRENDS	Shrimp aquaculture in India is synonymous with coastal aquaculture. Like other agricultural activities, it appropriates a wide range of environmental goods and services, and is vulnerable to impacts of climate change as the cultured animals are sensitive to various kinds of biotic and abiotic stressors. Climate change affects the shrimp aquaculture directly by extreme weather events and seasonal variations, and indirectly alter the primary and secondary productivity, structure and composition of the ecosystems or by influencing the availability of fishmeal, fish oil and other goods and services required for aquaculture farmers. The perceptions of farmers on the impacts of climate change on shrimp aquaculture in inland and coastal areas of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh are discussed. Cyclone and flood were perceived by all the farmers, whereas irregular season, high temperature, heavy rain and drought were perceived by 79, 89, 91 and 5 % of farmers, respectively. Environmental, biological, and economic impacts of climate change drivers on aquaculture indicated 20 to 30 % loss due to seasonal variations and 50 to 100% loss due to extremely heavy rainfall, flood and cyclones. The economic risk rating was high with flood followed by the cyclone and the magnitude was more in coastal areas compared to inland areas. There is no universally applicable list of adaptation measures and need to be evaluated for individual aquaculture systems. Autonomous and planned adaptation measures to be implemented by farmers, researchers and policymakers are discussed for climate-resilient aquaculture. Planned adaptive measures are either at the primary level or non-existence, hence policy initiatives are required to formulate planned adaptive measures to enhance the adaptive capacity of the farmers.

Environmental Change Perception and Engagement of Mountain-Dwelling People in the Western Himalayas, at Rajouri District, Jammu and Kashmir, India	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Atmosphere; Ecology; Social Science; Asia; Land surface; Climate change; Climate variability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; METEOROLOGICAL DATA; FARMER PERCEPTIONS; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; REGION; ADAPTATION; IMPACT; FLOODS	Substantial temperature rise is reported in the Himalayas, and the vulnerability of the region to climate change is well recognized. An apt adaptation strategy to cope with climate change calls for informed people's participation, which was rarely investigated in the western Himalayas. Having been better informed, people in developed areas adopt better actions against climate change that are well guided by their perception. In contrast, Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir represents a relatively impoverished and climate change-vulnerable region. Therefore, we gauged people's perceptions and actions in this area from a household survey from 717 randomly selected individuals. Further, consistency of perception was compared with meteorological records on temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and aboveground biomass from 1983 to 2013. The findings revealed that temperature increased significantly while changes in rainfall, wind speed, and relative humidity were insignificant. Although people sensed a rise in temperature and deforestation correctly, most of them differ with respect to rainfall, wind speed, and humidity. They reported rising pollution and traffic but no change in crop productivity or crop varieties. Of the respondents, 91% considered climate change as a risk, 86.8% reported reactive actions to it, and 82.8% reported proactive actions. Locals from varied socioeconomic backgrounds are not much informed about climate change; hence, the reasonability of their responses and positive adaptation actions needs further research. To engage people in climate adaptation actions, we suggest disseminating precise scientific information about local climate through awareness programs and by engaging them in climate change activities through suitable organizations.

Climate change: how it impacts the emergence, transmission, resistance and consequences of viral infections in animals and plants	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Climate change; viral diseases; industrialization; global warming; reservoirs and vectors	PUBLIC-HEALTH; VECTOR-BORNE; VIRUS; DISEASES; TEMPERATURE; SCENARIOS; DROUGHT; STRESS; BATS	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made us wonder what led to its occurrence and what can be done to avoid such events in the future. As we document, one changing circumstance that is resulting in the emergence and changing the expression of viral diseases in both plants and animals is climate change. Of note, the rapidly changing environment and weather conditions such as excessive flooding, droughts, and forest fires have raised concerns about the global ecosystem's security, sustainability, and balance. In this review, we discuss the main consequences of climate change and link these to how they impact the appearance of new viral pathogens, how they may facilitate transmission between usual and novel hosts, and how they may also affect the host's ability to manage the infection. We emphasize how changes in temperature and humidity and other events associated with climate change influence the reservoirs of viral infections, their transmission by insects and other intermediates, their survival outside the host as well the success of infection in plants and animals. We conclude that climate change has mainly detrimental consequences for the emergence, transmission, and outcome of viral infections and plead the case for halting and hopefully reversing this dangerous event.

However, global health systems are inadequately prepared to address this issue. Studies indicate that climate events such as floods, droughts, tornados, earthquakes, and fires not only exacerbate chronic mental illness, but also impact well-being causing anxiety, stress, and in the worst case, suicide. The World Health Organization estimates that 12.6 million preventable deaths per year can be attributed to environmental factors, all of which are exacerbated by climate change, and an additional 250,000 deaths per year are projected between 2030 and 2050. Nurses must advocate for research, education, and policies that support disaster-resilient infrastructure and human services that allow communities across the globe to effectively mitigate the impact of climate change on human health.

A mixed-method approach has been used in this study. The results reveal that increasing the frequency of flooding, severity of riverbank erosion and drought, and rising disease outbreak are the highest indicators of climate change perceived by riverine island (char) dwellers, which is similar to the observed data. It also uncovers, approximately all respondents encounter several health-related issues during different seasons where prevailing cold and cough with fever, skin diseases, and diarrhoea are the leading ailments. Several adaptation strategies are accommodated by char inhabitants in order to enhance resilience against the climate change health impacts, but the paucity of money, disrupted communication, lack of formal health-care centre are the most obstacles to the sustainability of adaptation. This research recommends that healthcare-associated project should be performed through proper monitoring for exterminating char dwellers' health issues.

Thus, many Indians share the sense of urgency that Greta Thunberg exhibits when she demands that nations make stronger commitments to limit carbon emissions. India's monsoon-dependent agriculture is highly vulnerable to any change in weather patterns, but the land irrigated by groundwater is also threatened. The projected rise in annual peak temperatures, similar to those now experienced only in the earth's hottest micro-climates, could make it nearly impossible for humans to engage in agriculture in India and several other parts of the world. Climate change affects yields of crops, livestock, dairy, and fisheries. Rising temperatures, increased frequency of flooding, and other hazards associated with climate change will reduce food production. Even a slight drop in food output can have a dramatic effect on food prices, both locally and globally. Rice farming, particularly in the rain-fed regions, faces multiple risks from uncertain climate, degraded soil, water deficits, and underdeveloped markets. Loss of biodiversity is also a threat to agriculture in India, and it is also affected by climate change.

Subsurface ecosystems, the earth largest reservoir of liquid freshwater, currently experience a significant increase in temperature and serious consequences from extreme hydrological events. Extended droughts as well as heavy rains and floods have measurable impacts on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, the growing water demand puts increasing pressure on the already vulnerable groundwater ecosystems. Global change induces undesired dynamics in the typically nutrient and energy poor aquifers that are home to a diverse and specialized microbiome and fauna. Current and future changes in subsurface environmental conditions, without doubt, alter the composition of communities, as well as important ecosystem functions, for instance the cycling of elements such as carbon and nitrogen. A key role is played by the microbes. Understanding the interplay of biotic and abiotic drivers in subterranean ecosystems is required to anticipate future effects of climate change on groundwater resources and habitats. This review summarizes potential threats to groundwater ecosystems with emphasis on climate change and the microbial world down below our feet in the water saturated subsurface.

J	Weaver, S; Bakhmetyeva, T; Rinn, DW				Weaver, Stewart; Bakhmetyeva, Tatyana; Rinn, Daniel Wayne			Climate Witness: Oral Environmental History and Community-Based Research-A Case Study from Trans-Himalayan India	ORAL HISTORY REVIEW			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; community-based participatory research; environmental history; India; Ladakh; resilience		On August 5, 2010, a violent cloudburst dumped fourteen inches of rain on Ladakh, a mountain desert region in the far north of India accustomed to getting just three inches of rain in a year. Five years later, flooding recurred on a wider scale, destroying buildings, roads, fields, and orchards all over Ladakh and provoking a wide-ranging discussion among locals about the causes of climate catastrophe. In this essay, we attend to those local voices and allow the people of Ladakh to speak for themselves about the causes and consequences of climate change as well as the best forms of climate change adaptation in the trans-Himalayan region. We offer a two-year progress report on our ongoing oral history fieldwork in this unique and ecologically sensitive high desert region. At the same time, we offer some reflections on the discipline of oral history itself and the promise it offers in conjunction with community engagement to the study of climate change. The surprising fact remains that despite much recent and inspiring work at the compelling intersection of oral and environmental history, few oral historians have taken on directly the subject of climate change, and those who have tend to dwell on the specific experience of the American West. Here we join those few oral and environmental historians who are approaching climate change by way of global community engagement. Only by way of such engagement, we argue-only by following the best practices of what has come to be known as community-based participatory research, can oral history fulfill its public mission as we understand it and contribute decisively to the humanistic study of the Anthropocene.

Mycotoxins are a group of naturally occurring toxic substances produced by several genera of filamentous fungi, among which, primarily aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes and zearalenone are of the greatest concern owing to their negative impact on human health, animal productivity and international trade. Results Extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts which have not occurred previously in Serbia may be supporting factors for contamination of crops by various species of toxigenic fungi and their related mycotoxins. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analyses were used as powerful tools allowing better understanding of the range of climate factors impacting on crop contamination by mycotoxins. Among the selected environmental variables, temperature and moisture significantly influenced aflatoxin production. Recent drought and then flooding confirmed that Serbia is one of the few European countries with very high risk exposure to natural hazards, as well as that mycotoxins are one of the foodborne hazards most susceptible to climate change. Thus climate change effects on mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin contamination are now receiving scientific attention, especially from a risk analysis perspective. Conclusion This paper evaluates the available information on the influence of climate change on mycotoxin contamination, especially aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). In addition, this investigation should beneficially contribute to more accurate predictions of the regional risk from mycotoxins in future decades.

This study aims to detect and compare differences in the climatological characteristics in response to climate change in arid and humid areas. Based on the CN05.1 reanalysis gridded dataset (high-resolution climate model validation launched by China Meteorological Administration) and output from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), the projected responses of temperature and precipitation to climate change under three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) in the arid basin (the Tarim River Basin, the TRB) and the humid basin (the Yangtze River Basin, the YRB) were characterized. Our results show that the swings of annual temperature and precipitation will extend with the rising emission scenarios in the future, while those are more vulnerable in the TRB. The topography-related changes of temperature and precipitation were further evaluated to explore the uncertainty. The elevation-dependent warming (EDW) may be weakened but still hold in the future at the watershed scale. Change in precipitation will decrease with increase in elevation in the TRB, while it will increase in the YRB. Compared with the general growth in seasonal temperature, precipitation shows more striking changes during spring and winter under climate change. Further researches to improve our understanding of the projected changes in temperature and precipitation are needed for better prediction of extreme weather conditions, such as drought and floods.

According to the 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 70% of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods have been water-related in the last 15 years. Since the climate change processes are speeding up, this percentage is expected to increase. A plethora of researchers have been working on the correlation between water scarcity and climate change. The purpose of this paper is to examine the published research dealing with water scarcity and climate. Therefore, the study carries out a scoping review (SR) via text data mining and reveals the related topics. Two kinds of analysis were carried out using IRaMuTeQ software: descriptive analysis (TTR, Giraud index, Herdan index and Zipf's curve) and cluster analysis (Reinert's method). The results show that the topic of water scarcity refers to the direct and indirect economic impacts on its availability for irrigation, the willingness to pay more for an irrigation water supply and the role of public institutions in "achieving sustainable development goals". The conclusion of the paper highlights the role of this analysis for developing future research and identifies implications for theory, practice and policy in order to overcome the current global challenges related to water scarcity and climate change.

The combined effect of LULC and climate change is of great importance for effective water resources planning and management. This study assessed the hydrological impact of long-term implementation of integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system with the projected climate scenarios on water yield using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model over two time periods (i.e., near future [2021-2050] and far future [2070-2099]). This study was conducted in three phases over Skunk Creek watershed (SCW), South Dakota. In phase I, the impact of long-term ICL system implementation (1976-2005; 30 years) on soil hydrology was evaluated. Phase II and phase III evaluated the impacts of projected climate changes under existing land cover and ICL system, respectively. Outcomes of phase I showed a significant decrease in water yield and surface runoff. Phase II showed the susceptibility of SCW to extreme events such as floods and waterlogging during spring, and droughts during summers under the projected climate changes. Phase III showed the reduction in water yield and surface runoff due to the ICL system and minimizing the induced detrimental impacts only due to climate change. This study provides a perspective on the possible impacts of the ICL system to mitigate the hydrological alteration due to climate change.

In 2019, around 25 million new displacements occurred due to natural disasters. This review aims to summarize the existing evidence regarding the impact of climate change on the health of African immigrants. Methods: Nine databases were systematically searched using a strategy developed in collaboration with a subject librarian. Potentially relevant articles were identified, screened, and reviewed by at least two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving conflicts where necessary. Data were extracted from relevant articles using a standardized form. Results: Seven studies (three cross-sectional, two qualitative, one cohort, and one need assessment report) were identified; they included different categories of African migrants and reported on various aspects of health. The included articles report on climate change, e.g., flooding, drought, and excess heat, resulting in respiratory illness, mental health issues, malnutrition, and premature mortality among African immigrants.

Understanding the Contributions of Paleo-Informed Natural Variability and Climate Changes to Hydroclimate Extremes in the San Joaquin Valley of California	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						natural variability; climate change; variance decomposition; drought; multi-hazard assessment; flood	CHANGE IMPACTS; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; FLOOD FREQUENCY; LARGE ENSEMBLES; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; PROJECTION; HYDROLOGY	To aid California's water sector to better understand and manage future climate extremes, we present a method for creating a regionally consistent ensemble of plausible daily future climate and streamflow scenarios that represent natural climate variability captured in a network of tree-ring chronologies, and then embed anthropogenic climate change trends within those scenarios. We use 600 years of paleo-reconstructed weather regimes to force a stochastic weather generator, which we develop for five subbasins in the San Joaquin Valley of California. To assess the compound effects of climate change, we create temperature series that reflect projected scenarios of warming and precipitation series that have been scaled to reflect thermodynamically driven shifts in the distribution of daily precipitation. We then use these weather scenarios to force hydrologic models for each of the five subbasins. The paleo-forced streamflow scenarios highlight periods in the region's past that produce flood and drought extremes that surpass those in the modern record and exhibit large non-stationarity through the reconstruction. Variance decomposition is employed to characterize the contribution of natural variability and climate change to variability in decision-relevant metrics related to floods and drought. Our results show that a large portion of variability in individual subbasin and spatially compounding extreme events can be attributed to natural variability, but that anthropogenic climate changes become more influential at longer planning horizons. The joint importance of climate change and natural variability in shaping extreme floods and droughts is critical to resilient water systems planning and management in the San Joaquin.

This study predicts areas with a high probability of flooding in coastal areas of South Korea owing to future climate change, which is likely to cause extreme rainfall and sea-level rise, using a spatiotemporal downscaled future climate change scenario with random forest, artificial neural network, and k-nearest neighbor techniques. In addition, the change in coastal flooding risk probability according to the application of different adaptation strategies (green spaces and seawalls) was identified. The results showed a clear difference in the risk probability distribution in the absence and presence of either adaptation strategy. Their effectiveness in moderating future flooding risks is subject to change owing to strategy type, geographic region, and urbanization intensity and the results show that green spaces are slightly more effective than seawalls when forecasting for 2050. This demonstrates the importance of a nature-based strategy. Moreover, this study highlights the need to prepare adaptation measures according to regional characteristics to mitigate the impact of climate change. Korea is surrounded by seas on three sides that have independent geophysical and climate characteristics. The south coast has a higher risk of coastal flooding than the east and west coasts. In addition, a higher urbanization rate is associated with a higher risk probability. This implies that climate change response strategies for coastal cities are necessary as the population and socioeconomic activities of coastal urban areas are likely to increase in the future.

Climate change affects ecosystem services and interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. The most drastic consequences have been observed in the agricultural and livestock sector, with diminished production and productivity potential. Agriculture and allied sectors contribute markedly to the production of greenhouse gases; however, integrated management practices can be used to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and its adverse impacts. Forage crops and their wild relatives maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services and minimise the drastic effects of climate change. Forage crops adapted to harsh environments have certain unique features such as perenniality, deep root system, high resource-use efficiency (light, nutrients and water), and low production of methane and N2O, making them suitable for future use under climate change. This review highlights the prominent features of various cultivated and rangeland forage crops that may be crucial to understanding impacts of climate change. We discuss the wild relatives of forage crops, which are often adapted for multiple stresses, and highlight their mechanisms for adaptation under climate change. We consider the advanced breeding and biotechnological tools useful for developing climate-smart forage crops. This review provides novel insight into forage crops and their wild relatives in terms of their exploitation in future stress breeding programmes and paths for developing climate-resilient crops.

Design floods and derived flood frequency curves obtained using event-based rainfall-runoff models are widely used in industry to assess flood risks for planning and design purposes. For these approaches it is necessary to have (a) rainfall inputs, and (b) rainfall losses specified, the latter representing the amount of rainfall that is either intercepted, stored on the surface, or infiltrated into the soil and does not contribute to the flood hydrograph. There is extensive research on changes in flooding under climate change that focus on pro-jections of rainfall. However, there is little research into projections of rainfall losses under climate change, despite the knowledge that their changes will modulate the flood response. Here, we present one of the first studies seeking to quantify how rainfall losses, as represented by estimates of initial and continuing losses used in event-based models, are projected to change under climate change. We identify dependencies between rainfall losses and antecedent soil moisture in around half (over 200) of the largely unregulated catchments (i.e. watersheds) in Australia analysed in this study and use these relationships to project rainfall losses under climate change. Near universal increases in both the mean and variance of both initial losses and continuing losses are projected in these catchments, suggesting that increased rainfall losses could offset the impact of increased rainfalls for frequently occurring floods and result in an increased variance in flood responses.

The future (i.e., the mid and late 21st century) climate is projected to result in increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events, which could negatively affect the hydroecological function of the wetlands. Wetland management practices have commonly been implemented to protect wetlands and their functions, but it is not clear whether the current management practices can still be effective in projected climate change scenarios. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the runoff and total phosphorus (TP) of natural (L28 Gap) and managed (L28) wetland watersheds in the Western Everglades. For the assessment, we employed future climate projections made using 29 general circulation models (GCMs) and the Watershed Assessment Model (WAM), a watershed loading model. The WAM was calibrated and validated for the baseline period (2000-2014), and the bias-corrected climate projections were incorporated into the model to project the runoff discharge and TP loads for the near-future (2030-2044) and far-future (2070-2084) periods in two carbon emission scenarios. The modeling results show that the natural wetland watershed would be more vulnerable to projected climate change than the managed wetland watershed. The impact of projected climate change scenarios on daily runoff and TP loads was modulated by water control facilities and practices in the managed watershed, highlighting the significance of watershed management practices for improved water quality under projected climate change. This study demonstrates how the local natural and managed wetland watersheds distinctly respond to the global-scale changes and emphasizes the role of water management practices in wetland basins, which are expected to help develop effective climate change adaptation plans for improved sustainability of wetland systems.

A semi-structured questionnaire was adopted from the existing literature, it was divided into different parts such as demographic information, use of wastewater for irrigation, farmer's livelihood assets, climate change deciding factors, and adaptation measures, and some statistical tools (correlation and regression) were used to analyze the data. The farmers with enough resources and assets regarded themselves as safer and have enough capacity to bear the negative impacts of climate change. Farmers' assets (FA) with determinants of climate change (DCC) and adaption measures (AM) are highly significant with the correlation values of 0.440 and 0.466, respectively, and DCC with AM (0.269). The correlation values for other variables are: gender with cultivated land 0.202, wastewater use (WWU) 0.419, farmers' assets (FA) 0.766, determinants of climate change (DCC) 0.381, and adaption measures (AM) 0.449. Floods and droughts variables have shown a significant relationship with adaption measures at p-value 0.000 and coefficient 0.176 and p-value 0.021 and coefficient 0.063, respectively. The study will aid in the implementation of effective monitoring and public policies to promote integrated and sustainable water development.

J	Obringer, R; Nateghi, R				Obringer, Renee; Nateghi, Roshanak			What makes a city 'smart' in the Anthropocene? A critical review of smart cities under climate change	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Review						Smart cities; Climate change; Critical infrastructure; Urban resilience; Sustainable development	BIG DATA; RESILIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; IMPACTS; CHALLENGES; TRENDS; TRANSFORMATION; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT	In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communi-cation technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustain-ability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastruc-ture, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.

J	Eccles, R; Zhang, H; Hamilton, D				Eccles, Rohan; Zhang, Hong; Hamilton, David			A review of the effects of climate change on riverine flooding in subtropical and tropical regions	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						climate change; climate projection; extreme weather; flooding; subtropical; tropical	CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT; CHAO-PHRAYA RIVER; LAND-USE CHANGES; WATER-RESOURCES; HYDROLOGICAL EXTREMES; BIAS CORRECTION; FUTURE CLIMATE; UNCERTAINTY SOURCES; DEGREES-C; SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGE	Tropical and subtropical regions can be particularly severely affected by flooding. Climate change is expected to lead to more intense precipitation in many regions of the world, increasing the frequency and magnitude of flood events. This paper presents a review of studies assessing the impacts of climate change on riverine flooding in the world's tropical and subtropical regions. A systematic quantitative approach was used to evaluate the literature. The majority of studies reported increases in flooding under climate change, with the most consistent increases predicted for South Asia, South East Asia, and the western Amazon. Results were more varied for Latin America and Africa where there was a notable paucity of studies. Our review points to the need for further studies in these regions as well as in Australia, in small to mid-sized catchments, and in rapidly urbanising catchments in the developing world. Adoption of non-stationary flood analysis techniques and improved site-specific socio-economic and environmental model scenarios were identified as important future directions for research. Data accessibility and mitigation of model uncertainty were recognised as the principal issues faced by researchers investigating the impacts of climate change on tropical and subtropical rivers.

J	Wu, T; Barrett, J				Wu, Tao; Barrett, Juliana			Coastal Land Use Management Methodologies under Pressure from Climate Change and Population Growth	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Land use change; Climate change; Resilience; Adaptive management; Social-ecological system	HURRICANE DAMAGE; RESILIENCE	Throughout history, humans living in the coastal area constantly adapt to the natural environment and create a changing environment. The rapid coastal development occurred in the mid-19th century and peaks in the mid-20th century, which was a common process in most industrialized areas. With increasing population growth and urban sprawl, many coastal lowlands are unprecedently vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea level rise, increasing extreme storm events, and coastal flooding. Under the influence of urban revitalization and conservation, the landward shoreline movement accelerated and coastal land shrank, accompanied by community retreat. This research focuses on the importance of incorporating an understanding of the changing coastal land-ocean interaction into adaptive management strategies by illustrating the relationship of land use change, social-economic development, and climate change. Typical coastal changes in Connecticut were selected: New Haven Harbor reflects a dramatic seaward land accretion under industrial and transportation development, New London downtown waterfront reveals a trend of building retreat under industrial and commercial transformation and coastal hazard, New London Ocean Beach indicates how overdeveloped coastal low-lying community fully retreat after a natural disaster, and Jordan Cove barrier island shows a highly dynamic coastal land change and proactive management strategy. The results reveal that to cope with a constantly changing shoreline and the challenges of climate change, a resilient management process must incorporate a cycle of learning, experimenting, and creating with the goal of developing new solutions that are able to deal with our ever-changing environment.

Examine climate change and variability and determinant factors of adaptation to ensure household food security in Basona Worena District, central highland of Ethiopia. Data were collected from the randomly selected 138 sample households, key informants and National Meteorological Agency. Rainfall and temperature trend and variability were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and Precipitation Concentration Index. Household food security was determined using Household Food Insecurity Access Scale and Food Consumption Score. Moreover, Tobit Model was used to examine climate change and variability adaptation options, while ordered logistic regression was employed to examine the contribution of climate change and variability adaptation to household food security status from the food consumption dimension. In the study site, an increasing minimum and maximum temperatures and decreasing and variable annual and spring season rainfalls were observed. The site has experienced recurrent drought for the last 35 years (1981-2016). Farmers were practicing biophysical soil and water conservation technologies, agro-forestry, small scale irrigation, livelihood diversification, and growing of high yielding and drought resistant crop varieties. The study identified that extension advisory services, access to training, farm size, sex, frequency of flood, and access to credit determine farmers' climate change and variability adaptation options. HFIAS and FCS analysis shows that food insecurity is high in the study site. Household food security status was influenced by climate variability and limited adaptation responses. The study suggests the implementation of feasible soil and water conservation, and livelihood diversification intervention to ensure household food security.

Uncertainties in General Circulation Models' (GCM) rainfall projections and seamless long-term hydrological simulations incorporating warming effects are major scientific challenges in assessing climate change impacts at the basin scale. Therefore, the Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS) of Japan and the Water Energy Budget-based Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation model (WEB-RRI) were utilized to develop an integrated approach, which was then applied to the Mahaweli River Basin (MRB) in Sri Lanka to investigate climate change impacts on its hydro-meteorological characteristics. The results for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) scenario from four selected GCMs showed that, with an average temperature increase of 1.1 degrees C over the 20 years in future (2026 to 2045), the basin will experience more extreme rainfall (increase ranging 204 to 476 mm/year) and intense flood disasters and receive sufficient water in the future climate (inflow increases will range between 11 m(3)/s to 57 m(3)/s). The socio-economic damage due to flood inundation will also increase in the future climate. However, qualitatively, the overall trend of model responses showed an increasing pattern in future meteorological droughts whereas there is uncertainty in hydrological droughts. Policymakers can utilize these results and react to implementing soft or hard countermeasures for future policymaking. The approach can be implemented for climate change impact assessment of hydro-meteorology in any other river basin worldwide.

Explaining the Spatial Pattern of US Extreme Daily Precipitation Change	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Climate records; Climate models; Climate change; Extreme events; Precipitation	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; EL-NINO-LIKE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; PACIFIC-OCEAN; UNITED-STATES; FLOOD RISK; CLIMATE; ATTRIBUTION; TRENDS; MODEL	Observed United States trends in the annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) over the last century consist of 15%-25% increases over the eastern United States (East) and 10% decreases over the far western United States (West). This heterogeneous trend pattern departs from comparatively uniform observed increases in precipitable water over the contiguous United States. Here we use an event attribution framework involving parallel sets of global atmospheric model experiments with and without climate change drivers to explain this spatially diverse pattern of extreme daily precipitation trends. We find that RX1day events in our model ensembles respond to observed historical climate change forcing differently across the United States with 5%-10% intensity increases over the East but no appreciable change over the West. This spatially diverse forced signal is broadly similar among three models used, and is positively correlated with the observed trend pattern. Our analysis of model and observations indicates the lack of appreciable RX1day signals over the West is likely due to dynamical effects of climate change forcing-via a wintertime atmospheric circulation anomaly that suppresses vertical motion over the West-largely cancelling thermodynamic effects of increased water vapor availability. The large magnitude of eastern U.S. RX1day increases is unlikely a symptom of a regional heightened sensitivity to climate change forcing. Instead, our ensemble simulations reveal considerable variability in RX1day trend magnitudes arising from internal atmospheric processes alone, and we argue that the remarkable observed increases over the East has most likely resulted from a superposition of strong internal variability with a moderate climate change signal. Implications for future changes in U.S. extreme daily precipitation are discussed.

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Urban flooding; Climate change; Water sensitive urban design; Integrated stormwater management	CHANGE IMPACTS; URBANIZATION; PRECIPITATION; FUTURE; TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS; AREAS	Impacts of Climate Change on rainfall is shown to increase the risk of flooding in urban areas with high population densities, creating a higher threat to loss of life and damage to property. Integrating stormwater management elements such as storage structures, infiltration and other water sensitive design features into the urban landscape is an increasing trend to adapt to the higher flood threat. Evaluating the effectiveness of these stormwater management features is increasingly more valuable as we try to balance the need for livable space and provide a safe environment within the developed areas and major cities globally. This study looks at two different urban catchments with and without stormwater management features to evaluate how well each catchment can absorb the impacts of climate change on flooding. Results from our analysis shows that sequentially placed storage structures are significantly effective in absorbing the more intense rainfall events expected in a warmer climate. We compare the ratio of total rainfall volume to the volume of flow leaving each of the catchments as an indicator of how well each catchment is able to absorb the impacts of climate change and find that there is approximately a 20-fold decrease in the ratio in the catchment with stormwater management for the future climate conditions. For this study temperature-based scaling is used to account for climate change impacts on rainfall and we use hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to characterize and evaluate the responses of each catchment.

Adaptation to its impacts ought to be a key focus for planning and policymaking in highly vulnerable countries like Australia. This responsibility, however, has been largely left to local councils with mixed results. This leaves substantial parts of the population at risk where adaptation plans are lacking. Even worse, since the impacts of climate change do not respect jurisdictional boundaries, there is a spill-over risk where good adaptation planning by one council may be undermined by the lack of action in an adjacent council. These risks can be reduced if state and federal governments provide more consistent support and guidance. This paper takes an integrated approach in comparing the relevant legislation, policies, plans, and strategies related to coastal management across the national and state/territory jurisdictions in Australia. The findings indicate that there are major differences, with some states (South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland) having more detailed policies and plans for addressing sea level rise and coastal flooding. The findings have implications beyond Australia, particularly for those countries with more devolved or federal systems of government, and provide key lessons for adaptation to climate change. Key policy insights In the absence of national guidance and leadership, climate adaptation responses will remain uneven across jurisdictions placing more of the population at risk and undermining what adaptation plans there are. National, state, and territory policies or plans are more effective if they are consistent over time, but they are undermined by reversals when governments change between political parties that have widely varying views on climate change. Effective long-term adaptation policymaking and planning therefore require a bipartisan commitment and consistent political will across the major political parties to prioritize the problem and commit significant public resources to a response.

Pakistan's geographical nature makes it susceptible to natural hazards. Pakistan is facing regional differences in terms of climate change. The frequency and intensity of natural hazards due to climate change vary from place to place. There is an urgent need to recognize the spatial variations in natural hazards inside the country. To address such problems, it might be useful to map out the areas that need resources to increase resilience and accomplish adaptability. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to create a district-level map that illustrates the multi-hazard zones of various regions in Pakistan. In order to comprehend the geographical differences in climate change and natural hazards across Pakistan, this study examines the relevant literature and data currently available regarding the occurrence of natural hazards in the past. Firstly, a district-level comprehensive database of Pakistan's five natural hazards (floods, droughts, earthquakes, heatwaves, and landslides) was created. Through consultation with specialists in related areas, hazard and weighting factors for a specific hazard were specified based on the structured district-level historical disaster database of Pakistan. After that, individual and multi-hazard ratings were computed for each district. Then, using estimated multi-hazard scores, the districts of Pakistan were classified into four zones. Finally, a map of Pakistan's multi-hazard zones was created per district. The study results are essential and significant for policymakers to consider when making decisions on disaster management techniques, that is, when organizing disaster preparedness, mitigation, and prevention plans.

Using a space-for-time substitution approach to predict the effects of climate change on nutrient cycling in tropical island stream ecosystems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; LIFE-HISTORY; BODY-SIZE; RAINFALL; CONSUMER; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; FISH; PRECIPITATION; RESPONSES	Climate change is expected to alter precipitation patterns worldwide, which can have direct effects on streamflow dynamics. In many tropical regions, climate-driven changes in rainfall are predicted to decrease streamflow and increase flash flooding, but the implications of these changes for stream ecosystem function are poorly understood. We used a rainfall gradient on Hawaii Island that mimics projected changes in rainfall and streamflow in order to estimate how climate change affects nutrient recycling. We measured per-capita excretion (nitrogen, phosphorus) and egestion rates of three dominant taxa (shrimp, caddisfly, midge) in eight streams along the gradient for 3 years. We scaled these rates to the population and community levels and measured nitrogen and phosphorus demand of the ecosystem to estimate if the relative contribution of nutrients supplied by invertebrates changes along the gradient. Across all three taxa, population egestion and excretion rates declined by 10-fold in drier streams. These declines were driven by lower population density, rather than differences in per-capita rates. Under the current climate scenario, community excretion supplied up to 70% of the nitrogen demand, which was 10-fold lower with projected changes in rainfall. Conversely, community excretion supplied up to 5% of the phosphorus demand, which did not vary across the rainfall gradient. This difference indicates that climate change may exacerbate nitrogen limitations in tropical island streams, and change the balance of nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics. Our study also demonstrates that space-for-time substitutions are a valuable tool to examine implications of climate change on ecosystem function in freshwater systems.

However, in practice, few empirical studies have been done on the influence of livestock insurance on the household resilience of livestock herders to climate change. We advanced knowledge in this area by: a) estimating household resilience to climate change and identifying the typology of livestock herders in terms of resilience; b) assessing the influence of livestock insurance on the household resilience of livestock herders. Population of this survey research were all livestock herder households from 11 rural areas in Kermanshah County in the west of Iran. A proportional stratified random sampling technique was used for selecting 250 livestock herder households. Livestock herders were interviewed individually through a questionnaire. Cluster analysis indicated that the sample households were heterogeneous in terms of resilience and can be divided into three categories of low, medium and high resilient households. These households were also different in terms of average livestock insurance. Hierarchical regression analysis confirmed that number of insured livestock and perception of the livestock insurance services are the significant determinants of household resilience of livestock herders to climate change. Even though, income, livestock ownership and climate change perception were also other predictors of household resilience of livestock herders. Findings of this study will be helpful for policymakers, managers and insurance companies to pursue cost-effective insurance policies for building adaptation and resilience capacity to climate disasters among livestock herders.

Climate migration brings many accompanying problems to the environment, economy, politics, society, and culture. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the internal relationship between climate change and population migration. MethodsThe data were extracted from the Web of Science core collection database (WOS) and China Knowledge Network database (CNKI). A total of 785 documents and 157 documents in the field of climate migration from 2008 to 2021 were selected as analysis samples. Word frequency analysis, clustering analysis, sudden word detection analysis, and other methods were extensively used to build the evolution trend map of climate migration using CiteSpace visual bibliometric software. ResultsIt is concluded that climate migration research has experienced three stages of development: initial exploration stage (2008-2011), development enrichment stage (2012-2017), and system deepening stage (2018).The hot topics of climate migration include: (1) different types of climate migration research; (2) Quantitative model research on climate migration; (3) Climate justice research. Different types of climate migration include 7 main types: (1) migration caused by sea level rise; (2) Resettlement caused by flood disaster; (3) Migration due to worsening drought; (4) Migration caused by extreme climate events; (5) Voluntary migration due to climate change discomfort; (6) Project resettlement caused by climate change response engineering measures; (7) Migrants whose livelihoods are broken due to climate change. DiscussionThe study points out that climate migration research is an interdisciplinary research field, which needs joint research by scholars from different academic backgrounds. In the future climate migration research, 1) strengthen the prediction ability of climate change population migration model; 2) Make use of China's beneficial exploration in the migration fields such as engineering resettlement, ecological resettlement and poverty alleviation resettlement to formulate climate migration policies, regulations and strategic planning; 3) Establish a database cloud platform related to climate change and population migration; 4) Strengthen the exchange and cooperation between Chinese researchers in the field of climate migration and international scientific research institutions.

Farmers'Adaptation of Floods, Droughts and Disaster Risk Preparedness: The Case of Angat, Bulacan, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						flood; drought; climate change; Angat; agriculture; adaptation strategies		Variability of rainfall caused by climate change has brought great impacts in the country, especially the agriculture sector. This study aimed to assess the effects and impacts of climate change, particularly flood and drought events, in the agriculture sector of Angat, Bulacan, Philippines. A household survey was conducted with 393 farmers surveyed using multi-criteria questionnaires. Sixty-two percent of farmers has been affected by drought, and 33.84% of them had their crop production decreased for more than 50% of their usual harvest. Absence of rain has affected majority of farmers (29.50%) whose farmlands are rainfed. Lack of irrigation facilities also affected the level of crop production in the locality. Majority of the respondents (46.56%) have experienced the effects of floods, especially those who reside near Angat River where overland flow occurs. Aside from damaged infrastructures and properties, the respondents also experienced water-borne diseases like diarrhea and skin infections. Farmers were able to adapt with the effects of climate change such as creating their own wells and planting crops that are suitable for the season. This study could aid in the improvement of adaptation measures of local farmers in Angat.

However, current changes in climate have been adversely affecting agricultural productivity. In this paper, perceived impacts of climate change on agriculture and adaptation towards it have been studied in Charsadda district (lowlands) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan through extensive field surveys, involving 116 farm households. Results have revealed that climate change factors including fluctuating temperature, evidence of yearly long droughts, and a steady shift in rainfall patterns have pressured the agriculture sector and livelihoods of the local peasants. The staggering floods of 2010 and 2011 in Pakistan have evidenced severe climatic changes in Pakistan. These countrywide floods have washed fertile soil in the study area that has directly contributed to losses in agricultural yield and increased vector-borne diseases in crops. The local farmers have commonly deployed adaptive measure such as crops diversification, changing fertilizer, and planting shaded trees to minimize the impacts of changes in climate. However, these adjustments measures are perceived as not appropriate for improving farm yield. Therefore, the study suggests that improved understanding of the climate change impacts and knowledge on adapting adequately will lead to no-regret adaptation. It will also help protecting farmer's lives and livelihoods and will boost their resilience towards changing climatic conditions.

Under climate change uncertainty, an adaptive strategy is required to provide supplemental flood mitigation. Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) in developed areas has the potential to provide substantial catchment runoff reduction. However, individual properties vary in their Flood Mitigation Capability (FMC) depending on their land characteristics. An effective methodology is needed to evaluate the FMC of properties to help urban planners determine which to target for GSI and when to implement GSI in light of increased climate change impacts. We advance the Hydrology-based Land Capability Assessment and Classification (HLCA+C) methodology for evaluating the FMC of large properties over the long term (80 to 100-year). It builds on the strengths of existing methodologies and uses a land unit analysis approach for assessing FMC, considering interdependent hydrological and geographical variables. The FMC classification system groups properties with similar flood mitigation characteristics, helping urban planners to understand their potentials and limitations for flood mitigation toward the development of adaptive strategies through time. Step-by-step instructions demonstrate how to apply the methodology to any low-lying coastal city.

The Pulangi River Basin (PRB) in the Philippines is experiencing sedimentation beyond the tolerable amount (11.2 tons/ha/yr) due to land conversion and the effects of climate change. Changes in precipitation and temperature due to climate change are likely to further affect the annual runoff and sediment yield of PRB. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was employed to simulate various scenarios of twelve downscaled climate projections from three Global Circulation Models (GCM) of CMIP5 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 6.0) for 2040-2069 and 2070-2099 timeframes, and the results were compared to a baseline period (1975-2005). This study revealed that the maximum mean annual precipitation is expected to increase by 39.10%, and the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to increase by 3.04 degrees C and 3.83 degrees C, respectively. These observed changes correspond to an increase in runoff (44.58-76.80%) and sediment yield (1.33-26.28%) within the sub-basins. These findings suggest a general increase in the threat of severe flooding and excessive soil loss, leading to severe erosion and reservoir sedimentation throughout the PRB.

The present study thus analyses mangroves' role as ecosystem-based technique to reduce disaster risk and adapt to climate change using Mauritius, a small island state, as case study, particularly the coastal protective and climate change adaptive capacities of the two local species Rhizophora mucronata Lam. and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to retrieve resources from Google Scholar, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for the 2002 to 2022 period. A total of 41,789 records were identified and through a robust screening and filtering process only 50 studies were deemed relevant to the present study. In this context, key attributes of mangrove forests were found to be in reducing coastal flood risk, sheltering coastal regions during storms and stabilizing the coast. This study lays the foundation to consider Rhizophora and Brugueira as robust nature based solutions for Mauritius which will be of key importance to decision makers, researchers and the public at large to consider restoring degraded mangrove sites and promote ecosystem-based approaches to reduce disaster risk, adapt to climate change, enhance marine spatial planning and better coastal zone management.

To study the climate change impact on urban pluvial flooding, fine-scale climate model simulations are needed. The number of such simulations is, however, still limited and not widely available, thus entailing the downscaling of the model outputs. One of the commonly used methods to meet this demand is statistical downscaling, where the statistical properties of large(r)-scale climate simulations are used to derive local climate variables. This study focuses on applying a distribution-based bias correction method on regional climate model (RCM) simulations to explore how climate change affects extreme precipitation and urban flood events at the end of this century (2071-2100). A 1D-2D hydrodynamic model, implemented in Infoworks ICM, is used to simulate pluvial flood events for several return periods for a case study in the city of Antwerp in Belgium. The results show that the statistical downscaling approach can effectively decrease the bias in the model simulations and offer strong scaling relations to derive high-resolution extreme precipitation time series. The analyses also reveal that climate change may cause an increase of 16%, 31%, 47%, 63%, 73% and 84% in the flood volume for 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 30- and 50-year return periods, respectively. This projected increase in the flood volume enlarges the inundated area by 32%, 49%, 56%, 58%, 58% and 59% for the respective return periods. The flood frequency is also projected to almost double in the future, so that a 5-year flood event in the historical period will most likely be a 2-year event in the future period.

Ice is melting, sea levels are rising, biodiversity is declining, precipitation has increased, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases are alarmingly high, and extreme weather conditions are becoming increasingly common. But what role do microorganisms have in this global challenge? In this Viewpoint article, several experts in the field discuss the microbial contributions to climate change and consider the effects of global warming, extreme weather, flooding and other consequences of climate change on microbial communities in the ocean and soil, on host-microbiota interactions and on the global burden of infectious diseases and ecosystem processes, and they explore open questions and research needs.

We found that imagery and party cues had significant total effects on perceived flooding threat but not on perceived climate change threat. Specifically, episodic imagery (but not thematic imagery) increased perceived flooding threat, and party cues lowered perceived threat. Perceived threat was positively associated with collective efficacy, which, in turn, was positively associated with intended political action. Both imagery and party cues had significant indirect effects on perceived efficacy and intended action.	[Hart, P.

Climate change is also altering the composition and behavior of different insect and pathogen populations adding to yield losses worldwide. Additional constraints to agriculture are caused by the increasing amounts of human-generated pollutants, as well as the negative impact of climate change on soil microbiomes. Although in the laboratory, we are trained to study the impact of individual stress conditions on plants, in the field many stresses, pollutants, and pests could simultaneously or sequentially affect plants, causing conditions of stress combination. Because climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of such stress combination events (e.g., heat waves combined with drought, flooding, or other abiotic stresses, pollutants, and/or pathogens), a concentrated effort is needed to study how stress combination is affecting crops. This need is particularly critical, as many studies have shown that the response of plants to stress combination is unique and cannot be predicted from simply studying each of the different stresses that are part of the stress combination. Strategies to enhance crop tolerance to a particular stress may therefore fail to enhance tolerance to this specific stress, when combined with other factors. Here we review recent studies of stress combinations in different plants and propose new approaches and avenues for the development of stress combination- and climate change-resilient crops.

This study provides insights into the climate change adaptation strategies of smallholders in the Yellow River-Huangshui River Valley (YHV), located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). The YHV is an important food-producing region on the TP. Climate change is threatening the livelihoods of local households. This study uses data from 494 household questionnaires, meteorological station data, and disaster statistics reports collected in the YHV region to understand the climate change adaptation strategies of smallholders and explore the factors that influence their strategies using the multivariate probit (MVP) model. The study found that frequent droughts, wind hail, and floods significantly impact agriculture in the YHV. Smallholders in the YHV adopted six main adaptation strategies to cope with the effects of climate change: crop rotation (88.25%), increasing agricultural inputs (75.30%), changing crop sowing times (61.94%), engaging in off-farm activities (50.20%), expanding cropland areas (32.59%), and raising more livestock (15.99%). The MVP model results indicated that smallholders' perceptions of disasters (drought, wind hail, and flood) have a significant impact on their adaptation strategies. An increase in perceived disasters positively and significantly affected off-farm strategies but negatively affected agricultural adaptation strategies. Although increasing the labor cost of agricultural production, the number of cropland plots to some extent encourages smallholders to adopt agricultural adaptation strategies and discourages the adoption of off-farm activities. Additionally, smallholder adaptation strategies were significantly influenced by various indicators including number of livestock, proportion of agricultural equipment, elevation, and off-farm income. The study proposes targeted policy recommendations to promote sustainable development of local households' livelihoods. These include strengthening household coping capacities for droughts, wind hail and floods, promoting skills training, encouraging agricultural scaling operations and off-farm livelihood transformation for certain small farmers, and considering the environmental impacts of household adaptational strategies.

Kratie province, in particular, has suffered from climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, storms, lightning, and heatwaves. To date, climate change interventions in the province have primarily focused on impacts on agriculture. However, enhancing the climate resilience of micro businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector is also crucial since the provincial economy increasingly depends on the interlinkage between agriculture, tourism and related enterprises. This article examines how climate change has impacted micro businesses in Kratie Town, and how they responded to the impacts. This study is based on semi structured interviews with micro entrepreneurs randomly selected in the town. Results show that businesses have been predominantly affected by floods and storms. Business exposures and locations, types of business, production and supply chains, and client bases determined different impacts of and responses to these climate related hazards. Businesses adopted primarily temporary and reactive responses rather than long-term systematic measures. Strengthening adaptive infrastructure, both physical and informational, will improve businesses' capability to prepare for and cope with these disasters.

Out of 110 households studied, male household members were absent in 66 cases because they had migrated to nearby towns and regional centres for alternative livelihood options. Male members' absence created opportunities for Gabura women to develop a range of novel adaptation strategies through engagement with aid agencies, changed gender roles, leveraging social capital and utilizing local knowledge. For example, women are increasingly contributing to income through works within and outside of the house in agricultural innovations and handmade productions. These adaptations are built on social capital and trust between community women and the NGOs through mobilization and sharing of local knowledge. Based on the findings, a framework for informed autonomous adaptation is proposed. The generalization of coastal women in developing contexts as passive victims of climate change due to social norms and instead highlights women's active agencies in adaptation is challenged. There is a need for a critical understanding of gender-specific dynamics in post-cyclone aid interventions towards in-situ climate change adaptation.

In this study, 18 flow regime metrics are adopted to fully characterize the streamflow hydrograph. The future changes are considered, including land use scenario in 2025 predicted by the Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov), and climate change scenarios under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) obtained from five general circulation models (GCMs) for the period 2021-2030. Regional impacts of future land use and climate changes on flow regimes in the Yellow River Source Region are simulated and identified using distributed hydrological modeling and spatial classification. Results show that the increases in unused land (14.16%), and decreases in grassland (2.54%), glacier and snow cover (62.85%) are remarkable for the period 1980-2025. The flow regimes will be highly impacted in the source region for the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, but in the middle stream and downstream regions for the RCP4.5 scenario. Both the future land use and climate changes will increase flow magnitude for most regions, but their impacts on other flow regime metrics are not homogeneous. The climate change will play the dominant role in the flow regime variations, while the land use change will highly affect mean pre-flood runoff, frequency and duration of high flow events, and mean rates of positive and negative changes. Key Points Based on CA-Markov model, grassland, glacier and snow cover will be remarkably degraded in 2025 Impacts of future land use and climate changes on flow regimes are clustered to three robust classes Climate change results in flow regime variations, while land use change mainly impacts flow variability, frequency, and duration of high flow	[Wang, Wei; Zhang, Yongyong; Geng, Xin; Tang, Qiuhong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei; Geng, Xin; Tang, Qiuhong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS	Zhang, YY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.	zhangyy003@igsnrr.ac.cn	Zhang, Yongyong/I-9367-2014; Wang, Wei/JOZ-9069-2023; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022	Wang, Wei/0000-0003-3858-9853; Geng, Xin/0000-0002-2846-702X	National Natural Science Foundation of China [41730645, 41671024]; Interdisciplinary Innovation Team, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [JCTD-2019-04]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Interdisciplinary Innovation Team, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)	This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41730645 and 41671024), and the Interdisciplinary Innovation Team, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (No. JCTD-2019-04).

Thus, this study aimed to analyze the climate change projections for the hydropower systems of Ecuador based on data from 14 projects studying scenarios according to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The study examined the period from 2010 to 2020 with historical data, determined the tendency, defined a database year, and then projected the scenarios to 2050. The quantitative methodology used time-series statistics for Ecuador's hydropower inflow to calculate the deviation over recent years and develop a model to simulate future power generation. The results showed that hydropower in Ecuador is expected to decrease considerably through to 2050 due to meteorological changes. In this calculation of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, the selected scenarios showed a reduction in SSP5 of 11.5%, SP2 of 16.2%, and SSP4 of 18.2% through to 2050, indicating that the opportunities for hydroelectric production in the face of climate change are variable, but the challenges are broad. In Ecuador, the projections of reductions in hydropower generation represent a sensitive issue, especially knowing that, in 2020, 87% of the energy grid in the country depended on hydroelectric production.

This paper attempts to investigate farmers' adaptation strategies to combat climate change in drought prone areas and identify their determinants based on a survey of 480 farmers from northwestern Bangladesh. Farmers commonly practicing six technology-based strategies and one labour/family-based strategy with 80% adapting two or more adaptation strategies. Although synergy exists between selected strategies, competition also exist between rice- and non-rice based strategies. The likelihood of undertaking climate change adaptation strategies are significantly and positively influenced by education, subsistence pressure, income from livestock and poultry, extension services, involvement in organizations and the use of ICT in farming. Adaptation probability inversely related with increasing women participation in agricultural labour force. Recommendations include strengthening extension services and promoting use of ICT in farming, incorporation of climatic information in education, easing and facilitating farmers' access to institutions and promotion of livestock rearing to combat climate change induced challenges on farming in drought prone areas.

In particular, uncertainty surrounds the success of mitigation strategies and economic and demographic developments. While 'grey' measures, such as dikes and pumping, have been the dominant form of adaptation in the past against inland flooding, Nature-based Solutions are receiving more attention. However, evidence on their cost-effectiveness compared to grey alternatives is still limited. In this article, we develop a real options model that integrates climate change uncertainty as well as flexibility of the timing of investment. We expect that the uncertainty falls over time due to an increase in climate data that becomes available to the decision-maker. The decision-maker learns about climate change from two types of events: inland flooding and meteorological drought. The model is calibrated with data from the Oldambt-Eemskanaal-Dollardboezem water system in the Dutch Province of Groningen. Our results show the potential for Nature-based Solutions to become a viable alternative to dike heightening and pumping in addressing both extreme events. Moreover, we observe that the cost-effectiveness of Nature-based Solutions depends on the maturing time of the ecosystem, the value of land on which the measure is being implemented, and the type of information considered in the investment decision. We show that maturing times of up to nine years make a Nature-based Solution the preferred measure to invest in, even under strong beliefs of severe climate change. When maturing times exceed nine years, the option takes too long to become effective and pumping is preferred. Furthermore, our results show that an increase in the value of land on which a Nature-based Solution is being constructed may substantially reduce its cost-effectiveness. Finally, decision-making flexibility becomes valuable if expected damages from floods and droughts are sufficiently low and the decision-maker learns quickly about climate change.

A Narrative Analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Climate change; adaptation; newspapers; narratives; responsibility; UK	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; POSITIVE AFFECT; MEDIA; DISCOURSES; COVERAGE; TRANSFORMATION; PROTECTION; PARADIGM; MATTERS; VALUES	Media coverage of climate change impacts and adaptation will likely influence how citizens think society can and should adapt. Here, we undertook the first analysis of UK newspaper adaptation coverage. We identified five prominent adaptation narratives: (1) the government should build more flood defences, (2) home owners should buy flood insurance, (3) individuals should become more informed, (4) the farming industry should innovate, (5) and the natural environment should fight for its survival. We find that only some of the more immediate climate change impacts likely to affect the UK are presented as necessitating a response. The government is considered primarily responsible while UK citizens are given few and narrow responsibilities. The range of adaptive actions under consideration is limited and unchallenging to the status quo. In summary, newspaper coverage presents a restricted view as to when the UK should adapt and how it could adapt.

High-impact weather and urban flooding in the West African Sahel-A multidisciplinary case study of the 2009 event in Ouagadougou	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES			English	Article						West african sahel; Ouagadougou; High-impact weather; Flood; Urban; Multidisciplinary	MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; EXTREME RAINFALL; TRENDS; RISK; TELECONNECTIONS; VARIABILITY; ATTRIBUTION; PROJECTIONS; EVOLUTION; MODEL	On September 1st 2009 an extreme high-impact weather event occurred in Burkina Faso that had significant impacts upon the capital city Ouagadougou and its inhabitants. Subsequent reporting and research has however not focused on the contributing socio-economic and hydrological factors and the role of global warming and climatic change remains uncertain. This reflects a paucity of evidence attributing such extreme weather events to climate change for the West Africa region and limits the knowledge base for urban planning to climate-related risks which pose serious threats. This case study provides a holistic assessment of the most extreme urban hydrometeorological event recorded in the West African Sahel, that links synoptic conditions to climate change and through to hydrological impacts on vulnerable urban populations. The intention is to inform regional decisionmakers on climate change and flood-generating high-impact weather events at the urban scale and to bridge the gap between what scientists understand as useful and decision-makers view as useable at the city scale by providing interdisciplinary answers to key questions raised by local stakeholders. Such an approach was shown to foster enhanced dialogue and engagement with stakeholders, while also providing a focus for communicating science at variable time- and spatial scales and between disciplines to improve understanding of how global processes have localised consequences. This reveals that Ouagadougou remains vulnerable to climate change and that such extreme weather events will become more frequent. But it is also demonstrated the complexity of attributing extreme events at such localised 'urban' scales to atmospheric phenomena affected by global climate change. Regional climate models are evolving and becoming more able to represent such extreme weather phenomena at suitable scales, enabling improved representation of climatedriven changes on such events, improving the ability for short-range forecasts in the future. Frameworks for managing flood risks however remain weak and under-resourced and there is limited capacity to manage flood risk from such events, particularly when rapid urbanisation amplifies vulnerability concerns. Recommendations are made to improve flood-resilience to future storms.

Thus, strategies, also called adaptation measures, have been discussed to minimize the impacts of climate change on transport systems and their infrastructure; however, a knowledge gap is evident in the literature. Therefore, this article develops a systematic review with a bibliometric approach, still scarce in the literature, in renowned databases, focusing on studies developed on adaptation measures for road infrastructure. The results show that, since the development of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an increasing amount of studies on the theme have been published in recognized journals such as Science of the Total Environment, Energy and Buildings and Urban Climate, analyzing climate threats such as intense precipitations and high temperatures that have led to biophysical impacts such as flooding and urban heat island. In addition, for each type of adverse weather condition, many impacts on road infrastructure can be listed, as well as ways to detect these impacts, and adaptation measures that can be used to minimize these problems.

However, the usefulness of the cycle has become questionable in diverse urban settings. Thus, this research uses a pragmatic approach to identify challenges in the effectiveness of the conventional disaster risk management cycle and its phases in the context of urban flooding in Pakistan. Institutions involved in flood risk management were interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. Three focus group discussions were also held to understand the viewpoints of selected communities. Thematic analysis was used to categorize views and responses under each phase. The analysis reveals that, despite the advent of disaster risk reduction strategies, local institutions are still relying on reactive approaches and are managing flood risk on an ad-hoc basis. Weak governance and limited corrective measures for existing development patterns are making it difficult to manage flood risks. There is an urgent need to perform multihazard vulnerability and risk assessment, and develop specific strategies under the philosophies of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. This study recommends the inclusion of climate change adaptation and resilience in the current management cycle for reducing future urban risks.

Biological responses to extreme weather events are detectable but difficult to formally attribute to anthropogenic climate change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LARGE LOWLAND RIVER; 2 MAIN TRIBUTARIES; MOLLUSK COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY; RESILIENCE; HEATWAVE; IMPACTS; SUMMER; TRENDS; DRIVEN	As the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as droughts, heatwaves and floods have increased over recent decades, more extreme biological responses are being reported, and there is widespread interest in attributing such responses to anthropogenic climate change. However, the formal detection and attribution of biological responses to climate change is associated with many challenges. We illustrate these challenges with data from the Elbe River floodplain, Germany. Using community turnover and stability indices, we show that responses in plant, carabid and mollusc communities are detectable following extreme events. Community composition and species dominance changed following the extreme flood and summer heatwave of 2002/2003 (all taxa); the 2006 flood and heatwave (molluscs); and after the recurring floods and heatwave of 2010 and the 2013 flood (plants). Nevertheless, our ability to attribute these responses to anthropogenic climate change is limited by high natural variability in climate and biological data; lack of long-term data and replication, and the effects of multiple events. Without better understanding of the mechanisms behind change and the interactions, feedbacks and potentially lagged responses, multiple-driver attribution is unlikely. We discuss whether formal detection and/or attribution is necessary and suggest ways in which understanding of biological responses to extreme events could progress.	[Harris, R. M.

Changes in Extreme Precipitation and Landslides Over High Mountain Asia	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEPAL HIMALAYA; OUTBURST FLOOD; GLACIER; KARAKORAM; HAZARD; AREA; SUSCEPTIBILITY	High Mountain Asia is impacted by extreme monsoonal rainfall that triggers landslides in large proportions relative to global distributions, resulting in substantial human impacts and damage to infrastructure each year. Previous landslide research has qualitatively estimated how patterns in landslide activity may change based on climate change scenarios. We present the first quantitative view of potential modulation in future landslide activity over the High Mountain Asia region leveraging a new landslide hazard model and precipitation data from satellite and Global Climate Model sources. In doing so, we find that the rate of increase in landslide activity at the end of the century is expected to be greatest over areas covered by current glaciers and glacial lakes, potentially exacerbating the impacts of cascading hazards on populations downstream. This work demonstrates the potential of Global Climate Models and satellite-based precipitation estimates to characterize landslide hazards at time scales affected by climate change. Plain Language Summary High Mountain Asia is home to both monsoonal rains and the largest concentration of glaciers outside the North and South Poles. With climate change, heavy rainfall will increase, especially in mountains near glaciers and glacial lakes. This will make landslides more likely and could present new hazards of landslides releasing a wall of water from glacial lakes, impacting communities and infrastructure are located downstream.

J	Jenkins, LM; Alvarez, R; Jordaan, SM				Jenkins, Lisa Martine; Alvarez, Robert; Jordaan, Sarah Marie			Unmanaged climate risks to spent fuel from US nuclear power plants: The case of sea-level rise	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; Nuclear power; Cooling pools; Spent fuel management; Independent spent fuel storage installations; Sea-level rise		Climate change and its accompanying sea-level rise is set to create risks to the United States' stockpile of spent nuclear fuel, which results largely from nuclear power. Coastal spent fuel management facilities are vulnerable to unanticipated environmental events, as evidenced by the 2011 tsunami-related flooding at the Fukushima plant in Japan. We examine how policy-makers can manage climate risks posed to the coastal storage of radioactive materials, and identify the coastal spent fuel storage sites that will be most vulnerable to sea-level rise. A geo-spatial analysis of coastal sites shows that with six feet of sea-level rise, seven spent fuel sites will be juxtaposed by seawater. Of those, three will be near or completely surrounded by water, and should be considered a priority for mitigation: Humboldt Bay (California), Turkey Point (Florida), and Crystal River (Florida). To ensure policymakers manage such climate risks, a risk management approach is proposed. Further, we recommend that policymakers 1) transfer overdue spent fuel from cooling pools to dry casks, particularly where located in high risk sites; 2) develop a long-term and comprehensive storage plan that is less vulnerable to climate change; and 3) encourage international nuclear treaties and standards to take climate change into account.

Here we analyze the effects of natural disaster experience on the belief in the existence of climate change. The primary data source is a panel survey covering 22,251 observations from 11,194 geo-located households collected in Germany between 2012 and 2015, combined with satellite imagery of a major flood event in 2013. We find that flood experience had a significant positive effect on the beliefs in the existence of climate change for those respondents living close to the flooded area. However, the effect decreases sharply with distance. We further show that this overall effect is driven by those respondents who already believed in climate change before the flood - they saw their belief confirmed by their experience. In contrast, spatial proximity to the flood had no measurable effect on skeptics. These results imply that climate skeptics may not be influenced by the experience of natural disasters at their doorsteps.

J	Hobbie, SE; Grimm, NB				Hobbie, Sarah E.; Grimm, Nancy B.			Nature-based approaches to managing climate change impacts in cities	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						cities; climate change adaptation; green infrastructure; nature-based strategies; urban ecosystems	COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOW; URBAN GREEN SPACE; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; GLOBAL PATTERNS; HEAT; INFRASTRUCTURE; WATER; BIODIVERSITY; TREES; ADAPTATION	Managing and adapting to climate change in urban areas will become increasingly important as urban populations grow, especially because unique features of cities amplify climate change impacts. High impervious cover exacerbates impacts of climate warming through urban heat island effects and of heavy rainfall by magnifying runoff and flooding. Concentration of human settlements along rivers and coastal zones increases exposure of people and infrastructure to climate change hazards, often disproportionately affecting those who are least prepared. Nature-based strategies (NBS), which use living organisms, soils and sediments, and/or landscape features to reduce climate change hazards, hold promise as being more flexible, multi-functional and adaptable to an uncertain and non-stationary climate future than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, future research should address the effectiveness of NBS for reducing climate change impacts and whether they can be implemented at scales appropriate to climate change hazards and impacts. Further, there is a need for accurate and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses that consider disservices and co-benefits, relative to grey alternatives, and how costs and benefits are distributed across different communities. NBS are most likely to be effective and fair when they match the scale of the challenge, are implemented with input from diverse voices and are appropriate to specific social, cultural, ecological and technological contexts.

Agricultural countries, such as Nepal, depend on farmers' adaptations to climate change for local sustainable development. Limited livelihood options, unequal access to resources and information, and climate change-related floods and droughts have reduced farmer welfare. Few studies have investigated the effects of altitude in rural areas or examined livelihood adaptation strategies in Nepal. Using a survey of farmers in rural areas at high, middle, and low altitudes in Nepal, this article explores the impacts of climate change-related floods and droughts, as well as the water resource utilization, disaster resilience, and livelihood improvement ability of farmers and the influencing factors. This article adopted participatory rural appraisal to obtain survey data from farmers at three altitudes. Through one-way ANOVA and F-tests, farmers' perceptions of floods and droughts were analyzed, and through field investigations, their production and water consumption patterns were established. Logistic regressions show that college education, farming income, and domestic water consumption have the strongest impacts on households' disaster resilience, while non-farm income, male laborer rates, and college education have the strongest impacts on households' abilities to improve livelihoods.

J	Chan, KM; Wang, YH				Chan, Kin-ming; Wang, Yuhong			Resilient pavement design with consideration of flooding effect caused by climate change	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article							FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION	Climatological reports demonstrate a clear trend of more frequent occurrence of extreme weathers. Flooding caused by heavy rains severely affects highway pavement performance in many coastal regions. As the trend of climate change continues, highway pavements in these regions will become more vulnerable to flooding. At present, however, pavement design is usually based on historical climatological data and seldom considers future climate changes. Moreover, traditional pavement analysis rarely considers the stochastic nature of weather. This study develops a life-cycle cost optimization model and adopts a stochastic approach to analyzing the effect of climate change. Pavement structure design is optimized by incorporating the flooding effect in the model. As a case study, hourly climate data in the past century in Hong Kong is analyzed to investigate changes in rainfall intensity, and the trends are used to optimize pavement design.

Understanding their potential responses to global and local changes is essential to develop management strategies adapted to these ecosystems. Salinity is a fundamental structuring factor for phytoplankton communities; however, its role under climate change is understudied. We hypothesized that salinity variations imposed by climate change and/or management actions could disturb Mediterranean lagoons' phytoplankton communities. To test our hypothesis, we performed two 5-day microcosm experiments in which natural phytoplankton assemblages from the Santa Giulia lagoon (Corsica Island) were subjected to three increasing (53-63-73) and decreasing (33-26-20) levels of salinity, to mimic strong evaporation and flash flooding, respectively. Results indicate that over-salinization inhibited growth and modified the assemblages' composition. Freshening, on the contrary, showed feeble effects, mainly boosting microphytoplankton abundance and depleting diversity at lowest salinity. In both experiments and under freshening in particular, initially rare species emerged, while photosynthetic activity was degraded by salinity increase only. We demonstrated that phytoplankton communities' structure and metabolism are strongly altered by the predicted implications of climate change. Such impacts have to be considered for future management of coastal lagoons (control of sea exchanges and watershed fluxes). This work constitutes a priority step towards the proactive adapted management and conservation of such as-yet-neglected ecosystems in the context of climate change.

This article aims to estimate the long-run impact of climate change on household development resilience. To do so, we use the China Health and Nutrition Survey, which contains detailed lon-gitudinal socioeconomic information from 1989 to 2015, and matches them to weather data. We find that climate change negatively impacts household development resilience. This negative impact stems from both a decline in upward mobility of households and an increase in downside risks. In other words, the rise in tem-peratures not only reduces the pace of household economic growth but also amplifies economic volatility, elevating consumption risk for households. The effects are driven by the decrease in agricultural production output and the risk of off-farm income. However, longer-run adaptation has offset 22.09% of the short-run effects of climate change on household development resilience. In contrast, climate adaptation mitigates household welfare loss to a greater extent through agricultural input adjustments and income diversification in the long run.

Adapting forest management to climate change: experiences of the Nisga'a people	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW			English	Article						Nisga'a people; climate change; Indigenous knowledge; flooding; forest management		This study examines and characterizes the potential impacts of climate change on the lands of the Nisga'a Nation in British Columbia, Canada, and how these impacts might affect traditional forest practices. The study results were integrated with a review of current Nisga'a forest policy. The current forest policy has developed an inflexible approach to forest management that perpetuates a top-down decision-making framework inherited from the past relationship with the provincial government. Building from the experiences of the Nisga'a Nation, it is revealed that inflexible forest policies coupled with climate change impacts could lead the forest ecosystems to ecological thresholds. No approach by itself will be sufficient to meet the challenges these changes will bring to Indigenous peoples and society in general. An integrative approach, where the forest management is undertaken from a resilience point of view, is needed if current conditions are to be improved.	[Arias-Bustamante, J. R.; Innes, J.

We call for an intersectional and decolonial approach to better understand how disabilities intersect with social and structural injustices in urban settings to shape diverse responses to climate change and disasters. We highlight the economic, socio-cultural, and embodied challenges that increase vulnerability to-and ability to recover from-disasters including urban flooding and earthquakes. We draw on ethnographic and visual data from our research, including a comic illustrated by Ariel and Zaldi and sketches by Rizaldi, to centre diverse lived experiences of structural vulnerabilities and socio-cultural marginalisation, particularly concerning education and livelihoods. Foregrounding life stories in this way serves to challenge the absence of meaningful engagement of people with disabilities in disaster risk reduction and climate change actions and decision-making. Our article highlights disability as a site of both discrimination and critical embodied knowledge, simultaneously a product of structural, socio-cultural, political, and environmental injustice while also a source of innovation, resilience, and agency.

It controls the hydraulic characteristics of streamflow, affects the geomorphology of channels, and can cause flooding due to ice-jam formation during ice-cover freeze-up and breakup periods. In recent decades, climate change has considerably altered ice regimes, affecting the severity of ice-jam flooding. Although many approaches have been developed to model river ice regimes and the severity of ice-jam flooding, appropriate methods that account for the impacts of future climate on ice-jam flooding have not been well established. Therefore, the main goals of this study are to review current knowledge regarding climate change impacts on river ice processes and to assess current modelling capabilities to determine the severity of ice jams under future climatic conditions. Finally, a conceptual river ice-jam modelling approach is presented for incorporating climate change impacts on ice jams.

However, previous studies have paid more attention to the changes in annual and monthly runoff. Therefore, the changes in the characteristics of floods and droughts are still unknown, particularly in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin (YRB) in the southern TP. Therefore, this study simulates the runoff in four subbasins in the YRB using the GR4J_SNOW model to depict the characteristics (including frequency, severity, peak, and duration) of floods on a daily scale and those of droughts on a monthly scale. It is done in historical (1979-2014) and future (2049-2084) periods under different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), and then the changes in floods and droughts between the two periods are comprehensively compared. The results indicate that the YRB has experienced marginal streamflow change during the historical period. Under future varying climate change scenarios, however, the YRB might become wetter with increasing frequency, volume, and peak of floods, along with decreasing frequency, severity, and duration of droughts. In the upstream YRB, covered by more snow with a drier climate, the flood and drought characteristics appear to be more sensitive to climate change than in the downstream YRB. This study is helpful for a better understanding of the hydrological process in the TP under climate change and for forming sustainable water resource strategies for the surrounding regions of the TP. Plain Language Summary The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the Asian water tower, providing water resources to hundreds of millions of people living downstream. The Yarlung Zangbo River basin (YRB), located in the southern part of the TP, has attracted increasing attention because most of the Tibetan people live there and it is the upper stream of the Brahmaputra River. It is not clear how floods and droughts, the two most serious natural disasters, could change under climate change in the YRB. This study simulates the changes in flood and drought characteristics in the YRB in the historical (1979-2014) and future (2049-2084) periods under different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Our results show that the YRB could become wetter with increasing floods and mitigated droughts in the future, despite minor changes in flood and drought characteristics in the historical period. The change could be stronger upstream than downstream. This study can be helpful for long-term water resource management and planning on the TP.

For the hazard assessment, hazard indicators were constructed utilizing design rainfall standards, which represented the local flood protection capability, as a flood threshold. We constructed high-resolution spatial images from data of buildings, roads, agriculture areas, and the population that have suffered significant flood damage in the Republic of Korea. We also calculated flood exposure levels by analyzing the scales of the targets in low-lying areas. Environmental and anthropogenic conditions that can directly increase or decrease river flooding and urban flooding were set as indicators and utilized as proxy variables. As a result of the risk assessment, we found 43 risk areas in the historical period, accounting for 19% of the total administrative districts, 42 in the projected period under RCP 4.5 (18%), and 51 in the projected period under RCP 8.5 (22%).

Understanding dimensions of vulnerability of PwVI to disasters and climate change is an important issue to reduce the culture of neglected disasters. To date, few studies have analyzed visual impairment and disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. This exploratory qualitative research project analyzed how to include PwVI in the DRR policies of Brazil. The research question is: how can we include PwVI in the discussion of DRR and climate change? The response to this question is part of a joint effort that involved a university, a hazard monitoring agency, and three institutions that work with PwVI. The three main results of the project are: (1) a mapping method to identify the exposure of PwVI to landslides and floods, and to create tactile risk maps tailored to them; (2) incorporating the voices of PwVI regarding their vulnerabilities and capacities with respect to disasters and climate change, achieved through shared interaction during 15 face to face interviews and one workshop attended by 100 people; and (3) an initiative of inclusive education to reduce some of the disabling barriers that intensify vulnerability.

Kerry			THE CRITICAL ROLE OF MARKETS IN CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION	CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMICS			English	Article						Climate change; adaptive responses; land markets; water markets; urban; agricultural signals and responses	US AGRICULTURE; CROP CHOICE; IMPACTS; IRRIGATION; RESOURCES; INSURANCE; STRATEGY; WEST	Markets, especially land markets, can facilitate climate change adaptation through price signals. A review of research reveals that urban, coastal, and agricultural land markets provide effective signals of the emerging costs of climate change. These signals encourage adjustments by both private owners and policy officials in taking preemptive action to reduce costs. In agriculture, they promote consideration of new cropping and tillage practices, seed types, timing, and location of production. They also stimulate use of new irrigation technologies. In urban areas, they motivate new housing construction, elevation, and location away from harm. They channel more efficient use of water and its application to parks and other green areas to make urban settings more desirable with higher temperatures. Related water markets play a similar role in adjusting water use and reallocation. To be effective, however, markets must reflect multiple traders and prices must be free to adjust. Where these conditions are not met, market signals will be inhibited and market-driven adaptation will be reduced. Because public policy is driven by constituent demands, it may not be a remedy. The evidence of the National Flood Insurance Program and federal wildfire response illustrates how politically difficult it may be to adjust programs to be more adaptive.

This study assesses the hydrological changes of Lake Tana Basin under future climatic changes. The study used Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) to project future climate change. The basin's hydrology was assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT was driven by the outputs of SDSM and calibrated against observed river flow. The results indicate that the maximum and minimum temperature trends are generally in line with the global trends, whereas the precipitation shows an inconsistent pattern. The predictive results from the RCP8.5 radiative forcing scenarios indicate that during the wet season (dry season), the evapotranspiration, streamflow, and base flow will tend to increase by 14.9%, 9.7%, and 20.9% (70.1%, 2.8%, and 16.7%) respectively by the year 2090s. The streamflow curve for the Lake Tana basin's under future climate change shows a steep slope, and stream discharge is highly variable, particularly the surface runoff. This study indicates that although climate change seems uncertain for the study area, preparedness is warranted to avoid the aggravation of soil erosion, water stress and scarcity, and often floods/droughts.

A general increase in temperature and precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and increase in weather-related natural disasters, such as floods and droughts, have been traced over the years. Bryophytes (liverworts, mosses, hornworts) occupy a pivotal position in the land plant evolution and form a unique part of the vegetation. Many taxa of bryophytes exhibit observable, distinct adaptations in response to changes in environmental conditions quickly. Bryophytes can be used to monitor climate change in two ways; (i) presence or absence in the ecosystem and (ii) changes in morphology and physiology that can be used for monitoring. Sri Lanka has a rich bryophyte flora consisting of 575 species of mosses, 338 species of liverworts, and 07 species of hornworts. It is estimated that 11% of mosses are endemic; there are no endemic thalloid liverworts or hornworts found in Sri Lanka, and the endemicity of leafy liverworts is yet to be investigated. The taxonomic status of endemic taxa and the biogeographic affinities of many taxa remain unexplored. Further, the potential use of bryophytes as indicators of climate change in Sri Lanka has not yet been investigated. This paper compiles the information on morphological and physiological responses of bryophytes to elevated temperature, increase in greenhouse gases, increased ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, and fluctuations in humidity. In the light of this gathered global knowledge, possible species of bryophytes to be used in assessing and predicting climate change and developing a climate change model in Sri Lanka are proposed. Asian bryophytes, in general, have poorly been represented in climate change literature. We believe that this knowledge will form the foundation for future research focused on climate change mitigation in other tropical and Asian countries.	[Ruklani, Sumudu; Rubasinghe, Sumudu C.

J	Aygün, O; Kinnard, C; Campeau, S				Aygun, Okan; Kinnard, Christophe; Campeau, Stephane			Impacts of climate change on the hydrology of northern midlatitude cold regions	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Cold region hydrology; climate change; snow; snowmelt; streamflow; spring floods; frozen soil; soil moisture	SNOW COVER VARIABILITY; SUMMER LOW FLOWS; WATER EQUIVALENT; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; FUTURE CHANGES; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; SURFACE TEMPERATURES; 21ST-CENTURY CHANGES	Cold region hydrology is conditioned by distinct cryospheric and hydrological processes. While snowmelt is the main contributor to both surface and subsurface flows, seasonally frozen soil also influences the partition of meltwater and rain between these flows. Cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes have been shown to be sensitive to climate change. Assessing the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of this region is therefore crucial, as it supports a significant amount of population relying on hydrological services and subjected to changing hydrological risks. We present an exhaustive review of the literature on historical and projected future changes on cold region hydrology in response to climate change. Changes in snow, soil, and streamflow key metrics were investigated and summarized at the hemispheric scale, down to the basin scale. We found substantial evidence of both historical and projected changes in the reviewed hydrological metrics. These metrics were shown to display different sensitivities to climate change, depending on the cold season temperature regime of a given region. Given the historical and projected future warming during the 21st century, the most drastic changes were found to be occurring over regions with near-freezing air temperatures. Colder regions, on the other hand, were found to be comparatively less sensitive to climate change. The complex interactions between the snow and soil metrics resulted in either colder or warmer soils, which led to increasing or decreasing frost depths, influencing the partitioning rates between the surface and subsurface flows. The most consistent and salient hydrological responses to both historical and projected climate change were an earlier occurrence of snowmelt floods, an overall increase in water availability and streamflow during winter, and a decrease in water availability and streamflow during the warm season, which calls for renewed assessments of existing water supply and flood risk management strategies.

Sustainable approaches aiming at mitigat-ing, adapting and reducing the vulnerability of people exposed to these hazards have to be based on the analysis of the risk perception. Many aspects (e.g. social, cultural, psychological) even au-tocorrelated, can affect the perception assessment. Furthermore, identifying factors that influ-ence or determine risk perception can help to implement more effective communication strate-gies. In this paper, the Italian young people's awareness, perception and preparation about nat-ural risks, mainly landslide and flood risk, as well as climate change are investigated. A survey was carried out by means of voluntary questionnaries on a group of Italian high school students, aged between 13 and 20, in central (Umbria region) and southern (Calabria region) Italy. The re-sults reveal that the students surveyed are aware of the climate change issue and of the its effects on nature and environment. The output of the two surveys confirms the relevant role of mass me-dia in terms of perception, knowledge and information about climate change and related impacts on young people. Moreover, a low level of trust in local administrations and a negative opinion on the policy about geo-hydrological risk have also emerged.

Novel communities of plant species that emerge and thrive in the harsh conditions of cities may represent a promising opportunity to address climate change adaptation and mitigation through the planting design and management of urban green spaces. The objective of this study is to develop an adaptive planting design and management framework. The proposed framework is grounded on previous adaptive approaches and focuses on the opportunities emerging from novel plant communities in urban conditions. The framework comprises three main steps (1 - Climate change assessment, 2 - Plant species database, and 3 - Planting design and management procedure). A proposal on how the framework could be tested was developed for the city of Porto, Portugal. Still, the application of the framework can also be adjusted to other urban contexts, offering a starting point for experimentation and assessment of plants' adaptation and mitigation capacities through design and management. As lack of knowledge and uncertainty about climate change limits global capacity to implement robust adaptation and mitigation strategies, building knowledge in an adaptive way and context-specific locations will be of paramount interest to tackle climate change in cities.

J	Raulf, M				Raulf, Monika			Climate change and type I allergies at the workplace	DERMATOLOGIE			German	Review; Early Access						Occupational allergy; Allergen exposure; Sensitization; Workplace; Occupational safety	SENSITIZATION	The consequences of climate change, the increasing frequency, duration and intensity of extreme events such as excessive drought, heat waves, large-scale forest fires, heavy rainfall and associated flooding also affect workers' conditions in the workplace in many ways. Allergic diseases of the respiratory tract and skin due to workplace exposure can also arise or be influenced by direct and indirect consequences of climate change. This affects outdoor workers not only through increased exposure to pollen allergens, but also through climate-related increases in typical workplace allergens. As an indirect effect of climate change, manufacturing processes and exposure at workplaces are changing, which can also cause new sensitization and allergies. Lifestyle changes, which are primarily intended to contribute to climate protection and sustainability, can also lead to new or changed products and thus to changed manufacturing processes and exposures in the workplace, so this should also be considered an indirect effect of climate change on the health of workers. The emergence of new occupational sources of sensitization due to new or changed allergen exposures must be considered in the context of occupational health and safety and requires proactive measures to protect workers.

Connecting the dots between climate change, household water insecurity, and migration	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article							HUMAN HEALTH; DIMENSIONS; SALINITY; DISTRESS; SCARCITY; CONTEXT; BRAZIL; URBAN	Climate change is now considered a primary global driver of migration, with water insecurity theorized to be a key determinant. Most studies have focused on large-scale climate migration events triggered by extreme weather events such as droughts, storms, or floods. But there are few studies of how climate change, interacting with background social, economic, and political processes, shapes the everyday household-level experience of water insecurity and subsequent migration decision-making beyond the contexts of disasters and agricultural livelihoods-an invisible 'slow drip' of migration. This review proposes a complementary, alternative framework for linking climate change, household-level water insecurity, and environmental migration by positioning household water insecurity as a critical pathway for shaping migration decision making in the context of socio-environmental change. We present evidence that household water insecurity is a push factor that motivates household members to migrate due to water-related disruptions to physical and mental health, livelihoods beyond agriculture, and social relationships. We close with implications for anti-poverty and development initiatives, and for water interventions to mitigate forced climate migration.

Climate change, climate-related disasters and mental disorder in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review	BMJ OPEN			English	Review						epidemiology; public health; mental health	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; SOCIAL SUPPORT; FLOOD VICTIMS; HEALTH; DEPRESSION; PTSD; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; RISK	Introduction Climate change and climate-related disasters adversely affect mental health. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and climate-related disasters and often lack adequate mental healthcare infrastructure. We used the scoping review methodology to determine how exposure to climate change and climate-related disasters influences the presence of mental disorders among those living in LMICs. We also aimed to recognise existing gaps in this area of literature. Methods This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. To identify relevant studies, we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo and Sociological Abstracts) from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2019. We also searched the grey literature. Included studies had an adult-focused LMIC population, a climate change or climate-related disaster exposure and a mental disorder outcome. Relevant study information was extracted and synthesised. Results Fifty-eight studies were identified, most of which (n=48) employed a cross-sectional design. The most commonly studied exposure-outcome combinations were flood-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=28), flood-related depression (n=15) and storm-related PTSD (n=13). The majority of studies identified a positive exposure-outcome association. However, few studies included a baseline or comparator (ie, unexposed) group, thereby limiting our understanding of the magnitude or nature of this association. There was also great heterogeneity in this literature, making studies difficult to pool or compare. Several research gaps were identified including the lack of longitudinal studies and non-uniformity of geographic coverage. Conclusion To our knowledge, this was the first scoping review to investigate the relationship between climate change and climate-related disaster exposures and mental disorder outcomes in LMICs. Our findings support the need for further research, but also highlight that mental health should be a priority within LMIC climate change policy considerations.

J	Bacha, MS; Muhammad, M; Kiliç, Z; Nafees, M				Bacha, Muhammad Suleman; Muhammad, Muhammad; Kilic, Zeyneb; Nafees, Muhammad			The Dynamics of Public Perceptions and Climate Change in Swat Valley, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; public perception; climate vulnerability; climate adaptation; climate-induced hazards	FARMER PERCEPTIONS; EXTREME WEATHER; ADAPTATION; KNOWLEDGE; TRENDS; DEFORESTATION; COMMUNITIES; EXPERIENCE; BARRIERS; IMPACTS	With rising temperatures, developing countries are exposed to the horrors of climate change more than ever. The poor infrastructure and low adaptation capabilities of these nations are the prime concern of current studies. Pakistan is vulnerable to climate-induced hazards including floods, droughts, water shortages, shifts in weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, melting of glaciers, and more in the coming years. For marginal societies dependent on natural resources, adaptation becomes a challenge and the utmost priority. Within the above context, this study was designed to fill the existing research gap concerning public knowledge of climate vulnerabilities and respective adaptation strategies in the northern Hindukush-Himalayan region of Pakistan. Using the stratified sampling technique, 25 union councils (wards) were selected from the nine tehsils (sub-districts) of the study area. Using the quantitative method approach, structured questionnaires were employed to collect data from 396 respondents. The study reveals varying public perceptions about different factors contributing to the causes and impacts of climate change and the sources of information in the three zones of the study area. The primary causes of climate change are deforestation, industrial waste, anthropogenic impurities, natural causes, and the burning of fossil fuels exacerbated by increased population. Changes in temperature, erratic rainfalls, floods, droughts, receding glaciers, and extreme weather events are some of the impacts observed over the past decades. While limiting the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels combined with government-assisted rehabilitation of forests can help combat climate change, the lack of proper education and economic, social, and governance barriers are hindering the local adaptation strategies. In addition, reduce environmental pollution (air, water, soil, etc.) and plantation polluted areas with suitable plants, are the two main actions in combating climate change. This study recommends policy interventions to enhance local adaptation efforts through building capacity, equipping local environmental institutions, discouraging deforestation, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.

J	Mehryar, S; Surminski, S				Mehryar, Sara; Surminski, Swenja			National laws for enhancing flood resilience in the context of climate change: potential and shortcomings	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Flood risk; resilience; national laws; climate change adaptation; disaster risk management		Flood risk is increasing across the world due to climate change and socio-economic development, calling for a shift from traditional protection and post-event activism towards a forward-looking, risk-aware, and more holistic resilience approach. The national legal system of countries can play an important role in creating and encouraging such a shift. In this study, we explore the potentials and shortcomings of national laws in managing flood risk and increasing flood resilience in the context of climate change. We analyze 139 laws from 33 countries collected from the Climate Change Laws of the World and Disaster Law databases and underpin this with case studies to gain insights on the interplay between national laws and resilience processes. We find: (1) a shift in flood laws from focusing on flooding as a natural resource and water resource management issue towards a broader consideration of disaster risk management (DRM) and climate adaptation policy; (2) a significant lack of climate change recognition in laws regulating decisions and actions for future flood risks, especially in DRM; (3) a prevailing focus on response and recovery strategies and a lack of recognition of risk reduction strategies and proactive flood risk governance approaches; and (4) little recognition of natural capital (comparing to physical capital) and its role in increasing flood resilience. Key policy insights Flood-related laws around the world lack consideration of future risks. Disaster risk management and climate change are often considered as separate issues in national laws, which can lead to gaps in institutional ownership, responsibilities, and allocated budgets. Flood-related laws are mainly created after major events, most of which are focused on reactive strategies (i.e. response and recovery). Laws can facilitate the shift from post-event response to anticipatory actions by encouraging proactive flood risk management (FRM) activities (i.e. risk reduction). Nature-based solutions often remain unrecognized in national laws due to the dominant focus on hard engineering measures. FRM should be treated as a holistic concept in laws: ensuring all the necessary human, social, physical, natural and financial systems are in place to support it.

Ghanaian cities are beset by weak urban planning capacities and inadequate finance to contend with climate risks, with the poor being swept aside. Given that the urban poor are excluded from official climate interventions, coupled with the fact that weak institutional and stakeholder coordination presently exists, community-led approaches to climate change are critical in providing a minimum localised climate-specific capacity. A preliminary investigation of two largely established informal settlements in Kumasi assessed residents' and local planning authorities' sensitivities for community-led approaches to climate risks. Our research: (i) investigated perceptions of the nature and evidence of climate change; (ii) examined respective knowledge on the asset-based community development approach (ABCD); (iii) identified and examined the influence of the ABCD approach in building resilience to climate change impacts; and (iv) probed the challenges with its implementation in informal settlements. We surveyed 367 households, six governmental agencies and conducted focus group discussions for relevant data. Respondents demonstrated a good understanding of the most salient manifestations of climate change: flooding, heat, and drought events. The absence of formally recognised associations and the challenges associated with utilising community assets and households' high expectations for government aid impede ABCD pathways. We conclude that mainstreaming ABCD within urban planning and governance systems can be enhanced by emphasising the co-benefits, better alignment with a shared vision of climate adaptation and transitioning towards an inclusive urban planning future.

In recent years, wetlands have been significantly affected by human activities and climate change, and wetland ecosystems have become one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. There have been many studies on the impact of human activities and climate change on wetland landscapes, but there is still a lack of relevant reviews. This article summarizes the research on the impact of global human activities and climate change on wetland landscape patterns (vegetation distribution, etc.) from 1996 to 2021. Human activities such as dam construction, urbanization, and grazing will significantly affect the wetland landscape. Generally, dam construction and urbanization are generally believed to harm wetland vegetation, but appropriate human behaviors such as tillage benefit wetland plants' growth on reclaimed land. Prescribed fires in non-inundation periods are one of the ways to increase the vegetation coverage and diversity of wetlands. In addition, some ecological restoration projects have a positive impact on wetland vegetation (quantity, richness, etc.). Under climatic conditions, extreme floods and droughts are likely to change the wetland landscape pattern, and excessively high and low water levels will restrict plants. At the same time, the invasion of alien vegetation will inhibit the growth of native vegetation in the wetland. In an environment of global warming, rising temperatures may be a "double-edged sword" for alpine and higher latitude wetland plants. This review will help researchers better understand the impact of human activities and climate change on wetland landscape patterns and suggests avenues for future studies.

In this article, we review the evidence that reliance on gasoline-powered transportation is contributing to global climate change, air pollution, and physical inactivity and that this is harmful to human health. Global climate change poses a major threat to human health and in the future could offset the health gains achieved over the last 100 yr. Based on hundreds of scientific studies, there is strong evidence that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to global climate change. Climate change is associated with increased severity of storms, flooding, rising sea levels, hotter climates, and drought, all leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Along with increases in atmospheric CO2, other pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5) are released by combustion engines and industry, which can lead to pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Also, as car ownership and vehicle miles traveled have increased, the shift toward motorized transport has contributed to physical inactivity. Each of these global challenges has resulted in, or is projected to result in, millions of premature deaths each year. One of the ways that nations can mitigate the health consequences of climate change, air pollution, and chronic diseases is through the use of active transportation. Research indicates that populations that rely heavily on active transportation enjoy better health and increased longevity. In summary, active transportation has tremendous potential to simultaneously address three global public health challenges of the 21st century.	[ALESSIO, H. E. L. A. I. N. E.

In this study, we assess the effects of climate change in sub-daily rainfall statistics for Spain. We downscale daily records to the hourly scale using machine learning techniques, and then update the downscaling predictors to generate the sub-daily rainfall projections. We use the atmospheric climate change projections of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) initiative to update the downscaling predictors. We do not observe important differences between climate change scenarios, except in the average amounts of precipitation. Climate change will intensify the most extreme sub-daily events overall, as well as increase the number of dry spells, although some dry climates concentrate most of the effects. The intensification will increase the 100-year return period event, especially in those regions where large variances are observed, making flash floods more intense in the future.

In Pakistan, an agrarian country where the majority of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods, the impacts of climate change can be particularly devastating. Understanding the adaptive capacity of farmers is crucial in order to identify effective strategies for coping with the impacts of climate change. This study aimed to assess the adaptive capacity of farmers in Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, two flood-prone districts of South Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected in October 2022 from 448 farmers through multistage stratified random sampling, and multivariate regression and bivariate probit models were used to analyze the likelihood of farmers adopting certain joint strategies and the impact of socioeconomic factors on their decision-making. Results indicated that concern for climate change and knowledge of market value of crops were significant determinants for farmers adopting joint strategies, while farmers with more experience and alternate sources of income were less likely to do so. Increased irrigation was a top strategy used despite its potential negative environmental impacts. Findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to climate adaptation that considers complex social, economic, and environmental factors and appreciates the complex decision-making process that farmers undergo. Understanding the local context is key to developing effective interventions to support climate resilience and sustainable livelihoods in agricultural communities.

Long-term changes in macroinvertebrate communities across high-latitude streams	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; diversity; long-term records; species loss; stream communities	DENALI-NATIONAL-PARK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BETA DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; PERSISTENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; COMPONENTS; STABILITY	Long-term records of benthic macroinvertebrates in high-latitude streams are essential for understanding climatic changes, including extreme events (e.g. floods). Data extending over multiple decades are typically scarce. Here, we investigated macroinvertebrate community structural change (including alpha and beta diversity and gain and loss of species) over 22 years (1994-2016) in 10 stream systems across Denali National Park (Alaska, USA) in relation to climatological and meteorological drivers (e.g. air temperature, snowpack depth, precipitation). We hypothesised that increases in air temperature and reduced snowpack depth, due to climatic change, would reduce beta and gamma diversity but increase alpha diversity. Findings showed temporal trends in alpha diversity were variable across streams, with oscillating patterns in many snowmelt- and rainfall runoff-fed streams linked to climatic variation (temperature and precipitation), but increased over time in several streams supported by a mixture of water sources, including more stable groundwater-fed streams. Beta-diversity over the time series was highly variable, yet marked transitions were observed in response to extreme snowpack accumulation (1999-2000), where species loss drove turnover. Gamma diversity did not significantly increase or decrease over time. Investigating trends in individual taxa, several taxa were lost and gained during a relative constrained time period (2000-2006), likely in response to climatic variability and significant shifts in instream environmental conditions. Findings demonstrate the importance of long-term biological studies in stream ecosystems and highlight the vulnerability of high-latitude streams to climate change.	[Milner, Alexander M.

However, given their key regulating hydrological functions, wetlands represent nature-based solutions to the anticipated, exacerbating effect of climate change on drought and flood events, which will vary at the regional scale. Here, we propose a science-based approach to establishing regional wetland restoration targets centered on their hydrological functions, using a case study on several sub-watersheds of a northern temperate basin in south-eastern Canada. We posit that restoration targets should minimally mitigate the negative effects of climate change on watershed hydrology, namely peak and low flows. We used a semi-distributed hydrological model, HYDROTEL, to perform a hydroclimatic assessment, including 47 climate projections over the 1979-2099 period, to test the effect of wetland restoration scenarios on peak and low flows. The results showed that hydrological responses to climate change varied among sub-watersheds (even at the scale of a relatively small region), and that, to mitigate these changes, increases in wetland coverage should be between 20% and up to 150%. At low restoration levels, increasing wetland coverage was more effective in attenuating floods than alleviating droughts. This study indicates that a no-net-loss policy is insufficient to maintain current hydrological cycles in the face of climate change; rather, a 'net gain' in wetland cover is needed.

Increasing our understanding of maladaptation is important for avoiding negative outcomes of adaptation project implementation. However, maladaptation has received limited research attention. Previous research has focused on frameworks that can assist in defining and avoiding maladaptive risk and be applied to adaptation initiative planning processes. Adaptation may cause more significant influences on spatial land change than the direct effect of climate change does. Identifying the adaptation consequences that are likely to result in maladaptation is crucial. A combination of spatial land analysis and climate change analysis can be used for the aforementioned identification. However, empirical case studies on methods that can assess and evaluate the risk of maladaptation by integrating spatial and temporal aspects in a land spatial modeling tool have not been conducted. The present study aimed to fill this research gap by exploring the existing knowledge on maladaptation to climate change. We examined the interaction among spatial analysis, evaluated maladaptation frameworks, and project design to extend our conceptual understanding on maladaptation to climate change. We adopted a systematic review method that involved considering several questions including the following: (a) What are the definitions and categories of maladaptation? (b) What methods and theoretical frameworks exist for the assessment and evaluation of maladaptive risk? (c) How have climate-related research communities considered issues of maladaptation? (d) What are the experimental studies on land use change that can be referred to for minimizing maladaptive risks in future adaptation planning? In conclusion, further research on maladaptation should integrate spatial land analysis methods to facilitate the identification and avoidance of maladaptive risk in the initial stage of adaptation planning.

However, in terms of preparing for catastrophes, few inquiries have been made into the individual propensity to acquire insurance, especially in terms of People with Disabilities (PwD). In this study, we assess the effect of information on the propensity of heads of households to acquire home insurance against forms of natural disasters, particularly flooding. We conduct a survey of over 500 individuals, including blind individuals, to verify the intuition that there is a causal link between the existence of information and the willingness of individuals to acquire flood insurance. The results reveal that visually deficient individuals are approximately 300% more likely to buy this insurance than other individuals. However, when PwD have information regarding the potential risk and harm caused by floods, this marginal effect is attenuated.

These changes will exert negative effects on respiratory and cardiovascular systems, nutritional status, burden of infectious diseases, especially vector-borne infections, and human mental health. Moreover, environmental damages, such as loss of biodiversity, ecological collapse and deterioration of socioeconomic factors such as agricultural and fishery production, and the loss of habitable land, will impulse massive migrations. This article summarizes the impact that climate change is expected to have on respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious diseases and its repercussions on people of extreme ages. It is imperative to achieve the immediate commitment of worldwide national governments to control greenhouse gas emissions. The appropriate technology does exist, but political will is urgently needed to accomplish this goal.

These constraints result in low adaptive capacity of women, which make them more vulnerable to hazards. As more men seek employment opportunities away from home, women are required to acquire new capacities to manage new challenges, including risks from climate change. An action research was conducted to assess impacts of capacity building interventions for women left behind in enhancing adaptive capacity of migrant-sending households in rural areas vulnerable to floods in Nepal. This study finds that capacity-building interventions, which aimed to strengthen autonomous adaptation measures (e.g. precautionary savings and flood preparedness), also positively influenced women to approach formal institutions. Besides, the intervention households were more likely to invest a part of the precautionary savings in flood preparedness measures than control households.

A Framework for Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Dementia Risk and Burden	GERONTOLOGIST			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Cognition; Hazards; Health disparities; Pollution	MENTAL-HEALTH; OLDER-PEOPLE; HEAT; DISPARITIES; STRESS	Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a public health crisis poised to worsen in a changing climate. Substantial dementia burden is modifiable, attributable to risk rooted in social and environmental conditions. Climate change threatens older populations in numerous ways, but implications for cognitive aging are poorly understood. We illuminate key mechanisms by which climate change will shape incidence and lived experiences of ADRD, and propose a framework for strengthening research, clinical, and policy actions around cognitive health in the context of climate change. Direct impacts and indirect risk pathways operating through built, social, interpersonal, and biomedical systems are highlighted. Air pollution compromises brain health directly and via systemic cardiovascular and respiratory ailments. Flooding and extreme temperatures constrain health behaviors like physical activity and sleep. Medical care resulting from climate-related health shocks imposes economic and emotional tolls on people living with dementia and caregivers. Throughout, inequitable distributions of climate-exacerbated risks and adaptive resources compound existing disparities in ADRD incidence, comorbidities, and care burden. Translational research, including work prioritizing underserved communities, is crucial. A mechanistic framework can guide research questions and methods and identify clinical- and policy-level intervention loci for prevention and mitigation of climate-related impacts on ADRD risk and burden.

J	Dhasmana, MK; Mondal, A; Zachariah, M				Dhasmana, Manish Kumar; Mondal, Arpita; Zachariah, Mariam			On the role of climate change in the 2018 flooding event in Kerala	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme event; probabilistic event attribution; climate change; floods; Kerala	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; MODEL EVALUATION; DATA SET; ATTRIBUTION; RAINFALL; ENGLAND; TRENDS; INDIA	The extreme precipitation during August 2018 in Kerala, India was catastrophic, triggering one of the worst floods in history. There is growing evidence of human-induced climate change in driving hydroclimatic extremes across the globe. However, whether and to what degree the 2018 flooding event in Kerala was influenced by climate change has yet to be fully understood. To this end, we present the first formal attribution analysis of the event, using the probabilistic event attribution (PEA) framework. Three methods using (i) Historical and HistoricalNat runs from CMIP6 (general circulation models-based method), (ii) observed records from 1901-2018 for two periods, split at 1950 (time-slice method) and (iii) observations that are scaled to 1901 and 2018 climates (scaling method), are considered for quantifying the risk ratio (RR) of the event. Using an objective approach, the 2018 precipitation event is defined by the return period of the 4 day cumulative precipitation over the Periyar River Basin (PRB), during 15-18 August, 2018. The subsequent flood event is characterized by the return period of the 1 day maximum streamflow at one of the outlets of the PRB, where maximum impact during the event was reported. The results from multiple methods are consistent, suggesting that the event is exceptionally less likely to have been caused by anthropogenic climate change, with RR for the precipitation and flood events ranging from 0.31 to 0.82 and 0.55 to 0.8, respectively. The role of wet antecedent soil moisture conditions, which is found to be the primary driving factor of floods in the PRB, is also found to be unchanged between simulations with and without climate change. Our results highlight the challenges in unequivocal discerning of the climate change signal on regional hydrological events and emphasize the importance of better consideration of local confounding interventions in PEA studies.

Gardens experience threats (e.g., water scarcity) but are also responding through adaptation strategies (e.g., selecting drought-resilient plants). A synthetic overview of how urban gardens are affected by climate change and responding to climate change is unclear. Here, we systematically reviewed articles and book chapters published in the last two decades (2000-2022) to illustrate the relationship between climate change and urban gardening. From 72 documents analyzed with Nvivo Software, we found that there has been an increase in academic publications. Universities from the US (14) and Germany (9) universities are the dominant producers. Evidence shows that climate change can have negative impacts on cities, people and urban food. Suggestions on how to build the adaptation capacity of urban gardens include collecting rainwater, changing plant selection, changing planting times, applying vegetative cover on the soil and other practices. For cities, community and allotment gardens are helpful for adaptation, mitigation and resilience. This includes the capacity to regulate the microclimate, to reduce urban heat island effects and to buffer urban floods, the power to capture carbon, the ability to create social networks and other socio-environmental benefits for urban climate planning.

In this study, the compound effects of climate change and urbanization on organized TC and its flood risk across the Guangdong-Hong Kong -Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) were explored and future projections of 10 models in different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The typical TC named Ewiniar that caused tremendous rainfall and flooding over GBA is taken as a case. We found that future TC will be exacerbated with rainfall band shifting inland and covering larger areas compared to the current scenario due to climate change and urbanization, and rainfall amount in the central rainfall band increases by 24% and 28% under SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5, respectively. Due to the land -atmosphere interactions, future actual direct runoff increased by 7.91%-15.53% during the TC Ewiniar under SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5, leading to further expansion of the area marked with the highest flood risk (24% and 39%, respectively).

The study area is the largest and most important agricultural production area within the Murray Darling Basin (MDB). It produces more than AUD 1.9 billion of agricultural products annually and accounts for about 46% of Australia's total agricultural production. Since Australia's economy largely depends on its natural resources, climate change adversely impacts the economy in various ways. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fifth assessment report (IPCC, AR5), the adaptive capacity and adaptation processes have increased in Australia. The country has implemented policies and management changes in both rural and urban water systems to adapt to future drought, unexpected floods, and other climatic changes. In this study, future catchment runoff has been estimated using the hydrological model, Simplified Hydrolog (SIMHYD), which is integrated with data from three different General Circulation Models (GCMs) and future emission scenarios. Two different representative concentration pathway (RCP) emission scenarios, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, have been used to obtain downscaled future precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the period of 2016 to 2100. Modeling results from the two emission scenarios showed an anticipated warmer and drier climate for the Murrumbidgee River catchment. Runoff in the Murrumbidgee catchment is affected by various dams and weirs, which yields positive results in runoff even when the monthly rainfall trend decreases. The overall runoff simulation result indicated that the impact of climate change is short and intense. The result of the Simplified Hydrolog (SIMHYD) modeling tool used in this study under the RCP 4.5 scenario for the period 2016 to 2045 indicates a significant future impact from climate change on the volumes of runoff in the Murrumbidgee River catchment. For the same period, the climate change prediction showed a decrease in total annual rainfall within the range of 2% to 62%. This reduction in rainfall is projected to decrease river runoff in the upper catchments (e.g., Tharwa, and Yass) by 17% to 58% over the projected periods. However, the runoff trends in the lower sub-catchments (e.g., Borambola) have increased by 137% to 87% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. This increasing potential runoff trend in the lower Murrumbidgee catchments gives an indication to build irrigation dams for dry season irrigation management.

Climate adaptation and risk preparedness in Florida's East Coast cities: views of municipal leaders	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change adaptation; Florida Atlantic Coast; risk perception; city planning	SELF-EFFICACY; PERCEPTIONS; RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE; SOUTHEAST; IMPACT; MEDIA; FLOOD; USA	Cities along Florida's Atlantic coastline are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, posing significant challenges for city planners. How cities see themselves in terms of developing or implementing their climate change adaptation action plans depends, in part, on the extent to which they perceive climate-related events as risks, and their city size. Data were obtained from city leaders (i.e. mayors, city/town managers, or their designees) from 86 cities along Florida's Atlantic Coast from January to May 2021 to quantitatively assess factors influencing city adaptation planning. Validity and reliability were obtained for the survey. Multiple regression analyses showed significant positive correlations between perceived risk, city size, and (self-assessed) climate change preparedness. A statistical interaction was noted; as city size increased, risk perception decreased.

The analysis results indicated that climate change is ongoing. In this era of climate crisis, based on the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) data, we projected the 20-year frequency rainfall for South Korea at intervals of 1 day/24 h. Our results indicate that the maximum rainfall (with a 24 h duration) will increase by similar to 18% in the second half of the 21st century, compared to the current maximum rainfall. Finally, we projected the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve for the infrastructure design of Seoul. According to the projected IDF curve, across all durations, the rainfall intensity was the strongest in the early 21st century, indicating that at present, we are in the midst of a climate crisis. Thus, it is important to develop and implement effective urban and river flood management measures to mitigate the current effects of climate change. Notably, our study can serve as a reference for future studies on climate change and help policymakers and decision-makers develop relevant policies and mitigation strategies related to the effects of climate change.

Consistent assessment of storm surge inundation risk that links probability of hazard occurrence to distribution of economic consequence are scarce due to the lack of historical data and uncertainty of climate change, especially at local scales. This paper proposes a simulation-based method to construct exceedance probability (EP) curves for representing storm surge risk and identifying the economic impact of climate change in the coastal areas of Ise Bay, Japan. The region-specific exceedance probability curves show that risk could be different among different districts. The industry-specific exceedance probability curves show that manufacturing, transport and postal activities, electricity, gas, heat supply and water, and wholesale and retail trade are the most affected sectors in terms of property damage. Services also need to be of concern in terms of business interruption loss. Exceedance probability curves provide complete risk information and our simulation-based approach can contribute to a better understanding of storm surge risk, improve the quantitative assessment of the climate change-driven impacts on coastal areas, and identify vulnerable regions and industrial sectors in detail.

However, few studies consider both climate change and land use change and formulate urban flood control plans for the uncertainty of climate change. This study proposes a real options method based on trinomial tree model to design urban flood control measures under environmental changes. Future rainfall was predicted based on the SDSM model. Land use changes for 2035 and 2050 were predicted using the CA-Markov model. Considering the uncertainty of future climate change, future urban flood control measures based on the real options method were developed, and to compare and analyze them with fixed investment method. The research results show that rainfall and construction land in the study area will increase in the future. The benefit of real options retrofit scheme is higher than the fixed investment retrofit scheme and climate change uncertainty has a greater impact on flood control planning decisions. The research framework proposed in this paper provides an effective basis for the formulation of urban flood control strategies and the design of flood control measures under environ-mental change.

The climate change effect is a real-world issue threatening the existence of species and human beings, thus causing the economic vulnerability. Apart from policymakers, academic researchers are showing their concern on the effect of climate change on economic and socioeconomic vulnerability through publishing research articles in the recent decade. In light of the revolution of research articles, this study applied a bibliometric analysis on the academic research articles to explore the publication trends, themes, impacts, and potential scopes for further studies. Both the Scopus and the Web of Science online databases were used to search for journal articles linked to climate change effects and economic vulnerability. The final data of 229 journal articles were analyzed using bibliometric and visualization tools "Biblioshiny" and "VOSViewer." The findings unveiled an uprising trend in publications and posited several themes, mainly exposure, sensitivity, drought, and flood by means of climate change effects that affect economic vulnerability. Based on the findings and review of literature, several research gaps were identified and offered opportunities for further studies. The policymakers can attribute attention to encouraging more research in several areas in addition to agriculture and coastal regions.

Climate models project increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation regimes which will alter the frequency, magnitude. and geographic distribution of climate-related hazards including flood, drought and heat waves. In the mining industry, climate change impacts are an area of research around the world, mostly in relation to the mining industry in Australia and Canada, where mining policies and mitigation actions based on the results of this research were adopted and applied. In Poland, there is still a lack of research on how climate change. and especially extreme weather events, impacts mining activity. This impact may be of particular importance in Poland, where the mining industry is in the process of intensive transition. The paper presents an overview of hazardous events in mining in Poland that were related to extreme weather phenomena.

J	Quandt, A				Quandt, Amy			Contribution of agroforestry trees for climate change adaptation: narratives from smallholder farmers in Isiolo, Kenya	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Adaptation; Agroforestry; Climate change; Kenya; Sensitivity; Vulnerability		Agroforestry is often praised as a sustainable approach for the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate change and variability in Africa. The environmental, economic, and social benefits of agroforestry can contribute to climate change adaptation efforts; however, most studies to date are quantitative and do not focus on specific natural hazards. To address these gaps, this study draws from the concepts of vulnerability and adaptation to explore how individuals from 20 smallholder farming households in semi-arid Isiolo County, Kenya have benefited from their agroforestry trees during drought and flood events. A total of 83 qualitative interviews were conducted with both male and female household heads. The interviews were recorded, and interview text was coded into major themes. The results highlight (1) the contributions of agroforestry trees to reducing sensitivity and increasing adaptive capacity to drought and flood events, as well as (2) the key characteristics of drought-important and flood-important agroforestry trees. In both drought and flood events agroforestry had an important role to play in reducing sensitivity, largely through improving environmental conditions (shade, soil erosion, windbreaker, microclimate regulation), and increasing adaptive capacity by providing critical tree products and financial benefits (fruit, food, firewood, construction materials, fodder, traditional medicines, money from sales of fruit products). Agriculture is often considered the livelihood strategy most vulnerable to climate change, and thus better understanding how to adapt agriculture to the impacts of climate change is critical for both the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and global food security efforts.

Climate change leads to changes in precipitation patterns and thereby changes in patterns of discharge and flood inundation. Consequently, estimating these changes using any numerical models is deemed essential to develop countermeasures. There is growing anticipation of climate change over Cambodia and the lower Prek Thnot River Basin, yet it is unknown how serious climate change is on the basin's hydrological and especially flood characteristics. Thus, this study aims to assess the change impacts by integrating the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to apply in the lower Prek Thnot River Basin, Cambodia, whose susceptibility to climate change is relatively high. The RRI model was integrated with the discharge outputs from the SWAT model to simulate four flood events: 2000, the biggest flood event, 2001, 2010, and 2020 flood events. Hydrographs, water levels, and flood extent maps for these events were generated. The biggest flood event of 2000 was set as the baseline period for a possible flood event in the future projected climate in the 2030s and 2060s using three general circulation models (GCMs) [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 3 (GFDL-CM3), Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2, coupled with Russell and interactive terrestrial Carbon Cycle (GISS-E2-R-CC), and Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model, version 5A, Medium Resolution (IPSL-CM5A-MR)] under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) including RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results of climate change suggested that flood magnitude in the lower Prek Thnot River Basin will vary slightly in the 2030s and greatly in the 2060s. In the 2030s, relative changes in precipitation between -8.2% and 21.6% could lead to relative changes in extreme flow (Q(5), flow exceeding 5% of the time) of -21.4% - 8.4%, changes in peak water level of -6.3% - 1.3%, and changes in inundated area of -12% - 7.4%. In the 2060s, relative changes in precipitation between -17.7% and 46.4% could lead to relative changes in Q(5) of -39.3% - 13.5%, in peak water level of -19.6% - 5.2%, and in inundated area from -31.4% to 20.7%. These relative changes imply the increases and decreases due to climate change compared with the present climate. Overall, the resultant outputs of this study revealed how impactful climate change is on the basin's hydrological and flood characteristics, which have long been in question. The results can thus be deployed to underpin decision making and offset the impending negative impacts of climate change on flood inundation within the lower Prek Thnot River Basin.

J	Abraham, A; Kundapura, S				Abraham, Alka; Kundapura, Subrahmanya			Assessing the Impacts of Land Use, Land Cover, and Climate Change on the Hydrological Regime of a Humid Tropical Basin	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article						Ecologically relevant flow; Google earth engine (GEE); Land change modeler (LCM); Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT); Representative concentration pathway (RCP)	RIVER; FLOW; PREDICTION; MODELS	Climate change and land use land cover (LULC) change are two major factors influencing river basin hydrology. This study explored these drivers' isolated and combined impacts on the ecologically relevant flow in the Achencoil basin, Kerala, India. The LULC classification in the study is carried out with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and Land Change Modeler (LCM) is incorporated for change detection and projection. The future climate data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) is used for climate change impact assessment. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is employed to simulate streamflow under LULC and climate change scenarios. The historical and projected future LULC change in the basin revealed an increase in the built-up and barren land, with a significant decrease in agricultural and forest areas. The results show that the projected future precipitation will decrease under the RCP 4.5 and increase under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The projected average maximum and minimum temperature are expected to increase under both scenarios in the basin. The LULC 2050 scenario shows the most significant rise in average annual streamflow, at 7.5%. Whereas in the climate change scenarios, the average annual flow decreases under RCP 4.5 and increases under RCP 8.5. The combined impacts of climate change and LULC change are relatively higher than the isolated effects of these drivers in the basin. The study outcomes are expected to help policymakers consider the effect of climate change and LULC change on the river's hydrology so as to implement the management activities that account for the riverine ecosystem. Changes in land use land cover and meteorological parameters are important environmental issues that must be pointed out. These changes will affect the river flow and eventually affect the river ecosystem. The current research investigates the combined effects of land use land cover and climate change in the flow of the Achencoil basin in India. This study area is one of the most frequently flooded in the state. As a result, the projected climate and land use land cover provide an idea of future streamflow in the basin. This research enables a better understanding of the response of streamflow components to climate variability and land use land cover changes in the Achencoil basin, which might help policymakers develop strategies for regional water resource management. Implementing these policies and management strategies will necessitate collaboration and coordination across various levels of government, private sector, and local communities in order to mitigate the risk and support a sustainable riverine ecosystem.

Taking the upper reaches of Weihe River Basin as a case in Western China, a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was established to quantitatively simulate the impact of land use and climate change on runoff changes, while 4 extreme land-use scenarios and 24 temperature and precipitation scenarios assumptions were proposed to simulate the response of runoff to land use and climate changes. The SWAT simulation results showed that the sensitivity parameters affecting the model simulation were the CANMX, CN2, SOL_K, CH_N2, and SOL_AWC. The correlation index R-2 and the efficiency coefficient E-NS of the upper Weihe River were both in the range of 0.75-0.78, the relative error PS between the simulated results and the measured runoff was below 10%, suggesting the good applicability of the SWAT model in this study area. Using the improved SWAT model to simulate the peak runoff (flood) simulation value is generally smaller than the measured value, and the absolute value of the error is less than 6%. The expansion of wasteland increased the runoff by over 90% on average, the expansion of cultivated land increased the runoff by 8% on average, and the expansion of woodland and grassland increased the surface runoff by 6% on average. When the precipitation decreased by 25% and the temperature increased by 22%, the smallest runoff was obtained in the simulation. Accordingly, when the precipitation increased by 25% and the temperature decreased by 22%, the maximum annual runoff was obtained. By decomposing the contribution rate of human activities and climate change to runoff, it showed that the contribution rate of human activities to the reduction of runoff was greater than that of climate change. This study can provide scientific reference for the simulation and prediction of future floods.

Although the impact of climate change on dysentery is being studied in specific areas, a systematic review is lacking. We searched the worldwide literature using three sets of keywords and six databases. We identified and selected 98 studies during 1866-2019 and reviewed the relevant findings. Climate change, including longterm variations in factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, and short-term variations in extreme weather events, such as floods and drought, mostly had a harmful impact on dysentery incidence. However, some uncertainty over the exact effects of climate factors exists, specifically in the different indexes for the same climate factor, various determinant indexes for different dysentery burdens, and divergent effects for different population groups. These complicate the accurate quantification of such impacts. We generalized two types of methods: sensitivity analysis, used to detect the sensitivity of dysentery to climate change, including Pearson's and Spearman's correlations; and mathematical models, which quantify the impact of climate on dysentery, and include models that examine the associations (including negative binomial regression models) and quantify correlations (including single generalized additive models and mixed models). Projection studies mostly predict disease risks, and some predict disease incidence based on climate models under RCP 4.5. Since some geographic heterogeneity exists in the climate-dysentery relationship, modeling and projection of dysentery incidence on a national or global scale remain challenging. The reviewed results have implications for the present and future. Current research should be extended to select appropriate and robust climate-dysentery models, reasonable disease burden measure, and appropriate climate models and scenarios. We recommend future studies focus on qualitative investigation of the mechanism involved in the impact of climate on dysentery, and accurate projection of dysentery incidence, aided by advancing accuracy of extreme weather forecasting.

The key to addressing these health challenges is adaptation carried out in cities through collaboration between institutions, including public health ones. Through semi-structured interviews (n = 16), this study investigated experiences and perceptions of what public health aspects are considered by urban and public health planners and researchers when planning climate change adaptation in the coastal cities of Soderhamn (Sweden), Porto (Portugal) and Navotas (the Philippines). Results of the thematic analysis indicated that participating stakeholders were aware of the main climate risks threatening their cities (rising water levels and flooding, extreme temperatures, and air pollution). In addition, the interviewees talked about collaboration with other sectors, including the public health sector, in implementing climate change adaptation plans. However, the inclusion of the public health sector as a partner in the process was identified in only two cities, Navotas and Porto. Furthermore, the study found that there were few aspects pertaining to public health (water and sanitation, prevention of heat-related and water-borne diseases, and prevention of the consequences associated with heat waves in vulnerable groups such as children and elderly persons) in the latest climate change adaptation plans posted on each city's website. Moreover, participants pointed to different difficulties: insufficient financial resources, limited intersectoral collaboration for climate change adaptation, and lack of involvement of the public health sector in the adaptation processes, especially in one of the cities in which climate change adaptation was solely the responsibility of the urban planners. Studies using larger samples of stakeholders in larger cities are needed to better understand why the public health sector is still almost absent in efforts to adapt to climate change.

The Possibilities of Capturing Rainwater and Reducing the Impact of Floods: A Proposal for the City of Beira, Mozambique	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; sustainable development; urban water management; water stress; rainwater harvesting; stormwater capture efficiency; water supply system	WATER MANAGEMENT; HARVESTING SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; EFFICIENCY; RESOURCES; TANKS; CATCHMENTS; LESSONS	Modern societies face various challenges, including climate change, rapid urbanization, and sometimes inadequate urban planning policies. In recent years, extreme weather events have received increasing attention for their impacts on cities, humans, and ecosystems worldwide, particularly on coastal towns in Mozambique, such as cyclones, floods, water pollution, and water scarcity, demonstrating their vulnerability to climate change. Cities must adapt to cope with the pressure on their water resources, and it is essential to ensure that communities have access to safe, reliable, and affordable water. A viable way to promote this resilience and simultaneously reduce costs in domestic budgets is to use rainwater to meet daily needs where water quality parameters are not required for consumption. According to the results of this study, it is possible to significantly reduce potable water use from the municipal water supply network by harvesting rainwater, up to 40% when the use does not require potable water at all, proactively protecting this vital resource. In addition to these direct benefits, the large-scale deployment of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in densely urbanized areas can also provide indirect benefits, such as reducing peak flow volumes in stormwater drainage systems and potentially reducing the frequency of urban floods. These benefits result from the reduction in the volume and duration of water sent to the drainage network, which can help to improve the overall resilience of communities in the face of climate change and other challenges.

Increases in such events and other circumstances are contributing to the change in the environmental conditions in the deltas, which translates into changes in the productivity of ecosystems and, ultimately, into impacts on livelihoods and human well-being. Accordingly, climate change will affect not only the biophysical conditions of deltaic environments but also their economic circumstances. Furthermore, these economic implications will spill over to other regions through goods and services supply chains and via migration. In this paper we take a wider view about some of the specific studies within this Special Issue. We analyse the extent to which the biophysical context of the deltas contributes to the sustainability of the different economic activities, in the deltas and in other regions. We construct a set of environmental-extended multiregional input-output databases and Social Accounting Matrices that are used to trace the flow of provisioning ecosystem services across the supply chains, providing a view of the links between the biophysical environment and the economic activities. We also integrate this information into a Computable General Equilibrium model to assess how the changes in the provision of natural resources due to climate change can potentially affect the economies of the deltas and linked regions, and how this in turn affects economic vulnerability and sustainability in these regions.

Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are inherently climate-sensitive due to the sensitivity of tick lifecycles to climate. Key direct climate and weather sensitivities include survival of individual ticks, and the duration of development and host-seeking activity of ticks. These sensitivities mean that in some regions a warming climate may increase tick survival, shorten life-cycles and lengthen the duration of tick activity seasons. Indirect effects of climate change on host communities may, with changes in tick abundance, facilitate enhanced transmission of tick-borne pathogens. High temperatures, and extreme weather events (heat, cold, and flooding) are anticipated with climate change, and these may reduce tick survival and pathogen transmission in some locations. Studies of the possible effects of climate change on TTBDs to date generally project poleward range expansion of geographical ranges (with possible contraction of ranges away from the increasingly hot tropics), upslope elevational range spread in mountainous regions, and increased abundance of ticks in many current endemic regions. However, relatively few studies, using long-term (multi-decade) observations, provide evidence of recent range changes of tick populations that could be attributed to recent climate change. Further integrated 'One Health' observational and modeling studies are needed to detect changes in TTBD occurrence, attribute them to climate change, and to develop predictive models of public- and animal-health needs to plan for TTBD emergence.

Hydrological conditions of phytophilic fish reproduction in the Lower Don River under the influence of climate change and flow regulation	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Early Access						Lower Don; Climate change; Tsimlyansk reservoir; Bream fingerlings; Floodplain spawning grounds; Fish catch reduction	WATER REGIME; RUNOFF	Despite the significant role that the Lower Don plays in Russia's fishing industry, the region's fisheries remain in a depressed state. It is well understood that the Tsimlyansk reservoir impacts the region's fisheries, but the potential influence of climate change and associated reductions in snowmelt water flow remains under debate. The present study provides the first investigation of the effects of reservoir management and reduction in snowmelt water flow due to global warming on fish spawning independently. Using estimates of water discharge in the lower reaches of the Don, in the absence of the Tsimlyansk reservoir, the results showed that climate-related factors, although still significant, had a smaller effect on water discharge, compared with reservoir management regimes. Hydrological characteristics affecting fish reproduction (i.e., water discharge, water level, area and duration of floodplain inundation, and fingerling abundance) are decreasing under the reservoir influence by a factor of 1.5-3.2, while the declines associated with climate change are a factor of 1.4-2.1. Artificial fish reproduction and improvements in management of the Tsimlyansk reservoir could lead to restoration of fish stocks in the Lower Don.	[Goncharov, A. V.; Semenova, A. A.; Tsyplenkov, A.

Measuring Social Vulnerability to Climate Change at the Coast: Embracing Complexity and Context for More Accurate and Equitable Analysis	WATER			English	Review						social vulnerability; index; climate change; adaptation; personas	COMMUNITY VULNERABILITY; CHANGE IMPACTS; FLOOD HAZARDS; ADAPTATION; RISK; DISASTERS; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; DROUGHT; FICTION	Social vulnerability indices are often used to quantify differential vulnerability to the impacts of climate change within coastal communities. In this review, we examine how "tried and tested" methodologies for analysing social vulnerability to climate hazards at the coast are being challenged by a new wave of indices that offer more nuanced conclusions about who is vulnerable, how, and why. Instead of producing high-level, generalised, and static conclusions about vulnerability, this new wave of indices engages more deeply with the interlinked socioeconomic, cultural, political, and economic specificities of place, as well as the multi-scalar and temporal dynamics, incongruities, and inconsistencies that are inherent to peoples' lived, felt experiences of social vulnerability. By integrating these complex observations into an output that is still readily accessible to decision- and policy-makers, the new wave of indices supports the pursuit of more tailored, context-appropriate, and equitable climate adaptation. We suggest one way that these more nuanced forms of vulnerability analyses might be operationalised, by reflecting on an experimental research project that uses personas or fictional characters to examine social vulnerability to climate change in coastal Aotearoa New Zealand.

Two-timescale response of a large Antarctic ice shelf to climate change	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SOUTHERN-OCEAN; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; MODEL; SHEET; SEA; CAVITY; IMPACTS	A potentially irreversible threshold in Antarctic ice shelf melting would be crossed if the ocean cavity beneath the large Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf were to become flooded with warm water from the deep ocean. Previous studies have identified this possibility, but there is great uncertainty as to how easily it could occur. Here, we show, using a coupled ice sheet-ocean model forced by climate change scenarios, that any increase in ice shelf melting is likely to be preceded by an extended period of reduced melting. Climate change weakens the circulation beneath the ice shelf, leading to colder water and reduced melting. Warm water begins to intrude into the cavity when global mean surface temperatures rise by approximately 7 degrees C above pre-industrial, which is unlikely to occur this century. However, this result should not be considered evidence that the region is unconditionally stable. Unless global temperatures plateau, increased melting will eventually prevail. New simulations find that one of Antarctica's largest ice shelves, the Filchner-Ronne, may be less vulnerable to climate change than previously thought. Melting of the ice shelf initially decreases for many decades, and only increases when global warming exceeds approximately 7 degrees C.

Climate change impacts on flood peaks in Britain for a range of global mean surface temperature changes	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; flooding; hydrological modelling; probabilistic projections; UKCP18	DEGREES-C; PROBABILISTIC IMPACTS	An increase in extreme weather events is leading to increased flood occurrence and risk in many areas. Although climate mitigation strategies are being implemented, it is widely accepted that societies must adapt to climate variability and climate change. Traditional climate change impact studies have used projections for future time-slices, often for a range of possible emissions scenarios. Recently however, there has been a move to instead consider climate change impacts relative to global mean surface temperature (GMST) change, to try to encourage action to avoid the more severe impacts from higher GMST changes. To support adaptation planning, more localised information on impacts is required. Here, data on the potential range of changes in flood peaks is generated by combining flood response surfaces and the new UK Climate Projections 2018, for every river cell on a 1 km grid across Britain, for GMST changes of 1-4.5 degrees C. The results show significant spatial variation, with impacts typically higher in the west than the east, and generally increasing with GMST change. Some southern regions show flood peak changes accelerating with GMST change. The changes in flood peaks can be translated into changes in flood inundation and associated flood risk under alternative adaptation assumptions.

Despite its importance, the integration of CCE in schools is challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of climate science and the obstacles and demands of everyday school reality. Here, we examine the case of satellite Remote Sensing (RS) for Earth Observation (EO) as an innovative tool for facilitating CCE. We focus on Greece, a country that, despite being a hot spot for climate change, shows a low level of CCE integration in schools and awareness for EO-based educational resources. Based on interviews with in-service teachers, our research reveals the following: (a) there is a high interest in how satellites depict environmental phenomena; (b) EO is considered an efficient vehicle for promoting CCE in schools because it illustrates climate change impacts most effectively; (c) local natural disasters, such as intense forest fires and floods, are more familiar to students and, thus, preferable for teaching when compared to global issues, such as the greenhouse effect and sea level rise; and (d) educators are in favor of short, hands-on, EO-based activities (also known as "activity-shots"), as the most useful material format for integrating climate change topics in their everyday teaching practice.

Pakistan's low adaptive capacity due to high poverty rate, limited financial resources and shortage of physical resources, and continual extreme climatic events including varying temperature, continual flooding, melting glaciers, saturation of lakes, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, avalanches, droughts, scarcity of water, pest diseases, human healthcare issues, and seasonal and lifestyle changes have persistently threatened the ecosystem, biodiversity, human communities, animal habitations, forests, lands, and oceans with a potential to cause further damages in the future. The likely effect of climate change on common residents of Pakistan with comparison to the world and their per capita impact of climate change are terribly high with local animal species such as lions, vultures, dolphins, and tortoise facing extinction regardless of generating and contributing diminutively to global GHG emissions. The findings of the review suggested that GHG emissions cause climate change which has impacted agriculture livestock and forestry, weather trends and patterns, food water and energy security, and society of Pakistan. This review is a sectorial evaluation of climate change mitigation and adaption approaches in Pakistan in the aforementioned sectors and its economic costs which were identified to be between 7 to 14 billion USD per annum. The research suggested that governmental interference is essential for sustainable development of the country through strict accountability of resources and regulation implemented in the past for generating state-of-the-art climate policy.

J	Huang-Lachmann, JT				Huang-Lachmann, Jo-Ting			Systematic review of smart cities and climate change adaptation	SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL			English	Review						Benefits; Climate change	URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FLOOD RISK; SUSTAINABLE CITIES; CHANGE IMPACTS; ENERGY; BENEFITS; EUROPE; CITY	Purpose Understanding policy consequences for cities is very important in an urban setting, especially in this era of developing solutions for grand challenges. Climate change adaptation and smart cities are emerging topics in the climate change and sustainability domain. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve a better understanding of policy consequences and exploring synergies of climate change adaptation and smart cities are valuable for both research and practice. Design/methodology/approach This paper systematically reviews synergies of smart city applications in urban climate change adaptation literature. A systematic literature review and content analysis are carried out to answer the research questions and a theoretically based smart cities concept matrix with synergetic coproduction theory is used to assess the empirical studies. Findings Key findings are that the model of synergetic coproduction could identify the benefits co-existing in smart city and climate change adaptation. While smart people and smart government play the fundamental roles, synergies could co-occur in other smart city dimensions. Smart city applications in climate change adaptation could increase competitiveness in cities by exploiting the opportunities as well as reducing the harmful risks. Originality/value This study combines two emerging topics in the assessment, climate change adaptation and smart cities, and represents a new way of assessing literature and possibly policy outcomes for the cities. By using the theoretical framework from smart cities and theory of coproduction, a theory-based framework is developed for assessing the empirical studies of climate adaptation in cities. The findings from the systematic literature review indicate relations among smart city dimensions in a clear manner and also identify the synergies of smart cities and climate adaptation.

We quantify fluvial flood risk due to changing climate in a mixed-use watershed in Michigan, USA. We apply two approaches to project future climate change: an ensemble of temperature and precipitation perturbations on the historical record and an ensemble of global and regional climate models. We incorporate climate projections into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate daily streamflow, then quantify flood risk using indices related to flood probability, duration, magnitude, and frequency. Results indicate rising temperatures may counteract small increases in precipitation, likely due to increased evapotranspiration. Climate model data without bias correction used in SWAT produced reasonable future streamflow changesd-similar to the perturbation of historical climatedtherefore retaining the predicted change in the flood frequency distribution. This work advances the application of climate models in SWAT for flood risk evaluation at watershed scales. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ires, I				Ires, Idil			Intensive Agriculture as Climate Change Adaptation? Economic and Environmental Tradeoffs in Securing Rural Livelihoods in Tanzanian River Basins	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; adaptation; intensive agriculture; growth corridors; Tanzania	FOOD SECURITY; GREAT RUAHA; VULNERABILITY; IRRIGATION; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; CAPITALISM; STRATEGIES; INSURANCE; MIGRATION	Tanzania is one of the East African countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Droughts and floods in 2015-16 had devastating effects on food production, crop failures and livestock deaths reaching record levels. One of the underlying projects of the Tanzanian government to mitigate these impacts is the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridors of Tanzania (SAGCOT), an area spanning the country's largest river basin, the Rufiji, where it collaborates with national and transnational companies to intensify irrigated crop production. Irrigation, drought-tolerant seeds, and employment are three of the key government-advised strategies to help smallholders increase crop yield, adapt to climate change, and alleviate poverty through the corridor. However, little research is available on whether these goals have been achieved. This paper aims to contribute to the literature by assessing harvest and income levels following the 2015-16 drought. Through fieldwork conducted in 2016-17 in Usangu, a key paddy production area in the Great Ruaha Basin within SAGCOT, data is collected from documents and 114 informants. This study finds that irrigation did not significantly contribute to rising paddy production in the case study. Prioritizing the downstream national park and the energy sector, the government periodically cut down the water access of the case-study irrigation scheme, which exacerbated water stress. Moreover, though farmers widely shifted to intensive farming and used hybrid seeds, mainly, the high-income groups ensured and increased the crop yield and profit. The-low income groups encountered crop failure and, due to rising production costs, debt. Many of them left farming, impoverished, and sought to secure subsistence through wage laboring. This study discusses the shortcomings of the transitions from traditional to intensive farming and from farming to employment as climate change adaptation strategies and draws critical policy-relevant conclusions.

J	Sekhri, S; Kumar, P; Fürst, C; Pandey, R				Sekhri, Simran; Kumar, Praveen; Fuerst, Christine; Pandey, Rajiv			Mountain specific multi-hazard risk management framework (MSMRMF): Assessment and mitigation of multi-hazard and climate change risk in the Indian Himalayan Region	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Adaptation; Climate service; Coping capacity; Societal response; Resilience; Vulnerability	CHANGE VULNERABILITY; CHANGE ADAPTATION; WESTERN-HIMALAYAS; SOCIAL MEDIA; CHALLENGES; IMPACT; BIODIVERSITY; RESILIENCE; CAPACITY; FORESTS	Mountains are characterized by their specificities such as fragility, marginality and remoteness. They are prone to various hazards such as drought, flood, forest fire, landslide and therefore physical, ecological and social systems of the mountains are at risk. Climate change adds to intensifying the magnitude of multi-hazard risk in mountains. The present study attempts to evaluate risk induced by multi-hazard and climate change in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework. The proposed multi-hazard risk index was based on indicators from a broader domain and applied on 109 administrative districts of IHR. Exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and coping capacity were defined using comprehensive and sub-regional indicators identified through inductive and deductive approaches. The result showed that the differential risks among the districts of IHR were governed by the multiplicity of the factor such as demography, amenities, natural capital, partnership, technology and spatial specificities of the districts. The result highlighted the need of inclusion of spatial specificities for the risk mitigation in the IHR and therefore a Mountain Specific Risk Management Framework (MSMRMF) was proposed for sustaining the mountainous communities. The proposed MSMRMF contained two broad components as risk assessment and risk addressal. The framework detailed the risk mitigation and coping strategies (based on adjustment of internal and external strengths) for addressing risks. Risk mitigation was proposed to achieved through habitation resilience, natural capital enhancement, external partnerships, climate change adaptation, and technological interventions. The framework would provide an insight of risk and risk management strategies for the multi-hazard prone mountain regions for the sustainable development under the global change.

A framework was applied to assess the impacts of climate change and land use/cover change (LUCC) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was used to prioritize watershed management alternatives by comparing watershed management criteria and alternatives using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Framework findings showed a 69 and 31% decline in runoff, and a 58 and 42% increment in evapotranspiration (ET) due to climate change and LUCC, respectively. The top prioritized suitable alternatives were water harvesting structure (WHS) and vegetative cover (VC). Suitability analysis showed that 63.61 and 16.56% area of the SRB were moderately to highly suitable for WHS, respectively. For soil and water management, VC has been found suitable to moderately suitable for 72.68 and 26.75% of the basin area, respectively. So, there should be adoption of such measures which will assist in configuring the climate adaptive strategies.

They are key factors related to farmers' attitudes towards the environment and climate change. Several methodological approaches, which were considered to be preferable for measuring the level of risk of an economic agent, ranging from highly risk-tolerant to highly risk-averse attitudes, are available. The Multiple Price List (MPL) method is one of the stated approaches that is gaining relevance. In this study, we apply the MPL and relate the risk outcomes to farmers' socio-economic characteristics and their perceptions of the environment and climate change. Data were collected using a face-to-face survey, carried out with a group of 370 farmers of an irrigation district, located in the northwest of Mexico. The results showed a risk level of about 0.32, according to the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) coefficient, locating farmers of the region in a risk-averse group. The heterogeneity analysis showed that the socioeconomic factors and the perceptions of climate change are related to the farmers ' stated risk level. Farmers who are young women, with a tendency to use public support for structural investment, were shown to be risk-tolerant. Farmers considered floods, hail, diseases, pests, and weed growth incidences to be the most frequent weather patterns in the region.

We surveyed planners and reviewed more than 150 plans to determine how communities responded to the state mandate along three domains: planning intelligence, SLR responses, and collaboration. We learned that the mandate spurred SLR planning, but that local SLR planning responses varied widely, ranging from complacent compliance to progressive planning responses. Further research is needed to clarify underlying motivators for these varied responses, as well as connections between policy adoption and implementation. Takeaway for practice Flexible mandates allow for discretion in how localities respond to complex, ever-changing, long-term, and uncertain phenomena like climate change and SLR. Commitment to addressing these challenges can be bolstered by state mandates that provide political cover and an impetus to move adaptation planning forward. Such flexibility can lead to inconsistent and vague policies. Thus, mandates can spur local policy adoption but cannot ensure substantive responses to climate change. Meaningful responses to climate change adaptation still depend heavily on local commitment, capacity, and competence of planners.

Agriculture sector also contributes to the causes of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can significantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries. However, barriers to the adoption of GHG mitigating agricultural practices, mainly the financial and institutional barriers, need to be appropriately addressed to achieve the desired level of mitigation.

However, the climate change impact on the hurricane rainfall-induced flood risk has not been investigated well yet, which leads to the potential increase in the flood risk in the future being overlooked. Investigation of future hurricane rainfall-induced flood risk can be very time-consuming because of the high resolution of the models for climate-dependent hazard simulation and regional loss assessment. Therefore, this study developed a statistical model for future hurricane freshwater flood loss assessment considering climate change scenarios by utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs) and gradient boosting. Future hurricane freshwater flood risks to residential buildings in the southeastern US coastal states were investigated with the model. It was found that the hurricane rainfall-induced freshwater flood loss can increase by 16% and 30% from 2020 to 2030 and from 2090 to 2100, respectively. The investigation suggests the need to consider climate change impact on future flood risk management practices.

The impacts of changing climate and streamflow on nutrient speciation in a large Prairie reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; CE-QUAL-W2; Large multi-purpose reservoir; Eutrophication	ICE-COVERED PERIOD; WATER-QUALITY; LAKE DIEFENBAKER; MODELING APPROACH; LOADINGS	Climate mediated warming water temperature, drought and extreme flooding are projected to shift the phenology of nutrients in receiving lakes and reservoirs further intensifying eutrophication and algal blooms, especially in temperate reservoirs. An emerging issue in reservoir management is the prediction of climate change impacts, a necessity for sound decision making and sustainable management. Lake Diefenbaker is a large multipurpose reservoir in the Canadian Prairies. In this study, the impact of climate change on nutrient speciation in Lake Diefenbaker is examined using loosely linked SpAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) and CE-QUAL-W2 models. Two climate mediated scenarios, RCP 8.5 representing the most extreme climate change, and climate induced streamflow were modelled. Nutrient levels are anticipated to double under the climate change and streamflow scenarios. Winter and spring were identified as hot moments for nitrogen pollution with a plausible saturation of nitrous oxides in the future. Of concern is a plausible recycling of nitrate through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. Summer and fall on the other hand represent the period for phosphorus enrichment and internal loading with a probable succession of cyanobacteria in the summer.	[Akomeah, E.; Lindenschmidt, K.

Due to the high degree of exposure and better insight of ground realities, they may have rich traditional knowledge of perception, prediction, and adaptation to climate change. We accessed and illustrated the traditional knowledge on fish and fisheries from the region through participatory rural appraisal (PRA). Our study revealed that ecological and climatic circumstances are maintained through the traditional system of governance and local self-government. Local skills, tools, techniques, wisdom, beliefs and costumes of the aboriginal people act as a shock absorber during disasters and successfully build resilience to climatic hazards. Most of this knowledge was transmitted over successive generations and became a part of living, cultural and religion sustenance. Adaptation strategies at community level fisheries helps in reducing vulnerabilities to extreme weather such as drought, flood and erratic rainfall pattern. Adaptation to climate change in fisheries can decipher through strategies available from fine-scale spatial and grassroots levels. Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation efforts can only be achieved through extensive assessment, research, recognition and promotion of local skills, culture, indigenous knowledge as well as community-based fisheries.

The Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences Scientific Statement on Climate Change - Its Impacts In Canada, and the Critical Role of Earth Scientists in Mitigation and Adaptation	GEOSCIENCE CANADA			English	Article							PERMAFROST CARBON; SEA-LEVEL; ACCUMULATION; THAW; CO2	The Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences (CFES) has issued this statement to summarize the science, effects, and implications of climate change. We highlight the role of Earth scientists in documenting and mitigating climate change, and in managing and adapting to its consequences in Canada. CFES is the coordinated voice of Canada's Earth Sciences community with 14 member organizations representing some 15,000 geoscientists. Our members are drawn from academia, industry, education, and government. The mission of CFES is to ensure decision makers and the public understand the contributions of Earth Science to Canadian society and the economy. Climate change has become a national and global priority for all levels of government. The geological record shows us that the global climate has changed throughout. Earth's history, but the current rates of change are almost unprecedented. Over the last 70 years, levels of common greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere have steadily increased. Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is now 418 parts per million - its highest of the last three million years. The chemical (isotopic) composition of carbon in the atmosphere indicates the increase in GHGs is due to burning fossil fuels. GHGs absorb energy emitted from Earth's surface and re-radiate it back, warming the lower levels of the atmosphere. Climatic adjustments that have recently occurred are, in practical terms, irreversible, but further change can be mitigated by lowering emissions of GHGs. Climate change is amplified by three important Earth system processes and effects. First, as the climate warms evaporation increases, raising atmospheric concentrations of water vapour, itself a GHG - and adding to warming. Second, loss of ice cover from the polar ice sheets and glaciers exposes larger areas of land and open water - leading to greater absorption of heat from the sun. Third, thawing of near-surface permafrost releases additional GHGs (primarily CO2 and methane) during decay of organic matter previously preserved frozen in the ground. Some impacts of climate change are incremental and steadily occurring, such as melting of glaciers and ice sheets, with consequent sea level rise. Others are intermittent, such as extreme weather events, like hurricanes - but are becoming more frequent. Summer water shortages are increasingly common in western Canada as mountain snowpacks melt earlier and summer river flows decline. In northern Canada, warming and thawing of near-surface permafrost has led to deterioration of infrastructure and increased costs for buildings that now require chilled foundations. Other consequences of unchecked climate change include increased coastal erosion, increases in the number and size of wildfires, and reduction in winter road access to isolated northern communities. Reductions in net GHG emissions are urgently required to mitigate the many effects of further climate change. Industrial and public works development projects must now assess the effects of climate change in their planning, design, and management. Cities, municipalities, and rural communities need to plan new residential development carefully to avoid enhanced risk of flooding, coastal erosion, or wildfire. Earth Science knowledge and expertise is integral to exploration and development of new metals and Earth materials required for a carbon-neutral future, and in the capture and storage of CO2 within the Earth. Earth Science is also central to society's adaptation to new climatic regimes and reduction of risks. This includes anticipation, assessment, and management of extreme events, development of new standards and guidelines for geotechnical and engineering practice, and revision to regulations that consider climate change. Geoscientists also have an important role in the education of students and the public on the reasons for necessary action. Canada is uniquely positioned with its strong global geoscientific leadership, its vast landmass, and its northern terrain to effectively leverage research activities around climate change. Geoscience tools and geoscientists' skills will be integral to Canada's preparation for climate change.

This study investigates the future water availability in the Langtang basin, Central Himalayas, Nepal under climate change scenarios using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. The daily snow area for the region was derived from MODIS images. The outputs of climate models were used to project the temperature and precipitation until 2100. Three ML models, including Gated recurrent unit (GRU), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Recurrent neural network (RNN), were developed for snowmelt runoff prediction, and their performance was compared based on statistical indicators. The result suggests that the mean temperature of the basin could rise by 4.98 degrees C by the end of the century. The annual average precipitation in the basin is likely to increase in the future, especially due to high monsoon rainfall, but winter precipitation could decline. The annual river discharge is projected to upsurge significantly due to increased precipitation and snowmelt, and no shift in hydrograph is expected in the future. Among three ML models, the LSTM model performed better than GRU and RNN models. In summary, this study depicts severe future climate change in the region and quantifies its effect on river discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the suitability of the LSTM model in streamflow prediction in the data-scarce HKH region. The outcomes of this study will be useful for water resource managers and planners in developing strategies to harness the positive impacts and offset the negative effects of climate change in the basin.

Monirul			Climate change risk perceptions and agricultural adaptation strategies in vulnerable riverine char islands of Bangladesh	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; Risk perception index; Adaptation strategies; Riverine char dwellers; Agricultural adaptation	COMMUNITIES; SECURITY; IMPACTS	Farmers in the riverine char islands of Bangladesh are frequently affected by climate change due to their proximity to the river and heavy reliance on agriculture for their livelihoods. The present study evaluates char dwellers? risk perceptions and agricultural adaptations to climate change. Survey data were collected from 98 households, and focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire from Rydas Bari char under the Gaibandha District of Bangladesh. A standardized risk perception index was created using a four point Likert scale against sixteen climatic events. In addition, a binary logit model was used to estimate the influence of socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. Findings suggest that droughts, river erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks perceived by char dwellers. Additionally, results from a climate vulnerability index portray similar findings that char respondents are more exposed to diverse climatic hazards. The study further investigates local adaptation mechanisms in agriculture with regards to major climatic events. In response to the existing climate change risks, the char inhabitants employ several adaptation strategies in agriculture such as implementing new or alternative farming practices, changing planting times, and cultivating short-duration varieties. The llogit analysis suggests that household age, family size, annual income, farm size, farm ownership and farming experience have a significant influence on farmers? adaptation choices. Household access to education, early warning by extension agents, information on improved agricultural technologies, access to off-farm sources of income and incorporating char people during policy design can effectively enhance farmers? resilience and help reduce vulnerability.

J	Das Bhowmik, R; Sankarasubramanian, A				Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi; Sankarasubramanian, Arumugam			A performance-based multi-model combination approach to reduce uncertainty in seasonal temperature change projections	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; equal weighting; GCM; genetic algorithm; model combination; seasonal temperature	CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; MODELS; VARIABILITY; CMIP5; SIMULATIONS; PREDICTIONS	Future changes in climate variable exhibit prominent impact on flood magnitudes, crop yields, and freshwater withdrawal. Researchers typically ignore the large degree of uncertainty translated from climate projections to the estimated climate change magnitudes while applying pre-processing approaches on climate change projections. General Circulation Models (GCM) exhibit substantial uncertainty in projecting future changes in the seasonal temperature, which is evaluated by estimating the shift in either the mean or variance. Bias between the observed changes (1950-1999) and GCM simulated changes vary across models, climate regions, seasons, and under emission scenarios. The simplest approach to reduce model structural uncertainty, equal weighting of GCMs, does not consider superiority of one or multiple GCMs compared to the rest. The current study adopts a performance-based model combination approach that has shown efficiency in streamflow and weather forecasting, and GCM precipitation simulation. The optimal model combination approach has been modified to combine multi-model climate change information, while yielding the spatial correlation in climate change information within a geographic region. The optimal model combination approach, along with a simple bias-correction, is applied on 10 GCMs over nine climate regions across the coterminous United States (CONUS). We found that the optimal combination exhibits lower RMSE values as compared to the equal combination. Correlations between the model combined projections under optimal combination and the observed changes are strong and positive (>0.5). Future (2000-49) model combined projections exhibit an increase in the mean seasonal temperature by 2 degrees C for winter and by 1 degrees C for summer over almost all climate regions.

Changes in Irrigation Planning and Development Parameters Due to Climate Change	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Irrigation planning; Irrigation development; Climate change	WATER; IMPACTS; MODEL; DEMAND	Considering changes in irrigation planning and development due to climate change is necessary to avoid system failure. This study demonstrated that changes in dependable flow and diversion water requirements in the future due to climate change will reduce potential irrigable areas. Climate change were based on the published projected climate in the study area. The dependable flow derived from successfully calibrated and validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model streamflow simulations and the diversion water requirements based on the CROPWAT estimations of irrigation scheme were used to assess the potential irrigable areas. Substantial reductions in potential rice production areas (-4% to - 39%) were largely due to dwindled dependable flow (-1% to -25%) and an increase in diversion water requirement (+ 7% to + 26%). Reduction in potential irrigable area was projected during dry and normal years and may worsen towards the late twenty-first century under the worst-case climate scenario. Swelling of rivers during wet years will increase stream flows and potential irrigable areas but may also pose a danger of flooding. The development of water storage structures is necessary to reduce the adverse impacts of too much water during the wet years. Crop calendars should also be retrofitted to optimize the use of available rainfall during dry and normal years and climate-proof future irrigation systems. The results showed that it is necessary to incorporate climate change in irrigation planning and development. The methodologies described here could be used to climate-proof future irrigation systems in other areas in the Philippines and other countries.

The increased rainfall amount and intensity during the rainy season lead to flood damage on a massive scale every year in Korea. In order to reduce such flood damage and secure the stability of hydraulic structures, evaluation of hydrologic risk corresponding to design floods is necessary. As Korea's current climate change scenarios are generally applied to mid-sized watersheds, there is no practical application method to calculate the hydrologic risk of local floods corresponding to various future climate change scenarios. Using the design flood prediction model, this study evaluated the hydrologic risks of n-year floods according to 13 climate change scenarios. The representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario resulted in the 100-year floods increasing 134.56% on average, and 132.30% in the Han River, 132.81% in the Nakdong River, 142.42% in the Gum River, and 135.47% in the Seomjin-Youngsan River basin, compared with the RCP 4.5. The 100-year floods at the end of the 21st century increased by +3% and +13% according to the RCP 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The corresponding hydrologic flood risk increased by 0.53% and 8.68% on average according to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively, compared with the current level of hydrologic risk of a 100-year flood.

This article examines the past trends and future impacts of climate change on riparian, water-dependent habitats within the special areas of conservation (SAC) of the Natura 2000 network located within Odra and Vistula River basins in Poland. Hydrological modelling using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was driven by a set of nine EURO-CORDEX regional climate models under two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. Changes in the duration of flooding and inundation events were used to assess climate change's impact on surface water-fed wetland habitats. The groundwater-fed wetlands were evaluated on the basis of changes in soil water content. Information about the current conservation status, threats, and pressures that affect the habitats suggest that the wetlands might dry out. Increased precipitation projected for the future causing increased water supply to both surface water and groundwater-fed wetlands would lead to beneficial outcomes for habitats with good, average, or reduced conservation status. However, habitats with an excellent conservation status that are already in optimum condition could be negatively affected by climate change as increased soil water or duration of overbank flow would exceed their tolerance.

Understanding how these challenges affect the WPR populations' mental health is essential to design effective prevention and care policies. Thus, the present study conducted an umbrella scoping review that examined the influence of climate change on mental health in the WPR, using review articles as a source of information. Ten review articles were selected according to eligibility criteria, and the findings were synthesized according to the socio-economic status of the countries identified: Australia, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, the Pacific Islands (broadly), and China. The findings revealed that each country and sub-region has its own unique profile of climate change-related challenges and vulnerable populations, highlighting the need for specific approaches to mental health care. Specifically, the influence of climate-related challenges differed according to populations' region (e.g., rural populations), demographic characteristics (e. g., age and gender), culture (e.g., traditional tights to land), and employment (e.g., farmers and fishers). The most frequently reported mental health outcomes in response to climate changerelated challenges such as droughts, floods, storms, tornadoes, typhoons, and climate-related migration were the decline in mental well-being and the increase in post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. In addition, using the GRADE framework for assessing the certainty of the findings, we identified that the number of articles discussing associations between a given climate change challenge and a mental health outcome was overall limited. Based on our findings and findings on a global scale, we identified several key research gaps in WPR and provided recommendations for future research and policy strategies.

Reservoir Water-Quality Projections under Climate-Change Conditions	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Reservoirs; Water quality; Climate change; CE-QUAL-W2 model; TDS concentration		Reservoirs are key components of water infrastructure that serve many functions (water supply, hydropower generation, flood control, recreation, ecosystem services, etc.). Climate change affects the hydrology of the tributary areas to reservoirs, which may profoundly impact their operation and possibly the reservoirs' water quality, among which the temperature gradient and the total dissolved solids (TDS) are key qualitative characteristics of reservoirs, especially those with irrigation function. This study examines water-quality changes in the Aidoghmoush reservoir (East Azerbaijan-Iran) under climate-change conditions in the period 2026-2039. The temperature and precipitation climate variables are calculated by the HadCM3 model driven by emission scenario A2 in the baseline period (1987-2000), and these variables are then projected over the future period (2026-2039). The average annual runoff under climate-change conditions is simulated by the IHACRES model. The results show the future average annual runoff would decrease by about 1% compared to the baseline conditions. The CE-QUAL-W2 model is employed to simulate the reservoir water quality. It is predicted the surface air temperature would increase by 1.3 degrees C under the climate-change scenario compared to the baseline condition, and the temperatures of the reservoir's surface- and bottom-waters would increase by 1.19 and 1.24 degrees C, respectively. The average TDS near the reservoir surface would increase by 44.5g/m(3) (4.3%) relative to baseline TDS. The TDS near the reservoir surface are projected to be highest in autumn and winter for baseline and future conditions. This research shows that changes due to climate change are potentially severe, and presents a methodology that could assist managers and planners to find optimal strategies of reservoir operation to cope with changes in thermal stratification and TDS. This paper results identify the reservoir levels from which to withdraw water with the best water-quality characteristics.

The catchment study is rare example in Indonesia where forestation has been applied at the catchment level. However, since the forestation program has been initiated, evaluations of the program only focus on the planting area targets, while the environmental success e.g., impacts on the hydrological processes have never been assessed. This study used a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to diagnose the isolated and combined effects of forestation and climate change on five water balance components, namely streamflow (Q), evapotranspiration (ET), surface runoff (Q(s)), lateral flow (Q(l)) and base flow (Q(b)). Results The results show that from 2006 to 2019, forest cover has increased from 2.7% to 12.8% of the total area, while in the same period there was an increase in the mean annual and seasonal temperature, rainfall, and streamflow. Results of SWAT simulations show that changes in the mean annual and seasonal water balance under the forestation only scenario were relatively minor, while changes were more pronounced under the climate change only scenario. Based on the combined impacts scenario, it was observed that the effects of a larger forest area on the water balance were smaller than the effects of climate change. Conclusions Although we found that forestation program has minor impacts compared to that of climate change on the hydrological processes in the Bogowonto catchment, seasonally, forestation activity has decreased the streamflow and surface runoff during the wet season which may reduce the risk of moderate floods. However, much attention should be paid to the way how forestation may result in severe drought events during the dry season. Finally, we urge the importance of accounting for the positive and negative effects in future forestation programs.

The supply of fine sediment from slope failures inhibits bed armoring of mountain rivers and increases sediment discharge to the downstream reaches. Floods without slope failures lead to bed erosion and armoring and may ultimately decrease sediment discharge. Thus, it is important to consider sediment discharge from slope failure and bed erosion as factors affecting sediment production. Climate change affects not only the rainfall amount, but also the temporal rainfall pattern; consequently, the pattern affects the sediment production factors and the amount of sediment discharge. However, changes in sediment discharge due to climate change based on sediment production sources have not yet been clarified. In this study, we statistically analyzed 1200 results simulated using a physics-based sediment runoff model to assess the impact of changes in temporal rainfall patterns on sediment discharge and sediment production sources in the Pekerebetsu River Basin. In the simulations, we used the rainfall predicted in d4PDF (Database for policy decision-making for future climate change), a large ensemble climate simulation database at 5 km and 20 km resolutions. Our results showed that the climate-driven increase in sediment discharge was considerably larger than that of rainfall. An increase in short-term heavy rainfall increased the supply of fine sediments from slope failure. This resulted in the suppression of bed armoring and a large increase in sediment discharge. Thus, the increase in sediment discharge is not only caused by an increase in rainfall but also by changes in temporal rainfall patterns and sediment production factors. The sediment discharge calculated for the 20 km resolution climate projection was nearly one order of magnitude smaller than that for the 5 km resolution. This suggests that the 20 km resolution climate projections do not adequately represent orographic rainfall in the mountains and thus, do not adequately reproduce extreme sediment discharge events. An increased sediment supply causes bed aggradation and decreases the river conveyance capacity of the downstream channel. The model developed in this study will contribute to flood risk analysis and flood control planning for increased rainfall due to climate change.

This has theoretical and realistic implications to study and couple the climate system with hydrologic processes, to understand the system and solve related problems in water resources and extreme hydrology, such as decision making, plan management, environmental protection, and ecological balance. This paper reviews recent studies investigating climate change impact on hydrological extremes using a perspective of the integrated modeling framework comprising climate change scenarios, climate models, bias correction methods, hydrological modeling (model structure and parameterization), and reducible uncertainty arising from these sources characterized by a paucity of knowledge. The available research outcomes show the extreme high flows are likely to increase under climate change in the most parts of Europe, Asia, and the USA, but greatly vary and decrease in Africa and Latin America, which is highly variable and uncertain in space and time. Each component in integrated modeling has an important role in shifting and producing uncertainty in projected extreme flow. Among them, the climate model's discrepancy and hydrological models' structure are the more dominant source of uncertainty in projection of extreme high and low (or mean) flow in most of the regions, respectively. However, the quality of input data and hydrological model structures are the most dominant source of uncertainty in Africa, Latin America, and some parts of Asia. This indicated that these regions have strong hydrological cycle and higher physiographic heterogeneity. We believe that our existing knowledge and skills need to be improved and transformed into an accurate mathematical and physical representation, to minimize the uncertainty due to the effect of choices in the methodology chain. So, disentangling the aggregated uncertainty in the cascade modeling chain can be done by using variances, which can help understand the interaction effect and identify their contribution to the projected extreme flow. This comprehensive review can help modelers to identify and reduce uncertainty in projecting hydrological extremes and policy makers for full awareness of the various uncertainties to make a robust decision for water resources management under climate change.

Quantitative methods to predict the effect of climate change on microbial food safety: A needs analysis	TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						Climate change; Food safety; Predictive microbiology; Impact modelling	MICROBIOLOGICAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; NEXT-GENERATION; BIAS CORRECTION; SCENARIO DATA; LEAFY GREENS; GROWTH-RATE; IMPACTS; MODEL; PROJECTIONS; UNCERTAINTY	Background: Food systems are both affecting and being affected by climate change. Anticipated effects of climate change on microbial food safety are both direct (e.g., on microbial prevalence) and indirect (e.g., increased risk of floods on water microbial contamination). Scope and Approach: This paper highlights the necessity to build a quantitative framework to evaluate the effects of climate change on microbial food safety. The tools available from the fields of climate modelling and predictive microbiology are analysed, knowledge gaps and data needs are identified. Moreover, key sources of uncertainty are underlined by emphasising on the importance of an integrated study of the uncertainties involved. Key Findings and Conclusions: Due to the high complexity of both climate change and microbial dynamics, a multidisciplinary research approach is essential. After selecting one food product and location to focus on, the appropriate climate change projections relative to microbial dynamics need to be determined and generated. The development of the impact model is based on the relationship between environmental pathogen prevalence and dispersal and climatic factors. This is linked with the impact of climatic factors on microbial dynamics. These mechanisms remain poorly understood. The knowledge gap of the mechanisms regarding food microbial contamination and the role of climatic variables remains unexplored. Since controlled experiments on the climate system are challenging, international collaboration is imperative to gather the appropriate observational datasets. Moreover, identifying and evaluating the sources of uncertainty is critical to build reliable models.

Analysis of the Methodological Approaches of Different Countries	WATER			English	Review						climate change; flood prevention; flood risks; flood directive; preliminary flood risk assessment; flood hazard; uncertainty	RISK-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; RESILIENCE; IMPACT; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; PROJECTIONS	Climate change has major effects on the planet, and its consequences on today's society are undeniable. Climate change is the cause of the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including floods. Flood management in Europe has experienced a significant change due to the emergence of the Flood Directive and its implementation in national regulations. The Flood Directive requires the inclusion of the effects of climate change. With multiple factors such as governmental and administrative diversity, and various management tools, each country uses a different methodology. This research conducts a bibliographic review to analyze the methodological approaches applied by four different countries-the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain-showing their differences and the causes of such differences and examining the common weaknesses and strengths in the countries' approach. To this end, it analyzes how to include climate change in the implementation of the Flood Directive in the four countries studied throughout the two cycles. Developing a uniform approach to FD implementation has been hampered by (1) different starting points in the technology of flood prediction, (2) widely varying "traditional" approaches to flood and risk management, and (3) differing levels of the integration of local, regional, and national agencies. Development under the FD has, however, led to increased awareness of the common uncertainty associated with the different current methodologies and the need to deepen the knowledge of climate change as well as the need to develop the technology to reduce said uncertainty.

Fire, grazing, flooding, succession, biodiversity, invasive species, and stewardship all affect the ``resilience'' (the capacity to recover) of an ecosystem to the effects of long-term changes in weather patterns. These significant ``controls'' should be part of climate change discussions. Research from various disciplines suggests that the actions of humans on the landscape minimized and/or ameliorated some of the impacts of past changes in climate.

Spatial models at the county-level within the US Mississippi River basin over the past 20 years (1990-2009) were developed to explain losses associated with flooding events. We applied integrative indices, spatial clustering, and spatial regression models to estimate the role of planning and policy effort in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. Results suggest that engaged social capital and social justice characteristics combined with local proactive planning and policy in place before a disaster result in lower disaster losses and serve to enhance community resilience. Further, while our findings are informed by a case study within the US, they are applicable to other less-developed regional and country contexts.

Vulnerability of nature-based tourism to climate variability and change: Case of Kariba resort town, Zimbabwe	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Zambezi river; Lake Kariba; Tourism southern Africa; Resort towns; Climate change; Drought impact; Hydro electricity	ZAMBEZI RIVER-BASIN; LAKE KARIBA; IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; RECOVERY; AREA	Nature tourism resorts are particularly sensitive to the impact of climate change and weather extremes, such as droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, extreme frost and flooding. While studies have been conducted to assess the implications of climate change on nature resorts in the global north, there is little understanding of how climate change will affect these resorts across Africa, where tourism is a significant contributor towards livelihood security for many. This study examined the evidence for and potential impacts of climate variability and change on nature-based tourism activities in the Kariba resort in Zimbabwe. A case study approach was used, with both primary and secondary data analysed using ArcGIS 10.3. Content and thematic analysis and Mann-Kendall trend analysis were also performed. The study revealed that nature-based tourism in Kariba is under threat from increased and intense droughts, likely resulting from climate change. Extreme temperatures and droughts are critical threats to biodiversity and water levels in Lake Kariba, and they undermine both certain tourist activities and destination attractiveness. Increased incidents of drought, among other factors, have likely led to a reduced hotel occupancy over the last two decades threatening tourism business viability. The paper recommends that the tourism industry in Kariba should streamline its operations, retrofit and invest in green buildings to adapt to climate change. Further studies are suggested to quantify the economic impacts of climate variability and change on flora and fauna. The results provide tourism players and other agencies with information that can support various management decisions and represent a benchmark for future monitoring of climate change in Kariba in line with the dictates of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 on climate action.

They are an essential part of the 'One Health' strategy that seeks to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and the environment. Crucially, plants are central to nature-based solutions to climate mitigation, not least because soil carbon storage is an attractive strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and the associated climate change. Agriculture depends on genetically pure, high-quality seeds that are free from pests and pathogens and contain a required degree of genetic purity. This themed collection addresses key questions in the field encompassing the biochemical mechanisms that underlie plant responses and adaptations to a changing climate. This collection encompasses an analysis of the biochemistry and molecular mechanisms underpinning crop and forest resilience, together with considerations of plant adaptations to climate change-associated stresses, including drought, floods and heatwaves, and the increased threats posed by pathogens and pests.

The purpose of this study is the projection of climate change's impact on the GWL fluctuations in the Mashhad aquifer during the future period (2022-2064). In the first step, the climatic variables using the ACCESS-CM2 model under the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 5-8.5 scenario were extracted. In the second step, different machine learning algor-ithms were used to predict the GWL fluctuations under climate change in the future. Our results point out that temperatures and evaporation will increase in the autumn season and precipitation will decrease by 26% in the future in the Mashhad aquifer. The results showed that the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) model had an excellent performance in predicting the GWL compared to other models. Based on the result of the RBF model, the GWL will decrease by 6.60 m under the SSP5-8.5 scenario in the future.

Ramifications due to urbanization and climate change on stormwater runoff and conduit efficiency: an integrated water management approach	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; IWRM; pollutant load; stormwater runoff; surface imperviousness; SWMM	HYDROLOGIC IMPACT; BIAS CORRECTION; AREA	Urbanization and climate change increase the frequency of urban floods worldwide which in turn poses a great challenge in the management of the urban stormwater drain system. This study investigated the impact of climate change and surface imperviousness in the urban stormwater runoff and the impact of washed off pollutants load in the conduit efficiency for two census wards Triplicane (ward 116) and Valasaravakkam (ward 152) in Chennai City. The climate change data for the study area wards were taken from the regional climate model (RCM) of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5. Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) with quality and quantity scenarios were developed and the results of the present year scenario were validated using a questionnaire survey. Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves were generated to forecast the observed rainfall and climate model data for various return periods, i.e., 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100 years for future climatic scenarios (2030s and 2050s). The model results show that infiltration is only 3-7% of the total rainfall in the study areas and the maximum blockage and reduction in conduit capacity were estimated to be 65 and 40%, respectively. This paper presents the observations and suggestions for improving the conduit efficiency from an Integrated Water Management Approach (IWMA).	[Maheswari, E.; Ambujam, N.

This empirical model was implemented in a Geographical Information System, taking into account Alpine hydrology and geomorphological and climate parameters, which are crucial in the analysis of the intensity and variability of sediment yield production processes. The case study is the Guerna Creek basin, a small-sized mountain watershed placed in Lombardy, in the South-Central Alps (Northern Italy). In recent decades it has been hit at the same time by floods and erosive phenomena, showing its hydraulic-hydrological weakness. Three future climate change scenarios from 2041 to 2060, around the middle of this century, were built according to CORDEX data referring to three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5). The findings showed that in the future climate, the sediment yield at the basin scale might change by 24-44% for a single heavy storm in the middle of the current century.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Theory of planned behavior; Protection motivation theory; Flooding; Sea level rise; Coastal climate adaptation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; POLICY; PROTECTION; COMMUNICATION; VALUES; MODEL; POLITICIZATION; DETERMINANTS; ORIENTATION	Climate change forecasts predict impacts that will increasingly expose coastal residents to existential risks, necessitating aggressive adaptation. While the polarization of climate change attitudes in American politics represents a barrier to climate adaptation efforts, it is not well-understood how political ideology mediates how individuals connect the abstract concept of "climate change" to concrete experiences with environmental risks. Understanding this link in the context of adaptation decision-making is important, as the effects of many, household-level adaptation efforts compound over space and time, affecting community flood risk and vulnerability. This paper asks, how do political ideologies interact with threat perception to affect coastal climate adaptation decisions? We frame this analysis using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). Using responses from a survey of residents (n = 164) in North Carolina's (USA) Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, we examine how measures of residents' subjective norms, threat-appraisals, and self-efficacy influence their intent to retreat or topographically adapt. We find that, despite political polarization around climate change, generally, when given concrete examples of risk, respondents' political beliefs appear unrelated to their plans to protect their property and livelihoods.

Previous research suggests differing theoretical explanations for these "gener-alization" effects such as buffering existential anxiety. Across two pre-registered experiments (N = 1031; USA & UK), we examine whether ingroup identification and social dominance orientation (SDO) moderate the relationship between experimentally induced collective threats and subjective threat perceptions (i.e., climate change and intergroup threat), modern racism, and pro-environmental collective action support. In Study 1, SDO and ingroup identification were measured 2 years prior to our experiment as antecedents of threat perceptions. Our results suggest that informing individuals about negative consequences of climate change (e.g., wildfires, floods, resource scarcity, health etc.), leads to higher intergroup threat perceptions and modern racism. These generalization effects, in turn, are moderated by SDO but not by ingroup identification. In Study 2, we successfully replicate our findings, measuring SDO and ingroup identification directly after the threat manipulation. Moreover, we use a behavioral measure of pro-environmental collective action to assess more direct stimuli responses. In Study 2, again, we show that SDO moderates the generalization effects. In contrast, ingroup identification showed only marginally significant moderation of the generalization effect and did not increase itself in response to experimental threat-cues. Notably, we also find that intergroup threat-cues generalize onto higher climate change threat perceptions. No effects on behavioral collective action support were found.

J	Jawid, A; Khadjavi, M				Jawid, Asadullah; Khadjavi, Menusch			Adaptation to climate change in Afghanistan: Evidence on the impact of external interventions	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY			English	Article							PROPENSITY-SCORE; FARMERS ADAPTATION; FOOD SECURITY; DETERMINANTS; STRATEGIES	Climate change is a significant obstacle for farmers in the least developed countries like Afghanistan and adaptation support is exceptionally scarce. This paper provides evidence on the impact of the agriculture-related external support on farmers' adaptation to climate change in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan. To this end, we collected primary data from 1434 farmers whom we interviewed across 14 districts in Bamiyan, Ghazni, and Diakundi provinces. We employ quasi-experimental econometric methods, including an endogenous switching regression analysis, to estimate the treatment effects on various adaptation-related outcomes. We find significant impacts of support interventions on the use of improved types of seeds and farmers' access to irrigation water. Further impacts on the risk of flood, economic and financial as well as government and institutional adaptation constraints appear to be significant, but sensitive to the existence of unobserved factors. We conclude that farmers perceived changes in the climate, and most of them tried to adapt by employing measures available to them. The impact of external support has been partially effective in addressing immediate and short-term farming challenges related to climate change and extreme weather events. They, however, have not been effective in treating long-term fundamental climate change-related risks. Based on our analysis of the past treatments and farmers' self-reported priorities, we provide a list of policy recommendations for adaptation to climate change in farming communities in Afghanistan.

Development of a composite climate change vulnerability index for small craft harbours	ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Vulnerability; climate change; sea level rise; harbours; cost-effectiveness	SEA-LEVEL RISE; COASTAL VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; ASSESSMENTS; HAZARDS; CITIES; PORTS; AREAS	Coastal areas around the world are threatened by an accelerated sea level rise (SLR), storm surges and coastal flooding related to climate change. These threats, together with the land use pattern of coastal areas, could create a dangerous mix for coastal communities and could result in major socio-economic and environmental consequences. Apart from human settlements, seaports are likely to be most vulnerable to climate change because they are located at areas exposed to SLR and storm surges or at mouths of rivers susceptible to flooding. To remain efficient and resilient, seaports must anticipate the impacts of climate change and proactively prepare for SLR, increased flooding, and more frequent extreme storm events. This paper presents the analytical and empirical aspects of an integrated vulnerability index (VI) for small raft harbours based on the methodology of the IPCC for coastal vulnerability assessment. Six corresponding steps are adopted to assess the fishing ports VI (VIP-F) considering geophysical and socio-economic parameters. The proposed index is applied to 47 fishing boats and small commercial harbours of Lesvos, Greece. The proposed methodology can be adapted for assessing the vulnerability of major ports.

However, urban flood modelling under climate change conditions poses several challenges. On one hand, the identification and collection of climate change data suitable for flood-related evaluations requires consistent computational and scientific effort. On the other hand, large difficulties can arise in the reproduction of the rainfall-runoff transformation process in cases when only little information about the subsurface processes is known. In this perspective, a simplified approach is proposed to address the challenges regarding the quantitative estimation of climate change effects on urban flooding for real case applications. The approach is defined as "bottom-up" because climate change information is not included in flood modelling, but it is only invoked for the interpretation of results. In other words, the challenge faced in this work is the development of a modelling strategy that is expeditious, because it does not require flood simulations for future rainfall scenarios, but only under current climate conditions, thus reducing the overall computational effort; and it is flexible, because results can be easily updated once new climate change data, scenarios or methods become available, without the need of additional flood simulations. To simulate real case applications, the approach is tested for a scenario analysis, where different return periods and hyetograph shapes are used as input for urban inundation modelling in Naples, Italy. The approach can support public and private stakeholders, such as land administrators and water systems managers; moreover, it represents a valuable and effective basis for climate change risk communication strategies.

In this work, we seek to evaluate and validate the evidence of climate change such as droughts and floods that are occurring in the southern region of Peru and northern Chile called the headwaters of the Atacama Desert. The analysis of the interrelationships and climate trends was carried out, to demonstrate conditions of climate change about the occurrence of alluviums. In recent years, extraordinary precipitation events have occurred that have generated surface storage, vegetation growth, and alluvial surface flows in areas where they were not normal. The return periods of said extraordinary events were calculated.

We consider these events as evidence of climate change; the normal conditions have been altered and the damage is irrefutable, it must be specified, for example, that a large part of the road infrastructure, services, buildings, etc., are not designed to take these conditions into account current climate, therefore, it is necessary to establish the safety regulations and adaptation of buildings to these new conditions that are being presented.

A qualitative comparative analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Governance; Environmental policy; QCA; Local climate change adaptation	MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; RISK GOVERNANCE; CHANGE IMPACTS; POLICY; FLOOD; BARRIERS; GOVERNMENTS; PERCEPTIONS; RESILIENCE; DISASTER	Climate change impacts vary wildly across different geographical contexts and their effects are primarily felt on the local level, generating demand for local solutions. The local level plays a key role in the adaptation to climate change. Nevertheless, in most European countries adaptation has yet to be integrated comprehensively into local policy agendas. To further our understanding of this slow pace of local adaptation progress, we study 21 Swiss Alpine municipalities exposed to a variety of natural hazards and issues exacerbated by local climate change impacts. Building on established research on local natural hazard management and climate change adaptation, we expect four factors to play decisive roles, either on their own or in combination with each other: Past extreme events, risk exposure, perceived climate risk and existing adaptation policies at superordinate levels. We test these expectations using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). We find that significant past extreme events and high perceived climate risk come close to being necessary conditions for local adaptation measures. High perceived climate risk on its own is also a sufficient condition for local adaptation measures to be taken while its absence is sufficient for no local adaptation measures to be taken. Thus, the importance of climate risk perception exceeds our expectation as it has clearly been revealed to be the most important factor. Future research should focus on disentangling different levels of public risk perception further and investigate the role different levels of perception or acceptance among different actor groups play in climate policy decisions.

The two experiments reported here tested communication strategies designed to increase trust in and concern about climate change. They also measured attitudes toward climate scientists. Climate predictions were systematically manipulated to include either probabilistic (90% predictive interval) or deterministic (mean value) projections that described either concrete (i.e., heat waves and floods) or abstract events (i.e., temperature and precipitation). The results revealed that projections that included the 90% predictive interval were considered more trustworthy than deterministic projections. In addition, in a nationally representative sample, Republicans who were informed of concrete events with predictive intervals reported greater concern and more favorable attitudes toward climate scientists than when deterministic projections were used. Overall, these findings suggest that while climate change beliefs may be rooted in partisan identity, they remain malleable, especially when targeted communication strategies are used.

Every day, at different places of the world, the planet sends alarming messages about the enormous transformations it is experiencing due to human-based activities. The latter are responsible for changing weather patterns that threaten food production, energy production and energy consumption, the desertification of land, the displacement of people and animals because of food and water shortages due to the reductions in rainfall, natural disasters and rising sea levels. The effects of climate change affect us all, and if drastic measures are not considered in a timely manner, it will be more difficult and costly to adapt to the aforementioned effects in the future. Considering this context, the aim of this work is to implement a prospective study/structural analysis to the identified sectors of a regional plan of adaptation to climate change so as to promote the resilience of the region against the negative phenomena generated by the climate crisis. This was achieved in two steps: first, we identified the relationships between the strategic sectors of the plan and organized them in order of importance. Second, we assessed the effectiveness of several public policies oriented towards a city's resilience according to their impact upon the strategic sectors of the plan and the co-benefits generated by their implementation for society. The results highlight that the most essential sectors for the mitigation of climate change are flood risk management, built environment, forest ecosystem management, human health, tourism and rise in sea level. As a consequence, the most important measures for the resilience of the North Aegean Region against climate change are the ones related to the preparation of strategic master plans for flood protection projects.

J	Khandel, O; Soliman, M				Khandel, Omid; Soliman, Mohamed			Integrated Framework for Quantifying the Effect of Climate Change on the Risk of Bridge Failure Due to Floods and Flood-Induced Scour	JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bridges; Risk; Flood; Scour; Climate change; Global climate models (GCM)	NORTH-AMERICAN CLIMATE; REINFORCED-CONCRETE BRIDGES; HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS; HIGHWAY BRIDGES; CMIP5; PROBABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTIONS; IMPACTS; UTILITY	Climate change has been recognized as a significant threat for transportation infrastructure. The change in temperature profiles and precipitation patterns and the increase in the intensity of weather-related extreme events are among the effects attributed to climate change. Additionally, climate change may also alter the frequency and intensity of flood events, which increases the complexity of assessing the risk of bridge failure due to flood-related failure modes. Flood occurrence generally increases the rate of river bed erosion and may cause the formation of scour holes around bridge piers, leading to an increased risk of bridge failure. Several factors, such as future precipitation, basin parameters, flow direction, and drainage area, affect the streamflow of a river; accordingly, the proper prediction of long-term future flood hazard requires detailed and computationally expensive climate and hydrologic modeling, which can be prohibitive in assessing the life cycle risk of bridges and other transportation structures. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a comprehensive, yet computationally efficient, probabilistic framework for quantifying the risk of bridge failure due to flood events considering climate change. Statistical modeling was employed to draw a relationship between the downscaled climate data adopted from global climate models and the streamflow at a given location. The effects of different global climate models and carbon dioxide emission scenarios on failure risk due to flood hazard were taken into account. The results showed that using traditional assessment approaches that do not properly consider climate change effects can lead to a considerable underestimation or overprediction in the predicted future risk. The approach was applied to an existing bridge in Oklahoma; however, it is equally applicable to bridges and other transportation structures located in various regions in the United States.

It is, however, evident from current observations that some predictions of unusually high rates of flooding and droughts are occurring and threatening food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The impact of climate change is immense on SSA though it contributes the least to climate change globally. Crops face lots of growth challenges which reduce their productivity under drought and flood conditions. SSA must prepare agricultural soils for the anticipated climate variabilities, to ensure sustainable food availability. The effort to adapt soils to climate change must be a concerted one, using technologies from various facets of science. Stakeholders must adopt water-smart strategies that maintain proper soil-water balance. They should focus on manageable inherent soil properties that control the susceptibility/adaptability of cropping systems to climate change. Conservation agriculture techniques that target improving soil organic matter and maintaining soil life; protecting the soil from compaction and erosion; reducing soil disturbance; enhancing soil infiltration and groundwater recharge capacity, must be applied to our soils. A number of these techniques equip the soils to be better sinks of excess water in flood-prone areas and improve water-holding capacities in drought-prone ones. Governments, farmers, and all stakeholders must also invest in both simple and complex water harvesting/ re-directing infrastructure which conserve water for future use. Water-efficient irrigation systems must be employed by farmers during water scarcity. Most importantly, gaps between research, industry, farmers, and governments must be bridged to for easy flow of information on improved technologies and quick adoption of climate change mitigation strategies.

EWEs hold the potential to harm sexual health through pathways including elevated exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), disrupted healthcare access, and increased sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The WHO defines four components of sexual health: comprehensive sexuality education; HIV and STI prevention and care; SGBV prevention and care; and psychosexual counselling. Yet, knowledge gaps remain regarding climate change and its associations with these sexual health domains. This scoping review will therefore explore the linkages between climate change and sexual health. Methods and analysis Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL) will be searched using text words and subject headings (eg, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Emtree) related to sexual health and climate change from the inception of each database to May 2021. Grey literature and unpublished reports will be searched using a comprehensive search strategy, including from the WHO, World Bank eLibrary, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The scoping review will consider studies that explore: (a) climate change and EWEs including droughts, heat waves, wildfires, dust storms, hurricanes, flooding rains, coastal flooding and storm surges; alongside (b) sexual health, including: comprehensive sexual health education, sexual health counselling, and HIV/STI acquisition, prevention and/or care, and/or SGBV, including intimate partner violence, sexual assault and rape. Searches will not be limited by language, publication year or geographical location. We will consider quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods and review articles for inclusion. We will conduct thematic analysis of findings. Data will be presented in narrative and tabular forms. Ethics and dissemination There are no formal ethics requirements as we are not collecting primary data. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and shared at international conferences.

Facing climate change impacts, long-term policy planning via scenario analysis is an essential tool to ensure water security. This investigation utilized an approach based on numerical model experiments and sustainability indexes to assess the impact of public policies for water resources management over a long-term horizon. Streamflow projections (2011-2099) from the hydrological model MHD-INPE (Distributed Hydrological Model - National Institute for Space Research) were evaluated as means to investigate water supply scenarios. Monthly flows were accounted into 30-year moving average intervals. Sustainability Indexes were then calculated to evaluate the performance of a water system as IPCC's Specific Warming Levels were reached. In this study, the contribution of public policies for water resources sustainability under climate change scenarios in the Paraiba do Sul river basin, which supports the water supply of the two major Brazilian metropolitan areas, were analyzed. Results indicated that the system will operate with more stress facing climate change impacts. Finally, the assessment of water availability scenarios is concluded to benefit decision-makers in incorporating adaptation measures, identifying uncertainties, and foreseeing potential effects of climate change.

Because the majority of these systems are in deltaic areas, integrated river basin management (water and sediment discharge) is a must in the design of such pathways. Rising sea levels will tend to gradually flood coastal lagoons and marshes unless there is enough sediment supplied to compensate for the increasing deficit. Although the relationship between climate change and Mediterranean coastal storms is weak or non-existent, their impacts are expected to grow in the context of SLR and coastal squeezing. For example, the most affected Ebro Delta coastal stretches during the Gloria storm (January 2020), one of the most intense ever recorded in the Mediterranean, were those where the beach was narrower and weaker. Hard engineering solutions, such as the construction of dykes, as a protection measure against marine storms are not sustainable under scenarios of climate change and energy scarcity. A management approach based on soft engineering coastal defences and nature-based solutions is the most cost-effective and sustainable in the long run. The adequacy of implementing this kind of solution along the Mediterranean coast is discussed.

Global climate change has increased both the intensity and frequency of disaster events, causing serious impacts worldwide. Because most people and economic activities are clustered in urban areas, most studies focus on how to enhance the resilience of urban areas, often overlooking the practicable resilience in rural areas, especially in radically different areas, such as coastal and alpine areas. There should be a fundamentally different resilience approaches in areas with low population densities, weak institutional capacities, and limited financial feasibility. The application of local and indigenous knowledge as an adaptation strategy for climate change to achieve the goal of balance between humans and nature has also received considerable attention. Therefore, this study applied in-depth interviews in the coastal rural village of Guogou in Taiwan. The results showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters and encouraged residents to live in areas with high flood exposure. Overall, the application of local and indigenous knowledge in such rural areas might be a possible solution to enhance local resilience.

An understanding of these effects is crucial for assessing future water availability, and for the development of sustainable management plans. Here, we investigate the influence of anticipated climate change on water security in the Jaguari Basin, which is the main source of freshwater for 9 million people in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region (SPMR). First, we calibrate and evaluate a hydrological model using daily observed data, obtaining satisfactory coefficient of determination and Kling-Gupta efficiency values for both periods. To represent possible climate change scenarios up to 2095, we consider two International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and use an ensemble of future projections generated by 17 general circulation models (GCMs). These data were used to drive the hydrological model to generate projected scenarios of streamflow. We then used indicators of water scarcity and vulnerability to carry out a quantitative analysis of provision probability. Our results indicate that streamflow can be expected to exhibit increased interannual variability, significant increases in flow rate between January and March, and a 2-month extension of the hydrological dry season (currently June to September) until November. The latter includes a more than a 35% reduction in streamflow during September through November (with a > 50% reduction in October). Our findings indicate an increased risk of floods and droughts accompanied by an expansion of the basin critical period, and our analysis of the water security indices identifies October and November as the most vulnerable months. Overall, our analysis exposes the fragility of water security in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region, and provides valuable technical and scientific information that can be used to guide regional plans and strategies to cope with potential future water scarcity.

For this study, China's Taihu Basin as a typical case for analyzing the impacts that climate change and urbanization will have on changes in the EWL. Additionally, changes in the response that EWL will have toward future climate change and urbanization are also studied. A generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) model with time (t), precipitation (pre) and population (pop) as major predictors was constructed to empirically investigate. Results indicate that the time dependent variables of the GAMLSS clearly describe the temporal variation of the EWL. The GAMLSS with physically-based covariates can capture additional details regarding the changing properties of EWL. According to changes exhibited in the EWL Akaike information criterion values, it is found that the impacts of climate change covariates are larger than that of the urbanization covariates. Additionally, for the study's sample period of 2015-2099, an increasing trend is found for EWL under the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios. It is concluded that flooding risk is likely to increase in China's Taihu Basin with changing environment conditions, and that some necessary measures should be taken by local water resource management authorities to address the potential risks posed to the region.

Evaluation of flexibility in adaptation projects for climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Real options; Coastal adaptations; Uncertainty; Sea-level rise; Flexibility; Multiple-stage adaptation	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; SEA-LEVEL; REAL OPTIONS; UNCERTAINTY; PATHWAYS; SOLENT; DEFENSES	Climate change adaptation inherently entails investment decision-making under the high levels of uncertainty. To address this issue, a single fixed large investment can be divided into two or more sequential investments. This reduces the initial investment cost and adds flexibility about the size and timing of subsequent investment decisions. This flexibility enables future investment decisions to be made when further information about the magnitude of climate change becomes available. This paper presents a real option analysis framework to evaluate adaptations including flexibility to reduce both the risk and uncertainty of climate change, against increasing coastal flooding due to sea-level rise as an example. The paper considers (i) how to design the sequence of adaptation options under growing risk of sea-level rise, and (ii) how to make the efficient use of flexibility included in adaptations for addressing uncertainty. A set of flexibilities (i.e. wait or future growth) are incorporated into single-stage investments (i.e. raising coastal defence from 2.5 mAOD to 3.5mAOD or 4.0 mAOD) in stages so that multiple-stage adaptations with different heights are created. The proposed method compares these sequentially growing adaptations in economic terms, including optimisation, providing additional information on the efficiency of flexible adaptation strategies given the uncertainty of climate change. The results from the evaluation enable decision-makers to identify long-lasting robust adaptation against the uncertainty of climate change.

ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING			English	Article						Climate change; Bank performance; Natural disasters; Mediating effect model; Simultaneous equations	ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CARBON-DIOXIDE; RISK; HEALTH; FLOOD; GOVERNMENT; INSURANCE; EMISSIONS; FRAGILITY; INCREASE	This research estimates the effect of climate change on bank performance by considering the mediating role of natural disasters via unbalanced panel data from 2005 to 2018 in 127 countries. Moreover, this paper uses forest land, carbon dioxide emissions, and temperature change to measure climate change, takes economic loss and the number of deaths as costs of natural disasters, and utilizes the non-performing loan ratio and the ratio of bank capital to assets as bank performance. The following conclusions are reached according to our empirical evidence. First, forest land has a strong negative effect on the non-performing loan ratio. Second, forest land decreases the economic losses and deaths due to natural disasters, and natural disasters also decrease banks' non-performing loan ratio. We also find that forest land increases the ratio of bank capital to assets through decreasing natural disasters. Third, there is a significant mediating effect of climate change on bank performance via natural disasters in high-income countries, but not in low-income countries. Finally, the decline of forest land and the rise of carbon dioxide emissions both have significantly positive effects on man-made disasters, which increase banks' non-performing loan ratio and decrease the ratio of bank capital to assets. One policy implication is that improving climate change, preventing natural disasters, and promoting financial institutions can help decrease the economic losses of natural disasters and banks.

Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Compound Flooding in Coastal River Areas	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						compound floods; coastal river areas; climate change; flood hazard; future projections	SEA-LEVEL RISE; MODEL EVALUATION; EXTREME; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; INUNDATION; DISCHARGE; EVENTS	Flood assessment in coastal river areas is subject to complex dependencies and interactions between flood drivers. In addition, coastal areas are especially vulnerable to climate change, and thus its effects should be considered in the evaluation of future flood hazard. In the present study, we propose a methodology for a robust evaluation of historical and future flooding in coastal river areas. It follows a continuous simulation approach in which a hydrologic-hydraulic modeling cascade is run for several years, driven by a simultaneous series of flood drivers. The method differs from other existing methodologies in: (a) jointly considering the relevant flood drivers, both coastal and inland, together with their dependencies and interactions, to represent the simultaneous occurrence of extreme water levels correctly, and (b) obtaining local-scale physically consistent projections of flood drivers to account for future climate change effects on compound flood hazard. The methodology is tested for a coastal river reach in NW Spain. The results show that, although mean sea level rise is usually expected to be the main driver of increased flood hazard, climate change effects on river discharge can play a very significant role in regions with compound flooding potential.

A cost-benefit analysis of afforestation as a climate change adaptation measure to reduce flood risk	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						afforestation; climate change; cost-benefit-analysis; natural flood risk management	FOREST; MANAGEMENT	Increased river flood frequency is considered a major risk under climate change. Protecting vulnerable communities is, therefore, a key public policy objective. Natural flood management measures (NFM)-notably re-afforestation on hillslope and floodplain-are increasingly discussed as cost-effective means for providing flood regulation, particularly when considering ecosystem services other than flood regulation. However, studies that place flood benefits alongside other benefits are rare, potentially causing uncertainty in policy decision-making. This paper provides a cost-benefit analysis of the impacts of afforestation on peak river flows under UKCP09 climate change projections, and on additional ecosystem services in a rural catchment in Scotland. We find significant positive net present values (NPV) for all alternatives considered. However, benefits are dominated by ecosystem services other than flood regulation, with values related to climate regulation, aesthetic appeal, recreation and water quality contributing to a high positive NPV. The investment in riparian woodland (under low and central climate change scenarios) delivers a positive NPV alone when considering flood regulation benefits only. The case study suggests that afforestation as a sole NFM measure provides a positive NPV only in some cases but highlights the importance of identifying and quantifying additional ecosystem co-benefits.

A rainfall-runoff model was calibrated and evaluated a in a tropical watershed located in Midwestern Brazil. An ensemble of 17 general circulation model outputs forced by Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) was used to create future climate change scenarios up to 2095. The LID efficiency was evaluated based on the runoff peak reduction and the resilience of stormwater drainage by means of a resilience index. Overall, LID combinations showed a reduction in runoff peak higher than 20%, and the best LID combination had a reduction of as much as 46%. This represents a significant improvement in the resilience against flooding in the study area. Therefore, the findings can contribute to the increase in widespread adoption of LID and can encourage decisionmakers to provide such practices for urban flood management.

Interest in ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is gaining importance due to its potential multiple benefits, including social and environmental aspects, when compared to more traditional approaches such as hard engineering interventions. When assessing EbA strategies, further understanding of the nature-society functions, processes, values, and benefits is needed to increase its application. This study contributes to better knowledge of EbA and other adaptation strategies by developing a systematic literature review of studies performing socio-economic assessments of climate-change adaptation in coastal areas. The analysis of 54 publications revealed that cost-benefit analysis was applied in most studies, followed by multi-criteria analysis and other techniques. Hybrid adaptation strategies based on different combinations of hard, soft, and EbA interventions were considered as potential optimal solutions in a significant part of the assessments. This study shows some potential co-benefits of EbA, such as livelihood diversification or biodiversity conservation, but also stresses the need for further research on this topic, as well as on evaluating how EbA performs in the long term under changing climate-condition scenarios.

Factors Influencing Smallholder Rice Farmers' Vulnerability to Climate Change and Variability in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Rice farmer; Livelihood vulnerability index; Beta regression; Mekong delta; Vietnam	LIVELIHOOD VULNERABILITY; BETA REGRESSION; RIVER DELTA; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; STRATEGIES; HOUSEHOLDS; PROVINCE; RISK; DIVERSIFICATION	This study analyzed the effects of climate change on rice farmers' livelihoods vulnerability by using primary data elicited from 405 rice farming households in Can Tho, Dong Thap, and Tien Giang provinces in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) showed that Can Tho province was the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by Dong Thap and Tien Giang provinces. In particular, the social index sub-indicator showed high vulnerability. The beta regression analysis identified seventeen significant factors influencing the susceptibility of rice farming households in the study area, such as weather information, flood occurrence, drought occurrence, access to extension services, access to credit, and cooperative membership as well as demographic variables and livelihoods related factors. The LVI result suggests the need for the government to consider raising the priority on households in Can Tho province through adaptation support to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity, especially by enhancing the social network in this area to stimulate support from local authorities and farmer groups. The regression results imply that extension services should provide adequate and timely weather information to equip the farmers to be more prepared for climatic shocks. Moreover, credit facilities with low interest rates should be made available, especially to those who are members of agricultural cooperatives.	[Ho, Tien D. N.; Kuwornu, John K.

Propagation and Characteristics of Hydrometeorological Drought Under Changing Climate in Irish Catchments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						propagation; drought; hydrometeorology; climate change; modeling; Ireland	RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; FLOOD HAZARD; UNCERTAINTY; PROJECTIONS; BASEFLOW; IMPACT	Hydrometeorological droughts are complex hazards expressed through the relative deviation in water availability relative to long-term average conditions. The development and propagation of drought is governed by hydrological processes at different spatial scales including precipitation, evapotranspiration, overland flow, soil moisture, groundwater storage and discharge. Detailed investigation is thus required to evaluate associated linkages among various types of hydrometeorological drought to understand the likely impacts of climate change on drought characteristics (magnitude, frequency, duration and propagation). This study explores the impact of climate change on hydrometeorological drought for 10 Irish catchments, using standardized drought indices representing different components of the hydrological system. We employ 12 Global Climate Models from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), forced with SSP370 and bias corrected to catchment conditions to force a conceptual hydrological model to generate hydrological projections for each catchment. The results indicate substantial drying during summer with associated increases in summer drought magnitude and frequency. However, simulations show a wide range of change, especially for hydrological drought (discharge and baseflow). Only modest changes in the magnitude and frequency of hydrological drought events were found, with increases in winter and spring precipitation offsetting summer dryness. Similarly, the probability of meteorological drought propagating to hydrological events (Standardized Streamflow Index/Standardized Baseflow Index), shows modest increases under the climate change projections considered. Findings highlight that drought, especially during summer are a critical climate change risk for adaptation.	[Meresa, H.; Murphy, C.; Donegan, S.

Disaggregation of future GCMs to generate IDF curves for the assessment of urban floods	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; disaggregation; GCM; IDF curves; RCP; urban floods	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL; REGIONS; MODEL	Urbanization and industrialization cause an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn causes changes in the atmosphere. Climate change is causing extreme rainfalls and these rainfalls are getting stronger day after day. Floods are threatening urban areas, and short-duration rainfall and outdated drainages are responsible for urban floods. Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are crucial for both drainage system design and assessment of flood risk. Once IDF curves are determined from historical data, they are assumed to be stationary. However, IDF curves must be non-stationary and time varying based on preparation for extreme events. This study generates future IDF curves with short-duration rainfalls under climate change. To represent future rainfall, an ensemble of four Global Climate Models generated under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 were used in this study. A new approach to the HYETOS disaggregation model was applied to disaggregate daily future rainfall into sub-hourly using disaggregation parameters of hourly measured rainfalls. Hence, sub-hourly future rainfalls will be obtained capturing historical rainfall patterns instead of random rainfall characteristics. Finally, historical and future IDF curves were compared. The study concludes that increases in short-duration rainfalls will be highly intensified in both the near and distant futures with a high probability.

As climate change has escalated, the management of such dangers has grown in importance and urgency, particularly among states with long coast lines. Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction have attracted attention from policymakers in Southeast Asia, which is one of the most disaster-prone regions. Coastal community resilience, however, is not determined by climate and disaster risks alone, but by other factors as well. Waste pollution is an environmental threat that may affect those who are dependent on marine resources. These multiple factors contribute to coastal resilience and are, in fact, addressed separately as different issues; therefore, conflicts or synergies in respective countermeasures often become oversights in the policy-making processes. Through a case study of key Philippine stakeholders, including fishing communities, we identified impacts of climate change, natural hazards, and waste on the livelihoods of community residents and the interplay among these factors. We aim to better understand the situation on the ground and contribute by improving policy recommendations for coastal communities. An integrated approach to enhance coastal adaptation is critical for maximising the effectiveness of the limited resources of communities.

Despite great interest in understanding differences in anxiety and resil-ience in response to natural disasters, enthusiasm appears to outstrip empirical clarity, as there remains considerable ambiguity as to determinants of resilient or pathological outcomes following exposure to natural disasters. In addition, there are several major methodological limitations in climate change and related natural disaster research, including the use of univariate analyses, cross-sectional design, and retrospective measures. Keeping these limitations in mind, we first review literature examining the mental health outcomes of natural disasters. Findings suggest that, overall, resilience is more common than pathological outcomes. Second, we use a multi-dimensional framework of resilience to selectively review factors at the event, individual, as well as family and community levels that could help inform resilient or pathological outcomes. Finally, we consider key limitations and future directions for research and practice in the field of anxiety and resilience in response to climate disasters.

In response, the government of Bangladesh has initiated a number of institutional interventions through development plans to better support sustainable adaptation. There have, however, been relatively few assessments of how these interventions have impacted sustainable local adaptation. Focusing on the highly climate-affected north-eastern floodplain region of Bangladesh, this paper presents the results of a literature synthesis supported by primary field data to identify how existing policy barriers can threaten institutional responses to climate change impacts, while institutional rigidity and the non-inclusiveness of bureaucratic polity work to undermine efficiency, effectiveness, and equitabilitysome important considerations for sustainable adaptation. Our results point toward the need for public policy to better enable broader public participation in the design, implementation, and evaluation of adaptation plans.	[Rahman, H. M.

To date, the impacts of climate change on health in in vivo con-ditions have not been assessed, and no protocol has been developed in this regard. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to develop a protocol as well as design and build a pilot to deal with climate change in vivo to show the direct effects of climate change on health. For this purpose, twenty specialists, comprising ten experts active in field climate and 10 experts in field medicine and anatomy, have been consulted to design the proposed exposure protocol using the Delphi method. According to the prepared protocol, an exposure pilot was then designed and built, which provides the climatic conditions for animal exposure with a fully automatic HMI-PLC system. The results showed the average 12:12-h day/night temperature, humidity, and circadian cycle for three consecutive ten-year periods selected for exposure of 1-month-old male rats. The duration of the exposure period is four months, which is equivalent to a ten-year climatic period. This study is a framework and a starting point for examining the effects of climate change on in vivo conditions that have not yet been considered.

In 1988 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established to coordinate the research. The first scientific publications on the effects of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Finland appeared in the early 1980's. After the launch of the Finnish Research Program on Climate Change (SILMU) in 1990, the number of climate-related projects and publications, and the input of Finnish researchers in the work of the IPCC started to increase. During the subsequent programs, the initial optimism about future crop production conditions changed into an awareness of the threats represented by climate change. Diversity of production and breeding of heat and flooding tolerant, disease resistant and nutrient-use efficient crop varieties were identified as being crucial for adaptation of agriculture. Efficient water management, measures to limit nutrient leaching and timely control of pests and pathogens are also crucial adaptation measures. Carbon storage in soils and biomass and reduced use of organic fields are suggested to be mitigation measures. By 2019, the awareness of the threats of climate change prompted citizens worldwide to demand action, and government programs have begun to include policies addressing reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate Change Vulnerability of American Lobster Fishing Communities in Atlantic Canada	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; lobster; thermal habitat; coastal vulnerability; harbor infrastructure; climate projections; fishery management	EPIZOOTIC SHELL DISEASE; HOMARUS-AMERICANUS; SCOTIAN SHELF; RANGE SHIFTS; OCEAN; GULF; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RECRUITMENT; MATURITY	Climate change impacts on fisheries will undoubtedly have socio-economic impacts on coastal communities and the seafood market. However, it is a challenge to integrate climate change information in a form that can be used efficiently by adaptation planners, policy makers, and fishery managers. In this study, we frame a climate change impact assessment using a geographical perspective based on the management units of the dominant fishery, in this case, American lobster in Nova Scotia, Canada. The information considered here includes economic dependence on the fishery, population size, diversity of the fishery revenue, status of harbor infrastructure, total replacement cost of each harbor, increased relative sea level and flooding, and the vulnerability of offshore lobster to ocean warming and changes in zooplankton composition and anticipatory changes in fishery productivity across management borders. Using two ocean models to provide multi-decadal scale projections of bottom temperature, changes in offshore lobster distribution are projected to have a neutral, or positive impact on the region as a whole. However, when lobster vulnerability is combined with climate change related vulnerabilities of coastal fishing communities, it is evident that adaptation planning is needed for long-term sustainability. This impact assessment provides both a framework and information for further in-depth analyses by climate change adaptation planners and fishery managers.	[Greenan, Blair J.

While major differences exist in how much attention is paid to climate coverage in different parts of the world, how climate is discussed has been noticeably uniform and the major thrust of the "climate communication agenda" remains recognizably "global" in that it is driven by the more mature media markets in the North and especially by the narratives coming out of international climate institutions (e.g., the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], climate Conference of the parties [COPs] international nongovernmental organizations [NGOs], and think tanks). Building on the recent experience of the 2022 floods in Pakistan, this essay argues that with the advent of what we are calling the age of adaptation, climate reporting is likely to shift rapidly from mostly explaining why climate change is important (and generally convergent broad ideas about what might be done about it) to reporting on localized climate impacts (and often divergent preferences on how to allocate responsibility and evaluate the cost of those consequences). This will, we argue, make global media narratives on climate change not only more complex and more contentious, but also more honest.

This is furthering the demand for the implementation of governance relocation frameworks. In order to stay true to the principles of environmental justice while at the same time ensuring an effective policy that meets the needs and wants of affected communities, an adaptive relocation framework requires collaboration between state and non-state actors. It is thus important to pay attention to how non-state actors are incorporated into public participatory climate change adaptation efforts. In order to affectively address previous limitations of public participation, stakeholders must pay attention to already existing power systems. Through a case study approach of a village relocation project in Fiji, I examine the role of power in a climate change adaptation plan that involved the community of Vunidogoloa, local government, and national government stakeholders. I employ Steven Lukes's three-dimensional framework of power to the case of Vunidogoloa, a Fijian village that relocated inland due to coastal erosion and shoreline flooding, to illustrate how the political arrangement of participation reinforced existing hierarchies between the village and the government.

Risk-based portfolio management of civil infrastructure assets under deep uncertainties associated with climate change: a robust optimisation approach	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Robust optimisation; risk assessment; portfolio management; climate change; deterioration; bridge scour	PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; CHANGE ADAPTATION; DECISION-MAKING; BRIDGE SCOUR; RELIABILITY; MAINTENANCE; FRAMEWORK; DETERIORATION; CORROSION; POLICIES	Managers of civil infrastructure systems are facing the challenge to effectively and efficiently manage the ageing and deteriorating asset portfolio while accommodating ever increasing demand resulting from socioeconomic development and climate change. In this article, a novel approach using robust optimisation is proposed for risk-based portfolio management of civil infrastructure assets under deep uncertainties associated with climate change. Robust optimisations based on minimax loss and minimax regret criteria are employed to yield intervention plans that can effectively reduce the long-term risk under different realisations of future scenarios. Through sensitivity analysis, it is found that the obtained solutions from robust optimisation are less sensitive to the factors that require long-term predictions (e.g. change in future hazard and deterioration conditions) than those that do not (e.g. the preference of the decision-maker on user cost and the efficiency of intervention actions). Therefore, the proposed approach is especially suitable for management under deep uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied to plan intervention actions for bridges over the Lehigh River, Pennsylvania under deterioration and flood-induced scour, both of which are affected by climate change.

As two of the main factors affecting the hydrological cycle, land-use change and climate change have attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, there are few studies that comprehensively consider the impacts of land-use change and climate change on hydrological extremes, and few researchers have made a quantitative distinction between them. Regarding this problem, this study aims to quantitatively distinguish the effects of land-use change and climate change on hydrological extremes during the past half century using the method of scenarios simulation with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Furthermore, the variations of hydrological extremes are forecast under future scenarios by incorporating the downscaled climate simulations from several representative general circulation models (GCMs). Results show that: (1) respectively rising and declining risks of floods and droughts are detected during 1960-2017. The land use changed little during 1980-2015, except for the water body and building land. (2) The SWAT model possesses better simulation effects on high flows compared with low flows. Besides, the downscaled GCM data can simulate the mean values of runoff well, and acceptable simulation effects are achieved for the extreme runoff indicators, with the exception of frequency and durations of floods and extreme low flows. (3) During the period 1970-2017, the land-use change exerts little impact on runoff extremes, while climate change is one of the main factors leading to changes in extreme hydrological situation. (4) In the context of global climate change, the indicators of 3-day max and 3-day min runoff will probably increase in the near future (2021-2050) compared with the historical period (1970-2005). This research helps us to better meet the challenge of probably increased flood risks by providing references to the decision making of prevention and mitigation measures, and thus possesses significant social and economic value.

J	Housh, M; Aharon, T				Housh, Mashor; Aharon, Tomer			Info-Gap Models for Optimal Multi-Year Management of Regional Water Resources Systems under Uncertainty	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Water Resources Systems; Info-Gap Decision Theory; uncertainty; climate change; Sea of Galilee	CLIMATE-CHANGE	The common practices for the planning and management of Water Resources Systems (WSSs) have been challenged in the last few decades by global climate change processes, which are observed around the world in increasing frequencies. Climate change is manifested by climate variability, temperature increase, and extreme events such as droughts and floods, which have a decisive effect on natural resource availability and in turn on water quality. Historical records may not be sufficient to reliably account for uncertain future predictions under climate change conditions. While such highly uncertain situations become the "normal" case worldwide, the traditional practices of probabilistic risk measures cannot be used to appropriately quantify the uncertain phenomena under non-stationarity conditions. To better account for uncertain future conditions, the objective of this study is to develop a water management model based on Info-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) using optimization under deep uncertainty conditions. The Info-Gap theory is a framework that measures the confidence in the operational decisions by quantifying the robustness to uncertainty without accounting for any probabilistic data. To demonstrate the method as a tool to better guide the long-term sustainable operation of the water supply system under uncertain future conditions, we applied the Info-Gap model to the Sea of Galilee (SoG) regional WSS, which is a significant part of the Israeli National Water System (INWS). For Israel, which is, like other Middle East semi-arid regions, prone to dry conditions and limited water availability, there are well-founded concerns that prolonged periods of drought lie ahead, as a consequence of the global climate change processes. This study contributes a management tool for decision making under deep uncertainty to improve the decision-making process and better adapt to unpredictable uncertain future conditions. We demonstrate how the IGDT could be formulated and used to analyze WSSs under different settings and demonstrate how decisions could be derived from the IGDT formulation. We also show a sensitivity analysis for the obtained solutions.

Majedul; Hofstra, Nynke			The impact of socio-economic development and climate change on <i>E-coli</i> loads and concentrations in Kabul River, Pakistan	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Global change; Scenario analysis; Escherichia coli; Hydrological modelling; Bacterial modelling	WATER-QUALITY; SCENARIO FRAMEWORK; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; SURFACE; CRYPTOSPORIDIUM; DISEASES; MODEL; BASIN; GROUNDWATER; KARAKORAM	Microbial pollution is a major problem worldwide. High concentrations of Escherichia coli have been found in Kabul River in Pakistan. E. coli concentrations vary under different socio-economic conditions, such as population and livestock densities, urbanisation, sanitation and treatment of wastewater and manure, and climate-change aspects, such as floods and droughts. In this paper, we assess potential future E. coli loads and concentrations in the Kabul River using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with scenarios that are based on the most recent Shared Socio-economic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways (SSPs and RCPs) developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scenario_1 considers moderate population and livestock density growth, planned urbanisation and strongly improved wastewater and manure treatment (based on SSP1, "Sustainability"), and moderate climate change (RCP4.5, moderate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions). Scenario_2 considers strong population and livestock density growth, moderate urbanisation, slightly improved wastewater treatment, no manure treatment (based on SSP3, "Regional rivalry") and strong climate change (RCP8.5, high GHG emissions). Simulated E. coli responses to Scenario_2 suggest a mid-century increase in loads by 111% and a late century increase of 201% compared to baseline loads. Similarly, simulated E. coli loads are reduced by 60% for the mid-century and 78% for the late century compared to the baseline loads. When additional treatment is simulated in Scenario_1, the loads are reduced even further by 94%, 92% and 99.3% compared to the baseline concentrations when additional tertiary treatment, manure treatment or both have been applied respectively. This study is one of the first to apply combined socio-economic development and climate change scenario analysis with an E. coli concentration model to better understand how these concentrations may change in the future. The scenario analysis shows that reducing E. coli concentrations in Pakistan's rivers is possible, but requires strongly improved waste water treatment and manure management measures.

This work explores the impact of internal climate variability on streamflow projections for 133 catchments across the eastern and northeastern United States. Using data from a single model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) at high spatial and temporal resolution, this work assesses the magnitude of anthropogenic climate change and internal climate variability on projected future streamflow. The impact of catchment size is studied by grouping catchments into three different size classes (less than500 km2, between 500 and 1000 km2, and greater than 1000 km2). Results show that in a warmer climate, low to middle quantiles of future streamflow will systematically decrease, while the upper quantiles will increase. Increases are largest for more extreme streamflow indices. Using three different approaches, the role of internal variability is studied to estimate the time of emergence (TOE). In this case, results show that the climate change signal of extreme floods and droughts emerges later than that of median flow quantiles, even though the changes for floods as droughts is more significant. There is a clear relationship between catchment size and TOE, with small catchments seeing an earlier TOE for floods, and a later one for droughts. These results provide insight into adaptation times for small to large watersheds.

Socio-ecological challenges and food security in the 'salad bowl' of Fiji, Sigatoka Valley	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Adaptation; Fiji; Food security; Climate change; Resilience; Vulnerability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PACIFIC; ISLAND; ADAPTATION; VILLAGE	This article examines food security in the Sigatoka Valley, one of the most productive food regions in Fiji, in the context of recent socio-ecological challenges through a case study of Narewa village. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews (n = 25), a fixed question food insecurity experience survey (n = 25), and a free listing exercise about preferred and consumed foods (n = 24). Results revealed that while most households had access to sufficient food, the increased frequency and intensity of droughts, tropical cyclones, and flooding caused almost half to worry about meeting their future food needs. To date, a culture of sharing within the village has helped most households access food but this will likely be inadequate to meet future needs as climate change is projected to impact food production. Given that the foundation of food production in Narewa, like other villages in the valley, relies on the long-term viability of agricultural systems, better focus needs to be placed on the natural resources that form the backbone of these systems such as water availability, soil health, and slope stability and their resilience to anthropogenic and natural stressors. Efforts that focus on protecting and enhancing local ecosystems in light of expected future climate change, combined with greater attention on food storage and the use of resilient crops, and enhancing social cohesion and sharing networks are needed to avoid breaching tipping points in the food system.

Urban and peri-urban agriculture in Goia<SIC>nia: The search for solutions to adapt cities in the context of global climate change	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Urban voids; Urban resilience; Urban and peri-urban agriculture; Climate change; Carbon sequestration		Goiania is a city in the late 1930s, and one of the two cities constructedin the Brazilian savannah. In 2018, it had 1.4 million inhabitants and 2,05217 inhabitantsper km(2). With less than 100 years of age, the urbanization model associated with the effects of global climate change has led the city to live, in recent periods, with moments of water scarcity and flooding. In view of this, the urban municipal policy seeks to point out actions that aim to control land use and occupation from an environmental sustainability perspective. Urban and pen-urban agriculture (UPA) is one strategy and will be the main objective of this article. The urban municipal policy will indicate areas for the practice of UPA as a strategy for adapting cities in the context of climate change. As a secondary objective, the potential for carbon sequestration by this activity was analyzed. The methodology was based on the analysis of urban land use in a Geographic information system (GIS) environment. The database of the Municipality of Goiania was used. The results indicated three levels of priorities, with a total of 10,650 hectares. In terms of carbon sequestration, this area would result in the capture of 5.536.764,60 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere in 20 years.

A large body of literature, as well as sustained efforts to attract funding for the research on soil organic matter, have focused on the soil carbon sequestration - climate change nexus. However, because CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas released by soils, and given the fact that the feasibility of large-scale carbon sequestration in soils remains controversial, this approach does not appear optimal to convince policy makers to invest in soils. In this perspective article, we argue that a far better strategy revolves around the effect of climate change on functions/services that soils render. In particular, since climatologists forecast less frequent but more intense rainfall events in the future, which may lead to food shortages, catastrophic flooding, and soil erosion if soils are not able to cope, a more suitable focus of the research would be to increase soil organic matter content so as to strengthen the water regulation function of soils. The different conceptual and methodological shifts that this new focus will require are discussed in detail.

Peri-urban areas-which are typically under-governed, undergoing significant environmental change and highly susceptible to zoonotic disease transfer-are especially important in this regard. In this research note, we briefly explore how climate change is contributing to both peri-urbanization and EID risk. First, climate change is linked to the displacement of people and other species into peri-urban areas, thereby increasing opportunities for zoonotic disease transfer. Second, whether coastal or inland, peri-urban space, characterized by low resources and inadequate services, is also typically vulnerable to mounting climate impacts including severe weather events, sea level rise, flooding, erosion, drought, salinization and heat waves that create socio-ecological conditions amenable to EID outbreaks. These relationships are particularly alarming given that peri-urban environments abut urban areas creating numerous pathways for the movement of EIDs into larger populations. In this research note, we briefly explore these relationships and illustrate them with a causal loop diagram of climate change-peri-urban displacement-EID interactions based on field work in Malawi. We conclude by emphasizing the need for improved EID risk management and suggest that bringing together the environmental expertise of the conservation community with that of planners through a more convivial urbanism that draws on the concept of working landscape conservation might be a beneficial approach.

Three decades of landuse landcover were analyzed to assess the performance of the existing drainage system. Furthermore, the effect of climate change on drainage system performance was assessed using the estimated design storms from two global climate models (CanESM2 and HadGEM2-ES).New hydrological insights for region: The trend of landuse landcover analysis shows that the town has experienced a significant increase in the impervious surface area ranging from 59.73 % to 86.01 %. In response to urbanization, the trend of peak stormwater showed a continuously increasing trend. The field observations confirm that the landuse change has had a significant impact on the performance of stormwater drainage systems. The study also found that the peak runoff and flooding volume of the study area was increased under separate and combined effects of rainfall intensity variation due to climate change and increased impervious surface area. This finding indicates that existing drainage systems flooded due to discharge exceeding the design capacity and that profit is required when considering the effects of both land-use and climate change scenarios. Three environmentally friendly low-impact development approaches: bio-retention, permeable pavement, and a combination of the two are applied to reduce increased peak stormwater and mitigate flooding problems.

We analyse the responses already reflected in Czech water policy and legislation at three levels: strategic, statutory and constitutional. We first describe the substantial changes that have been satisfactorily introduced into the Czech government's policies. We then trace the far less successful developments in the law, which have so far essentially been limited to drought plans and restrictions on water extraction during droughts. At the core, we concentrate on the political attempts to constitutionalize water protection.

This work aims to provide new analytical elements to decision-makers in flood management and forecasting in three Mediterranean catchments (Lonquen, Evrotas, and Azzaba), in order to better understand their hydrological behavior and to quantify the flow and its vulnerability to climate change. A semi-distributed conceptual model (HBV-A model) was used to simulate flows with a daily time step. The model results (simulated flows) were used to examine the evolution of high flows using two different approaches (linear regressions and statistical test). The Chilean and the Greece catchments show a decrease in flooding. However, the Moroccan catchment reacts differently, since a positive trend in high flows is observed. The overall results confirm the influence of climate change on the rainfall/runoff relationship.

In this study, we propose spatial solutions to enhance resilience in Korean cities facing climate change and minimize damages from natural disasters. To achieve this, we developed a vulnerability analysis model considering inadequate facilities and public-space utilization. We analyzed climate vulnerability under future scenarios, focusing on heat waves, urban flooding, and property damage in Korea, which are increasing in occurrence. By incorporating various climate-change-induced natural disaster factors into climate exposure variables, we identified current vulnerabilities within the context of future scenarios, allowing for the utilization of sensors and optimal monitoring locations for early preparedness. Future research could further establish criteria for designating natural disaster prevention districts and regulating development activities within such zones, as well as determining the best locations for heat wave and flood disaster prevention sensors.

Accounting for Climate Change in Extreme Sea Level Estimation	WATER			English	Article						climate change; coastal flooding; extreme sea levels; generalised Pareto distribution; non-stationarity; skew surge	MODELS; TRENDS	Extreme sea level estimates are fundamental for mitigating coastal flooding as they provide insight for defence engineering. As the global climate changes, rising sea levels combined with increases in storm intensity and frequency pose an increasing risk to coastline communities. We present a new method for estimating extreme sea levels that accounts for the effects of climate change on extreme events that are not accounted for by mean sea level trends. We follow a joint probabilities methodology, considering skew surge and peak tides as the only components of sea levels. We model extreme skew surges using a non-stationary generalised Pareto distribution (GPD) with covariates accounting for climate change, seasonality and skew surge-peak tide interaction. We develop methods to efficiently test for extreme skew surge trends across different coastlines and seasons. We illustrate our methods using data from four UK tide gauges and estimate sea level return levels when accounting for these long-term trends.

Understanding hydroclimatic trends and variability is critical for developing integrated coupled human and natural system models to evaluate future scenarios of vulnerability. Here we describe the historical climatic changes in the Logone River basin using grid-based climatic data during a time of concomitant human hydrological modification of the floodplain. Temporal trends were analysed by comparing two periods i.e. 1901/1921-1961 (pre-1960) and 1961-2013 (post-1960). Trends were analysed spatially based on the basin's two Koppen climatic zones: savanna (Aw) covering the southern upstream areas and semi-arid hot (BSh) covering the northern downstream areas. The results show significant increasing trends in maximum and minimum temperatures and potential evapotranspiration (PET), and non-significant decreasing trends in annual rainfall and number of rainy days, across the study area. These climatic changes on temporal and spatial scales play an important role for the coupled natural and human systems in the Logone floodplain.

An improved three-parameter hydrological model (CM) based on monthly water balance using an exponential equation to depict the distribution of groundwater storage capacity was developed and evaluated. The model uses Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) rainfall data as input, with the Zhejiang Province as the case application, and the effects of climate change and human activities on streamflow changes were assessed by separating environmental variables in this study. The results indicate that APHRODITE data has excellent monthly accuracy, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) of more than 0.96 and an average absolute percentage bias (Pbais) of less than 5%. The three models are relatively close in their ability to simulate high flows, but the CM simulated low flow is better than the other two models. Positive and negative Pbais phenomena occur in the CM model in each catchment, and absolute levels are regulated by 5%. Furthermore, the CM model's average Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE) is greater than 0.9, indicating that it can correctly fulfill the water balance. The results are more consistent throughout multiple catchments in each watershed using Budyko-based and hydrological model technique to evaluate the influence of climate change and human activities on streamflow. Climate change dominated streamflow variations in 18 of the 21 catchments in Zhejiang Province, whereas human activities dominated the rest. The findings of the study will be used to influence the management, development, and usage of water resources in the watershed.

In order for food production systems to remain viable and resilient under a changing climate, novel approaches, which integrate risk management (i.e. adaptation) and risk transfer strategies, such as insurance, are required. We argue that the coordinated integration of risk management and risk transfer approaches will support greater resilience of food production systems under climate change. Conversely, if risk management and risk transfer strategies are not carefully integrated, there is potential to undermine adaptive capacity (e.g. insurance subsidies may dissuade farmers from investing in climate adaptation) and ultimately reduce the capacity of food production systems to cope with and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change. Here we propose a resilience-based conceptual framework for integrating risk management and risk transfer strategies along with four key principles, which we believe could underlie their successful integration and thus enhance food production system resilience under climate change. These are as follows: (1) pro-active investments in farmer climate adaptation rather than re-active disaster relief, (2) structuring of government subsidies around insurance and climate disaster relief to incentivise farmer climate adaptation, (3) rewarding farmer efforts towards climate adaptation with cheaper insurance premiums for those farmers that invest resources into climate adaptation and (4) recognising investments in the integration of farm climate adaptation and risk transfer schemes within the broader context of future climate disaster risk management and global food security. Such an integrated investment approach could substantially reduce future economic losses for farmers while also enhancing food security under climate change.

Using the "volunteers on-site system" to strategically adapt to crisis situations caused by climate change	BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ			German	Article						Disaster Control; Care Interruptions; Regional Management North Hesse; Organised help; Emergency services; Care Recipients		Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. The impacts are globally and regionally visible through more and more frequent extreme weather events, be they devastating storms, longer periods of cold and heat or prolonged periods of drought alternating with heavy rain and flooding. In addition to the urgent need for climate change mitigation, therefore, the question has been raised for some time as to which measures cities and municipalities, rural districts and regions can use to prepare themselves against the consequences of climate change.The region of Northern Hesse developed strategies and measures for climate adaptation at an early stage as part of the KLIMZUG (shaping climate change for the future in regions) federal support programme. The question remains open as to what will happen in rural regions - and especially in remote places - when there is no more civil protection assistance available in the event of adisaster either because they are needed elsewhere, roads are impassable or electricity, telephone and Internet connections are no longer functioning. For this case, aproject consortium led by the Regionalmanagement Nordhessen GmbH has now developed the volunteers on-site system (Freiwilligen-vor-Ort-System [FvOS]) as an organised form of neighbourhood support.This model project, which is unique in Germany, is intended to show how care for people in need of help and care can be ensured in rural areas in the event of adisaster.The project has sensitised citizens and task forces to this task and initiated aprocess that is intended to lead to more self-responsibility, but also safety in the event of adisaster situation. FvOS is intended to signal the need for climate change mitigation throughout Germany.

Here, we investigate climate change impacts on different livelihood activities in western Amazonia, through the lens of local ecological knowledge. We conducted semi-structured interviews and surveys with similar to 400 residents from 24 communities spread across a similar to 600 km stretch of the Jurua River. Residents reported a vast set of changes, many referring to changes in the atmospheric system (e.g., more summer rainfall), but with cascading effects in physical, biological, and human systems. Different livelihood activities are impacted with different intensities and by different climate-related changes. While most changes have negative impacts, residents recognize some positive impacts of climate-driven changes (e.g., large river floods positively impact fishing). Beyond demonstrating the manifold and multidirectional climate change impacts, our findings highlight the contribution of local ecological knowledge in identifying vulnerable livelihood activities and biodiversity-based value chains.

We compared young (5-15 years since latest grassland renewal) with old (>20 years since latest grassland renewal) permanent grassland soils in terms of carbon stock, carbon sequestration, drought tolerance and flood resistance. The research was carried out on marine clay soil at 10 dairy farms with young and old permanent grassland. As hypothesized, the carbon stock was larger in old grassland (62 Mg C ha(-1)) topsoil (0-10 cm) than in young grassland topsoil (51 Mg C ha(-1)). The carbon sequestration rate was greater in young (on average 3.0 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) compared with old grassland (1.6 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and determined by initial carbon stock. Regarding potential drought tolerance, we found larger soil moisture and soil organic matter (SOM) contents in old compared with young grassland topsoils. As hypothesized, the old grassland soils were more resistant to heavy rainfall as measured by water infiltration rate and macroporosity (at 20 cm depth) in comparison with the young grassland soils. In contrast to our hypothesis we did not find a difference in rooting between young and old permanent grassland, probably due to large variability in root biomass and root tip density. We conclude that old grasslands at dairy farms on clay soil can contribute more to the ecosystem services climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation than young grasslands. This study shows that under real farm conditions on a clay topsoil, carbon stock increases with grassland age and even after 30 years carbon saturation has not been reached. Further study is warranted to determine by how much extending grassland age can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Highlights We studied the effect of young versus old grassland on a range of soil properties related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Old, more than young, grassland soils offer potential to mitigate and adapt to climate change. This finding gives farmers insight into the merits of extending grassland age on clay soils. Soil carbon stock determines carbon sequestration rate more than grassland age.

Potential pollution risks of historic landfills in England: Further analysis of climate change impacts	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article; Early Access						contamination; erosion; flooding; hydrology; legacy landfill	MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; REMOVAL REQUIREMENTS; COASTAL LANDFILLS; SURFACE-WATER; GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; LEACHATE; UK; RESOURCES; MODEL	Five years ago, an article in WIREs Water provided the first comprehensive analysis of historic (legacy) landfill sites vulnerable to coastal flooding and erosion at a national scale (England). This update expands upon that article by considering the potential impacts of climate change upon inland historic landfills. Globally, there are hundreds of thousands of landfills that predate modern environmental regulations, and where waste is not isolated from the surrounding environment, but climate change impacts on the pollution risk from historic landfills in freshwater environments has received little attention. Where climate change causes an increase in the frequency and magnitude of fluvial flood events, this will increase leachate generation and the probability of landfill erosion and solid waste release. Where there is increased drought the landfill capping materials may crack, opening up new pollutant pathways, and increasing the risk of solid waste release. Changes to groundwater movement resulting from climate change may open new leachate pathways, and in England alone, thousands of historic landfills are in (groundwater) Source Protection Zones where modern regulations to protect drinking water supplies would not permit their construction. This increased contaminant release from historic landfills in freshwater environments may impact surface and/or groundwater quality and ecological health, increase costs for drinking water monitoring/treatment, or make some abstraction sources unviable. This is especially of concern where receptors are subject to multiple pressures and may cause tipping points to be reached. Further research is warranted into contaminant behavior, receptor vulnerability, historic landfill risk prioritization, and mitigation/remediation methods.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Engineering WaterScience of Water > Water QualityScience of Water > Water and Environmental ChangeWater and Life > Stresses and Pressures on Ecosystems	[Brand, James H.; Spencer, Kate L.] Queen Mary Univ London, London, England	University of London; Queen Mary University London	Brand, JH (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, London, England.	j.h.brand@qmul.ac.uk		Spencer, Kate/0000-0001-6621-6945					116	0	0	10	10	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2049-1948			WIRES WATER	Wiley Interdiscip.

The Eastern Cape Province in South Africa is one of the driest provinces with prolonged water scarcity challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate coping strategies adopted by the rural poor to build resilience against food insecurity. Primary data was collected from a total of 385 respondents in three rural communities using semi-structured questionnaires and interview. The findings suggest that farmers have been proactive in responding to climate change and food security. The study revealed that farmers are engaged in different coping strategies to ensure that there is enough food for the household. Although some of the coping strategies might assist, others would have severe consequences on the health of the population, especially children. Based on the findings, it is recommended that there should be regular engagement by the local municipality, the community and rural farmers on climate change events. The focus should be on the management of drought, heatwaves, flood, and soil erosion. The government within the local municipality should also focus on building a dam for rural farmers. The dam will serve as a reservoir of water for irrigation during drought.

SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article							CROP YIELDS; TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; LINKAGES; RAINFALL	Concerns about the human effects of climate change have contributed to forecasts of how populations in drought-prone and flood-prone areas would respond to these events. Empirical studies have predicted that human migration has been among the critical resilient strategy in responding to the impact of climate change. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the climate-migration relationship, the impacts of climate change on international migration flows from sub-Saharan Africa nations to South Africa are investigated empirically in this paper. The study employed static and dynamic models and panel data from 35 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, spanning 1990 to 2017. The findings are as follows: (1) The analysis shows that historical temperature has a positive and statistically significant effect on outmigration in agriculture-dependent nations. (2) The analysis shows that agricultural value added as a share in gross domestic product has a negative and statistically significant effect on outmigration in agriculture-dependent nations. (3) The results also show that geographic location and development level of a country, in addition to dependency on agriculture, are key factors in the climate change-international migration nexus. Policy implications are discussed.

The city of Fredericton, New Brunswick has a long history of river and overland flooding; however, more recent changes in local weather patterns have led to an increase in flood risk in the area. For more than a decade, decision-makers in Fredericton have worked to mainstream adaptation action within municipal policy in order to address the growing flood risk. Through anticipatory spatial planning and incremental infrastructure upgrades, the city aim's to proactively mitigate the impacts of climate change on day-to-day life. Framed through evolutionary governance, this article investigates the relationships between actors and institutions, as well as power and knowledge in order to uncover long-standing path dependencies that hinder comprehensive climate change adaptation action. While Fredericton can be considered a success story in many ways, this research reveals flawed multi-level governance structures and economic development goals as major barriers to effective adaptation in practice. As climate impacts worsen, balancing economic and political interests with adaptation action will require new approaches to adaptation governance.	[Birchall, S.

This study projected the temporal and spatial variation in urban flood susceptibility during the period 2020-2050 on the basis of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). A case study in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was conducted for ver-ifying the feasibility and applicability of this approach. GBA is predicted to encounter the increase in extreme precipitation with high intensity and frequency, along with rapid expansion of constructed areas, resulting in ex-acerbating of urban flood susceptibility. The areas with medium and high flood susceptibility will be expected to increase continuously from 2020 to 2050, by 9.5 %, 12.0 %, and 14.4 % under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. In terms of the assessment of spatial-temporal flooding pattern, the areas with high flood susceptibility are overlapped with that in the populated urban center in GBA, surrounding the existing risk areas, which is consistent with the tendency of construction land expansion. The approach in the present study will pro-vide comprehensive insights into the reliable and accurate assessment of urban flooding susceptibility in re-sponse to climate change and urbanization.

High mountains and high latitudes are experiencing the greatest warming of all regions on Earth and also are some of the most sensitive areas to climate change, in part because ecosystems and natural processes in these areas are intimately linked to the cryosphere. Evidence is mounting that warming will further reduce permafrost and snow and ice cover in high mountains, which in turn will destabilize many slopes, alter sediment delivery to streams, and change subalpine and alpine ecosystems. This paper contributes to the continuing discussion of impacts of climate change on mountain environments by comparing and discussing processes and trends in the mountains of western Canada and the European Alps. We highlight the effects of physiography and climate on physical processes occurring in the two regions. Processes of interest include landslides and debris flows induced by glacier debuttressing, alpine permafrost thaw, changes in rainfall regime, formation and sudden drainage of glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes, ice avalanches, glacier surges, and large-scale sediment transfers due to rapid deglacierization. Our analysis points out the value of integrating observations and data from different areas of the world to better understand these processes and their impacts.

Partial afforestation can be a practical mitigation strategy if efficiently integrated with farms and pastures. Using an integrated surface-subsurface hydrological model, this study evaluates the water and salt dynamics and soil salinization conditions of a rural intermittent catchment in the semi -arid climate of southeast Australia subjected to four different partial afforestation configurations under different climate change scenarios, as predicted by several general circulation models. The results show that the locations of afforested areas can induce a retarding effect in the outflow of groundwater salt, with tree planting at lower elevations showing the steadier salt depletion rates. Moreover, except for the configuration with trees planted near the outlet of the catchment, the streamflow is maintained under all other configurations. It appears that under both Representative Concentration Pathways considered (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model represents the fastest salt export scheme, whereas the Canadian Earth System Model and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate represent the slowest salt export scheme. Overall, it is found that the location of partial afforestation generally plays a more significant role than the climate change scenarios.

We have also seen a rapid acceleration in extreme weather events influenced by climate change, including forest fires in Australia, the United States, and Europe; severe flooding in many parts of the world; and extreme heat waves in, for instance, India and Pakistan. These demonstrate how climate change is also increasingly a matter of human and national security. Therefore, climate change as a policy issue and a political topic reaches beyond the remit of sectoral climate or environmental policy. It should be seen as a horizontal cross-government policy area that increasingly affects the security of the whole society.

This article explains why, with its arm of "creation science," young-earth creationism is a significant factor in evangelicals' widespread denial of anthropogenic climate change. Young-earth creationism has become closely intertwined with doctrines such as the Bible's divine authority and the Imago Dei, as well as with social issues such as abortion and euthanasia. Addressing this aspect of the environmental crisis among evangelicals will require a re-orientation of biblical authority so as to approach social issues through a hermeneutic that is able to acknowledge the reality and imminent threat of climate change.

Unpriced climate risk and the potential consequences of overvaluation in US housing markets	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							PROPERTY; EVENTS; PRICES; IMPACT; MAPS	Climate change impacts threaten the stability of the US housing market. In response to growing concerns that increasing costs of flooding are not fully captured in property values, we quantify the magnitude of unpriced flood risk in the housing market by comparing the empirical and economically efficient prices for properties at risk. We find that residential properties exposed to flood risk are overvalued by US$ 121-US$237 billion, depending on the discount rate. In general, highly overvalued properties are concentrated in counties along the coast with no flood risk disclosure laws and where there is less concern about climate change. Low-income households are at greater risk of losing home equity from price deflation, and municipalities that are heavily reliant on property taxes for revenue are vulnerable to budgetary shortfalls. The consequences of these financial risks will depend on policy choices that influence who bears the costs of climate change.

Taking advantage of the work done in the H2020 RESCCUE project, 12 different papers dealing with several issues related to the resilience of urban areas have been published. Due to the complexity of cities, urban resilience management is one of the key challenges that our societies have to deal with in the near future. In addition, urban resilience is a transversal and multi-sectorial issue, affecting different urban services, several hazards, and all the steps of the risk management cycle. This is precisely why the papers contained in this Special Issue focus on varied subjects, such as impact assessments, urban resilience assessments, adaptation strategies, flood risk and urban services, always focusing on at least two of these topics.

Over the past century, climate change has contributed to a gradual and considerable rise in sea level, which has eroded shorelines and increased storm-related coastal flooding. The differences in estuary water quality over time, both seasonally and annually, have been efficiently controlled by changes in stream flow. Assessment requires digitized analytical platforms to lower the risk of catastrophes associated with climate change in coastal towns. To predict future changes in an area's vulnerability and waste planning de-cisions, a prospective investigation requires qualitative and quantitative scenarios. The paper concentrates on the development of a forecasting platform to evaluate the climate change and waste water impacts on the south coastal region of India. Due to the enhancement of Digitization, a multi-model ensemble combined with manifold learning is implemented on the multi-case models influencing the uncertainty probability rate of 23% and can be ignored with desired precaution on the coastal environmental. Because Manifold Learning Analysis results cannot be utilized directly in wastewater management studies because of their inherent biases, a statistical bias correction and meta-feature estimation have been implemented. Within the climate-hydrology modeling chain, the results demonstrate a wide range of expected changes in water resources in some places. Experimental statistics reveal that the forecasted rate of 91.45% will be the better choice to reduce the uncertainty of climatic change and wastewater management.	[Priyanka, E.

Impact of Global Climate Change on Pulmonary Health: Susceptible and Vulnerable Populations	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY			English	Review						vulnerable populations; environmental health; SARS-CoV-2; low- and middle-income countries; air pollution	AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; AIR-POLLUTION; DUST STORMS; TEMPERATURE; EXPOSURE; ASTHMA; HOSPITALIZATIONS; INDOOR; WORK	As fossil fuel combustion continues to power the global economy, the rate of climate change is accelerating, causing severe respiratory health impacts and large disparities in the degree of human suffering. Hotter and drier climates lead to longer and more severe wildland fire seasons, impairing air quality around the globe. Hotter temperatures lead to higher amounts of ozone and particles, causing the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases and premature mortality. Longer pollen seasons and higher pollen concentrations provoke allergic airway diseases. In arid regions, accelerated land degradation and desertification are promoting dust pollution and impairing food production and nutritional content that are essential to respiratory health. Extreme weather events and flooding impede healthcare delivery and can lead to poor indoor air quality due to mold overgrowth. Climate and human activities that harm the environment and ecosystem may also affect the emergence and spread of viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and associated morbidity and mortality exacerbated by air pollution. Children and elderly individuals are more susceptible to the adverse health effects of climate change. Geographical and socioeconomic circumstances, together with a decreased capacity to adapt, collectively increase vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. Successful mitigation of anthropogenic climate change is dependent on the commitment of energy-intensive nations to manage greenhouse gas emissions, as well as societal support and response to aggravating factors. In this review, we focus on the respiratory health impacts of global climate change, with an emphasis on susceptible and vulnerable populations and low- and middle-income countries.

This research uses a Bayesian network (BN) approach to analyze the intensity of such urban risks for the Andean municipality of Pasto, Colombia, under climate change scenarios. The stochastic BN model is linked to correlational models and local scenarios of representative concentration trajectories (RCP) to project the possible risks to which the municipality of Pasto will be exposed in the future. The results show significant risks in crop yields, food security, water availability and disaster risks, but no significant risks on the incidence of acute diarrheal diseases (ADD) and acute respiratory infections (ARI), whereas positive outcomes are likely to occur in livestock production, influenced by population growth. The advantage of the BN approach is the possibility of updating beliefs in the probabilities of occurrence of events, especially in developing, intermediate cities with information-limited contexts.

South Asia is daily going to be more vulnerable to climate change and climatic variability. This region is facing multiple challenges in terms of climate change, dilapidation of ecosystems, and food insecurity. Climate is the primary determining factor for agricultural output, which unswervingly influences food production across the globe. South Asia is mainly an agricultural foundation based region and thus the economy of these regions directly depends on agriculture and agricultural production. Due to the extensive dependence on natural assets for thriving, it makes the people of this region more vulnerable to climate change. This region is now under serious risk from sea-level rising and growing incidences of extreme events such as flash floods, enhanced temperature, drought, salinity, cyclones, storms, landslides, and irregularity of precipitation. These abiotic stresses continuously disturb plant growth and productivity. It is now the time to take urgent action on these issues towards a sustainable, inclusive and resource efficient way to overcome this. In this review, we summarize the overall situation of climate change in the South Asian countries and their adverse consequences on plants, and upcoming challenges towards a sustainable production.

Study focus: This study aims to assess the sensitivity of Nam Ngum 1 reservoir operation to water resource uncertainty driven by a combination of climate change and upstream cascade dam development. New hydrological insights for the region: Precipitation projections of the basin under a 4 degrees increase scenario vary in the range of -9.6 % to +6.9 %, compared to the historical observed precipitation (present climate). The impact of climate change on hydropower resources was investigated. Based on the combined effect of climate change and upstream cascade dam development, the projected inflow of the Nam Ngum 1 reservoir at the full development stage will change from -16.0 % to +6.5 %, which results in a large range of annual energy production changes from -18.8 % to +2.8 % compared to the current condition (present climate and existing dam stage). Furthermore, water losses from the reservoir due to water discharge from the spillway for extreme floods and evaporation are expected to increase with increasing temperature, which will lead to a loss in energy production. Our study indicates that the operation of hydropower should be adapted to the effects of climate change. This information can be used by stakeholders to propose water resource management strategies.

The various types of land use, especially agriculture and forestry, account for nearly a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the world's soil is under pressure from many factors, including climate change and land use change. Increases in temperature, prolonged drought and floods put pressure on the soil. In order to contribute to a better understanding of these interactions, we conducted a review combining a narrative-focused approach, selecting examples worldwide, and a bibliometric analysis (VosViewer software). This review reports on a study that analyses how climate change and land use change may negatively influence soil biodiversity and related services. It also outlines some of the actions needed to increase the resilience of soil biodiversity in the context of a changing climate. Some key findings are: 1) Well-managed soils are critical for resilient production systems. 2) Integrated agricultural production systems have gained prominence as climate-resilient production systems. 3) Agricultural zoning may be a valuable tool in integrated systems to minimise the effects of climate change. However, it is vital to continuously monitor environmental variations so producers can be more prepared for climate change and extreme events.

ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Migration; Maize farmers; Ghana; Heckit probit model	AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; INTERNAL MIGRATION; VARIABILITY; DROUGHT	Studies on climate change-migration nexus have generally assumed that all climatic conditions trigger migration in the same direction without a differentiated understanding of which conditions drive migration of rural farmers or otherwise. This study examines climate changemigration nexus in Ghana by using data collected from 500 maize farmers. Observed errors in the data were corrected through a propensity score matching (PSM) technique. Location was endogenously related to migration, with the unobserved errors corrected by implementing a twostage Heckit probit model. The results show that drought and decrease in rainfall are climatic conditions likely to trigger migration. However, floods and decline in soil fertility are less likely to induce migration. Also, farming experience, access to credit, participation in climate-smart agriculture training, access to extension services, and information from extension agents influenced the present location of maize farmers. These push factors identified were corroborated in focus group discussions. The study recommends that policymakers, development partners, and other relevant stakeholders should first understand and appreciate the deafferented roles of diverse climatic conditions on migrations, and then support farmers to adopt appropriate longterm climate change adaptation strategies to address perennial climatic factors that affect livelihoods. While doing so, short-term measures such as scaling up access to climate services should be devised to adapt to climate change.

Realizing these threats has heightened scholarly inquiry on future risk trends of climate change and adaptation strategies in the countries of Global South and North. However, most studies are based on data of North America, Europe, and Asia. There is minimal documentation of adaptation strategies to mitigate the risk of extreme weather in cities of Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, this study addresses this need by examining the factors influencing individual and household adaptation strategies to climate risk in Port Harcourt Metropolis, Nigeria. Data was collected from 384 randomly selected household heads in different residential densities of the city. Household socioeconomic and demographic attributes, awareness of climate change and factors influencing their adaptation strategies to climate risk were assessed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study showed that adaptation strategies adopted were reactive rather than anticipatory and varied in magnitude according to the different residential densities. Recommendations emanating from the study include integrating and implementing climate change adaptation policies and embarking on a rigorous awareness campaign to ease households' vulnerability and augment their climate change absorptive, adaptive, and transformative abilities in the city.

RAS are eco-friendly, water efficient, highly productive intensive farming system, which are not associated with adverse environmental impacts, such as habitat destruction, water pollution and eutrophication, biotic depletion, ecological effects on biodiversity due to captive fish and exotic species escape, disease outbreaks, and parasite transmission. Moreover, RAS operate in indoor controlled environment, and thus, only minimally affected by climatic factors, including rainfall variation, flood, drought, global warming, cyclone, salinity fluctuation, ocean acidification, and sea level rise. However, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the two most stringent limiting factors for RAS. Despite these potentials and promises, RAS have not yet been widely practiced, particularly in developing countries, due to complex and costly system designs. Further research with technological innovations are needed to establish low-cost, energy efficient RAS for intensifying seafood production, reducing GHG emissions, and adaptation to climate change.

However, the rate of coastal erosion, and the frequency and intensity of coastal flooding events, are now on the rise around the world due to the changing climate. Current responses to coastal erosion are primarily determined by site-specific factors, such as coastal elevation, coastal slope, coastal features, and historical coastline change rate, without a systematic understanding of the coastal-change processes in the context of climate change, including spatiotemporal changes in sea level, regional changes in wave climate, and sea ice coverage. In the absence of a clear understanding of the coastal-change processes, most of the current coastal responses have been built upon a risky assumption (i.e., the present-day coastal change will persist) and are not resilient to future climate change. Here, we conduct a literature review to summarize the latest scientific understanding of the coastal-change processes under climate change and the potential research gaps towards the prediction of future coastal erosion. Our review suggests that a coupled coastal simulation system with a nearshore wave model (e.g., SWAN, MIKE21, etc.) can play a critical role in both the short-term and long-term coastal risk assessment and protective measure development.

In order to limit future coastal flood risk, adaptation is necessary. This study presents an integrated model to simulate storm surge inundation risk in Osaka Bay under climate change and provide a cost-benefit analysis of structure adaptation strategies to reduce risk. The results show that storm surge inundation risk will increase dramatically as combined impacts of sea level rise and intensified storm surges due to global warming. Without adaptation measures, the expected annual damage cost increases from 9.85 billion JPY to 69.17 billion JPY in Osaka Bay under the projected RCP8.5 scenario to 2100. We then explore the effectiveness of structural adaptation strategies. The results indicate that raising the height of existing dikes can reduce inundation risk effectively. The benefits and costs depend on the elevated height and the discount rate. Using cost-benefit analysis, we find that upgrading by 1 m the height of existing dikes is the most cost-effective strategy for Osaka Bay. The methodology developed in this paper provides a reference for Osaka Bay and other coastal regions when they make coastal flood risk management and adaptation strategies to respond to climate change.

We quantify global and regional risk-related metrics associated with these levels of warming that capture climate change-related changes in exposure to water scarcity and heat stress, vector-borne disease, coastal and fluvial flooding and projected impacts on agriculture and the economy, allowing for uncertainties in regional climate projection. Risk-related metrics associated with 2 degrees C warming, depending on sector, are reduced by 10-44% globally if warming is further reduced to 1.5 degrees C. Comparing with a baseline in which warming of 3.66 degrees C occurs by 2100, constraining warming to 1.5 degrees C reduces these risk indicators globally by 32-85%, and constraining warming to 2 degrees C reduces them by 26-74%. In percentage terms, avoided risk is highest for fluvial flooding, drought, and heat stress, but in absolute terms risk reduction is greatest for drought. Although water stress decreases in some regions, it is often accompanied by additional exposure to flooding. The magnitude of the percentage of damage avoided is similar to that calculated for avoided global economic risk associated with these same climate change scenarios. We also identify West Africa, India and North America as hotspots of climate change risk in the future.

During the distant future (2071-2099), the flow increased by 15.11% and 24.40% for RCP scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 W/m(2), respectively. The flow is highly dependent on precipitation and evapotranspiration. Both precipitation and evapotranspiration increased, but the relative change of precipitation was greater than the relative change of evapotranspiration. For this reason, the flow would show a significant increase. Additionally, for RCP 8.5 W/m(2), the variability of the flow according to the GCM also increased because the variability of precipitation increased. Moreover, for RCP 8.5 W/m(2), the summer and autumn flow increased significantly, and the winter flow decreased in both scenarios. The variability in autumn and winter was so great that the occurrence of extreme flow could intensify further. These projections indicated the possibility of future flooding and drought in summer and winter. Regionally, the flow was expected to show a significant increase in the southeastern region. The findings presented for South Korea could be used as primary data in establishing national climate change adaptation measures.

This is producing changes in the earth's climate and weather which have implications for gastrointestinal health and disease. Climate change will exacerbate current challenges with regard to provision of adequate nutrition and access to clean water. An increase in high rainfall events, flooding and droughts will be associated with an increase in enteric infections and hepatitis. Changes in habitat may result in altered distribution of gastrointestinal illness such as Vibrio cholera. Climate change will force migration between countries, and within countries, and will drive relocation from rural to urban areas, further straining sanitation and clean water provision. The infrastructure required to the delivery of gastrointestinal care is vulnerable to extreme weather events which will become more frequent. The Gastroenterology community needs to join the debate on climate change by organizing, educating, advocating, and supporting our political leaders as they face the enormous challenges posed by global warming.

In the present study, data obtained by monitoring the French-German river are collated to visualize long-term trends in the pollution, river discharges and temperatures of Moselle waters. While air temperatures and accumulated heat sums in the catchment area showed an upward trend, precipitation and discharge levels as well as river temperatures were less affected by the ongoing climatic change. At the same time, the electric conductivity, i.e., the total suspended solids, did not show the anticipated reductions, while oxygen levels and pH values have showed upward trends since the 1990s. Despite the improvements in classical water quality parameters, the flooding of abandoned mines, increased water abstraction for cooling and agriculture and untreated old and emerging pollutants may aggravate environmental problems in the future. Climatic change will probably modify the runoff of pollutant loads by increasing the severity of flash floods and by concentrating water pollutants in drought spells.

J	Fan, XY; Goeppert, N; Goldscheider, N				Fan, Xinyang; Goeppert, Nadine; Goldscheider, Nico			Quantifying the historic and future response of karst spring discharge to climate variability and change at a snow-influenced temperate catchment in central Europe	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Karst; Spring discharge; Climate change; Conceptual modelling; Germany	SPECTRAL-ANALYSES; RECHARGE; WATER; AQUIFERS; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; IMPACTS; SYSTEM; ALPINE	Climate change is projected to threaten groundwater resources in many regions, but projections are highly uncertain. Quantifying the historic impact potentially allows for understanding of hydrologic changes and increases confidence in the predictions. In this study, the responses of karst discharge to historic and future climatic changes are quantified at Blautopf Spring in southern Germany, which is one of the largest karst springs in central Europe and belongs to a regional aquifer system relevant to the freshwater supply of millions of people. Statistical approaches are first adopted to quantify the hydrodynamic characteristics of the karst system and to analyse the historic time series (1952-2021) of climate variables and discharge. A reservoir model is then calibrated and evaluated with the observed discharge and used to simulate changes with three future climate-change scenarios. Results show that changes in the annual mean and annual low discharge were not significant, but the annual peak discharge shifted to a low state (<13.6 m3 s-1) from 1988 onwards due to decreasing precipitation, increasing air temperature, and less intense peak snowmelt. The peak discharge may decrease by 50% in this century according to the projections of all climate-change scenarios. Despite there being no significant historic changes, the base flow is projected to decrease by 35-55% by 2100 due to increasing evapotranspiration. These findings show the prolonged impact of climate change and variability on the floods and droughts at the springs in central Europe, and may imply water scarcity risks at similar climatic and geologic settings worldwide.

Climate change vulnerability of Asia's most iconic megaherbivore: greater one-horned rhinoceros <i>(Rhinoceros</i> <i>unicornis</i>)	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Climate change vulnerability assessment; Trait-based approach; Vulnerability score; Vulnerability index; Adaptive capacity; Climate refugia	CHITWAN NATIONAL-PARK; EXTINCTION RISK; CHANGE IMPACTS; HABITAT LOSS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; FUTURE; CONSEQUENCES	Climate change is an emerging threat for biodiversity conservation. It has already started impacting species assemblages and ecosystem dynamics. The greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) is an iconic and globally threatened megaherbivore. Once widespread across the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, there were fewer than 500 rhinoceros during the early 1960s, confined to isolated patches of suitable habitats in the southern part of Nepal and northern foothills of India, including Brahmaputra flood plains. Following both governments' successful conservation strategies, the species has been recovering, and its global population at present is over 3500. However, the likely impacts of climate change has not been adequately incorporated into conservation plans for the species and may challenge this success. In this study, we developed a set of 21 vulnerability indicators and assessed the vulnerability of rhinoceros to climate change in Nepal through a review of literature, site observations of prime rhinoceros habitat, key informant interviews, a two-day stakeholders' consultation workshop, and expert elucidation. Our findings suggest that rhinoceros in Nepal is likely to be 'moderately vulnerable' to the impacts of climate change, mainly due to (1) the likelihood of invasive plant species and severe floods in its prime habitat 'Chitwan National Park', and (2) fragmented habitat, small population size, droughts and forest fires in Bardia and Shuklaphanta National Parks. We further identified and recommended adaptation measures intended to enhance the resilience of rhinoceros to these likely threats. (C 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Limited access to safe water is projected to impact approximately 5 billion people worldwide by 2050. Climate change and worsening severe weather events pose increasing threats to global water safety. However, people may not perceive links between climate change and water safety, potentially undermining their willingness to implement behaviors that improve water safety. Existing studies on water safety risk perceptions have mostly been conducted in single-country contexts, which limits researchers' ability to make cross-national comparisons. Here, we assessed the extent to which people's severe weather concern and climate change concern predict their water safety concern. Our analyses used survey data from the 142-country 2019 Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, including 21 low-income and 34 lower-middle-income countries. In mixed-effects models, severe weather concern was significantly more predictive of water safety concern than was climate change concern, although both resulted in positive associations. Worldwide, this finding was robust, insensitive to key model specifications and countries' varying protection against unsafe drinking water. We suggest communicators and policymakers improve messaging about water safety and other environmental threats by explaining how they are impacted by worsening severe weather.

A detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis on the impact of climate change and human activities is therefore of great significance towards the sustainable water resources planning and management. In this study, the impact of climate change and human activities on the runoff was first quantitatively analyzed for the Yalong River Basin (YRB), China, by using a combination of the CREST hydrologic model and the Choudhury-Yang equation based elastic coefficient method, respectively. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis on the response of runoff to human activities was carried out in terms of land use changes, water withdrawal and reservoir operation. Results indicate that precipitation and runoff of the Yalong River Basin increased and decreased at the rate of 1.17 and 0.35 mm/a, respectively, for the period from 1980 to 2018. Climate change and human activities contributed 6.65-21.67% and 78.33-93.35% to the runoff variation, respectively. Among the human activities, we found that reservoir construction and operation is likely to be the major driver of the variation in the hydrologic regime of the YRB. Our methods and findings are expected to provide implications for water resources planning and management for the YRB and different basins across the globe.

Using observed runoff, there is a statistically significant decreasing trend for annual and monthly runoff detected by the Mann-Kendall's test, in the upper reaches of Luanhe River basin (URLRB), 1954-2000. With the break point analysis, the whole time series are divided into two sub periods: "natural period (1954-1970) and "impact period" (1971-2000). "Natural runoff" from 1954 to 2000, is reconstructed by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model, in which the model parameters are calibrated in "natural period" representing the natural watershed characteristics without the impact of local human activities. By comparing the difference between observed runoff and "natural runoff" in "impact period", the contributions of climate change and local human activities are quantitatively separated. The results indicate that climate change and local human activities account for 49% and 51%, respectively, on the annual runoff decrease in the URLRB. That means the effects of climate change on runoff are roughly the same as the effects of local human activities.

Using monthly labour force surveys from 78 cities in Latin America, we demonstrate that large sustained dry events decrease the probability of being employed, hourly wages, hours worked, and labour incomes. Informal workers are impacted the most. We highlight that the impact of droughts is larger than the impact of wet events, like those that cause floods. Health and power outages are two pathways explaining our results. Climate change will increase the occurrence of droughts, making our findings particularly relevant.

The flood vulnerability index (FVI) can quantitatively compare the flood vulnerabilities of the analysis targets and can be used for the relative comparison of hydraulic structures to determine the reinforcement priority. In this study, we proposed a simple FVI that contained exposure and adaptive capacity of the hydraulic structure. We selected ten dam heightening reservoirs in Korea and constructed data for flood vulnerability assessment. The FVI was calculated before and after the dam heightening to analyze the priority and effect of reservoir rehabilitation under climate change. Flood vulnerability indices were estimated for four periods (1995s: 1981-2010, 2025s: 2011-2040, 2055s: 2041-2070, 2085s: 2071-2100) and before/after the dam heightening project. As a result, flood vulnerability indices decreased after the dam heightening project for all reservoirs, and the indices have increasing tendencies in the future. The indices developed in this study can be useful to determine the priority and to evaluate the effect of rehabilitation for hydraulic structures.

Small and low-lying islands are particularly exposed to natural disasters, and many countries have limited access to water resources. Anthropogenic climate change is expected to further increase these environmental pressures. Any associated engineering response needs to consider the cultural, societal and historical context, and prioritise the agency of local communities to determine their preferred outcomes. It follows that Humanitarian Engineering, a discipline centred around strengths-based and context-appropriate solutions, has an important role to play in climate change adaptation. In this review, the interplay between hydroclimatology, geography and water security in the Pacific Islands is described and projected climate shifts summarised to highlight future adaptation challenges. A key source of uncertainty relates to the dynamics of two convergence zones that largely drive weather patterns. A broad overview of societal factors that present challenges and opportunities for Humanitarian Engineers is given. Finally, actions are recommended to inform climate change adaptation given the scientific uncertainty around hydrologic risks, and outline lessons for best practice Humanitarian Engineering in the Pacific. Enhancing data sharing, building resilience to climate variability and integrating traditional knowledge with convention engineering methods should be key areas of focus.

J	Sarchani, S; Tsanis, I				Sarchani, Sofia; Tsanis, Ioannis			Analysis of a Flash Flood in a Small Basin in Crete	WATER			English	Article						flash flood; calibration; validation; precipitation intensity; climate change; flood extent	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; IMPACTS; MODULE; ISLAND; MODEL	Climate change will have a greater impact on the severity of flash floods, since precipitation intensity is expected to increase, even in areas where a reduction of precipitation is possible. This change in climate is expected to increase flood wave speed and its flood wave area extent. A case study of a small basin in the island of Crete was conducted to examine this effect, following the calibration and validation of the flow hydrograph of a flash flood event, in order to achieve model verification with the post-flood data. It was found that the most important parameters that affect the timing and magnitude of the peak discharge are the storage coefficient, the impervious rate and the curve number, as well as the time of concentration. Rainfall distribution was examined in different time intervals in order to study the effect of the intensity of precipitation on the peak hydrograph. From the precipitation records and according to the size of the watershed, the time step of the precipitation in the simulation model is recommended to be less than an hour. In other areas around the basin of interest, severe storms known as Medicanes that pass over Crete can produce higher precipitation in shorter time intervals. The impact of climate change scenarios results in an increase on the peak discharge by creating precipitation of higher intensity. Furthermore, the intensification of precipitation due to climate change results in higher flood depths and flooded area extent, as well as wave velocities.

Issues of adaptation and actions in relation to climate change are being discussed in the architectural, urban planning, and governmental communities. Models are being developed for shaping the functional and spatial structure, buildings and infrastructure in the city in relation to the projected climate change. Multi-criteria and interdisciplinary research is being carried out and solutions are being implemented for retaining water, minimising the heat island effect, reducing emissions and environmental impact by analysing the carbon footprint and introducing circular economy principles. The research is focused on the analysis of design and implementation conditions for multi-family housing projects in Poland, and the development of design guidelines enabling adaptation and mitigation of the negative effects of climate change, including heat island effects, smog, overheating, drought, and flooding in housing. Conclusions from the overview of the indicated documents and legal provisions for the implementation of sustainable development principles and adaptation to climate change in the investments under preparation (urban and architectural projects) enable the forecasting of development directions and ideological assumptions for shaping urbanised areas, providing the basis for shaping the resilience of the functional and spatial structure and the natural system in urban areas subject to transformation. Issues of implementing pro-environmental technologies and developing new urban planning standards disseminate the solutions of compact cities in which the development of multifunctional building complexes with public spaces equipped with greenery linked to the buildings are realised.

J	Lahsen, M; Ribot, J				Lahsen, Myanna; Ribot, Jesse			Politics of attributing extreme events and disasters to climate change	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						blaming politics; causal attribution; climate change; disaster; experience; extreme events; media; vulnerability	VULNERABILITY	Climate change certainly shapes weather events. However, describing climate and weather as the cause of disasters can be misleading, since disasters are caused by pre-existing fragilities and inequalities on the ground. Analytic frames that attribute disaster to climate can divert attention from these place-based vulnerabilities and their socio-political causes. Thus, while politicians may want to blame crises on climate change, members of the public may prefer to hold government accountable for inadequate investments in flood or drought prevention and precarious living conditions. To be both strategic and moral, framing choices must therefore be sensitive to context-dependent political meanings and particularities, and to how the values implicit within analytic frames about the causes of disasters shape policy responses. Such sensitivity requires multicausal analysis of weather-linked disasters to illuminate a broader range of means to reduce the damages associated with climate change and weather extremes. Through examples from around the world, and especially Brazil, we discuss how and why climate-centric disaster framing can erase from view-and, thus, from policy agendas-the very socio-economic and political factors that most centrally cause vulnerability and suffering in weather extremes and disasters. We also offer a theoretical discussion of why attribution is not neutral. Analytic frameworks always embed choices about factors that matter, and thus are inherently normative and consequential for understandings of responsibility and action. This article is categorized under: Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Decision Making Highlight Attributing crises only to climate is inadequate from a mechanical, moral, and strategic policy points of view.

This study introduces a new definition of urban drainage system (UDS) sustainability, focusing on BMP usage to enhance system performance after adaptation to climate change. Three types of hydraulic reliability index (HRI) plus robustness and improvability indices were used to quantify the potential enhanced sustainability of the system in a changing climate, together with a climate change adaptability index (CCAI). The sustainability of UDS for the safe conveyance of storm-water runoff was investigated under different land-use scenarios: No BMP, BMP in urban areas, and BMP inside and upstream of urban areas, considering climate change impacts. Rainfall-runoff simulation alongside drainage network modelling was conducted using a storm-water management model (US EPA SWMM) to determine the inundation areas for both base-line and future climatic conditions. A new method for disaggregating daily rainfall to hourly, proposed to provide a finer resolution of input rainfall to SWMM, was applied to a semi-urbanized catchment whose upstream runoff from mountainous areas may contribute to the storm-water runoff in downstream urban parts. Our findings confirm an increase in the number of inundation points and reduction in sustainability indices of UDS due to climate change. The results present an increase in UDS reliability from 4% to 16% and improvements in other sustainability indicators using BMPs in upstream suburban areas compared to implementing them in urban areas.

To address these challenges and promote sustainable development, it is essential to adopt an integrated approach that considers the complex interactions and trade-offs within the WEFE nexus. This research article focuses on the integration of climate change adaptation into the Water-Energy-Food-Environment (WEFE) nexus for sustainable development in EAC. In this study, the Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method was used for five proposed subsystems to assess both long and short-term influence of WEFE on economic development in EAC across the 1970 to 2021 period. The long-run results disclose that with an increase of 1% in agricultural production, renewable energy consumption, total emissions and total water withdraw increase economic development by 0.39%, 0.9%, 0.33%, 0.9%, respectively. The equilibrium of short-to long-run adjusted at the yearly rate of 0.18%. However, the challenges have seen in the light of climate change impacts including landslides, soil erosion, floods, and rise of the sea level which leads to environmental degradation and affect WEFE nexus and sustainable development. Therefore, the study argues that a fundamental strategy for overcoming these difficulties is to incorporate climate adaptation into the WEFE nexus. As such, it identifies the key drivers and pressures of climate change on the nexus, and proposes a framework for integrating climate change adaptation into WEFE nexus planning and management.

In this study, we used the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method to assess the physical and social vulnerability of the entire coastal areas of Bangladesh, using 10 critical factors to evaluate the coastal vulnerability model (CVM). Our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the coastal regions of Bangladesh is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We found that one-third of the study area, encompassing around 13,000 km(2), was classified as having high or very high coastal vulnerability. Districts in the central delta region, such as Barguna, Bhola, Noakhali, Patuakhali, and Pirojpur, were found to have high to very high physical vulnerability. Meanwhile, the southern parts of the study area were identified as highly socially vulnerable. Our findings also showed that the coastal areas of Patuakhali, Bhola, Barguna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat were particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The coastal vulnerability map we developed using the FAHP method showed satisfactory modeling, with an AUC of 0.875. By addressing the physical and social vulnerability factors identified in our study, policymakers can take proactive steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of coastal residents in the face of climate change.

This problem is aggravated by the effects of climate change, with the increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena in this region. In light of this situation, the local governments, in collaboration with the concessionaire companies providing supply and sewage services, are committed to adopting measures aimed at a more efficient management of non-conventional water resources. Examples of good practice for reducing urban flood risk and adapting to climate change are those actions developed in the tourist municipalities of Alicante, Torrevieja, and Benidorm, where measures have been implemented or have been planned and integrated with green spaces, with a commitment to sustainability, such as sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) or Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs). This study analyses these case studies, based on a detailed review of the technical projects that contemplate each of the actions. Furthermore, several field trips were made with technical personnel who are familiar with the measures adopted. The results show that the implementation of these systems contributes to advancing the reduction of urban flood risk and the adaptation to climate change, creating more resilient and safer urban spaces for the citizens residing in them.

To respond to emerging challenges due to climate change, land-use changes, and sociodemographic and migration issues, an integrated management of natural hazards is needed, including appropriate approaches to risk communication. This study-which included a quantitative street survey, semistructured interviews (Leitfadeninterview), and focus group discussions carried out in 9 Austrian municipalities prone to flooding-found that residents with foreign-born parents and foreign-born residents were underrepresented in local governments and in voluntary organizations related to disaster risk management and therefore often do not participate in decision-making. Nonetheless, ethnicity was often not the prevailing factor that determined vulnerability and modes of coping. Instead, social networks and ownership structures had an important influence on people's ability to recover from past events and prepare for future events. Study participants who had not recently been affected by natural hazards, including floods, generally perceived them as having a low probability of recurrence and ranked them lower than other (daily) risks and struggles. This article aims to contribute to a better understanding of efficient communication as well as targetgroup-oriented communication channels and contents that foster risk awareness and private adaptation capacity among migrants in rural Austria.

The reduction of several chronic diseases and associated symptoms, including anxiety, obesity and cardiovascular disease, has been associated with the presence of and access to green space. Green spaces also contribute to a number of environmental health benefits and have been shown to reduce the likelihood of flooding, improve air quality and provide cooling and shade. These co-benefits address both the symptoms of several chronic diseases and associated risk factors along with the environmental and health impacts of climate change. This article explores how to maximize the co-benefits of green spaces through two examples of multi-sectoral collaborations. With these two examples, we have provided a model of collective collaboration that aims to address complex issues, such as climate change and chronic diseases, through the common intervention of green spaces.

To aid decision-making under climate change, we developed a bottom-up approach for assessing the performance of flood management systems under climate uncertainty and nonstationarity. The developed bottom-up approach was applied to the American River, CA, USA flood management system by first identifying the sensitivity and vulnerability of the system to different climates. To do this, we developed a climate response surface by calculating and plotting Expected Annual Damages (EAD, $/year) under different flood regimes. Next, we determined a range of plausible future climate change and flood frequency scenarios by applying Bayesian statistical methods to projected future flows derived from a Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model forced with Global Circulation Model (GCM) output. We measured system robustness as the portion of plausible future scenarios under which the current flood system could meet its performance goal. Using this approach, we then evaluated the robustness of four proposed management strategies in the 2012 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan in terms of both flood risk and cost-effectiveness, to assess the performance of the strategies in the face of climate risks. Results indicated that the high sensitivity of the expected damages to changes in flood regimes makes the system extremely vulnerable to a large portion of the plausible range of future flood conditions. The management strategy that includes a combination of nature-based flood management actions along with engineered structures yields the greatest potential to increase system robustness in terms of maintaining EAD below an acceptable risk threshold. However, this strategy still leaves the system vulnerable to a wide range of plausible future conditions. As flood frequency regimes increase in intensity from the current conditions, the cost-effectiveness of the management strategies increases, to a point, before decreasing. This bottom up analysis demonstrated a viable decision-making approach for water managers in the face of uncertain and changing future conditions. Neglecting to use such an approach and omitting climate considerations from water resource planning could lead to strategies that do not perform as expected or which actually lead to mal-adaptations, increasing vulnerability to climate change.

This study aimed to elucidate the downstream channel evolution of the Yuan River in Hunan Province, China, during the Qing Dynasty via Landsat 8 satellite image data and relevant literature. The objective was to establish the modes of channel evolution and discuss the significance of historical climate change. The downstream paleochannel of the Yuan River was identified in the Late Ming Dynasty and Early Qing Dynasty (1600-1644 AD), the Kangxi-Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty (1661-1796 AD), the Late Qing Dynasty (1840-1912 AD), and the World War II (1939-1945 AD), and three main modes of river evolution were determined. Using remote sensing data and the ancient literature, the evolution characteristics of the paleochannel in the Lower Yuan River were analyzed and its distribution across historical periods was comprehensively revealed. The findings reveal a strong correlation between channel evolution, flood events, and climate change. Numerous flood events that occurred from the Late Qing Dynasty to the World War II caused a high rate of channel evolution, demonstrating the combined effects of climate change and human activities. These findings will help adopt robust and resilient hydrological management methods in the future of a changing climate.

Rapidly growing urban areas are liable to greater risk of climate change. Fine-scale rainfall forms the most important input to achieve greater accuracy in urban flood model simulation results. The major concern with modeling urban floods, particularly in developing countries like India is the unavailability of fine-scale rainfall data. This explains the need for developing a methodology to disaggregate large scale precipitation data into a fine-scale interval of time. A statistical rainfall disaggregation method is employed to scale down IDF parameters under climate change conditions. Synthetic rainfall hyetographs are developed from scaled IDF values and used as input to simulate the 1D?2D urban flood model. In this study, we used the combination of flow velocity (V), inundation depth (D), and the product (D ? V) framed to quantify the flood-hazard for part of Hyderabad, India. The flood vulnerability produced by the hydraulic model is analysed and matched with the 2016 flooding event. The methodology implemented here produced acceptable results and hence evidences to be a reliable approach in an urban setting.

Climate change effects on the thermal stratification of Lake Diefenbaker, a large multi-purpose reservoir	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL			English	Article						Climate change; thermal stratification; Lake Diefenbaker; large multi-purpose reservoir	TEMPERATURE	Large multi-purpose reservoirs serve not only to generate hydropower but to supply water for agricultural irrigation, animal and human consumption and to provide flood control. One of the key factors affecting physical functioning and deteriorating aquatic ecosystems in reservoirs is climate change. For instance, increases in water temperature accelerate chemical reaction rates, decomposition rates and oxygen demand at the water-sediment interface. Earlier thermal stratification onset, and longer and more intense reservoir thermal stratification are all consequences of global warming. Such disruptions in thermal stratification have been associated with reductions in hypolimnion dissolved oxygen, increasing anoxia events and enhancing reservoir eutrophication. In this research paper, we implement the 2 D hydrodynamics and water quality model, CE-QUAL-W2, to investigate the effects of climate change and streamflow scenarios on the thermal structure of Lake Diefenbaker, a large, multipurpose reservoir, located in Saskatchewan, Canada. Model results indicate that meteorological variability will dictate a nonlinear increase in reservoir water temperature in the coming decades, where larger increases in water temperature will occur during summer and fall in the upper layers. Also, decreases in reservoir streamflows will reduce water temperature at intermediate layers during summer and fall. Our model can be used as a tool to mitigate and manage the effects of climate change on the reservoir water quality.	[Morales-Marin, L. A.; Carr, M.; Sadeghian, A.; Lindenschmidt, K.

Using an analysis of UK decision-makers managing and responding to heatwaves and flood risks, this paper argues how more robust local evidence is needed to inform decision-making regarding adaptation options for enhancing local resilience. We identify evidence gaps and issues relating to local climate change impacts, including sources and quality of evidence used, adequacy and accessibility of evidence available, ill-communicated evidence and conflicting or misused evidence. A lack of appreciation regarding how scientific evidence and personal judgement can mutually enhance the quality of decision-making underpins all of these gaps. Additionally, we find that the majority of evidence currently used is reductively based upon socio-economic and physical characteristics of climate risks. We argue that a step change is needed in local climate resilience that moves beyond current physical and socio-economic risk characterisation to a more inclusive co-constitution of social and politically defined climate risks at the local scale that are better aligned with the local impacts felt and needs of stakeholders.

Water, anxiety, and the human niche: a study in Southern Province, Zambia	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Water; anxiety; climate change; niche construction; household surveys; Zambia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSECURITY; EVOLUTION; MIGRATION; CONFLICT; ANTHROPOCENE; DIMENSIONS; DISTRESS; RAINFALL; FOOD	Water (in)security is increasingly recognized as a global threat driven by population increase, water (mis)management, and global climate change. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan Africa where the impacts of climate change are expected to negatively affect water access and availability. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods and their potential impact on agriculture and water resources are especially worrisome. It is critical to understand how water disturbances are driving local level ecological changes - and the processes of adaptation undertaken by individuals and communities responding to these changes - to develop sustainable pathways through the global climate change landscape. Here I place local level nuances and processes at centre, using a niche construction heuristic framework and household level surveys (N = 224) to investigate locally relevant responses to water scarcity, with specific attention paid to social, psychosocial, and physical health impacts arising from anxiety about water. The findings here indicate that the anthroecological system in Choma - specifically the human-water subsystem - is internalizing negative impacts driven by water variations. Experienced anxieties from water issues have been shown to be strongly linked to household water needs not being met, time investments required for fetching water, suspected waterborne sickness, and household size.

Due to the fast emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the Earth's climate system is being negatively impacted by global warming. Stresses caused by climate change, such as rising and hotter seas, increased droughts and floods, and acrid waters, threaten the world's most populated areas and aquatic ecosystems. As a result, the aquatic ecosystems of the globe are quickly reaching hazardous conditions. Marine ecosystems are essential parts of the world's environment and provide several benefits to the human population, such as water for drinking and irrigation, leisure activities, and habitat for commercially significant fisheries. Although local human activities have influenced coastal zones for millennia, it is still unclear how these impacts and stresses from climate change may combine to endanger coastal ecosystems. Recent studies have shown that rising levels of greenhouse gases are causing ocean systems to experience conditions not seen in several million years, which may cause profound and irreversible ecological shifts. Ocean productivity has declined, food web dynamics have changed, habitat-forming species are less common, species ranges have changed, and disease prevalence has increased due to human climate change. We provide an outline of the interaction between global warming and the influence of humans along the coastline. This review aims to demonstrate the significance of long-term monitoring, the creation of ecological indicators, and the applications of understanding how aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning respond to global warming. This review discusses the effects of current climate change on marine biological processes both now and in the future, describes present climate change concerning historical change, and considers the potential roles aquatic systems could play in mitigating the effects of global climate change.

Examining the impact of emissions scenario on lower Mississippi River flood hazard projections	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						climate change impacts; flooding; Mississippi river	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROUGHTS; RISK; 21ST-CENTURY; DISCHARGE	The Mississippi River is the largest commercial waterway in North America and one of the most heavily engineered rivers in the world. Future alteration of the river's hydrology by climate change may increase the vulnerability of flood mitigation and navigation infrastructure implemented to constrain 20(th) century discharge conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in Lower Mississippi River basin hydroclimate and discharge from 1920-2100 C.E. by integrating river gauge observations and climate model ensemble simulations from CESM1.2 under multiple greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. We show that the Lower Mississippi River's flood regime is highly sensitive to emissions scenario; specifically, the return period of flood discharge exceeding existing flood mitigation infrastructure decreases from approximately 1000 years to 31 years by the year 2100 under RCP8.5 forcing, primarily driven by increasing precipitation and runoff within the basin. Without aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, flood mitigation infrastructure may require substantial retrofitting to avoid disruptions to industries and communities along the Lower Mississippi River.

This study investigates the implications of climate change using Gumbel-Hougaard copula function for future bivariate of flood peak and volume variables, in Azarshahr chay watershed. Canadian Earth system model (CanESM2) under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) along with statistical downscaling method (SDSM) and soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) were adopted to assess both baseline (1976-2005) and future (2030-2059) periods. Bivariate analysis of Copula improved the accuracy of model with an average NSE of 0.97 for all scenarios. Joint return period for severe floods has declined in the future, especially in RCP8.5. For a constant discharge and volume, joint return periods at the base period, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were 24, 10, 13 and 9 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis may also provide useful information for flood risk assessment.

ASSESSMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON THE VITICULTURE USING ADCON TELEMETRY STATION	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						vineyard; ADCON; climate change; agriculture; open source		Climate change represents a significant threat to agriculture, food security, and livelihood of millions of people in Europe and across the world. European farming is strongly affected by the high impact of climate change due to increased temperatures, rainfall regimes, and variations in frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events such as floods and droughts. Climate changes have effects on the viticulture, on grapes and in wine quality, which may cause geographical shifts in suitable grapevine varieties and production areas. According to the estimation made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the temperatures will increase by 2.0 and 2.5 degrees C until the end of the century. The aim of this paper consists in analysing the effects of diseases on the grapes on a 5 years period in an area cultivated with vines from the southern part of Romania. The ADCON station collects via sensors, mounted in the Histria winery, the air temperature and humidity, the amount of precipitation and leaf wetness. The connection between the station and the central server is ensured by the GPRS data service provided by one of the GSM mobile operators that have coverage in the area, and users' access to the processed information is possible anywhere and anytime using a tablet or smartphone.

Climate variables were predicted for the years 2021-2050 based on three representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) scenarios of the general circulation model from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5) using the statistical downscaling model. Streamflow at the USGS 07226500 streamgage was simulated by a rainfall-runoff model with predicted data. Instantaneous peak flow was estimated using an empirical method. Flood frequency analysis was used for the estimation of the design flood. The shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) is used to optimize a labyrinth spillway design and its results were compared with two other nature-inspired algorithms: invasive weed optimization (IWO) and cuckoo search (CS). The spillway was optimized once with the actual design flood (16,143 m(3)/s) and again with the design flood under climate change (12,250 m(3)/s). Results revealed that optimization with realistic design flood reduced the concrete volume of the spillway by 37% and under climate change by 43% using the SFLA.

J	Lee, JS; Choi, HI				Lee, Jong Seok; Choi, Hyun Il			Comparative Analysis of Flood Vulnerability Indicators by Aggregation Frameworks for the IPCC's Assessment Components to Climate Change	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						flood vulnerability assessment; IPCC's assessment component; composite indicator; aggregation framework; climate change	ECOLOGICAL VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; RISK; SYSTEMS; INDEX	As severe flood damages have been increasing due to climate change, the flood vulnerability assessment is needed in the flood mitigation plans to cope with climate-related flood disasters. Since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report (IPCC TAR) presented the three assessment components, such as exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability for the vulnerability to climate change, several aggregation frameworks have been used to compile individual components into the composite indicators to measure the flood vulnerability. It is therefore necessary to select an appropriate aggregation framework for the flood vulnerability assessments because the aggregation frameworks can have a large influence on the composite indicator outcomes. For a comparative analysis of flood vulnerability indicators across different aggregation frameworks for the IPCC's assessment components, the composite indicators are derived by four representative types of aggregation frameworks with all the same proxy variable set in the Republic of Korea. It is found in the study site that there is a key driver component of the composite indicator outcomes and the flood vulnerability outcomes largely depend on whether the key component is treated independently or dependently in each aggregation framework. It is concluded that the selection of an aggregation framework can be based on the correlation and causality analysis to determine the relative contribution of the assessment components to the overall performance of the composite indicators across different aggregation frameworks.

We present two concrete but contrasting case studies that focus on coastal realignment and wetland restoration as well as seaside tourism and resort development on the German Baltic Sea coast. The ecosystem service assessments compare past, present and potential future local development scenarios. Complementary, we apply the InVest and the Matrix ecosystem service assessment approaches. Despite some shortcomings, the proactive German hierarchical planning system seems suitable to deal with climate change and provide a framework for adaptation measures in coastal zones. It largely prevents a shift of climate change risks between municipalities and stakeholders. Comparative ecosystem service assessments seem well suited to play a role in the planning process by raising awareness about problems, possible solutions and consequences. On a local level, they can provide comprehensive insight into consequences of alternative measures. Our examples show that, in principle, potential future situations can be addressed with comparative ecosystem service approaches. We discuss whether the results of hypothetical future scenarios, with inherent uncertainties, might be misleading and counterproductive.

Review: How will climate change impact the 'many little hammers' of ecological weed management?	WEED RESEARCH			English	Review						adaptation; agroecology; global warming; IWM; non-chemical control; organic farming	CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SMALLHOLDER FARMS; PEST-MANAGEMENT; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CONCRETE FROST; FLOOD RISK; CROP; SOIL	Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations [CO2] and climate change are impacting farming worldwide. Ecological weed management (EWM) principles, including use of diverse tactics already employed by many farmers, may assist in adapting to and mitigating climate change. We systematically reviewed the literature on EWM and climate change and here summarise practical considerations related to changing efficacy and utility of non-chemical EWM practices. Localised changes in precipitation will affect tillage and cultivation. We expect that mulching, transplanting and some weed seedbank management strategies, which add resiliency to a weed management programme, may show increased utility in a future with more extreme and variable weather. Innovations in autonomous robotic weeding technologies and cultivation tool design show promise in helping to overcome challenges related to low and variable cultivation efficacy and traditionally slow working rates. EWM practices that help farmers achieve multiple objectives and provide benefits beyond climate change adaptation, such as financial gains, may be most advantageous, the development of which could be facilitated by interdisciplinary research and outreach efforts. Overall, we conclude that in an increasingly variable climate, farmers will have to employ a greater diversity of weed management tactics in order to spread risk and enable climate resilience through farming systems diversification.

The potential for climate change impacts in South Dunedin to exacerbate existing inequalities is high. Floods in 2015 became a catalyst for a different way of 'doing' climate change adaptation suggesting more care-full and just intentions and practices. Drawing from both local authority and community actions, we document how care has become the basis for a meaningful way to bring justice to the forefront of the early stages of adaptation planning. We document how Tronto's (2013) caring with is demonstrated in a significant shift in the relationship between and within affected communities and the Council since the floods. The nature of this partnership work is evident through community initiatives and the Council's approach to community engagement, both of which are providing spaces in which adaptation discussions are becoming easier, the emotional dimensions of climate change impacts can be expressed, and where embodied care work is justice work. We argue that just adaptation invokes care, and that care and justice are co-constituted when the moral dimensions of caring with are institutionalised in both community and local authority adaptive practices.

This study intends to investigate the impact of climate change on internally displaced char people's lives and livelihoods along with local adaptation strategies and hindrances to the coping mechanism. Data have been collected from 280 internally displaced households in two sub-districts. A mixed-method approach has been considered combined with qualitative and quantitative methods. The results disclose that frequent flooding, riverbank erosion, and crop loss are the leading causes for relocation, and social relations are impeded in the new place of residence. Increasing summer and winter temperatures, recurrent flooding, severity of riverbank erosion, and expanding disease outbreaks are also important indicators of climate change identified by displaced people, which are consistent with observed data. This study also reveals that almost all households come across severe livelihood issues like food shortage, unemployment and income loss, and housing and sanitation problems due to the changing climate associated with disasters in the former and present places. In response to this, the displaced people acclimatize applying numerous adaptation strategies in order to boost the livelihood resilience against climate change. However, fragile housing, financial conditions, and lack of own land are still the highest impediments to the sustainability of adaptation. Therefore, along with the government, several organizations should implement a dynamic resettlement project through appropriate scrutiny to eradicate the livelihood complications of internally displaced people.

We tested this assertion by comparing impacts at the regional scale between low-end (<2 degrees C; RCP2.6) and high-end (>4 degrees C; RCP8.5) climate change scenarios accounting for interactions across six sectors (agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, water, coasts and urban) using an integrated assessment model. Results show that there are only minor differences in most impact indicators for the 2020s time slice, but impacts are considerably greater under high-end than low-end climate change in the 2050s and 2080s. For example, for the 2080s, mitigation consistent with the Paris Agreement would reduce aggregate Europe-wide impacts on the area of intensive agriculture by 21% (on average across climate models), on the area of managed forests by 34%, on water stress by 14%, on people flooded by 10% and on biodiversity vulnerability by 16%. Including socio-economic scenarios (SSPs 1, 3, 4, 5) results in considerably greater variation in the magnitude, range and direction of change of the majority of impact indicators than climate change alone. In particular, socio-economic factors much more strongly drive changes in land use and food production than changes in climate, sometimes overriding the differences due to low-end and high-end climate change. Such impacts pose significant challenges for adaptation and highlight the importance of searching for synergies between adaptation and mitigation and linking them to sustainable development goals.

The methodology used allows for a complete assessment of the effect of climate change on maximum precipitation by accounting for uncertainty, and may be applied to other case studies. Behaviour regarding observations, trends and changes in climate model maximum precipitation series are evaluated. In turn, multi-model mean (and percentile) relative changes accounting for statistical significance, torrential rate changes, and relative changes in daily annual maximum precipitation accumulated along river network are estimated. Results show a large variability in climate model outcomes. In general, a suitable behaviour is found for the climate model ensemble regarding observations: it properly represents seasonality of daily annual maximum precipitation for all regions, and observation-based statistics are found to be within range of simulation-based statistics for most regions. As an exception, daily annual maximum precipitation is underestimated in Mediterranean regions, which may be attributed to known limitations of current climate models in adequately reproducing convective precipitation typical of those areas. Results also show an intensifying increase in trends and changes as precipitation duration decreases, a torrentiality rise, and relative changes related to accumulated maximum precipitation of up to 35%. These findings support the notion that the effect of climate change may be stronger for extreme precipitation associated with short precipitation durations. This may be attributed to a stronger scaling between change in extreme precipitation and mean surface temperature increase for shorter durations. The findings also highlight the importance of analysing statistical significance of relative changes in quantile for allowing its attribution to climate change. Statistical model choice is found to be essential for identifying significant changes.

The goal was to predict which of the species co-dominating the same habitat is more vulnerable under prospective climate change. Along a transect from the treeline to the floodplain, photosynthetic pigment content and electron-transport rate (ETR) were measured in needles of neighboring trees of the species. From 570 to 1240 m a.s.l., P. sibirica does not suffer from stress factors during the growing season, while A. sibirica does. The latter is reflected in a decrease of pigment content and ETR with the increase of altitude. A stronger climate-change trend (probably to more dry and warm conditions) will likely favor the shift of P. sibirica upper in altitudes, and only under the pine shelter might the fir survive the changes.

Based on a digital terrain model and on a mapping of the flow obstacles relevant for precipitation runoff, hydrodynamic modelling with different precipitation intensities was carried out for an investigation area in the Ruhr area. The simulation tools FloodArea and Hec-Ras were used for geodata processing and to produce hazard maps. The results of the modelling with both programs show similarities in the distribution of the areas with highest flood levels. However, differences can be observed in absolute heights. The approach shown can be used to simulate the effects of future heavy rainfall events and provides urban planning decision support (location of retention areas) for adaptation measures related to climate change.

Nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis (NS-RFFA) provides an effective way to consider these influences. But there is currently no standard framework of NS-RFFA and insufficient consideration of uncertainty in quantile estimates. In the study, we proposed an improved framework of NS-RFFA considering the influence of multi-reservoirs as well as climate change and involving uncertainty estimation. The framework was applied to analyze the frequency of extreme floods in the Huai River Basin (HRB) where multi-reservoirs have been constructed and to reveal the extreme flood variation under the impact of climate change and reservoir group. Results show that precipitation during flood season and reservoir index played a dominant role in the variations of annual maximum streamflow in the HRB. The impact of reservoirs was more significant in the upstream tributaries than in the mainstream. The nonstationary models with location parameters varying with time and/or main influencing factors perform better on fitting extreme streamflow in the HRB compared with stationary and at-site analysis. The quantile estimates and their uncertainty based on NS-RFFA are dynamic, which gives an expression of the changing environment effects on annual maximum streamflow. Thus, our work contributes an improved framework of NS-RFFA considering the influence of climate change and reservoirs, providing more accurate and reliable estimates for river flood risk management.

WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Urban flood resilience; Integrated green-grey-blue system; Integrated framework; Coupling model; Climate change; Future uncertainty	PERFORMANCE	Urban flooding is becoming a great global concern due to growing cities, while climate change and urbanization may pose daunting challenges to both environment and humans. The integrated green-grey-blue (IGGB) system has gained interests worldwide to mitigate flood issues, however, how IGGB system acts in urban flood resilience and whether it can address future uncertainties have not been fully understood. In this study, a new framework, which combined an evaluation index system and coupling model, was constructed to quantify urban flood resilience (FR) and its responses to future uncertainties. The results showed that higher FR upstream than downstream; however, upstream FR declined approximately twice as much as downstream when faced with climate change and urbanization. Generally, climate change appeared to have a greater impact on urban flood resilience than urbanization, resulting to 3.20%-4.28% and 2.08%-4.09% FR reduction, respectively. The IGGB system could greatly improve robustness against future uncertainty, due to the fact that the IGGB without low impact development facilities (LIDs) was about 2 times in FR decline compared with IGGB with LIDs. The increase of LIDs proportion could diminish the impact of climate change, which shifted the dominant factor affecting FR from the interaction between urbanization and climate change to urbanization. Notably, a threshold of 13% construction land increase was quantified, beyond which negative effects of rainfall become dominant again. The results could guide IGGB design and urban flooding management in other similar regions.

A Hybrid Model-Based Adaptive Framework for the Analysis of Climate Change Impact on Reservoir Performance	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; GCMs; RRV; Reservoir performance; Reliability; Resilience; Vulnerability	WATER-RESOURCES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; RELIABILITY; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; VARIABILITY; ADAPTATION; RUNOFF; SYSTEM	Climate change and population growth have influenced social and physical water scarcity in many regions. Accordingly, the future performance of water storage reservoirs, as one of the fundamental elements in the water resource management, are anticipated to be affected by climate change. This study reports on a framework that can model Reliability-Resiliency-Vulnerability (RRV) measures of water reservoirs in the context of climate change. The framework first develops a hydrological model of a reservoir system using its historical data. The model is then optimised to minimise the water deficit and flooding around the catchment area of the reservoir. The resulting optimal policies are simulated back to the model considering the GCMs. Finally, RRV indices are calculated. RRV indices are effective measures for defining the performance of reservoir systems. Reliability is defined as the probability of the failure of the system, Resiliency is defined as the time needed for the system to go back to its satisfactory state once it entered the failure state, and Vulnerability is defined as the "magnitude of the failure" of a system. The proposed framework has been applied to a reservoir system located in the south-west of Iran on the Dez river. The results show climate change may increase the reliability and resiliency of the system under study while increasing its vulnerability. Therefore, the output of this framework can also provide supplementary information to authorities and decision-makers to inform future water management and planning policies.

They are also likely to be the system most impacted by climate change, feeling the effects of sea levels rise, temperature increases and rainfall regime changes. Climate change impacts on estuarine coastal wetlands (mangroves, saltmarsh) have been thoroughly investigated; however, the impacts on coastal freshwater wetlands (CFWs) are relatively unknown. To explore the current knowledge of the impacts of climate change on CFWs globally, we undertook a systematic quantitative literature review of peer-reviewed published literature. We found surprisingly little research (110 papers of an initial 678), the majority of which was conducted in the USA, focusing on the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on CFW vegetation or sediment accretion processes. From this research, we know that SLR will lead to reduced productivity, reduced regeneration, and increased mortality in CFW vegetation but little is known regarding the effects of other climate change drivers. Sediment accretion is also not sufficient to keep pace with SLR in many CFWs and again the effects of other climate drivers have not been investigated. The combination of unhealthy vegetation communities and minimal gain in vertical elevation can result in a transition towards a vegetation community of salt-tolerant species but more research is required to understand this process.

The issue of climate change pushes to tackle the expected risks in the water sector through a comprehensive and global view, with a revision of the paradigms considered as drivers of water resources development. Based on the evolution of these paradigms in Italy the main characteristics of an adaptive approach to climate change and other global changes are discussed relatively to water infrastructures, legislative and institutional frameworks. The objective of adaptation strategies is the increase of resilience of water systems, emphasizing the capability of reducing both physical and socio-political vulnerability, improving the governance of water services. Starting from the analysis of the evolution of water management, priorities for coping with future challenges are discussed with reference to the reduction of the risk of water shortage due to drought, to the mitigation of flood risk, and to the issues concerning the water-food-energy nexus.

Increasingly, more studies are focusing on how communities are receiving messages about environmental degradation, and from whom they are receiving them. This case study draws upon ethnographic research conducted in November 2015 in Narikoso on Ono Island in Fiji's Kadavu Group. This village was in the process of relocating inland as a response to shoreline erosion and severe coastal flooding. By employing data drawn from interviews with government actors, religious leaders, and residents of Narikoso village along with fieldnotes from participant observation, this paper examines how village residents interpreted coastal flooding and shoreline erosion according to the biblical story of Noah's Ark alongside a secular narrative of climate change. I conclude by showing the unique challenges these worldviews had on the community's decision to relocate.

The future streamflows were simulated using bias-corrected climate change data and physical-based hydrological models, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and Hydrologic Engineering Centre - Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). The performances of SWAT and HEC-HMS were assessed using four statistical indices (R-2, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, percentage bias, and RSR). It was observed that SWAT slightly outperformed HEC-HMS. PROMETHEE-2 was used to select the CMIP6 general circulation models (GCMs). The variations in climate variables and streamflows were studied for three future periods, i.e., near-future (2031-2040), mid-future (2051-2060), and far-future (2071-2080) under three shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585). The projections of different GCMs show different patterns in variation of precipitation. Generally, there is a slight increase in annual precipitation. However, a noteworthy decline in peak in July was observed. In most cases, an alternate peak was observed in October. The maximum and minimum temperatures showed a decreasing trend. Under SSP126, the average decrease in annual streamflow was about 25.63, 27.92, and 26.24% in the near-future, mid-future, and far-future, respectively. Under the SSP245 scenario, the average decrease is 30.71, 16.06, and 19.06% for near-future, mid-future, and far-future, respectively. For the SSP585 scenario, there is an increase (12.73%) in the far-future period.

This situation is expected to worsen due to anthropogenically induced climate change. However, the magnitude and relevance of expected increase in sea level rise (SLR) is uncertain for marine and terrestrial species that are reliant on coastal habitat for foraging, resting or breeding. To address this, we showcase the use of a low-cost approach to assess the impacts of SLR on sea turtles under various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SLR scenarios on different sea turtle nesting rookeries worldwide. The study considers seven sea turtle rookeries with five nesting species, categorized from vulnerable to critically endangered including leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Our approach combines freely available digital elevation models for continental and remote island beaches across different ocean basins with projections of field data and SLR. Our case study focuses on five of the seven living sea turtle species. Under moderate climate change scenarios, by 2050 it is predicted that at some sea turtle nesting habitats 100% will be flooded, and under an extreme scenario many sea turtle rookeries could vanish. Overall, nesting beaches with low slope and those species nesting at open beaches such as leatherback and loggerheads sea turtles might be the most vulnerable by future SLR scenarios.

In this study, the impact of climate change on the streamflow of the Qinglong River located in northern China is predicted. The streamflow of the Qinglong River (2021-2100) under two climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) was mainly synthesized over multiple timescales. The meteorological data from 31 global climate models (GCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used as inputs of the Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) for hydrological simulation. Results show that the peak flood flow and average daily streamflow for the RCP4.5 scenario are at least 101.15 and 110.14% of the historical phase, and at least 108.89 and 121.88% of the historical phase for the RCP8.5 scenario. Under both scenarios, the proportion of summer streamflow to annual total streamflow is projected to increase from 61.46% (historical phase) to over 85%, while the proportion of winter streamflow to annual total streamflow is projected to decrease from 8.84% (historical phase) to below 0.5%. Compared to the historical period, the maximum increase in future multi-year average annual streamflow for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios is 30.34 and 31.48%, respectively.

Surging seas, rising fiscal stress: Exploring municipal fiscal vulnerability to climate change	CITIES			English	Article						Fiscal stress; Land finance; Property taxes; Climate change; Sea level rise; Adaptation	ADAPTATION; GENTRIFICATION; RESPONSES; IMPACTS	Recent disasters and growing concerns about climate change have spurred calls for cities to retreat from and avoid developing in coastal areas. Instead, cities have doubled down on waterfront development. We ask why and with what implications, using the U.S. state of Massachusetts as a case study. By overlaying data on sea level rise, land use, and property taxes, we find a few coastal cities may lose significant levels of municipal revenues to long-term sea level rise, while others face negligible impacts. Coastal municipalities are cognizant of their risks yet continue to site redevelopment projects in flood-vulnerable areas to meet present-day budgetary needs. Moreover, they resist efforts to align property values and insurance premiums with climate risks, as reforms only hasten lost taxes. Left unchanged, existing land use and fiscal policies incentivize municipalities to make short-term decisions with accelerating climate risks over time. This creates new dynamics of fiscal stress that can increase regional inequality and vulnerability to climate change. The study highlights the need for dialogue among researchers and policymakers in the U.S. and internationally on the nexus between land use planning, government administration, and climate change as these tensions likely exist wherever local governments rely on land-based finance.

This study aims to assess the impacts of climate change on national food production and food and nutritional security as well as document issue-based prioritized adaptation options for a resilient food production system. MethodsThis study considers temperature, precipitation, and their anomalies as the key factors affecting food production in Nepal. Nationwide precipitation trends along with their association with the annual production of major cereal crops in Nepal were assessed using data from the last three decades (1990-2018). The annual productions of the major cereal crops were summed and normalized to calculate the production index scores in the districts. Scores were plotted and visualized into maps using the Geographical Information System. In three ecological regions, the distribution of flood and extreme rainfall events and cases of malnutrition from 2005 to 2018 were plotted. The effects of climate change and highest priority adaptation options at the district level were documented through a review of national policies and literature studies and qualitative research based on Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). ResultsBetween 1990 and 2018, the overall average production of major cereal crops in Nepal was increased by around 2,245 MT annually. In the district level index analysis, the highest production score was found for Jhapa and Morang while the lowest production score was found for Humla. Cases of malnutrition in some districts coincided with flood and heavy rainfall events, indicating that climate change and extreme climatic events have a role to play in food production and security. Growing drought-tolerant crops, changes in crop cycle, riverbed farming practices, developing short-term strategies, such as contingency crop planning, changing planting dates, planting short duration varieties, schemes evacuation, and long-term strategies, such as encouraging out-migration of population to safer locations, resettlement programs with transformative livelihood options, and sustainable agricultural practices were found to be key prioritized adaptation measures for a resilient food production system. ConclusionIn Nepal, climate change and the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme climatic events adversely affect the food production system, which has become a serious threat to food and nutritional security. The implementation of evidence-based practices to build a resilient food system specific to climate-vulnerable hotspots at the district and local levels is the nation's current need.

J	Kim, K; Garcia, TF				Kim, Kyungmee; Garcia, Tania Ferre			Climate Change and Violent Conflict in the Middle East and North Africa	INTERNATIONAL STUDIES REVIEW			English	Article						climate change; violent conflict; MENA region	SYRIAN CIVIL-WAR; ARMED CONFLICT; WATER; DROUGHT; SECURITY; STATE; WEAPONIZATION; RETHINKING; MIGRATION; SCARCITY	Previous research has demonstrated that climate change can escalate the risks for violent conflict through various pathways. Existing evidence suggests that contextual factors, such as migration and livelihood options, governance arrangements, and existing conflict dynamics, can influence the pathways through which climate change leads to conflict. This important insight leads to an inquiry to identify sets of conditions and processes that make climate-related violent conflict more likely. In this analytic essay, we conduct a systematic review of scholarly literature published during the period 1989-2022 and explore the climate-conflict pathways in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Through the systematic review of forty-one peer-reviewed publications in English, we identify that society's ability to cope with the changing climate and extreme weather events is influenced by a range of factors, including preceding government policies that led to the mismanagement of land and water and existing conflict dynamics in the MENA region. Empirical research to unpack the complex and diverse relationship between the climate shocks and violent conflict in the MENA region needs advancing. Several avenues for future research are highlighted such as more studies on North Africa and the Gulf region, with focus on the implications of floods and heatwaves, and exploring climate implications on non-agriculture sectors including the critical oil sector.

However, the risk-based approach applied to weather similar to the target event (typhoons, a stationary weather front, horizontal ellipsis etc) becomes theoretically similar to the storyline approach. We examine this theory for the climate change impact of a real event, Typhoon Hagibis, which caused devastating flood damage to eastern Japan in 2019, while focusing on basin-averaged accumulated rainfall (BAAR) in major eastern river basins. A risk-based approach was conducted to determine the future change of BAAR by calculating the quantile change corresponding to Hagibis from the probability distribution of typhoon-induced events in a large ensemble climate simulation dataset database for Policy Decision-making for Future climate change (past, +2K and +4K future climates). A storyline approach for Typhoon Hagibis was realized using a pseudo global warming (PGW) experiment with a 5 km non-hydrostatic model. The projected BAAR in the two approaches were consistent for all target basins, supporting the robustness of the calculated changes in extreme catchment precipitation. This presents an important practical benefit: one can assess future climate change impact on a past symbolic event using either PGW experiments or large ensemble climate projections for the target weather.

However, adaptation strategies for coastal areas, especially of Turkey, are lacking. This study aims to construct a general framework for denoting impacts of sea level rise due to climate change in coastal cities and to propose adaptation strategies against these effects. It evaluates different aspects and scales, with focus on geographical/morphological, administrative and spatial/functional aspects and global, regional, national, urban and architectural scales. The discussion on the coastal areas is elaborated through the case of Turkey. Figured out by the related literature on coastal cities and elaborated through the case of Turkey, this comprehensive framework is intended to be used also for different coastal cities having a risk of sea level rise.

The study focused on exploring the existing coastal resources and their support to communities' livelihood, climatic threats that are experienced, and the role of coastal resources in enhancing communities' resilience. It further sought to establish other enabling factors for climate change adaptation (e.g., gender, education, governance, by-laws, and membership in social networks). The study used focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys in data collection. Findings show that Mchungu village is endowed with fish, mangrove, natural canal, and floodplains as their major coastal resources, while Kivinja' A' is rich in salt and coconut production. Communities in both villages exploit these coastal resources for their livelihood activities such as fishing, agriculture, and business. The study further found that coastal communities are already experiencing the effects of climate change through temperature rise, flooding, drought, sea-level rise, and storm surges. These affect household food security in terms of fish catch and crop production. The study revealed that coastal and marine resources were important for increasing community resilience (P <= 0.05) to climate change impacts in the studied villages. However, household resilience to climate change impacts was also influenced by gender, by-laws, education, and membership in social networks.

An assessment of marine, estuarine, and riverine habitat vulnerability to climate change in the Northeast US	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; SALT MARSHES; COASTAL WETLANDS; NEW-ENGLAND; CARBON ACCUMULATION; FUTURE CHANGES; UNITED-STATES; FLOOD RISK; FISH	Climate change is impacting the function and distribution of habitats used by marine, coastal, and diadromous species. These impacts often exacerbate the anthropogenic stressors that habitats face, particularly in the coastal environment. We conducted a climate vulnerability assessment of 52 marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats in the Northeast U.S. to develop an ecosystem-scale understanding of the impact of climate change on these habitats. The trait-based assessment considers the overall vulnerability of a habitat to climate change to be a function of two main components, sensitivity and exposure, and relies on a process of expert elicitation. The climate vulnerability ranks ranged from low to very high, with living habitats identified as the most vulnerable. Over half of the habitats examined in this study are expected to be impacted negatively by climate change, while four habitats are expected to have positive effects. Coastal habitats were also identified as highly vulnerable, in part due to the influence of non-climate anthropogenic stressors. The results of this assessment provide regional managers and scientists with a tool to inform habitat conservation, restoration, and research priorities, fisheries and protected species management, and coastal and ocean planning.

This paper investigates the impact of climate change on urban flooding using future projected rainfall data and a calibrated hydraulic model. Two urban watersheds in Delhi, India (the Qudesia Nallah catchment and the Jahangirpuri drain catchment) are considered to evaluate the climate change impact on urban flooding. Regional climate models (RCMs) are used to project future precipitation, which is then utilized by the hydraulic model to evaluate the impact on flooding. Climate data from three RCMs extracted from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) are used to study the impact of climate change for historical (1990-2016) and future scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, 2021-2100). The rainfall projections are fed as 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year return periods to a calibrated hydrodynamic Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The results show that the flooded nodes vary between 2-6 and 12-43, respectively, in the Qudesia Nallah catchment and the Jahangirpuri drain catchment under present conditions but increase from 11 to 51 and 42 to 91, respectively, for future climate conditions. The results suggest that the risk of occurrence of flooding, duration, and frequency in the two study areas will increase in the future when compared to those under the present conditions. The results also indicate that the damage induced by the 20-year return period rainfall at the present time will likely be caused just by the 2-year return period in the future. This is due to the greater likelihood of rainfall extremes in the region. The potential flooding sites identified in this study will provide the urban municipalities with substantive information to perform ameliorative strategies.

To ensure the sustainable management of water resources, it is important to evaluate how dam construction may affect surface runoff. In this study, using Mann-Kendall tests, the double mass curve method, and the Budyko-based elasticity method, the effects of climate change and human activities on annual and seasonal runoff were quantified for the Yellow River basin from 1961-2018; additionally, effects on runoff were assessed after the construction of the Xiaolangdi Dam (XLD, started operation in 2001) on the Yellow River. Both annual and seasonal runoff decreased over time (p < 0.01), due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities. Abrupt changes in annual, flood season, and non-flood season runoff occurred in 1986, 1989, and 1986, respectively. However, no abrupt changes were seen after the construction of the XLD. Human activities accounted for much of the reduction in runoff, approximately 75-72% annually, 81-86% for the flood season, and 86-90% for the non-flood season. Climate change approximately accounted for the remainder: 18-25% (annually), 14-19% (flood season), and 10-14% (non-flood season). The XLD construction mitigated runoff increases induced by heightened precipitation and reduced potential evapotranspiration during the post-dam period; the XLD accounted for approximately 52% of the runoff reduction both annually and in the non-flood season, and accounted for approximately -32% of the runoff increase in the flood season. In conclusion, this study provides a basic understanding of how dam construction contributes to runoff changes in the context of climate change; this information will be beneficial for the sustainable management of water resources in regulated rivers.

However, most IGGI strategies rely heavily on historical precipitation data, while ignoring the long-term effects of dynamic and non-stationary climate change. This study explored a novel approach to assess the hydrological performance under Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) based on longterm rainfall time series, facilitating the exploration of the optimal solution to urban runoff alleviation in response to climate change. A case study of Guangzhou, China, was applied for model validation. The results indicated that through non-stationarity analysis and stage division, the future time series of the three SSPs were identified with an abrupt point and divided into two stages. By assessing the hydrological performance of the optimal solutions at various historical and future stages, both fully centralized IGGI and decentralized IGGI are found vulnerable to long-term climate change. Based on a certain extent of trade-off between centralization and decentralization, an appropriate degree of decentralization was observed to significantly enhance the hydrological performance of the whole IGGI system, particularly for reducing peak flow following extreme rainfall events. The authors believe that the findings could provide a novel perspective on hydrological performance assessment for IGGI in response to non-stationary and multi-scenario climate change in urban catchments with high built-up density.

Climate change and human activity are two key driving factors of flood formation, and it is difficult to determine how to quantitatively detect their relative impacts on flood susceptibility. As an important non-engineering measure of preventing floods and reducing losses, flood susceptibility assessment is a synthetic task that involves many factors. In this study, the flood susceptibility in Guangdong Province, China, was assessed based on a cloud model. The relative impacts of climate change and human activity on flood susceptibility were also quantitatively investigated from the spatial perspective. The results prove that the cloud model is a feasible, reasonable, and effective method for flood susceptibility assessment. Approximately 40% of the studied areas have changed their flood susceptibility level since 1985 due to the comprehensive impacts of climate change and human activity, of which about 56.3% converted from a low to high level, and 43.7% from a high to low level. About 35.7% of the areas changed their susceptibility level due to climate change, of which 55.8% converted from a low to high level and 44.2% from a high to low level. In contrast, only 9.8% of the areas changed the susceptibility level due to human activity, of which 57.2% converted from a low to high level and 42.8% from a high to low level. Generally, from the spatial perspective, climate change has a larger impact on flood susceptibility than human activity. This study aims to provide a novel idea to quantitatively detect the relative impacts of climate change and human activity on flood susceptibility from spatial perspective; the findings of this study are also expected to enhance the understanding on distribution rule of flood susceptibility in Guangdong Province and are conducive to taking targeted measures to reduce the flood risk.

Gridlock: Vigilance and early warning in the shadow of climate change	HAU-JOURNAL OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THEORY			English	Article						climate change; adaptation; vigilance; gridlock; duration	ANTICIPATION; RESOURCES; TIME	This article examines how Guyana's storm early warning system shapes political imaginaries of climate adaptation. Specifically, it focuses on the reactions people have to the forms of gridlock that can make intense flooding, and climate change more generally, feel like an insurmountable problem. As I detail throughout this article, gridlock is an object of intervention in the development, maintenance, and operations of the storm early warning system. The management of gridlock is synonymous with aspirations to make more consistent institutional arrangements of vigilance. But Civil Defense Commission staff and village residents run into difficulties making enhancements because gridlock unfolds across multiple historical tenses. That is, as they implement the storm early warning system, gridlock reveals itself as a product of past and ongoing governmental practices that permeate the present in ways that shape uncertainty about the future. In this respect, this article extends conversations in anthropological scholarship on anticipation around the different configurations of political time within contexts of climate change/risk and governance.

To inspire the Swedish climate research community and to promote assessments of international research on past and future changes in extreme weather events against the global climate change background, the Earth Science Class of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences organized a workshop entitled 'Extreme weather events in a warming world' in 2019. This article summarizes and synthesizes the key points from the presentations and discussions of the workshop on changes in floods, droughts, heat waves, as well as on tropical cyclones and extratropical storms. In addition to reviewing past achievements in these research fields and identifying research gaps with a focus on Sweden, future challenges and opportunities for the Swedish climate research community are highlighted.

Less attention has been given to assessing the future trends in this relationship under the joint influence of climate change and urbanization. This paper aims to quantify future trends in the FRS supply-demand relationship under the joint impacts of climate change and urbanization. To this end, we took the Baiyangdian Lake Basin as an example and developed a "Climate Change-Urbanization-FRS supply and demand" framework by combining future climate scenarios from the ScenarioMIP (Scenario Model Intercomparison Project) dataset and socioeconomic data from the SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) to estimate the FRS supply and demand dynamics during the period from 2020 to 2050. The results show that the framework has a reasonable ability to estimate the FRS supply-demand relationship. The correlation coefficients between estimated supply-demand ratios and the historical values exceeded 0.9. The average FRS supply-demand ratio among the four scenarios shows a significantly downward trend between 2020 and 2050. The FRS is expected to decrease by 0.159 (36.6 %), resulting in the imbalanced area increasing from 38.3 km2 (4.1 % of the whole basin) to 11049.7 km2 (36.2 %). We believe that although urbanization is the dominant factor contributing to the intensified imbalance trend (with a contribution of 71.2 %), influences from climate change also cannot be ignored (with a contribution of 28.8 %). Therefore, adaptation actions to climate change should be actively taken to reduce urban flood risks in the future.

In a warmer climate, increasing rainfall and changing snowmelt rates could lead to significant shifts in flood-generating mechanisms. Here, projected changes to flood-generating mechanisms in terms of the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall are assessed across Canada, based on an ensemble of transient climate change simulations performed using a state-of-the-art regional climate model. Changes to flood-generating mechanisms are assessed for both a late 21st century, high warming (i.e., Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) scenario, and in a 2 degrees C global warming context. Under 2 degrees C of global warming, the relative contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to streamflow peaks is projected to remain close to that of the current climate, despite slightly increased rainfall contribution. In contrast, a high warming scenario leads to widespread increases in rainfall contribution and the emergence of hotspots of change in currently snowmelt-dominated regions across Canada. In addition, several regions in southern Canada would be projected to become rainfall dominated. These contrasting projections highlight the importance of climate change mitigation, as remaining below the 2 degrees C global warming threshold can avoid large changes over most regions, implying a low likelihood that expensive flood adaptation measures would be necessary.

Spanish mountains are especially affected by that situation, since snow storage is there focussed on very specific periods of the hydrological year and plays a very important role in the management of water resources. In this study, an analysis of the behaviour of the complex snow-related phenomena in the four main mountain regions of Spain in the next 50 years is conducted. The ASTER hydrological model is applied using temperature and precipitation data as basic input, estimated under a climate change scenario. Results show different changes in the maximum and average expected flows, depending on the very different magnitude and sign of changes in precipitation. An increase of flooding episodes may occur as a result of a complex relation between changes in precipitation and an increase in maximum snowmelt intensities that range from 2.1% in the Pyrenees to 7.4% in the Cantabrian Mountains. However, common patterns are shown in a shorter duration of the snow bulk reserves, expected to occur 45 days earlier for the Cantabrian Mountains, and about 30 days for the rest of the studied mountain regions. Changes observed also lead to a concerning decrease in the regulatory effect of the snow-related phenomena in the Spanish rivers, with a decrease in the average snow accumulation that ranges from about 28% for the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada to 42% for the Central System and the Cantabrian Mountains. A decrease in average flow is expected, fluctuating from 2.4% in the Pyrenees to 7.3% in Cantabrian Mountains, only increasing in the Central System by 4.0%, making all necessary to develop new adaptation measures to climate change.

Thus, their genetic composition could be shaped by climatic drivers that differ from those occurring at higher latitudes, resulting in potentially adaptive variants of conservation value. Such variants could facilitate the adaptation of populations from other portions of the geographical range to similar future conditions anticipated under ongoing climate change. However, very few studies have assessed standing genetic variation at potentially adaptive loci in natural LLM populations. We investigated standing genetic variation at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 117 candidate genes and its links to putative climatic selection pressures across 19 pedunculate oak (Quercus roburL.) populations distributed along a regional climatic gradient near the species' southern range margin in southeastern Europe. These populations are restricted to floodplain forests along large lowland rivers, whose hydric regime is undergoing significant shifts under modern rapid climate change. The populations showed very weak geographical structure, suggesting extensive genetic connectivity and gene flow or shared ancestry. We identified eight (6.2%) positiveF(ST)-outlier loci, and genotype-environment association analyses revealed consistent associations between SNP allele frequencies and several climatic variables linked to water availability. A total of 61 associations involving 37 SNPs (28.5%) from 35 annotated genes provided important insights into putative functional mechanisms in our system. Our findings provide empirical support for the role of LLM populations as sources of potentially adaptive variation that could enhance species' resilience to climate change-related pressures.

This study used a 23-year data set of wave heights and tide-surge levels to define return periods of overwash potential for current and future sea-level conditions, namely 2055 and 2100, at two sites from South Portugal. A relevant intensification of both frequency and magnitude of the overwash is expected to occur by mid-century if adaptation measures are not taken and further aggravated by 2100. Current overwash levels with a return period of 100-years can reach a return period lower than 20-years by 2055 and 10-years by 2100. However, these values are rather variable from site to site, highlighting the urgency to develop detailed local studies to identify climate change impacts along coastal sectors, based on validated equations and long-term time series. These could be easily carried by replicating and adapting the here proposed methodology to sandy coasts worldwide. Understating the impact that climate change (namely sea-level rise) may have at the local level is key to contribute to effective management plans that include adaptation measures to minimize risks associated with coastal floods.

The overarching objective of managed retreat is to reduce the exposure of people and assets to flooding, storm surges and sea level rise by retreating from these threats in a planned fashion. Managed retreat is one of four main options covered in the TARA' (protect/accommodate/retreat/avoid) framework explained in this paper, which can be used to enhance resilience in coastal megacities. In this paper, qualitative research methods were used to collect primary data on the feasibility of using managed retreat for two case study coastal megacities: Manila, Philippines, and Vancouver, Canada. Both case studies review the risk context of each city, local climate change adaptation/disaster risk reduction (CCA/DRR) policies linked to managed retreat, examples of managed retreat practice, and barriers to managed retreat identified through primary or secondary data analysis. Comparisons between the two cases are then carried out, and similarities and differences are highlighted. The paper concludes by suggesting possible means by which barriers to managed retreat might be overcome.

Experience of local flooding can in theory, inform individuals' attitudes towards climate change. This trend however, is not observed in all cases and is highly dependent on the local, situational context. This paper postulates that the variation observed in attitudinal and behavioural responses by farmers to climate change following experiences of local flooding can, in part, be explained by the Cognitive Filters of Experience Appraisal Model introduced in this paper. The model is developed firstly through a review of the existing literature concerning appraisal (cognitive and experience). Secondly, the model is framed by empirical research via fifteen face to face interviews with farmers in Gloucestershire, England, who have all directly experienced flooding in recent years. The study is exploratory in nature, and the qualitative data serve as contextualised accounts of the different patterns of experience appraisal. The paper contributes to existing literature by developing current understandings of experience appraisal as well as providing qualitative detail to an area which has generally only been researched quantitatively. The model of experience appraisal which is put forward could be applied to multiple contexts of environmental risk.

J	Yan, B; Xu, Y; Liu, H; Huang, CS				Yan, Bing; Xu, Yi; Liu, Heng; Huang, Changshuo			Response of future hydropower generation of cascade reservoirs to climate change in alpine regions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RIVER-BASIN; DOWNSTREAM; IMPACTS	Climate warming accelerates the hydrological cycle, especially in high-latitude and high-altitude areas. The increase in temperature will increase the amount of snow and glacier melting and change the runoff, which will affect the operations of cascade reservoirs significantly. Therefore, taking the upper reaches of the Yellow River with an alpine climate as an example, we propose an improved SIMHYD-SNOW, which considers the snowmelt runoff process. The impacts of climate changes on the runoff process were revealed based on the SIMHYD-SNOW model using the precipitation and temperature data predicted by the SDSM model. A model for the maximum power generation of the cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was constructed to explore the impacts of climate changes on the inter-annual and intra-annual hydropower generation of the cascade reservoirs at different periods in the future. The results show that climate change has changed the spatial and temporal allocation of water resources in this area. The future runoff will decrease during the flood period (July to September) but increase significantly during the non-flood period. The inter-annual and intra-annual hydropower generation under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario is significantly lower than the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 climate change scenarios, and as the CO2 emission concentration increases, this gap increases significantly. This study can provide technical references for the precise formulation of water resources management under climate change.

Climate Change Implications for Tidal Marshes and Food Web Linkages to Estuarine and Coastal Nekton	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Tidal wetlands; Seascapes; Multiple stressors; Ecosystem resilience; Trophic relays		Climate change is altering naturally fluctuating environmental conditions in coastal and estuarine ecosystems across the globe. Departures from long-term averages and ranges of environmental variables are increasingly being observed as directional changes [e.g., rising sea levels, sea surface temperatures (SST)] and less predictable periodic cycles (e.g., Atlantic or Pacific decadal oscillations) and extremes (e.g., coastal flooding, marine heatwaves). Quantifying the short- and long-term impacts of climate change on tidal marsh seascape structure and function for nekton is a critical step toward fisheries conservation and management. The multiple stressor framework provides a promising approach for advancing integrative, cross-disciplinary research on tidal marshes and food web dynamics. It can be used to quantify climate change effects on and interactions between coastal oceans (e.g., SST, ocean currents, waves) and watersheds (e.g., precipitation, river flows), tidal marsh geomorphology (e.g., vegetation structure, elevation capital, sedimentation), and estuarine and coastal nekton (e.g., species distributions, life history adaptations, predator-prey dynamics). However, disentangling the cumulative impacts of multiple interacting stressors on tidal marshes, whether the effects are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, and the time scales at which they occur, poses a significant research challenge. This perspective highlights the key physical and ecological processes affecting tidal marshes, with an emphasis on the trophic linkages between marsh production and estuarine and coastal nekton, recommended for consideration in future climate change studies. Such studies are urgently needed to understand climate change effects on tidal marshes now and into the future.

China launched a sponge city policy as a holistic nature-based solution combined with urban planning and development to address flooding due to climate change. Using Weibo analytics, this paper aims to study public perceptions of sponge city. Design/methodology/approachThis study collected 53,586 sponge city contents from Sina Weibo via Python. Various artificial intelligence tools, such as CX Data Science of Simply Sentiment, KH Coder and Tableau, were applied in the study. Findings76.8% of public opinion on sponge city were positive, confirming its positive contribution to flooding management and city branding. 17 out of 31 pilot sponge cities recorded the largest number of sponge cities related posts. Other cities with more Weibo posts suffered from rainwater and flooding hazards, such as Xi'an and Zhengzhou. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to explore the public perception of sponge city in Sina Weibo.

J	Entwisle, B; Williams, N; Verdery, A				Entwisle, Barbara; Williams, Nathalie; Verdery, Ashton			Climate Change and Migration: New Insights from a Dynamic Model of Out-Migration and Return Migration	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							LIFE-COURSE; NANG-RONG; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; DECISION-MAKING; SOCIAL NETWORKS; REMITTANCES; VARIABILITY; MOBILITY; POPULATION; HOUSEHOLD	In popular accounts, stories of environmental refugees convey a bleak picture of the impacts of climate change on migration. Scholarly research is less conclusive, with studies finding varying effects. This article uses an agent-based model (ABM) of land use, social networks, and household dynamics to examine how extreme floods and droughts affect migration in Northeast Thailand. The ABM explicitly models the dynamic and interactive pathways through which climate-migration relationships might operate, including coupled out and return streams. Results suggest minimal effects on out-migration but marked negative effects on return. Social networks play a pivotal role in producing these patterns. In all, the portrait of climate change and migration painted by focusing only on environmental refugees is too simple. Climate change operates on already established migration processes that are part and parcel of the life course, embedded in dynamic social networks, and incorporated in larger interactive systems where out-migration and return migration are integrally connected.

The results shed light on how adaptation measures and investments influence housing values and local real estate markets with respect to their place-based and local forms of implementation. Numerous quantitative approaches, with the use of geospatial data, panel-data hedonic regressions, and difference-in-differences analyses, are used to examine changes in property values associated with climate adaptation measures and the dynamics of risk perception. The results also signal how risk perception and hurricane characteristics are reflected in housing markets, thereby shedding light on the effects of anticipatory and reactive adaptation strategies on property values in these coastal communities. Collectively, the study suggests which adaptation strategies and characteristics can contribute to maximizing both community resilience and economic benefits against the weather extremes caused by climate change.

Floating developments are one such innovation. This phenomenon and its ideas are driven by a variety of societal forces, including by population pressure, rapid urbanisation, the resulting need for additional housing inventory, by urban adaptation strategies to counter fluvial flooding and sea level rise, plus interests in urban landscape renewal. We reflect on seventeen projects in five countries and note that, to date, it is inner city harbours or industrial areas in decline that are being targeted for floating communities. These can add renewal, recreational and landscape value, while simultaneously expanding the existing urban housing stock.

J	Hampton, S; Curtis, J				Hampton, Sam; Curtis, James			A bridge over troubled water? Flood insurance and the governance of climate change adaptation	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Insurance; Flooding; Flood risk; Climate change; Climate adaptation	BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS; RISK SOCIETY; CATASTROPHE; POLITICS; STRATEGIES; INSIGHTS; MARKETS; IMPACT; CITIES; UK	Floods are one of the most commonly occurring natural hazard events globally, and present a significant threat to the UK from climate change. Operating since 2016, Flood Re is an industry-government initiative, set up with the goal of reforming the flood insurance market in order to provide universal, affordable cover for UK households. Principally providing reinsurance services to insurers and including mutualisation arrangements, it aims to withdraw from the market in 2039, having paved the way for risk-reflective pricing without subsidy. Drawing on the theoretical work of Francois Ewald, and empirical data from interviews with 12 key stakeholders and documentary analysis, this paper traces a shift in Flood Re's insurantial imaginary, exemplified by the devel-opment of several solutions which go beyond its initial remit of providing reinsurance to private insurers. Findings show that this shift has been driven by the growing realisation that climate change is not merely a complicating factor for the ability to achieve a thriving insurance market, but demands a paradigmatic change in the governance of flood risk. We argue that Flood Re has an opportunity to adopt a leadership role in the governance of climate adaptation, but that it must be expanded to include a wider variety of stakeholders covering land-use planning, housing, consumer and community representatives. That a market for flood insur-ance that delivers on risk reduction and affordability for all can be brought about without structural reform to the industry nor a strong role for the state, is a delusion in light of climate change.

Sustainable intensification in the form of improved agricultural management practices and new technologies may help farmers cope with stress and adapt to changing conditions. In this study, we explore how climate change perceptions of agricultural risk affect adaptation to climate change through technology adoption in a unique landscape: the polders of Bangladesh. In 2016, a survey was conducted in 1003 households living on these artificial, leveed islands facing the Bay of Bengal. We analyzed the responses from polder residents to construct a climate risk index which quantifies climate risk perception in this highly vulnerable agrarian landscape. We analyzed how polder demographics influence their perceptions about climatic change using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Further, by using three bivariate probit regression models, we estimated how the perception of climate risk drives the differential adoption of new agricultural technologies. Our findings show that farmers perceive polder agriculture as highly vulnerable to four environmental change factors: flooding, drought, salinity, and pest infestation. The SUR model suggests that farmer demographics, community group memberships, and access to different inputs and services strongly influence climatic risk perceptions. Findings also suggest that polder farmers with higher risk perceptions have a higher propensity to adopt both chemical and mechanical adaptation strategies. Cost, however, limits the ability of farmers to adopt improved technologies, suggesting an opportunity for institution-led approaches.

We developed a method to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological effect of ecological conservation programs by combining a hydrological model and mathematical method and assessed the hydrological changes attributed to ecological conservation programs (2005-2015) in the source region of the Yangtze River in China. Through improved water retention capacity, ecological conservation programs induce annual streamflow decreased by 57% and the summer flood decreased by 78%, decreasing these streamflow amounts by 60.71 m(3)center dot s(-1) and 160.14 m(3)center dot s(-1), respectively. The ecological conservation programs decreased the streamflow concentration degree in the summer-flood season, indicating reduced river flood risk. However, climate change increased annual streamflow by 167.44 m(3)center dot s(-1), which offset a large part of the decreased annual streamflow caused by the ecological conservation programs. Streamflow and streamflow concentration degree in the summer flood season increased by 366.16 m(3)center dot s(-1) and 0.27, respectively, resulting in a final increase of 206.02 m(3)center dot s(-1) in annual streamflow in the summer-flood season and an increased flood risk, offsetting some of the positive effects of ecological conservation programs. The ecological conservation programs generally exhibited beneficial hydrological effects; however, these improvements were largely nullified by the negative effects of climate change.

However, it remains unclear how much technological advances alone can mitigate climate change and the associated economic losses in the future. Through designing a suite of technological advances scenarios and using an earth system model with an integrated assessment model, we illustrate that rapid technological progress without production control might achieve the 2 degrees C global warming target in the 2100s. Relative to a world of stagnant technology, the frequency (intensity) of extreme warm events at the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) would be reduced by similar to 21% (5.5 degrees C) via rapid technological advances, with a reduction in extreme precipitation (droughts) by similar to 41% (10 times). Furthermore, fast technological advances may reduce the global economic losses linked with climate change at 2081-2100 by similar to 21% and those in China related to floods (droughts) by 86% (67%). Our results highlight the potential of technological advances to fill the emission gap between the Paris Agreement and unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions and hence to efficiently mitigate global warming.

Muskrats are culturally important semi-aquatic rodents whose populations may respond to changing water levels in this region. We investigated the importance of patch configuration and patch composition - two properties affected by climate change - on muskrat presence and distribution in the Mackenzie Delta, using remote sensing and field-based surveys of lakes with and without muskrats. We tested multiple hypotheses about predictors of muskrat and forage biomass presence using a model-selection approach. We found that configuration and patch composition explained o muskrat distribution in the Mackenzie Delta, with composition being of greater importance. Muskrats were more likely to occur in lakes with longer perimeters, higher amounts of forage biomass, and sediment characteristics that supported macrophyte growth. The latter two conditions are related to spring flooding regimes, which will likely be altered by climate change. This may result in a decrease in muskrat habitat in the Mackenzie Delta. Our research indicates that both patch composition and configuration are important for understanding species distributions in heterogeneous environments.

Planetary health: an imperative for pediatric radiology	PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY			English	Review						Planetary health; Pediatric radiology; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PARTICULATE MATTER; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; HURRICANE-KATRINA; AIR-POLLUTION; IMPACT; ASSOCIATION; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN	The global temperature has been increasing resulting in climate change. This negatively impacts planetary health that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable among us, especially children. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, flooding, and heatwaves, are becoming more frequent and severe, posing a significant threat to our patients' health, safety, and security. Concurrently, shifts in environmental exposures, including air pollution, allergens, pathogenic vectors, and microplastics, further exacerbate the risks faced by children. In this paper, we provide an overview of pediatric illnesses that are becoming more prevalent and severe because of extreme weather events, global temperature increases, and shifts in environmental exposures. As members of pediatric health care teams, it is crucial for pediatric radiologists to be knowledgeable about the impacts of climate change on our patients, and continue to advocate for safe, healthier environments for our patients.

Their structure and composition directly influence the risk of hydrogeomorphic processes, like floods with high sediment transport or debris flows. Climate change is substantially altering forest ecosystems, and for Central Europe an increase in natural disturbances from wind and insect outbreaks is expected for the future. How such changes impact the regulating function of forest ecosystems remains undear. By combining methods from forestry, hydrology and geotechnical engineering we investigated possible effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on shallow landslides. We simulated forest landscapes in two headwater catchments in the Eastern Alps of Austria under four different future climate scenarios over 200 years. Our results indicate that dimate-mediated changes in forest dynamics can substantially alter the protective function of forest ecosystems. Climate change generally increased landslide risk in our simulations. Only when future warming coincided with drying landslide risk decreased relative to historic conditions. In depth analyses showed that an important driver of future landslide risk was the simulated vegetation composition. Trajectories away from flat rooting Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) forests currently dominating the system towards an increasing proportion of tree species with heart and taproot systems, increased root cohesion and reduced the soil volume mobilized in landslides. Natural disturbances generally reduced landslide risk in our simulations, with the positive effect of accelerated tree species change and increasing root cohesion outweighing a potential negative effect of disturbances on the water cycle. We conclude that while the efficacy of green infrastructure such as protective forests could be substantially reduced by climate change, such systems also have a strong inherent ability to adapt to changing conditions. Forest management should foster this adaptive capacity to strengthen the protective function of forests also under changing environmental conditions. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Trophic implications of a phenological paradigm shift: Bald eagles and salmon in a changing climate	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						bald eagle; climate change; flood; Haliaeetus leucocephalus; hydroelectric management; phenology; salmon; trophic interactions	PACIFIC SALMON; IMPACTS; MARINE	Climate change influences apex predators in complex ways, due to their important trophic position, capacity for resource plasticity, and sensitivity to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Bald eagles, an ecologically and culturally significant apex predator, congregate seasonally in high densities on salmon spawning rivers across the Pacific Northwest. One of the largest eagle concentrations is in the Skagit River watershed, which connects the montane wilderness of North Cascades National Park to the Puget Sound. Using multiple long-term datasets, we evaluated local bald eagle abundance in relation to chum and coho salmon availability; salmon phenology; and the number and timing of flood events in the Skagit. We analysed changes over time as a reflection of climate change impacts, as well as differences between managed and unmanaged portions of the river. We found that peaks in chum salmon and bald eagle presence have advanced at remarkably similar rates (c. 0.45 days/year), suggesting synchronous phenological responses within this trophic relationship. Yet the temporal relationship between chum salmon spawning and flood events, which remove salmon carcasses from the system, has not remained constant. This has resulted in a paradigm shift whereby the peak of chum spawning now occurs before the first flood event of the season rather than after. The interval between peak chum and first flood event was a significant predictor of bald eagle presence: as this interval grew over time (by nearly one day per year), bald eagle counts declined, with a steady decrease in bald eagle observations since 2002. River section was also an important factor, with fewer flood events, and more eagle observations occurring in the river section experiencing direct hydroelectric flow management. Synthesis and applications. The effects of climate change and hydroelectric management contribute to a complex human footprint in the North Cascades National Park, an otherwise largely natural ecosystem. By accounting for the differential phenological impacts of climate change on bald eagles, salmon, and flood events, Park managers and the operators of the hydroelectric system can more effectively ensure the resilience of the eagle-salmon relationship along the Skagit River.

Future impacts of climate change and urbanization on reproduction of a keystone native fish species	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY			English	Article						climate change; ecological forecasting; flooding impacts; hydrology; River Chub; urbanization	NEST ASSOCIATION; NOCOMIS-MICROPOGON; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; UNITED-STATES; STREAM; RESTORATION; PATTERNS; PERSISTENCE; MECHANISM; ECOLOGY	Objective: Predicted impacts of climate change in the eastern United States are pervasive and complex, including increased precipitation, increased frequency of heavy precipitation events, and altered seasonality of rainfall. This will potentially lead to increased flooding frequency and severity. The River Chub Nocomis micropogon is an important keystone and engineer species in the eastern United States, primarily through its construction of nesting habitat, which is shared with other species ("nest associates") in a mutualistic relationship. River Chub nests are vulnerable to high flows caused by excessive precipitation and by urbanization of watersheds. Using predictions of climate change models, we examined the potential for increased River Chub nest disruption under two climate change scenarios. Methods: Published thresholds linking River Chub nest disruption with stream discharge were used to interpret fine-scale predictions of a downscaled climate prediction model (HadGEM2-ES) using a stochastic weather generator (LARS-WG6) calibrated to two climate change scenarios. This was examined for a case study watershed (Big Elk Creek, Maryland). The amount of River Chub nest disruption was compared between present-day stream discharge observations (1995-2021) and simulated data for 2061-2080 under the "worst case" (RCP85) and "probable-case" (RCP45) scenarios. Potential nest disruption in an urbanized stream that lost its River Chub (Gwynns Falls, Maryland) was also evaluated for comparison with Big Elk Creek scenarios. Result: Significantly elevated nest disruption under both RCP45 and RCP85 relative to observed current conditions was found under status quo watershed characteristics in the form of more disruptive events, more disrupted days, and shorter periods of disruption-free days during the River Chub nesting season. Potential nest disruption in the urbanized case study stream was far greater than that observed for any scenario. Conclusion: Increased nest disruption projected by the downscaled HadGEM2-ES climate prediction model was moderate and far below the level of nest disruption observed in flashy urbanized streams that have lost or may have lost River Chub populations in the region. The moderate impacts of increased flooding from climate change will interact with projected population growth and urbanization for the Big Elk Creek watershed. Mechanistic modeling of fine-scale processes by using stochastic weather generators shows promise for modeling the responses of ecosystems to changing conditions.

The unfolding impacts of climate change are affecting human societies and natural ecosystems. Projections of climate change impacts are associated with a cascade of uncertainties including greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, climate models, and associated processes. Uncertainty due to climate models is essential in predicting flow and flood peaks, necessitating proper means of quantification and re-use to help refine the predictions made. This study presents an innovative new framework to quantify flood damage assessment as the climate changes. To integrate uncertainty in modelling catchment behaviour, the Quantile Flow Deviation (QFD) metric was used to attribute different sources of uncertainty, including those from variations in climate from point measurements and from extrapolation to flood peaks from the limited observed flows that are available. The square root of error variance (SREV) calculated from global climate model (GCM) precipitation outputs was used to quantify climate change uncertainty, thereby enabling the estimation of the uncertainty in modelled streamflow to enable the assessment of the extent of change in flood damage assessment. Using data from the Leaf River catchment in the USA, this study presents the increase in flood damage uncertainty resulting from explicit consideration of uncertainty as well as the change in the climate as a function of global temperature rise.

In this study, an integrated framework, based on downscaled climate variables and hydrological model, i.e. the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, was applied to generate extreme precipitation (Rx1day) and extreme streamflow (Sx1day) series under historical and future climate conditions. Then the potential impacts of climate change for univariate and bivariate joint frequency of extreme precipitation and flood in Xitiaoxi River Basin (XRB), a representative watershed of the Yangtze River Delta, are detected. The compound risk of extreme precipitation and flood under different levels of joint return period for historical and projected periods is estimated by copula-based two-dimensional approaches. The Rx1day and Sx1day under future scenarios changed by - 0.4% to 11.7% and 0.7% to 20.4%, respectively, compared to historical period based on univariate frequency analysis, indicating the increasing magnitude of the flood in the future. Climate change with different emission scenarios all have a driving effect on the rising coactivity of extreme precipitation and flood under compound flooding frequency analysis. In addition, the enhancement of climate change to extreme events is more apparent for extremes with higher return period and under the periods of 2080s. Moreover, the flood frequency designs are deduced by bivariate joint distribution are safer than that by univariate distribution. This study may provide actionable insights to formulate the planning scheme of flood control and disaster reduction under the changing environment.

Salinity and food security in southwest coastal Bangladesh: impacts on household food production and strategies for adaptation	FOOD SECURITY			English	Article						Salinity; Saltwater intrusion; Food security; Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Bangladesh	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROUNDWATER QUALITY; LIVELIHOOD CHOICES; WATER MANAGEMENT; SHRIMP; INTRUSION; FARMERS; SYSTEMS; ZONE; IRRIGATION	The rising salinity of land and water is an important, but understudied, climate change-sensitive trend that can exert devastating impacts on food security. This mixed methods investigation combines salinity testing with qualitative research methods to explore these impacts in one of the most salinity-affected regions in the world-the Ganges River Delta. Data collection in 2015 and 2016 undertaken in Bangladesh's southwest coastal region and Dhaka consisted of 83 in-depth household and stakeholder interviews, six community focus groups, and salinity testing of 27 soil and 45 surface and groundwater samples. Results show that household food production is a multifaceted cornerstone of rural livelihood in the southwest coastal region, and virtually every component of it-from rice plantation and homestead gardening to livestock cultivation and aquaculture-is being negatively affected by salinity. Although households have attempted multiple strategies for adapting food production, effective adaptation remains elusive. At the community level, improved irrigation and floodplain management, as well as restrictions on saltwater aquaculture to abate salinity, are viewed as promising interventions. However, the potential of such measures remains unrealized on a broad scale, as they require a level of external resources and regulation not yet provided by the NGO and government sectors. This study elucidates issues of accessibility, equity, and governance surrounding agricultural interventions for climate change-related salinity adaptation, and its findings can help inform the community of organizations that will increasingly need to grapple with salinity in order to guarantee food security in the context of environmental change.

O.; West, Chris			A conceptual framework for cross-border impacts of climate change	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Risk propagation; Adaptation; Response; Climate trigger; Cascading impacts; Complex system	RISKS; ADAPTATION; FUTURE; FLOOD; NEEDS; DAM	Climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability studies tend to confine their attention to impacts and responses within the same geographical region. However, this approach ignores cross-border climate change impacts that occur remotely from the location of their initial impact and that may severely disrupt societies and livelihoods. We propose a conceptual framework and accompanying nomenclature for describing and analysing such cross-border impacts. The conceptual framework distinguishes an initial impact that is caused by a climate trigger within a specific region. Downstream consequences of that impact propagate through an impact transmission system while adaptation responses to deal with the impact propagate through a response transmission system. A key to understanding cross-border impacts and responses is a recognition of different types of climate triggers, categories of cross-border impacts, the scales and dynamics of impact transmission, the targets and dynamics of responses and the socio-economic and environmental context that also encompasses factors and processes unrelated to climate change. These insights can then provide a basis for identifying relevant causal relationships. We apply the framework to the floods that affected industrial production in Thailand in 2011, and to projected Arctic sea ice decline, and demonstrate that the framework can usefully capture the complex system dynamics of cross-border climate impacts. It also provides a useful mechanism to identify and understand adaptation strategies and their potential consequences in the wider context of resilience planning. The cross border dimensions of climate impacts could become increasingly important as climate changes intensify. We conclude that our framework will allow for these to be properly accounted for, help to identify new areas of empirical and model-based research and thereby support climate risk management.

Accurate climate change forecasts, therefore, depend on a reliable representation of mechanisms governing Arctic carbon cycle processes, but this task is complicated by the complex interaction of multiple controls on Arctic ecosystem changes, linked through both positive and negative feedbacks. As a primary example, predicted Arctic warming can be substantially influenced by shifts in hydrologic regimes, linked to, for example, altered precipitation patterns or changes in topography following permafrost degradation. This study presents observational evidence how severe drainage, a scenario that may affect large Arctic areas with ice-rich permafrost soils under future climate change, affects biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes within an Arctic floodplain. Our in situ data demonstrate reduced carbon losses and transfer of sensible heat to the atmosphere, and effects linked to drainage-induced long-term shifts in vegetation communities and soil thermal regimes largely counterbalanced the immediate drainage impact. Moreover, higher surface albedo in combination with low thermal conductivity cooled the permafrost soils. Accordingly, long-term drainage effects linked to warming-induced permafrost degradation hold the potential to alleviate positive feedbacks between permafrost carbon and Arctic warming, and to slow down permafrost degradation. Self-stabilizing effects associated with ecosystem disturbance such as these drainage impacts are a key factor for predicting future feedbacks between Arctic permafrost and climate change, and, thus, neglect of these mechanisms will exaggerate the impacts of Arctic change on future global climate projections.

Such conferences together with available project reports and empirical studies recommend project managers and practitioners to adopt smart technologies and develop robust measures to tackle climate risk exposure. Comparatively, artificial intelligence (AI) risk management tools are better to mitigate climate risk, but it has been inadequately explored in the PPP sector. Thus, this study aims to explore the tools and roles of AI in climate risk management of PPP infrastructure projects.Design/methodology/approach - Systematically, this study compiles and analyses 36 peer-reviewed journal articles sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed.Findings - The results demonstrate deep learning, building information modelling, robotic automations, remote sensors and fuzzy logic as major key AI-based risk models (tools) for PPP infrastructures. The roles of AI in climate risk management of PPPs include risk detection, analysis, controls and prediction.Research limitations/implications - For researchers, the findings provide relevant guide for further investigations into AI and climate risks within the PPP research domain.Practical implicationsThis article highlights the AI tools in mitigating climate crisis in PPP infrastructure management.Originality/value - This article provides strong arguments for the utilisation of AI in understanding and managing numerous challenges related to climate change in PPP infrastructure projects.

How resilient are waterways of the Asian Himalayas? Finding adaptive measures for future sustainability	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						adaptive capacity; Himalayas; resilient waterways; sustainability; thresholds of change	FRESH-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIME SHIFTS; ECOLOGICAL THRESHOLDS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FLOW REGULATION; COLORADO RIVER; EUTROPHIC LAKE; ENERGY NEXUS; MANAGEMENT	The high-mountain system, a storehouse of major waterways that support important ecosystem services to about 1.5 billion people in the Himalaya, is facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change during the 21st century. Intensified floods, accelerating glacial retreat, rapid permafrost degradation, and prolonged droughts are altering the natural hydrological balances and generating unpredictable spatial and temporal distributions of water availability. Anthropogenic activities are adding further pressure onto Himalayan waterways. The fundamental question of waterway management in this region is therefore how this hydro-meteorological transformation, caused by climate change and anthropogenic perturbations, can be tackled to find avenues for sustainability. This requires a framework that can diagnose threats at a range of spatial and temporal scales and provide recommendations for strong adaptive measures for sustainable future waterways. This focus paper assesses the current literature base to bring together our understanding of how recent climatic changes have threatened waterways in the Asian Himalayas, how society has been responding to rapidly changing waterway conditions, and what adaptive options are available for the region. The study finds that Himalayan waterways are crucial in protecting nature and society. The implementation of integrated waterways management measures, the rapid advancement of waterway infrastructure technologies, and the improved governance of waterways are more critical than ever.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Sustainable Engineering of Water	[Kattel, Giri R.] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Kattel, Giri R.; Wu, Wenyan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastructure, Parkville, Australia; [Kattel, Giri R.] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Paszkowski, Amelie] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Pokhrel, Yadu] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI USA; [Li, Dongfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Kent Ridge, Singapore, Singapore; [Li, Dongfeng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rao, Mukund P.

PMP and PMSA of various storm durations were simulated based on the moisture maximization of high efficiency storms. Also, P-100 and SWE100 data were calculated based on the frequency analysis of liquid precipitation and snowpack data during each 30-year period. The required meteorological variables, including liquid and solid precipitation, precipitable water content, and snow accumulation, defined over a 50 x 50 km grid, were extracted from an ensemble of six regional climate model simulations provided by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Projections indicated that while PMP and P-100 are intensifying in the future period, PMSA and SWE100 are declining. This is the first study which quantifies the impact of climate change on extreme-value characteristics of precipitation in Newfoundland. The results of the study can help stakeholders throughout the province to gain a better understanding of the impact of global warming on extreme meteorological events. Such an understanding is prerequisite to build resiliency and understand the uncertainty related to standard probable maximum flood analysis in the region.

In the current climate change context, understanding behavioural responses of marine species to such stressors is essential, especially for species of high ecological and economic interest such as bivalves, which can be quite useful for future management and conservation actions. In this study, a laboratory experiment using different salinity conditions was undertaken to assess potential behavioural responses of cockles (Cerastoderma edule), as a survival strategy facing low-salinity stress during riverine flood events. Results showed consistent patterns of burrowing/emergence of cockles facing salinity variation: with high salinities the individuals were observed buried in the sediment; when salinity decreased, organisms were observed to actively emerge, and when salinity was <10, cockles were found exposed at the sediment surface. These behavioural changes may be a strategy for the survival of this species in response to flooding: once at the sediment surface, hydrodynamics may transport organisms towards areas that are more suitable	[Verdelhos, Tiago; Verissimo, Helena; Marques, Joao Carlos] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Anastacio, Pedro] Univ Evora, Escola Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Paisagem Ambiente & Ordenamento, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Rua Romao Ramalho 59, P-7000671 Evora, Portugal	Universidade de Coimbra; University of Evora	Veríssimo, H (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal.	tverdelhos@uc.pt; helena.verissimo@uc.pt; jcmimar@ci.uc.pt; anast@uevora.pt	Anastácio, Pedro M./B-4716-2008; Verissimo, Helena/AAP-2199-2021	Anastácio, Pedro M./0000-0003-1808-3847; Verissimo, Helena/0000-0003-3971-8696; Verdelhos, Tiago/0000-0003-4713-3006	FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P.

The scientific community has been evidencing the concept of sustainable urban water management (SUWM) as a driver to foster the integration of the urban water cycle with its environmental, economic, and social sustainability dimensions. This article studies the approaches addressed by recent research on sustainable urban water management, focusing on the attention given by the scientific community to the way WSPs and city planners address the new challenges brought by climate change. A systematic review of existing literature shows how emergent challenges address the articulation between urban water cycle management and city planning. The results underline the need for the technical and economic evaluation of the overarching concept of SUWM systems, integrating values that go beyond financial issues; the need to address water scarcity not only from the supply side but also from the demand point of view; and the deepening of the relationship between new sources of water, such as the reuse, with the city planning in a context of climate change. Nevertheless, strategies for collaboration are still poorly addressed. The insights and gaps emerging from the analysis suggest new paths for research and practice in the field.

Considering issues related to climate change, floods can be expected to increase. Floods do not affect populations homogeneously, and communities with worse socioeconomic conditions tend to be impacted more heavily. In order to determine whether the number of floods increases the incidence of leptospirosis and its relationship to contextual variables, the study used socioeconomic, environmental, and disease occurrence data at the municipal (county) level. Municipalities suffering problems with sewage disposal showed a higher risk of leptospirosis incidence. Total flooding since the municipality's declaration of flood emergency was an important risk marker for leptospirosis incidence. Regression tree modeling proved useful for estimating leptospirosis incidence in Brazil.

The monthly normalized precipitation index (SPI) was used in this study to assess the impact of climate change for wet events and droughts from a meteorological perspective. The GR2M model was used to project changes in the streamflow of the Daule River. The climate projection was based on the four rigorously selected models to represent the climate of the study area. On average, an increase in temperature (~2 & DEG;C) and precipitation (~6%) is expected. A 7% increase in precipitation would result in a 10% increase in streamflow for flood periods, while an 8% decrease in precipitation could result in approximately a 60% reduction in flow for dry periods. The analysis of droughts shows that they will be more frequent and prolonged in the highlands (Andes) and the middle part of the basin. In the future, wet periods will be less frequent but of greater duration and intensity on the Ecuadorian coast. These results point to future problems such as water deficit in the dry season but also increased streamflow for floods during the wet season. This information should be taken into account in designing strategies for adaptation to climate change.

Assessing the long-term effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions under different climate change scenarios	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nature-Based Solutions; System dynamics; Participatory modelling; Droughts; Aquifer; Climate change	SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODEL; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT	Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been gaining importance in many European cities to reduce floods' impacts. However, evidence of their effectiveness in reducing the impacts of droughts in rural areas are scarce. Besides, ignoring future climate conditions or the specific socio-economic context in which NBS is applied could decrease their long-term effectiveness. This study aims to stress the importance of developing scientifically-based and customised information on climate change impacts as a precondition for designing and implementing NBS. For that, a System Dynamic model was developed to analyse and understand the dynamic behaviour of NBS responding to different scenarios of climate change and socio-economic contexts. This article recognises the proactive involvement at all societal levels as an essential component to enhance and maintain ecosystem resilience and, therefore, NBS(1)effectiveness. Thus, participatory modelling activities were carried out to engage stakeholders in the model development process to obtain relevant bottom-up information and organise stakeholders' collective knowledge in a graphical structure that captures the system's main dynamics. The Medina del Campo Groundwater Body was used as a frame for the analysis. The study results highlight the need for developing scientifically-based and customised information on the impacts of climate change on NBS as an essential precondition to maintain their long-term effectiveness.

These threats are especially acute for frontline communities. Addressing climate change and its unequal impacts requires psychologists to consider temporal and spatial dimensions of health, compound risks, as well as structural sources of vulnerability implicated by few other public health challenges. In this review, we consider climate change as a unique context for the study of health inequities and the roles of psychologists and health care practitioners in addressing it. We conclude by discussing the research infrastructure needed to broaden current understanding of these inequities, including new cross-disciplinary, institutional, and community partnerships, and offer six practical recommendations for advancing the psychological study of climate health equity and its societal relevance.

Here, we explored ways of communicating it, in the form of intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, using the nonstationary equidistant quantile matching (EQM(NS)) method. EQM(NS) was applied in two urbanized areas of Brazil: Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre. This research was conducted using recorded and modeled precipitation data, the latter using the Regional Climate Model Eta. Results indicated an increase in rainfall intensity for rare events, which were intensified under nonstationarity. The use of stationarity misrepresented the trends related to precipitation, being able to mask the direction of change in future conditions. Future IDFs with Eta's 3-hourly resolution appeared to be intensified when compared with those from daily resolution. The increase in rainfall intensity was more significant for short durations than for daily ones, bringing concerns about associated hazards and their impacts on society and urban infrastructure.

Source of data: The authors of the present study performed a non-systematic review of English, Spanish, and Portuguese articles published in the last five years in databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and SciELO. The terms used were air pollution OR climate changes OR smoke, AND children OR health. Synthesis of data: The increase in the prevalence of some diseases, such as allergic ones, is attributed to the interactions between genetic potential and the environment. However, disordered growth combined with inadequate waste management has caused problems for the planet, such as heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, increased storms and floods, interference in food crops and their nutritional values, changes in the infectious disease pattern, and air pollution resulting from the continuous use of fossil fuels. Children, beings still in the development stage with immature respiratory and immune systems, are the primary victims of the climate crisis. Conclusions: The authors documented that prenatal and postnatal exposure to ambient air pollutants will accelerate or worsen the morbidity and mortality of many health conditions, including allergic diseases. Ambient air pollutants change the microbiota, interfere with the immune response, and take direct action on the skin and respiratory epithelium, which facilitates the penetration of allergens. Understanding how the children and adolescent health and well-being are affected by climate change is an urgent matter. (C) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

In particular, its riverine-island (char) dwellers face continuous riverbank erosion, frequent flooding, and other adverse effects of climate change that increase their vulnerability. This paper aims to assess the livelihood vulnerability of riverine communities by applying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework and the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI). Results indicate substantial variation in the vulnerability of char dwellers based on mainland proximity. The main drivers of livelihood vulnerability are char-dweller adaptation strategies and access to food and health services. The study further reveals that riverbank erosion, frequent flood inundation, and lack of employment and access to basic public services are the major social and natural drivers of livelihood vulnerability. Char-based policy focusing on short- and long-term strategy is required to reduce livelihood vulnerability and enhance char-dweller resilience.

This study aims to develop a flood risk evaluation technique for agricultural basins by incorporating the low temporal resolution of climate change scenarios. The approach utilizes flood probability as a key component and incorporates the Multiplicative Random Cascade model as a probability-based rainfall time decomposition model to capture the inherent uncertainty in climate change data. Reliability analysis with the limit state equation is employed for probabilitybased risk evaluation. Given that agricultural watersheds typically consist of agricultural reservoirs and farmland, the study develops a hydraulic and hydrological linkage model to comprehensively calculate flood probability, simulating from the agricultural reservoir in the upper side to the farmland located at the bottom edge of the watershed. The flood risk assessment is applied to the Yedang Reservoir watershed in Korea, using the Shared Socio-economic Pathways climate change scenario. Results indicate that flood probability is the highest in river levees during future precipitation events, converging to nearly 100% under 24-hour duration rainfall, irrespective of the rain frequency. Despite the hydraulic structures at the farmland being designed for a lower frequency of rain events, the average probability of flooding in the farmland have reached 50%. The agricultural reservoir exhibits a low risk of flooding even under climate change conditions. The proposed method not only enables the establishment of flood countermeasures but also facilitates the evaluation and prediction of future flood risk for each hydraulic structure located in rural areas affected by climate change.

In recent decades, changes in the cryosphere have been well documented in many high-mountain regions. While there are some benefits from snow and ice loss, the negative impacts, including from glacier lake outburst floods and variations in glacier runoff, are generally considered to far outweigh the positive impacts, particularly if cultural impacts are considered. In international climate policy, there has been growing momentum to address the negative impacts of climate change, or Loss and Damage' (L&D) from climate change. It is not clear exactly what can and should be done to tackle L&D, but researchers and practitioners are beginning to engage with policy discussions and develop potential frameworks and supporting information. Despite the strong impact of climate change on the mountain cryosphere, there has been limited interaction between cryosphere researchers and L&D. Therefore, little work has been done to consider how L&D in the mountain cryosphere might be conceptualized, categorized, and assessed. Here, we make a first attempt to analyze L&D in the mountain cryosphere by conducting a systematic literature review to extract L&D impacts and examples from existing literature. We find that L&D is a global phenomenon in the mountain cryosphere and has been more frequently documented in the developing world, both in relation with slow and sudden onset processes. We develop a categorization of L&D, making distinctions between physical and societal impacts, primary and secondary impacts, and identifying seven types of L&D (including L&D to culture, livelihoods, revenue, natural resources, life, and security). We hope this conceptual approach will support future work to understand and address L&D in the mountain cryosphere.

J	Marsooli, R; Lin, N				Marsooli, Reza; Lin, Ning			Impacts of climate change on hurricane flood hazards in Jamaica Bay, New York	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Flood hazards; Hurricane; Climate change; Sea level rise; Jamaica Bay; New York	SEA-LEVEL RISE; 3RD-GENERATION WAVE MODEL; STORM-SURGE; EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONES; NORTHEAST COAST; REANALYSIS; INTENSITY; REGIONS; TIDES	Sea level rise (SLR) and tropical cyclone (TC) climatology change could impact future flood hazards in Jamaica Bay-an urbanized back-barrier bay in New York-yet their compound impacts are not well understood. This study estimates the compound effects of SLR and TC climatology change on flood hazards in Jamaica Bay from a historical period in the late twentieth century (1980-2000) to future periods in the mid- and late-twenty-first century (2030-2050 and 2080-2100, under RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration scenario). Flood return periods are estimated based on probabilistic projections of SLR and peak storm tides simulated by a hydrodynamic model for large numbers of synthetic TCs. We find a substantial increase in the future flood hazards, e.g., the historical 100-year flood level would become a 9- and 1-year flood level in the mid- and late-twenty-first century and the 500-year flood level would become a 143- and 4-year flood level. These increases are mainly induced by SLR. However, TC climatology change would considerably contribute to the future increase in low-probability, high-consequence flood levels (with a return period greater than 100 year), likely due to an increase in the probability of occurrence of slow-moving but intense TCs by the end of twenty-first century. We further conduct high-resolution coastal flood simulations for a series of SLR and TC scenarios. Due to the SLR projected with a 5% exceedance probability, 125- and 1300-year flood events in the late-twentieth century would become 74- and 515-year flood events, respectively, in the late-twenty-first century, and the spatial extent of flooding over coastal floodplains of Jamaica Bay would increase by nearly 10 and 4 times, respectively. In addition, SLR leads to larger surface waves induced by TCs in the bay, suggesting a potential increase in hazards associated with wave runup, erosion, and damage to coastal infrastructure.

In general, Char land (Riverine Island) communities are frequently affected by floods, riverbank erosion, and other climatic hazards, including drought, cyclones, tornadoes, salinity intrusion, water logging, cold waves, etc., which cause many to lose their sources of livelihoods and properties and make them more vulnerable. Using survey data of 262 rural households, this study investigates the extent of livelihood vulnerability to climate change and natural hazards in the Char land communities by applying the climate change vulnerability index (CVI) (i.e., UN-IPCC vulnerability framework) and the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) to develop context-specific interventions for building climate and livelihood resilience. The two approaches to vulnerability assessment were modified to incorporate local contexts and indigenous knowledge into 41 sub-components. The result shows that LVI and CVI values are different between Char land communities. The LVI index shows that households in Char Jotindro-Narayan (0.148) are more vulnerable than those in Char Kulaghat (0.139). The CVI values for Char Jotindro-Narayan (0.633) are slightly lower than for Char Kulaghat (0.639). The major vulnerability factors were access to food and water, social networks, natural disasters, and climatic variability. The study also indicates that flood, riverbank erosion, unemployment, and access to communication, market, and basic service opportunities are the major biophysical and socioeconomic factors determining livelihood vulnerability. Context-specific sustainable policies and development initiatives are required to improve the adaptive capacity of Char land communities across Bangladesh, thereby building their climate and livelihood resilience.

Yet, there are calls for examining relevant multiple natural hazards in still unstudied national contexts as Sweden. Moreover, multi-hazard concepts rarely consider climate change effects, despite the call of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to adopt multi-hazard approaches and the growing recognition that compound events should be considered "normal". Using a systematic literature study, the paper presents a national natural hazard interaction framework for Sweden identifying 39 cascading, 56 disposition alteration, 3 additional hazard potential, and 17 coincident triggering interactions between 20 natural hazards. Reviewed gray literature, an expert workshop, and reviewed climate research suggest increases of multiple natural hazards with heat wave and heavy rain as triggering or driving events and with hydrological hazards, for instance, fluvial floods, landslides, and debris flows, as the main consequences.

It is crucial to promote cooperation between the general public and the science community by sharing data, information, knowledge, experiences, and ideas. Japan has routinely been beset by catastrophic floods caused mainly by destructive typhoons and critically active seasonal fronts. With the turn of the 21st century, changes in climate and society required additional realignment into the standardized procedures that had evolved over the previous half-century. Japan's new policy, 'River Basin Disaster Resilience and Sustainability by All,' takes comprehensive measures, mainly consisting of flood prevention, exposure reduction, and appropriate evacuation, response and recovery, aiming to strengthen disaster resilience and achieve sustainability through concerted efforts among all stakeholders. The policy can play a key role in the achievement of the common global goal.

Climate services' role in safeguarding pastoral disaster communities	REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES			English	Article						Climate change; Climate services; Disaster communities; Meteorological information		Climate change due to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is one of the most pressing issues facing society on a global scale. The growth of GHG emissions between 2000 and 2010 was higher than in each of the previous three decades, and each of the past four decades has been successively warmer than any preceding decades since 1850. Continued GHG emissions will cause further warming and changes in the climate system. Climate change affects livestock production in multiple ways, both directly and indirectly. Many of the impacts on the livestock sector result from increasing frequency and magnitude of weather and climate extremes such as droughts, flash floods, untimely rains, frost, hail and severe storms. This article describes some of the most vulnerable disaster communities in Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and South America. It then describes the importance of meteorological information provided by national Meteorological and Hydrological Services to help Veterinary Services support sustainable management of livestock in vulnerable pastoral communities.

In this study, we aimed to assess the change in water balance change and hydrological extremes in the Prek Thnot River Basin of the Lower Mekong in Cambodia through a hydrological model (SWAT) under the two climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) following three different GCMs. An ensemble of 3 GCMs included GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC and IPSL-CM5A-MR models and was applied to a well-calibrated SWAT model through climate change factors. Annual precipitation under RCP2.6 likely decreases by 0.1-0.5% for the near future (2021-2040) and mid-future (2051-2070) and decreases by 0.2-1.3% under RCP8.5. The decrease in precipitation will lead to reductions in water yield by 1-4% (RCP2.6) and 2-5% (RCP8.5). However, peak flow is expected to increase, while the low flow was projected to decrease (1-2% for RCP2.6 and 8-9% for RCP8.5). The study further found that high flow events will increase in both magnitude and frequency. The finding highlights water resources management issues in the Prek Thnot River Basin, including the frequency of future flood events.

J	Wen, K; Gao, B; Li, ML				Wen, Ke; Gao, Bing; Li, Mingliang			Quantifying the Impact of Future Climate Change on Runoff in the Amur River Basin Using a Distributed Hydrological Model and CMIP6 GCM Projections	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; CMIP6; distributed hydrological model; runoff; the Amur River	BIAS CORRECTION; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE	The Amur River is one of the top ten longest rivers in the world, and its hydrological response to future climate change has been rarely investigated. In this study, the outputs of four GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were corrected and downscaled to drive a distributed hydrological model. Then, the spatial variations of runoff changes under the future climate conditions in the Amur River Basin were quantified. The results suggest that runoffs will tend to increase in the future period (2021-2070) compared with the baseline period (1961-2010), particularly in August and September. Differences were also found among different GCMs and scenarios. The ensemble mean of the GCMs suggests that the basin-averaged annual precipitation will increase by 14.6% and 15.2% under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. The increase in the annual runoff under the SSP2-4.5 scenario (22.5%) is projected to be larger than that under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (19.2%) at the lower reach of the main channel. Future climate changes also tend to enhance the flood peak and flood volume. The findings of this study bring new understandings of the hydrological response to future climate changes and are helpful for water resource management in Eurasia.

We demonstratethe feasibility of shallow geologic storage of carbon by a field experiment,and the injection process also raises the ground surface. The resultingCO(2) storage and ground uplift rates upscale to a techniquethat could contribute to the mitigation of climate change by storingcarbon as well as helping to adapt to flooding risks by elevatingthe ground surface above flood levels. A life-cycle assessment indicatesthat CO2 emissions caused by shallow geologic storage ofcarbon are a small fraction of the injected carbon. This project demonstrates that injectingsolid particlesof biomass can store carbon and raise the ground surface at ratesthat would reduce atmospheric CO2 and help adapt to floodingcaused by climate change.

This study identified the perceptions of climate change and health adaptation (CC&H) among relevant stakeholders, decision-makers, and policymakers (SDPs) in Burkina Faso (BF) by determining their perceptions of CC, of related health risks and vulnerabilities, and of CC impacts on agriculture and food security. We carried out 35 semi-structured, qualitative in-depth interviews with SDPs, representing national governmental institutions, international organizations, and civil society organizations. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis. SDPs shared similar perceptions of CC and concurred with three ideas (1) CC is a real and lived experience in BF; (2) the population is aware of climatic changes in their environment; (3) CC is intertwined with the agricultural and economic development of the country. SDPs identified biodiversity loss, floods, droughts, and extreme heat as posing the highest risk to health. They elaborated five exposure pathways that are and will be affected by CC: water quality and quantity, heat stress, food supply and safety, vector borne diseases, and air quality. In conclusion, SDPs in Burkina Faso are highly aware of CC hazards, relevant health exposure pathways, and their corresponding health outcomes. Mental health and the interplay between social factors and complex health risks constitute perception gaps. SDPs perceived CC&H risks and vulnerabilities align with current evidence.

The main objective was to study the farmers' concept of climate change issues and their responses in respect to cropping systems and nutrition. This study is crucial for comparing the existing situation and taking future decisions. The feasibility and strategic direction of the present haor agriculture were evaluated using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and matrices. The results showed that the farmers' understanding of climate change was much lower than expected; a maximum of 73.2% farmers pointed out that climate change means frequent flooding, and more than 90% of farmers opined that temperature, early flooding, and lightning have increased over time. They strongly agreed that boro (dry-season-irrigated) rice is affected more frequently by natural hazards than in previous times. Very few farmers (only 14.4%) have taken adaptation strategies, which are less climate-smart and nutrition-sensitive. Only 10.8% of farmers cultivated oilseeds, pulses, and vegetables other than boro rice. A lack of technological knowledge is the main obstacle to practicing climate-resilient, modern cultivation practices. The trends of cultivation and consumption of vegetables by haor farmers are very low, whereas they are agreeable to cultivating nutrition-sensitive and high-value crops if they have technical support. The major strengths of haor agriculture are fertile soil and rice surplus, whereas weaknesses are monocropping and malnutrition.	[Islam, Md.

Fluvial flood losses are expected to increase in the future, driven by population and economic growth in flood-prone areas, and exacerbated in many regions by effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle. Yet, studies assessing direct and indirect economic impacts of fluvial flooding in combination with climate change and socio-economic projections at a country level are rare. This study presents an integrated flood risk analysis framework to calculate total (direct and indirect) economic damages, with and without socio-economic development, under a range of warming levels from < 1.5 to 4 degrees C in Brazil, China, India, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Ghana. Direct damages are estimated by linking spatially explicit daily flood hazard data from the Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) model with country- and sectorspecific depth-damage functions. These values input into an economic Input-Output model for the estimation of indirect losses. The study highlights that total fluvial flood losses are largest in China and India when expressed in absolute terms. When expressed as a share of national GDP, Egypt faces the largest total losses under both the climate change and climate change plus socio-economic development experiments. The magnitude of indirect losses also increased significantly when socio-economic development was modelled. The study highlights the importance of including socio-economic development when estimating direct and indirect flood losses, as well as the role of recovery dynamics, essential to provide a more comprehensive picture of potential losses that will be important for decision makers.

Local-scale impacts of climate change may have positive effects by restoring natural riverine habitat and reducing invasive fish density	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						hydrological change; invasive species impact; native species assemblage; river revitalisation; round goby	GOBY NEOGOBIUS-MELANOSTOMUS; FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; ROUND GOBY; PROTERORHINUS-SEMILUNARIS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; MOTTLED SCULPIN; DANUBE; GOBIES; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES	Global biodiversity is increasingly threatened by habitat loss, climate change, and biological invasion. However, predictions of impacts on native fauna are hampered by an inadequate knowledge of how these factors interact and how climate change will affect the distribution, abundance, and behaviour of both native and invasive species, not least as most predictions are based on the long-term effects of temperature alone. Here, we present a case study illustrating how local-scale climate change impacts (increased temperature, reduced rainfall, shifts in peak rainfall) affected the hydrology of a channelised lowland European river (reduced flow, reduction in flood events, increased siltation, macrophyte growth), allowing native fish species to recolonise the bankside zone and reducing the density of invasive round gobyNeogobius melanostomusby removing its preferred habitat. While most studies predict long-term negative impacts on global fish populations, some suggest potential direct and indirect benefits at a local scale. We are of the opinion that, at a local scale, climate change impacts on fish will be more nuanced and complex than long-term predictions suggest, resulting in both positive and negative effects, withconsolation prizesin the face of larger losses. While impacts on fish will differ between regions and/or continents, depending on the specific impacts of climate change, identification of positive effects will be essential in clarifying long-range forecasts and identifying management procedures for mitigating overall negative impacts.

In the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, disrupted water flows driven by climate change and hydropower development have caused water scarcity, threatening agricultural systems in both upstream and coastal areas. Based on insights from desk reviews, stakeholder workshops and interviews with local informants, this paper argues that while grey (engineered) solutions take precedence in addressing water scarcity, securing water sustainability (water retention) for agricultural resilience demands integrated 'grey-green' (engineered-nature-based) solutions. This paper suggests demands for translating this approach into the water governance framework for the delta's agricultural development.

Climate change, population growth, and urbanization have only exacerbated this crisis. For the Caribbean, climate change through the impact of increasing temperatures and rainfall variability has resulted in more frequent and intense episodes of disasters including droughts and floods which have impaired the quantity and quality of freshwater supplies. Using Caribbean-specific climate forecasting, it is shown that rainfall totals in Kingston, Jamaica, are expected to reduce by 2030 and 2050 under two RCPs. In addition, the timing of the primary rainy season is expected to shift, potentially impacting water supply security. Analysis of the potential of rainwater harvesting (RWH) to augment supply and enhance water supply resilience shows that in two communities studied in Kingston, it can contribute up to 7% of total water supply. Household storage requirements are about 1 m(3) per household, which is feasible. RWH offers the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation measures at a household level. Policy, incentives, and increased awareness about the potential of RWH to meet non-potable household demand in Kingston must be improved, as well as efforts to reduce the currently unreasonably high levels of non-revenue water in order to move towards an integrated, sustainable, and climate-resilient urban water supply strategy for the city.

It is crucial to investigate the possible threats of climate change and understand their impact on river watersheds. In this research, climate change's impact on the mountainous watershed of the Jajrood River, upstream of Latyan Dam in Iran, was assessed by using a multivariate recursive quantile-matching nesting bias correction (MRQNBC) and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). Also, this study considered ten global circulation models (GCMs) from the coupled model intercomparison project phase VI (CMIP6). With a higher correlation coefficient, the MIROC6 model was selected among other models. For the future period of 2031-2060, the large-scale outputs of the MIROC6 model, corresponding to the observational data were extracted under four common socioeconomic path scenarios (SSPs 1-2.6, 2-4.5, 3-7.0, 5-8.5). The bias was corrected and downscaled by the MRQNBC method. The downscale outputs were given to the hydrological model to predict future flow. The results show that, in the period 2031-2060, the flow will be increased significantly compared to the base period (2005-2019). This increase can be seen in all scenarios. In general, changes in future flow are caused by an increase in precipitation intensity, as a result of an increase in temperature. The findings indicate that, although the results show an increase in the risk of flooding, considering the combined effects of three components, i.e., increased precipitation concentration, temperature, and reduced precipitation, climate change is intensifying the problem of water scarcity.

Perturbations in global climate models have created the need to concentrate consequent changes in hydro climatic factors to comprehend the regional and territorial impacts of climate and environmental changes. Syria, as a Middle East country, is exposed to extreme climate events such as drought and flood. The aim of this study is to analyze rainfall trends in Syria in response to the likely climate change. The analysis was conducted for rainfall data collected from 71 stations distributed all over the country for the period (1991-2009). The trend analysis was performed in monthly and seasonal scales using Mann-Kendall non-parametric statistical tests. The results attained from Mann-Kendall trend analysis revealed decreasing trends at most of the stations. Additionally, rainfall analysis was conducted for the stations with significant trends for wet and dry periods, which also revealed decreasing trends at almost all the stations. From the analysis of the results, it is obvious that slight increasing trends in rainfall in Syria occurred in the fall period. However, in the winter and spring periods, significant decreasing trends have been observed at almost all the stations. This reveals that the country will suffer from shortage of water, because most rainfall occurs in the winter and spring, infrequently in fall and rarely in summer. The results are consistent with the IPCC's fifth report that predicted a decrease in rainfall in the Mediterranean and southern Asia. The results of this paper could help the management of water resources in Syria considering future climate changes.

Effects of future climate change on the geographical distribution of a bird endemic to South America floodplains	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cercomacra melanaria; Mato Grosso Antbird; niche modeling; Pantanal; Thamnophilidae; wetland	ANTBIRD CERCOMACRA-MELANARIA; ELEVATIONAL RANGE SHIFTS; EXTINCTION RISK; CONSERVATION; SELECTION; AREA; BIODIVERSITY; ENSEMBLES; AVIFAUNA; WETLANDS	Future climate change poses an immediate threat to biodiversity. Species are shifting their geographic distribution in direct response to climate change. Species around the globe are expected to redistribute poleward and/or to high elevations. However, in the Neotropical region, the effects of climate change on species distribution are still unclear. Here, we aimed to infer the current and future geographical distribution of an insectivorous bird species endemic to South American floodplains, the Mato Grosso Antbird (Cercomacra melanaria). We also estimated shifts in the variables of elevation, longitude, latitude, and slope based on forecasting. Current and future distribution in different climate scenarios were predicted using ecological niche modeling (ENM). A non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post hoc test were carried out to determine if dependent variables (elevation, slope, latitude, and longitude) differed between climate scenarios. Our findings suggest that future climate change will have negative effects (range contraction) on the distribution of the Mato Grosso Antbird. The decrease in the species' geographical range will cause it to shift to higher elevations, latitudes, longitudes, and slopes. The species should tend to disperse toward more suitable areas located in highlands close to wetlands, such as the headwaters of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPB), and toward the Andean highlands. However, this species inhabits strictly forested environments covering a small home range and its mobility capacity is limited. It is possible that the species will not be able to achieve future geographical redistribution, thus increasing its risk of extinction.

Evidence from China	GROWTH AND CHANGE			English	Article							DRINKING-WATER TURBIDITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VIRUS TRANSMISSION; HUMAN HEALTH; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY; DROUGHT; HUMIDITY; LEVEL; FLOOD	Research at the biophysical level constitutes the main approach to study the path through which climate influences infectious diseases, but the influence of socioeconomic factors on climate change and the spread of infectious diseases also cannot be ignored. In the current context, with its emphasis on carbon emission reduction, countries have begun to adopt "total control and trading" methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This paper is based on the monthly relevant data of various provinces and cities from 2015 to 2019, adds the moderating variable of "carbon emission trading volume" based on current research results, establishes a static model of unbalanced panel fixed effects and a dynamic panel model, and deeply analyzes the impact of climate change on infectious disease popularity and the moderating effect of the carbon trading market. The study found that climate warming, frequent precipitation, and shortened sunshine duration will lead to an increase in the number of infectious disease cases and that the "carbon emission trading volume" variable plays a negative role in the positive correlation between climate change (temperature/precipitation) and the number of infectious disease cases. There are seasonal differences, and the moderating effect in summer/autumn is more obvious than that in winter/spring.

J	Di Sante, F; Coppola, E; Giorgi, F				Di Sante, Fabio; Coppola, Erika; Giorgi, Filippo			Projections of river floods in Europe using EURO-CORDEX, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; EURO&#8208; CORDEX; floods; runoff		A large ensemble of hydroclimatic simulations is used to simulate the occurrence of river floods over Europe in a climate change context. A river routing model derived from a distributed hydrological model (CHyM) is forced with 44 EURO-CORDEX, 13 CMIP5 and 7 CMIP6 simulations to assess the effects of climate change on the flood magnitude under two different scenarios. The impact of climate change is evaluated using a 100-year return period discharge indicator (Q100). Results show a decrease in magnitude of Q100 flood events over the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and north eastern Europe. This latter signal appears particularly robust and in contrast to the projected mean flow signal, which is shown to increase by the end of the century in response to increased mean precipitation. The reduction of snow accumulation during winter induced by a large increase of late winter temperatures is the main reason behind the decrease of floods over the North Eastern regions. An opposite signal is projected over Great Britain, Ireland, Northern Italy and Western Europe, where a robust signal of flood magnitude increase is evident, being driven by an increase of extreme precipitation events. All these simulations are intended for use in impact assessment studies towards the development of suitable response options.

This paper assesses how climate change will alter high streamflow events by changing both the prevalence of different driving mechanisms (i.e. 'flood generating processes') and the magnitude of differently generated floods. We present an analysis of simulated changes in high streamflow events in selected basins in the hydroclimatically diverse Pacific Northwestern United States, classifying the events according to their mechanism. We then compare how the different classes of events respond to changes in climate at the annual scale. In a warmer future, high flow events will be caused less frequently by snowmelt and more frequently by precipitation events. Also, precipitation-driven high flow events are more sensitive to increases in precipitation than are snowmelt-driven high flow events, so the combination of the increase in both frequency and magnitude of precipitation-driven high flow events leads to higher flood likelihood than under each change alone. Our comparison of the results from two emissions pathways shows that a reduction in global emissions will limit the increase in magnitude and prevalence of these precipitation-driven events.

Climate change, policy responses, and redistributed forests in the twenty-first century	AMBIO			English	Review						Forest gains; Forest transitions; Latecomer effects; Tree plantations	EASTERN-EUROPE; LAND; REFORESTATION; CARBON; DEFORESTATION; DYNAMICS; DRIVERS; VIETNAM; CRISIS; TREES	Forest transitions occur when net reforestation replaces net deforestation in places. Because forest transitions can increase biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover. These historical shifts in forest transitions reflect our growing appreciation of their utility for countering droughts, floods, land degradation, and climate change.

This article presents findings from a National Geographic Society funded project, which employed a people-centered, narratives-based approach to study climate impacts and adaptation strategies of people in 19 rural study sites in four provinces of Pakistan (N = 108). The study looked at six climate-related stressors-changes in weather patterns, floods, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, drought, heat waves, and sea-level rise-in the coastal areas of Sindh, the desert of Thar, the plains of Punjab, and the mountains of Hunza, Gilgit, and Chitral. Speaking to people at these frontlines of climate change revealed much about climate suffering and trauma. Not only is the suffering induced by losses and damages to property and livelihood, but climate impacts also take a heavy toll on people's psycho-social wellbeing, particularly when they are displaced from their homes. The findings further demonstrate that people try to adapt in various ways, for instance by altering their agricultural practices, but they face severe barriers to effective adaptation action. Understanding people's perceptions of climate change and incorporating their recommendations in adaptation planning can help policy-makers develop a more participatory, inclusive, and holistic climate resilience framework for the future.

Projected changes in annual maximum discharge for Iowa communities	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Flood peaks; Climate change; Hydrologic modeling; HLM; Iowa	21ST-CENTURY CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGIC EXTREMES; MIDWEST; MODEL; STREAMFLOW; FREQUENCY; REGION; SOIL	Understanding the projected changes in annual maximum peak discharge is important to improve resiliency in water resource planning and design at the community level. Currently, much of the literature on climate change impacts focuses on analyses at the regional scale. In this study we use a hydrologic model to evaluate the projected changes in annual maximum peak discharge at the community-level across Iowa under two emission scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We utilize climate forcings from global climate models part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projected Phase 5 (CMIP5) from 1950 to 2100. Our simulations show a detectable increase in annual maximum discharge for 27% of Iowa's communities under RCP8.5. However, under RCP4.5 none of the communities are projected to face an increase in annual maximum discharge by the end of the 21st century; furthermore, precipitation intensity under this scenario is not projected to increase in the latter half of the 21st century. Our results point to a larger increase in precipitation intensity and annual maximum discharge under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5, especially in the second half of this century. The projected flood peak distributions tend to become statistically different from the historical ones later in the 21st century under RCP8.5 than under RCP4.5. This study provides a basis for analyzing climate change impacts at a local decision-making scale.

The increasing severity of consequent floods has major socio-economic impacts, especially in urban environments. Urban flood modelling supports the assessment of these impacts, both in current climate conditions and for forecasted climate change scenarios. Over the past decade, model frameworks that allow flood modelling in real-time have been gaining widespread popularity. Flood4castRTF is a novel urban flood model that applies a grid-based approach at a modelling scale coarser than most recent detailed physically based models. Automatic model set-up based on commonly available GIS data facilitates quick model building in contrast with detailed physically based models. The coarser grid scale applied in Flood4castRTF pursues a better agreement with the resolution of the forcing rainfall data and allows speeding up of the calculations. The modelling approach conceptualises cell-to-cell interactions while at the same time maintaining relevant and interpretable physical descriptions of flow drivers and resistances. A case study comparison of Flood4castRTF results with flood results from two detailed models shows that detailed models do not necessarily outperform the accuracy of Flood4castRTF with flooded areas in-between the two detailed models. A successful model application for a high climate change scenario is demonstrated. The reduced data need, consisting mainly of widely available data, makes the presented modelling approach applicable in data scarce regions with no terrain inventories. Moreover, the method is cost effective for applications which do not require detailed physically based modelling.

The changes in temperature, precipitation, glaciers, and glacial lakes over Nepal are comprehensively reviewed based on published literature and compared with regional studies. Furthermore, the published glacier datasets were used to calculate and analyze the changes in area, equilibrium line of altitude (ELA) and ice reserves to show the response of glaciers to climate change. We find that the warming trend (0.02 to 0.16 degrees C yr-1) is being more pronounced over Nepal, and heterogeneous changes in precipitation amount, pattern, and frequency are observed with no significant trend. Concurrently, the glaciers are found to be responding with heterogeneous shrinkage in area (- 1 to - 5 km(2) yr(-1)), possessing negative mass balance (- 0.3 to - 0.8 m w.e. yr(-1)), decrease in ice volume (- 4.29 km(3) yr(-1)) and upward shift of the ELA (similar to 20.66 m decade(-1)). The total decrease in ice reserve (- 128.84 km(3)) of Nepal has resulted in similar to 0.32 mm of sea level rise in past 30 years. Moreover, the formation and surface area expansion (0.83 % yr(-1)) of glacial lakes over Nepal have been accelerated. Additionally, we note that Nepal is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) events and document a total of 45 reliable reported and unreported historical GLOF events from 39 glacial lakes across Nepal. This review will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the current state of climate change and the identification of existing knowledge gaps in Nepal.

By regressing local variations in climate onto annual Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST), we track the emergence of an anthropogenic signal in long-term quality assured observations of temperature and precipitation for the island of Ireland, a sentinel location on the western European Atlantic seaboard. Analysis of station based observations, together with island scale composite series is under-taken for annual and seasonal means, together with 16 indices of extremes, with the derived signal-to-noise ratio classified as normal, unusual or unfamiliar relative to early industrial climate. More than half of indices show the emergence of at least unusual conditions relative to early industrial climate. The increase in annual mean temperature has led to the emergence of unfamiliar climate at six of eleven stations. Warming at the island scale is estimated at 0.88 degrees C per degree warming in GMST. While many stations show the emergence of unusual climate for spring, summer and autumn mean temperature, no forced signal of change is found for winter mean temperature. Changes in cool/warm days and nights are unfamiliar relative to early industrial climate. However, no anthropogenic signal is found for the hottest day annually or in summer - an extreme often associated with climate change in public consciousness. Increases in annual precipitation totals have emerged as unusual for western stations with large increases in winter totals per degree warming in GMST (e.g., 25.2% and 19.7% at Malin Head and Markree, respectively), indicating heightened flood risk with continued warming. By contrast, summer precipitation shows no significant relationship with GMST. Increases in rainfall intensity have emerged as unusual for 30% of stations, with increases consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Our analysis shows that an emerging climate change signal is discernible for Ireland, a location strongly influenced by climate variability.

Impacts of Hydrological Changes on Annual Runoff Distribution in Seasonally Dry Basins	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Annual runoff distribution; Budyko's curve; Climate change; Land use change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; FLOOD-FREQUENCY; WATER; URBANIZATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; ATTRIBUTION; BALANCE	Runoff is expected to change due to climate and land use change. Because it constitutes a large component of the terrestrial water budget, we need to develop new policies for managing regional water resources. To do so, we must first attribute changes in the natural flow regime to either climate or land use change. In this context, the Budyko's curve has previously been adopted to separate the impacts of climate and land use change on runoff by using long term hydrological variables. In this study, a framework based on Fu's equation (which describes Budyko's curve) is used to separate the impacts of climate and land use change on annual runoff distributions. Specifically, this framework is based on a recently developed method to obtain annual runoff probability density function (pdf) in seasonally dry basinssuch as those in Mediterranean regionsfrom climate statistics and Fu's equation parameter . The effect of climate change is captured through variations in the first order statistics of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, while land use change is represented by changes in Fu's equation parameter . The effects of these two drivers (i.e., climate and land use change) are analyzed by reconstructing the annual runoff pdfs for the current period and for likely future scenarios, based on predictions from global circulation models and urbanization trajectories. The results show that climate change can lead to a strong reduction in mean annual runoff, a shift of the runoff pdf toward lower values, and a decrease in its variance. Concurrent changes in climate and land use almost always result in a reduction in the mean annual runoff, due to the greater impact of climate change on the runoff pdf.

J	Chen, XL; Zhang, H; Chen, WJ; Huang, GR				Chen, Xiaoli; Zhang, Han; Chen, Wenjie; Huang, Guoru			Urbanization and climate change impacts on future flood risk in the Pearl River Delta under shared socioeconomic pathways	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flood risk; Climate change; Urbanization; SSP scenarios; Set pair analyze; Pearl River Delta	MODEL; BASIN; SIMULATION; PREDICTION; DECISION; SYSTEM; FORMULATION; EXTREMES; AHP	Climate change and urbanization are converging to challenge the flood control in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) due to their adverse impacts on precipitation extremes and the urban areas environment. Previous studies have investigated temporal changes in flood risk with various single factor, few have considered the joint effects of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Here, based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of future (2030-2050) flood risk over the PRD combined with a thorough investigation of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Precipitation extremes were projected using the regional climate model RegCM4.6, and urbanization growth was projected based on the CA-Markov model. The economic and population development was estimated by the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Flood risk mapping with different RCPs-urbanization-SSPs scenarios was developed for the PRD based on the set pair analyze theory. The results show that climate change and urbanization are expected to exacerbate flood risk inmost parts of the PRD during the next few decades, concurrently with more intense extreme precipitation events. The high flood risk areas are projected mainly in the urban regions with unfavorable terrain and dense population. The highest flood risk areas are expected to increase by 8.72% and 19.80% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions may effectively mitigate the flood risk over the PRD. This study highlight the links between flood risk and changing environment, suggesting that flood risk management and preventative actions should be included in regional adaptation strategies.

In this context cities play a key role. If, on the one hand, cities cause climate change, on the other hand, they are the places where climate change impacts are most evident, as it deeply affects the quality of life of its inhabitants. Climate change impacts are particularly relevant for coastal areas. These are characterized by a higher concentration of buildings and people in comparison to inland areas. In particular, one of the forecasted effects of climate change in these areas is the increase in coastal flooding due to rising sea levels and storm surges. The implementation of strategies and actions for the adaptation of urban areas to the impacts of coastal flooding is essential to ensure the liveability of coastal communities. Urban planning plays a key role in cities' adaptation. However, even though the interest in this topic has been increasing, operative support and tools for planning urban adaptation in cities are in short supply, especially in coastal cities. In light of this, it has become necessary to focus on the definition of new tools responding to the needs of urban planning. Based on these observations, this paper, starting from the existing literature on coastal vulnerability indices, has developed a new index: the Coastal Resilience Index (CoRI). Thanks to the CoRI and to the use of technological innovations applied to urban planning (in particular, Geographic Information Systems), a decision support tool has been developed to identify adaptation measures aiming to reduce the impacts of coastal flooding, caused by rising sea levels and storm surges.

This study systematically evaluates the impact of climate change on reservoir inflow, hydropower output, sustainability, and efficiency under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) by taking the Pearl River basin in China as the case. The variable infiltration capacity model is coupled with global climate models to project future hydropower changes. It is shown that future reservoir inflow and hydropower output significantly differ from the historical ones. Dry years in future are projected to become drier leading to decrease in hydropower output that in turn reduces hydropower reliability and resiliency and increases the vulnerability. Wet years would get wetter, but the hydropower output does not necessarily increase possibly due to more surplus water released from reservoirs during flood seasons. For normal years, neither of reservoir inflow and hydropower output displays obvious changes. Moreover, water use efficiency of the West River in wet years and that of the North River in wet, normal and dry years would be lower in future, while the East River during non-flood seasons in dry years is expected to have higher water use efficiency. Our study can potentially provide an insight into the response of hydropower to climate change and help policy-makers and stakeholders manage future hydropower generation.

Climate change impacts on human health at an actionable scale: a state-level assessment of Indiana, USA	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Human health; Ozone	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; CULEX-QUINQUEFASCIATUS; AEDES-ALBOPICTUS; AIR-POLLUTION; UNITED-STATES; TEMPERATURE; DIPTERA; HEAT; SUSCEPTIBILITY; SCENARIOS	Climate change is already being felt on local levels, with historical records from the State of Indiana (USA) revealing warmer winters and more extreme precipitation events. To refine our understanding of climate change impacts on human health, we conducted a state-level assessment of future climate change impacts on human health using outputs from advanced climate model projections for this century. Future projections show a steep increase in extreme heat events, leading to greater potential vulnerability to heat disasters for Indiana communities. Additionally, a 2- to 4-fold increase in days with "uncomfortable night" conditions by the end of the century will strongly impact the cardiopulmonary health of more vulnerable populations (i.e., elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, children, and those with inadequate access to cooling). Continued trends for warmer winters and more flooding suggest a much greater risk for the expansion and virulence of a number of vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, West Nile Virus, and "tropical" diseases for which the mosquito vectors will thrive. Higher temperatures will also drive more frequent and severe harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs, with implications for human and animal health. Food systems will also be impacted, particularly with increased risk of contamination by bacteria and mycotoxins due to elevated heat and humidity.	[Filippelli, G.

Since 2016, RESCCUE has been developing methodologies and tools to support cities increase their resilience. The three RESCCUE cities, Barcelona, Bristol, and Lisbon, have become a testing platform for the cutting-edge technologies developed in RESCCUE but these are also ready to be deployed to different types of cities, with different climate change pressures. This paper presents some of the main outputs generated by RESCCUE. From climate change scenarios to dissemination tools, and from sectorial models to Resilience Action Plans (RAPs), the outputs that have been produced are very diverse, but special focus is put on the urban water cycle and urban floods. All the project results have a common goal: to increase the resilience of cities from around the world, by offering the methodologies and tools so anyone can take advantage of using them and replicate the RESCCUE results.

A multiplicity of climate hazards will be involved, triggering cumulative and interactive impacts on a variety of natural and human systems. An improved understanding of risk interactions and dynamics is required to support decision makers in their ability to better manage current and future climate change risks. To face this issue, the research community has been starting to test new methodological approaches and tools, including the application of Machine Learning (ML) leveraging the potential of the large availability and variety of spatio-temporal big data for environmental applications. Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000-2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network. These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications.

Within this region, recent studies have focused particularly on marine or lacustrine archives. Studies on fluvial archives are thus important for improving our understanding of palaeoenvironmental responses to Holocene climatic changes at regional and supraregional scales. Here, we studied alluvial archives from two basins 300 km apart in the mid-Moulouya basin and High Plateaus region located in the rarely studied NW African highlands, which are currently defined by arid and cold climatic conditions. Strong similarities between these deposits in terms of morpho-pedosedimentary and chronostratigraphical evolution demonstrate a regional morphogenic pattern controlled by Holocene climatic changes. Using a multi-proxy approach, we document rapid palaeoenvironmental changes and orbital-scale morphogenic changes. Four particular phases of regional geomorphic stability have been dated to ca. 10800-10500, 10200-9900, 9300, and 8900 cal. BP. Enhanced flooding periods that reflect times of climatic aridification may correlate with Early and Mid-Holocene Rapid Climatic Changes, especially during the 9.2 ka event. Furthermore, the Moulouya alluvial archives record the development of an extensive wetland formation and tufa sedimentation within the alluvial plains between ca. 10.8 to 6-5 cal ka BP. This formation is recognised at a regional scale across the upper and mid-Moulouya catchments, whereas it is missing from other Moroccan fluvial archives. These lasting humid climatic conditions (ca. 10.8-6/5 ka cal. BP.) are consistent with those recorded in the sub-Saharan records during the last African Humid Period (AHP), and suggest a potential linkage between the NW African highlands and the Saharan domain. Hence, we assume that this fluvio-palustrine wetland formation located at 32 degrees-34 degrees N is consistent with the northern archives recording AHP wet conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jansson, R; Ström, L; Nilsson, C				Jansson, Roland; Strom, Lotta; Nilsson, Christer			Smaller future floods imply less habitat for riparian plants along a boreal river	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change; flooding; inundation; niche width; riverbanks; river; water table	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIES RICHNESS; MARGIN VEGETATION; HYDROLOGICAL CHANGE; FLOW REGULATION; RESPONSES; WATER; RESTORATION; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT	Climate-change projections suggest large changes in riverine flow regime, which will likely alter riparian communities. In northern Europe, forecasts propose lower annual spring flood peaks and higher winter flows, resulting in narrower riparian zones. To estimate the impact of climate change on habitat extent of riparian plants, we developed a framework estimating the sensitivity and exposure of individual species to streamflow change, and surveyed five reaches along the free-flowing Vindel River in northern Sweden. We modeled the hydrologic niche of riparian plant species based on the probability of occurrence along gradients of flood frequency and duration and used predicted future water-level fluctuations (based on climate models and IPCC emission scenarios) to calculate changes in flow-related habitat availability of individual species. Despite projected increases in runoff, we predict most species to decrease in riparian elevational extent by on average 12-29% until the end of the century, depending on scenario. Species growing in the upper, spring-flood-controlled part of the riparian zone will likely lose most habitat, with the largest reductions in species with narrow ranges of inundation duration tolerance (decreases of up to 54%). In contrast, the elevational extent of most amphibious species is predicted to increase, but conditions creating isoetid vegetation will become rarer or disappear: isoetid vegetation is presently found in areas where ice formed in the fall settles on the riverbank during the winter as water levels subside. Higher winter flows will make these conditions rare. We argue that our framework is useful to project the effects of hydrologic change caused by climate change as well as other stressors such as flow regulation also in other regions. With few rivers remaining unaffected by dams and other human stressors, these results call for monitoring to detect species declines. Management to alleviate species losses might include mitigation of habitat degradation from land-use activities, more environmentally friendly flow schemes, and more intensive management options such as mowing riparian meadows no longer regularly maintained by recurrent floods.

Sea level rise due to climate change increases the occurrence of coastal flood events, creating more challenges to coastal societies. Here we intend to draw the understanding of coastal inundation from our early studies, and provide a silhouette of our approaches in assessing climate change impacts as well as developing risk-based climate adaptation. As a result, we impart a distinctive view of the adaption towards the integration of asset design, coastal planning and policy development, which reflect multiscale approaches crossing individual systems to regions and then nation. Having the approaches, we also discussed the constraints that would be faced in adaptation implementation. In this regard, we initially follow the risk approach by illustrating hazards, exposure and vulnerability in relation to coastal inundation, and manifest the impact and risk assessment by considering an urban environment pertinent to built, natural, and socioeconomic systems. We then extend the scope and recommend the general approaches in developing adaptation to coastal inundation under climate change towards ameliorating overall risks, practically, by the reduction in exposure and vulnerability in virtue of the integration of design, planning and polices. In more details, a resilience design is introduced, to effectively enhance the capacity of built assets to resist coastal inundation impact. We then emphasize on the cost-effective adaptation for coastal planning, which delineates the problem of under-adaptation that leaves some potential benefits unrealized or over-adaptation that potentially consumes an excessive amount of resources. Finally, we specifically explore the issues in planning and policies in mitigating climate change risks, and put forward some emerging constraints in adaptation implementation. It suggests further requirements of harmonizing while transforming national policies into the contents aligned with provincial and local governments, communities, and households.

EARTH INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Ecology; Climate change; Climate prediction; Climate models; Hydrologic models	NORTH-AMERICAN CLIMATE; WATER TEMPERATURE; HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS; MUSSELS IMPLICATIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY	Riverine ecosystems are dependent in large part on the climate of the region, and climate change is expected to alter climatic factors of interest, such as precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration. In central Texas, precipitation is expected to decrease while temperature increases as the climate changes. Drought and flooding events are also expected to increase in the region, which will also affect streamflow and stream temperature in riverine ecosystems. Numerous studies have assessed the potential impacts of climate change on riverine species. This study examines the pro-jected climate changes, determines potential changes in streamflow and stream temperature for river basins in central Texas, and assesses the appropriate uses of climate projections for riverine species impact assessments, using the Texas fatmucket (Lampsilis bracteata) as a case study. Previously established regression methods were used to produce projec-tions of streamflow and stream temperature. This study finds that streamflow is projected to decrease and stream tempera-ture is projected to increase. Using thermal tolerance thresholds previously determined for the Lampsilis bracteata, this study also finds that the lethal temperature events for the Lampsilis bracteata will increase. This study makes several recommendations on the use of downscaled climate projections for impact assessments for riverine species such as the Lampsilis bracteata.

Indeed, climate change has been causing an increase in the frequency and the intensity of various natural events such as floods and sea storms; anthropogenic pressures have caused an increase in impermeable surfaces with negative consequences on the vulnerability of territories under the action of natural events. In this paper, we analyze the effects of climate change in terms of possible increases in floodable areas and in terms of population, infrastructure, coastal dunes, and sites of social, economic, and strategic interest exposed along the coasts of the region of Calabria in southern Italy. Calabria was chosen as a case study due to its geomorphological peculiarities and its considerable anthropogenic pressures. These peculiarities cause significant variability of weather and sea conditions among the different coastal areas, which influences the coastal dynamics and the characteristics of meteorological events. The main results show that, in the analyzed areas, the floodable areas double between current and future scenarios, involving both significant percentages of the population and railways, highways, industrial areas, and coastal dunes.

This paper describes the potential impact of climate change on an urban river catchment using a physically based hydrological model called Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The study area considered is the Dodder River basin located in the southern part of Dublin, the capital city of Ireland. Climate projections from three regional climate models and two representative concentration pathways (RPC 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were used to evaluate the impact of flooding corresponding to different climate change scenarios. Annual maximum flow (AMF) is generated by combining the bias-corrected climate projections with the calibrated and validated SWAT model to understand the projected changes in flood patterns for the year 2021-2100. The expected changes in flood quantiles were estimated using a generalised extreme value distribution. The results predicted up to 12% and 16% increase in flood quantiles corresponding to 50 years and 100 years return periods. Based on the flood quantiles, flood inundation maps were developed for the study area.

J	Kahaduwa, A; Rajapakse, L				Kahaduwa, Amaya; Rajapakse, Lalith			Review of climate change impacts on reservoir hydrology and long-term basin-wide water resources management	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Review						Climate prediction; hydrologic variations; hydropower generation; water supply-demand balance	RIVER-BASIN; HYDROPOWER; STREAMFLOW; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; DROUGHT; DRIVEN; MODEL	Global climate change is known to trigger local and regional hydrologic variations such as changes in precipitation patterns, increased surface temperatures, variations in the streamflow and the occurrence of frequent floods and droughts which in turn affect the built environment. Apt and efficient water management is paramount as climate change can considerably affect the water supply-demand balance. Focusing on reservoir management, the vulnerability to floods and droughts, the effect on energy production, the ability to cope with the agricultural and drinking water demand and the impact on ecological flow need to be reconsidered. The objectives of this paper are to review and identify the impacts of climate change on reservoir hydrology, discuss the related uncertainties and conclude and recommend the ways of adapting to the change. Under reservoir operation, the emphasis is on the consequent need for closer attention of the planners and reservoir operators. Variations in precipitation patterns affect hydropower generation and become a reason for aggravated floods and droughts. Changed evaporation volumes affect the irrigation and drinking water supplies considerably. Several possible approaches are discussed emphasizing long-term basin-wide water resource management. The recommendation is to stress more on the ways of reducing climate change impacts in future studies.

To study attitudes and perceptions towards environmental measures, we apply several items of New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) and Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theories to cross-examine the public perceptions of climate change in the urban city-state of Singapore through analysis of quantitative questionnaires and qualitative semi-structured interviews. The perceptions were explored about ecological orientation (two dimensions of NEP: level of concern, self-reported knowledge) and environmental behavior (two dimensions of VBN: acceptance and support of national adaptation measures, confidence in adaptation). There is a moderate to high concern for climate change, in general, and sea level rise and flooding, in particular, and the concern is expected to increase in the future. Individuals who indicated a higher level of concern are likely to be more accepting and supportive of climate change measures. Also, while the majority of the populace are amenable to legislative measures from the government, such as enacting pro-environmental laws and more are agreeable to accepting cuts on living standards, as opposed to paying more in prices and taxes. Ecological orientation does not translate directly into environmental behavior, highlighting the gulf between perception and behavior in Singapore.

Precipitation response to climate change and urban development over the continental United States	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme precipitation; urbanization; WRF; regional climate; climate change; urban flooding	GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; ARID CLIMATE; RAINFALL; EXPANSION; MODEL; HEAT; URBANIZATION; IMPACT; SUSTAINABILITY	Appropriately characterizing future changes in regional-scale precipitation requires assessment of the interactive effect owing to greenhouse gas-induced climate change and the physical growth of the built environment. Here we use a suite of medium resolution (20 km grid spacing) decadal scale simulations conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to an urban canopy parameterization to examine the interplay between end-of-century long-lived greenhouse gas (LLGHG) forcing and urban expansion on continental US (CONUS) precipitation. Our results show that projected changes in extreme precipitation are at least one order of magnitude greater than projected changes in mean precipitation; this finding is geographically consistent over the seven CONUS National Climate Assessment (NCA) regions and between the pair of dynamically downscaled global climate model (GCM) forcings. We show that dynamical downscaling of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCM leads to projected end-of-century changes in extreme precipitation that are consistently greater compared to dynamical downscaling of the Community Earth System Model GCM for all regions except the Southeast NCA region. Our results demonstrate that the physical growth of the built environment can either enhance or suppress extreme precipitation across CONUS metropolitan regions. Incorporation of LLGHGs indicates compensating effects between urban environments and greenhouse gases, shifting the probability spectrum toward broad enhancement of extreme precipitation across future CONUS metropolitan areas. Our results emphasize the need for development of management policies that address flooding challenges exacerbated by the twin forcing agents of urban- and greenhouse gas-induced climate change.

The impact of climate change on country and community and the role of mental health professionals working with Aboriginal communities in recovery and promoting resilience	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						Aboriginal; Australia; climate change; connection; country; eco-anxiety; eco-grief; first nation; Indigenous; psychosocial well-being; solastalgia		This paper emerged from discussions between the authors about our shared and different perspectives of climate change and its impact on the social, emotional, physical, spiritual and cultural wellbeing of Aboriginal Peoples and mental health services in a rural region, heavily impacted in recent years by bushfires and floods. Here we discuss, from the lead authors personal perspective as a Gamilaraay Woman, the experience of Solastalgia as a critical impact of climate change on wellbeing. Specifically, we discuss the relationship of a connection to country from a Gamilaraay, first person perspective through a series of diary entries from the lead author. Authors are researchers from different cultural backgrounds, connected through a medical research futures fund research project, to promote resilience within Aboriginal communities and the health services sector in the New England, North West region. The lead author has cultural connections to some of the communities we work with and our work is informed by these connections. While this paper was written to express an Aboriginal perspective on climate change and wellbeing, it reflects our shared perspectives of how disasters such as bushfires impact the wellbeing of Aboriginal peoples. We also explore the connection between the impact of localised, recurring natural disasters and the increasing demands on mental health services in regional and rural areas and discuss what this means with Aboriginal and non-Indigenous mental health nurses and researchers working in regional and rural areas where access to mental health services often poses considerable challenges. From our perspective, mental health research and nursing play an important role in walking alongside Aboriginal Peoples as we explore, respond and create resilience to the ever-present influence that climate change is having on our lives, communities, country and workplaces.

A GIS-based framework for high-level climate change risk assessment of critical infrastructure	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Critical infrastructure; Geographic information system; GIS-based analysis; Risk assessment	VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS; NETWORK	The IPCC states that climate change unequivocally impacts on various aspects of the natural and built environment, including our vital critical infrastructure systems (transport, energy, water/wastewater and communications). It is thus essential for countries to gain an understanding of critical infrastructure vulnerability to current and future climate-related threats, in order to develop effective climate adaptation strategies. The first requisite step towards implementing these strategies, before any detailed analysis can commence, is high-level vulnerability or risk assessments. The work in this paper is concerned with such high-level assessments, however the framework presented is GIS-based, facilitating modelling of geographical variability in both climate and asset vulnerability within a country. This permits the identification of potential climate change risk hotspots across a range of critical infrastructure sectors. The framework involves a number of distinct steps. Sectoral information matrices are developed to highlight the key relationships between the infrastructure and climate threats. This information is complemented with sectoral maps showing, on an asset-level, the potential geospatial impacts of climate change, facilitating initial quantification of the vulnerable portions of the infrastructure systems. Finally, the approach allows for development of multi-sectoral semi-quantitative risk ranking maps that account for the geographical proximities of various assets from different critical infrastructure sectors which are vulnerable to a specific climate threat. The framework is presented in the paper and applied as a case study in the context of Irish critical infrastructure. The case-study identified for instance, potentially substantial increases in fluvial flooding risk for Irish critical infrastructure, while the multi-sectoral risk ranking maps highlighted a number of Ireland's urban and rural areas as climate change risk hotspots. These high-level insights are likely to be useful in informing more detailed assessment, and initiating important conversations relating to a region's critical infrastructure cross-sectoral risk.

This study applied a simulation optimization approach to maximize infiltration with LIDs at minimum costs in a small urban catchment (0.67 km2). We coupled the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) with the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to determine near-optimal locations of bioretentions, green roofs, and permeable pavements. The temporal resolution of rainfall projections was disaggregated from 24 hours to 15 minutes using the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular method to evaluate the performance and robustness of the optimized solutions under different budgets and climate scenarios. Results suggest that LIDs can mitigate climate change impacts with relatively inexpensive solutions. However, the robustness analysis showed that climate change could compromise the expected performance of LIDs sized with historical rainfall.

Long-term studies of either homogeneous or heterogeneous responses of historical disasters to climate change are, however, limited by the quality and quantity of the available proxy data. Here we reconstruct spatio-temporal patterns of five types of disasters in China during the period AD 1368-1911. Our analyses of these time series reveal that warmer temperatures decreased the occurrence of disasters in the monsoon-affected parts of central-east China, but it increased the frequency and intensity of disasters along the boundary of arid and humid conditions in parts of southwest and northeast China, probably driven by the interplay among monsoon, westerlies, polar vortex and variation of temperature. Moreover, we show that drought and flood events had cascading effects on the occurrences of locust outbreaks, famine and human epidemics. Our findings suggest that climate can contribute to the spatio-temporal occurrence of disasters, and therefore may contribute to an improvement of China's regional to national risk management of future climate and environmental change.

In this study, we considered the Jinghe River Basin in the Loess Plateau as the research object. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized runoff index (SRI) series were used to represent meteorological drought and hydrological drought with monthly runoff generated by the SWAT model. In addition, the evolution laws of the JRB in the future based on Copula functions are discussed. The results showed that: (1) the meteorological drought and hydrological drought of the JRB displayed complex periodic change trends of drought and flood succession, and the evolution laws of meteorological drought and hydrological drought under different spatiotemporal scales and different scenario differ significantly. (2) In terms of the spatial range, the JRB meteorological and hydrological drought duration and severity gradually increased along with the increase in the time scale. (3) Based on the joint distribution model of the Copula function, the future meteorological drought situation in the JRB will be alleviated when compared with the historical period on the seasonal scale, but the hydrological drought situation is more serious. The findings can help policy-makers explore the correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in the background of future climate change, as well as the early warning of hydrological drought.

J	Zhang, F; Lin, N; Kunreuther, H				Zhang, Fang; Lin, Ning; Kunreuther, Howard			Benefits of and strategies to update premium rates in the US National Flood Insurance Program under climate change	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						affordability; climate change; NFIP flood insurance	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; AREAS	The United States' National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has accumulated over $20 billion in debt to the US Treasury since 2005, partly due to discounted premiums on homes in flood-prone areas. To address this issue, FEMA introduced Risk Rating 2.0 in October 2021, which is able to assess and charge more accurate and equitable rates to homeowners. However, rates must be continually updated to account for increasing flood damage caused by sea level rise and more intense hurricanes due to climate change. This study proposes a strategy to adopt updated premium rates that account for climate change effects and address affordability and risk mitigation issues with a means-tested voucher program. The strategy is tested in a coastal community, Ortley Beach, NJ, by projecting its future flood risk under sea level rise and storm intensification. Compared with using static rates for all the properties in Ortley Beach, the proposed strategy is shown to reduce the NFIP's potential losses to the community from 2020 to 2050 by half (from $4.6 million to $2.3 million), improve the community's flood resistance, and address affordability concerns. Sensitivity analysis of varying incomes, loan interest rates, and conditions for a voucher indicates that the strategy is feasible and effective under a wide range of scenarios. Thus, the proposed strategy can be applied to various communities along the US coastline as an effective way of updating risk-based premiums while addressing affordability and resilience concerns.

Soil Carbon Isotope Values and Paleoprecipitation Reconstruction	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						carbon; isotopes; paleoclimate; precipitation; soil; water	ORGANIC-CARBON; STABLE CARBON; PEDOGENIC CARBONATE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANNUAL PRECIPITATION; DELTA-C-13 VALUES; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; C-4 GRASSLANDS; NORTH-AMERICA	Anthropogenic climate change has significant impacts at the ecosystem scale including widespread drought, flooding, and other natural disasters related to precipitation extremes. To contextualize modern climate change, scientists often look to ancient climate changes, such as shifts in ancient precipitation ranges. Previous studies have used fossil leaf organic geochemistry and paleosol inorganic chemistry as paleoprecipitation proxies, but have largely ignored the organic soil layer, which acts as a bridge between aboveground biomass and belowground inorganic carbon accumulation, as a potential recorder of precipitation. We investigate the relationship between stable carbon isotope values in soil organic matter (delta C-13(SOM)) and a variety of seasonal and annual climate parameters in modern ecosystems and find a statistically significant relationship between delta C-13(SOM) values and mean annual precipitation (MAP). After testing the relationship between actual and reconstructed precipitation values in modern systems, we test this potential paleoprecipitation proxy in the geologic record by comparing precipitation values reconstructed using delta C-13(SOM) to other reconstructed paleoprecipitation estimates from the same paleosols. This study provides a promising new proxy that can be applied to ecosystems post-Devonian (similar to 420 Ma) to the Miocene (similar to 23 Ma), and in mixed C-3/C-4 ecosystems in the geologic record with additional paleobotanical and palynological information. It also extends paleoprecipitation reconstruction to more weakly developed paleosol types, such as those lacking B- horizons, than previous inorganic proxies and is calibrated for wetter environments.

Following the most recent drought period (2015-2018), local authorities such as the City of Cape Town are being tasked with restructuring policy to include climate change adaptation strategies to adapt more adequately and proactively to these new challenges. This paper describes an evaluation of the water governance processes required to implement Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Cape Townwith a specific focus on the barriers to, and opportunities for, those processes related to wastewater treatment, flood risk and the pressing issue of water scarcity. The City Blueprint Approach (CBA) was selected as the indicator assessment approach for this task. The CBA is a set of diagnostic tools comprising the Trends and Pressures Framework, the City Blueprint Framework and the Governance Capacity Framework. This was applied to Cape Town based on in-depth interviews and publicly available information. The analysis revealed that smart monitoring, community knowledge and experimentation with alternative water management technologies are important when considering uncertainties and complexities in the governance of urban water challenges. We conclude that there is potential for Cape Town to transition to a water sensitive city through learning from this experimentation and by implementing WSUD strategies that address water scarcity following the shifts in governance caused by the 2015-2018 drought.

We sought to assess how the psychosocial consequences of a major event were addressed via public health responses (e.g., programs, policies, and practices) that aimed to enhance, protect, and promote mental health. Methods We report on a study of health and social service responses to the long-term mental health impacts of the 2013 Southern Alberta flood, in High River, Alberta. Qualitative research methods included (i) telephone interviews (n = 14) with key informant health and social services leaders, (ii) four focus group sessions with front-line health and social services workers (n = 14), and (iii) semi-structured interviews with a sample of community members (n = 18) who experienced the flood. We conducted a descriptive thematic analysis, with a focus on participants' perceptions and experiences. Results Findings of this study suggest (1) the long-term psychosocial impacts of extreme weather and climate change require sustained recovery interventions rooted in local knowledge and interdisciplinary action; (2) there are unintended consequences related to psychosocial interventions that can incite complex emotions and impact psychosocial recovery; and (3) perceptions of mental health care, among people exposed to climate-related trauma, can guide climate change and mental health response and recovery interventions. Conclusion Based on this initial exploration, policy and practice opportunities for public health to enhance psychosocial adaptation to our changing climate are highlighted.

Assessing the Vulnerability of Water Balance to Climate Change at River Basin Scale in Humid Tropics: Implications for a Sustainable Water Future	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; CMIP6; GCM; humid tropics; hydrology; SWAT; water balance; Western Ghats	LAND-USE CHANGE; RCP SCENARIOS; DATA SET; MODEL; RAINFALL; IMPACTS; MONSOON; PROJECTIONS; COMPONENTS; INDIA	Sustainability in hydrology aims at maintaining a high likelihood of meeting future water demands without compromising hydrologic, environmental, or physical integrity. Therefore, understanding the local-scale impact of global climate change on hydrology and water balance is crucial. This study focuses on assessing the impact of climate change on water balance components (precipitation, surface runoff, groundwater flow, percolation, etc.) at the river basin scale in a humid tropical region. The Periyar river basin (PRB) in Kerala in India is considered as a case study and the SWAT hydrological model is adopted to obtain the water balance components. Three general circulation models are considered under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP 245 and SSP 585) emission scenarios assess the impact of climate change until 2100. For the PRB, the results demonstrate a significant increase in streamflow (>65%) and runoff (>40%) in the mid (2041-2070) and far (2071-2100) future under both the SSP scenarios, indicating a potential vulnerability to future floods. Conversely, in the near future under SSP 585, a decrease in runoff (-15%) and nominal changes in streamflow (-5%) are observed. Spatially, the eastern sub-basins and the west coast of the Periyar river basin are projected to experience higher precipitation events, while the central region faces reduced precipitation and low flow rates. The findings emphasize the need for proactive and sustainable management of water resources, considering irrigation requirements, groundwater discharge, and flood control measures, to mitigate the negative effects of climate change and prevent water stress/surplus situations in specific sub-basins. This study enhances our understanding of climate change impacts on water balance and emphasizes the significance of sustainable water resource management for an effective response. By integrating scientific knowledge into policy and management decisions, we can strive towards a resilient water future within a changing climate.	[Sadhwani, Kashish; Eldho, T.

J	Johnsson, I; Balstrom, T				Johnsson, Isabelle; Balstrom, Thomas			A GIS-based screening method to identify climate change-related threats on road networks: A case study from Sweden	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						GIS; Flood analysis; Vulnerability assessment; Climate change adaptation; Road networks		Extreme weather-related events are likely to increase in both frequency and intensity if current emission rates continue. Particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of climate change is the transportation sector, which fully relies on the uninterrupted accessibility of the road network. With the Swedish Government adopting a National Adaptation Strategy in 2018, creating a coordinated cross-disciplinary strategy underpinned by international frameworks, new ambition levels regarding climate change adaptation efforts have been established. Identifying particularly vulnerable parts of the road network is an essential step for National Road Authorities (NRAs) in early planning stages to prioritize adaptation efforts around high-risk areas to safeguard the road network. By utilizing both publicly and commercially available climate-related data, as well as applying and assessing new terrain analysis techniques, a large-scale vulnerability assessment is carried out for Halland County in southwestern Sweden by assessing three climate-adjusted extreme weather events (a 100-year pluvial flood event, a 100-year fluvial flood event, and an extreme coastal storm surge event) projected to exacerbate in the region. The study demonstrates how a GIS-based screening method, specifically adapted for NRAs or similar stakeholders, may provide quick overviews of potentially at-risk areas along road networks through a simple vulnerability index assigned to individual road segments. Further studies are recommended to compare modeled results to recorded flood events if available and incorporate updated climate change trajectories from upcoming IPCC reports.

The increased prevalence of allergic airway disease worldwide can be partially attributed to those global environmental changes. Climate change and air pollution pose adverse impacts on respiratory allergies, and that the mechanisms are complex and interactive. Adverse weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, can act directly on the respiratory tract to induce allergic respiratory illnesses. Thunderstorms and floods can alter the production and distribution of aeroallergens while wildfires and dust storms increase air pollution, and therefore indirectly enhance health risks. Concentrations of particulate matter and ozone in the air have been projected to increase with climate warming and air stagnation, and the rising temperatures and CO(2)increase pollen, molds, and spores, which escalate the risk of allergic respiratory diseases. The synergistic effects of extreme heat and aeroallergens intensify the toxic effect of air pollutants, which in turn augment the allergenicity of aeroallergens. With the Earth's climate change, migration of humans and plants shift the living environments and allergens of susceptible people. Urban residents are exposed to multiple factors while children are sensitive to environmental exposure. Since climate change may pose many unexpected and persistent effects on allergic respiratory diseases, health professionals should advocate for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize its respiratory health effects.

J	Kaczan, DJ; Orgill-Meyer, J				Kaczan, David J.; Orgill-Meyer, Jennifer			The impact of climate change on migration: a synthesis of recent empirical insights	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Review							ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES; POPULATION MOBILITY; OUT-MIGRATION; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; CONSUMPTION; ADAPTATION; DROUGHT; VULNERABILITY; POLITICS	Concern about the human impact of climate change has led to predictions of how people living in areas vulnerable to drought, flood, and temperature changes will respond to such events. Early studies warned that climate change would lead to dramatic increases in human migration as households became unable to adapt to the impacts of climate change. More recently, empirical studies focused on observed climate events and trends have documented how migration flows vary as a function of both the severity of the event and the ability of the household to migrate, among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of this literature, based on a conceptual framework in which climate shocks (e.g., drought, floods, or temperature extremes) affect (a) household capability to migrate, by depleting household resources necessary for migration, and (b) household vulnerability in staying, by increasing the risk that a household falls (further) into poverty. In combination, these factors help explain four key patterns seen in the empirical literature: (1) climate-induced migration is not necessarily more prevalent among poorer households; (2) climate-induced migration tends to be more prevalent for long-distance domestic moves than local or international moves; (3) slow-onset climate changes (such as droughts) are more likely to induce increased migration than rapid-onset changes (such as floods); and (4) the severity of climate shocks impacts migration in a nonlinear fashion, with impacts influenced by whether the capability or vulnerability channel dominates.

Exploring urban growth-climate change-flood risk nexus in fast growing cities	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; LAND-USE; IMPACT; ADAPTATION	This study looks at the nexus between urban growth, climate change, and flood risk in Doha, Qatar, a hot-spot, climate change region that has experienced unprecedented urban growth during the last four decades. To this end, this study overviews the main stages of Doha's urban growth and influencing climatic factors during this period. A physically-based hydrological model was then built to simulate surface runoff and quantify flood risk. Finally, the Pearson correlation was used to verify the potential nexus between flood risk, climate change, and urban growth. Surveying showed that, between 1984 and 2020, urban areas grew by 777%, and bare lands decreased by 54.7%. In addition, Doha witnessed various climatic changes with a notable increase in air temperature (+ 8.7%), a decrease in surface wind speed (- 19.5%), and a decrease in potential evapotranspiration losses (- 33.5%). Growth in urban areas and the perturbation of climatic parameters caused runoff to increase by 422%, suggesting that urban growth contributed more than climatic parameters. Pearson correlation coefficient between flood risk and urban growth was strong (0.83) and significant at p < 0.05. Flood risk has a strong significant positive (negative) correlation with air temperature (wind speed) and a moderate positive (negative) correlation with precipitation (potential evapotranspiration). These results pave the way to integrate flood risk reduction measures in local urban development and climate change adaptation plans.

Urban land planning shapes the urban form and is considered to be an effective approach for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, there is little knowledge about what urban forms can reduce both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate stresses while considering trade-offs between them. Here, we investigate the role of urban land use in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, we assess quantitatively the competition between strategies for mitigation and adaptation and identify potential win-win solutions in land use responses. Using a coastal city as a case study, we find that the land use strategies for unilateral mitigation or adaptation can cause contradicting consequences with respect to the reductions in GHG emissions and climate stresses, i.e. reductions in GHGs could increase climate stresses or vice versa. Poorly integrated strategies potentially may compromise international efforts to meet the Climate Action in the Sustainable Development Goals. Properly integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies, or climate-sensitive land use planning, however, can lead to win-win outcomes and eventually achieve co-benefits. Yet, any co-benefits will gradually diminish if there is a delay in climate-sensitive land use planning, implying growing GHGs and intensified climate stresses. Our analysis indicates that integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban land use needs to be enacted as soon as possible: any delays in implementation reduce the window to act to maximize the co-benefits.

Therefore, this study projected the changes in extreme precipitation in North Korea by applying downscaling to GCMs forced by Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) Scenarios 4.5 and 8.5, preserving the long-term trend of climate change projection. Employing climate change scenario ensembles of RCP8.5, the precipitation level of the 20-year return period in the reference period of 1980-2005 increased to 21.1 years for the future period 2011-2040, decreased to 16.2 years for 2041-2070, and decreased to 8.8 years for 2071-2100. Extreme precipitation was expected to occur often in the future. In addition, an increase in extreme precipitation at the border of North and South Korea is expected, and it is concluded that a joint response for the Imjin River, a river shared by North and South Korea, is needed.

Using an indicator-based approach, this study examines the social factors that affect the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of households and communities in the Volta estuary, Ghana. Results indicate that all the communities within the study area were ex-posed to climate change related hazards. However, two communities, Azizanya in Ada East Dis-trict and Fuveme in Anloga District, were highly exposed with unweighted indexes of 0.50 and 0.76, respectively. Sensitivity among communities was generally high ranging from 0.00 to 0.87 due to several social factors including low household income, high number of children and aged at home, and lack of social amenities such as roads, health facilities, markets, and schools. The communities recorded high adaptive capacity and were able to withstand the ravages of the ocean and the river system. Households and communities developed various adaptation measures such as relocation to nearby communities or higher grounds, open spaces and packing of their be-longings on higher objects such as tables, whiles government actions included occasional dredg-ing and constructions of sea defense structures. An integrated, multi-stakeholder approach in-volving government, non-governmental community-based organisations, communities, house-holds, and other stakeholders is proposed to design and implement a comprehensive disaster management plan to combat climate change related coastal disasters.

Flooding by extreme weather events andhuman activities can lead to catastrophic impacts in fast-urbanizing areas.However, high uncertainty in climate change and future urban growth limitthe ability of cities to adapt to flood risk. This study presents amulti-scenario risk assessment method that couples a future land usesimulation (FLUS) model and floodplain inundation model (LISFLOOD-FP) tosimulate and evaluate the impacts of future urban growth scenarios withflooding under climate change (two representative concentration pathways(RCP2.6 and RCP8.5)). By taking the coastal city of Shanghai as an example, wethen quantify the role of urban planning policies in future urbandevelopment to compare urban development under multiple policy scenarios(business as usual, growth as planned, growth as eco-constraints).Geospatial databases related to anthropogenic flood protection facilities,land subsidence and storm surge are developed and used as inputs to theLISFLOOD-FP model to estimate flood risk under various urbanization andclimate change scenarios. The results show that urban growth under the threescenario models manifests significant differences in expansion trajectories,influenced by key factors such as infrastructure development and policyconstraints. Comparing the urban inundation results for the RCP2.6 andRCP8.5 scenarios, the urban inundation area under the growth-as-eco-constraints scenario is less than that under the business-as-usualscenario but more than that under the growth-as-planned scenario. We alsofind that urbanization tends to expand more towards flood-prone areas underthe restriction of ecological environment protection. The increasing floodrisk information determined by model simulations helps us to understand thespatial distribution of future flood-prone urban areas and promote there-formulation of urban planning in high-risk locations.

Evaluating the flood risk under nonstationarity is critical to water resource management authorities in disaster reduction. In this study, the annual maximum streamflow (AMS) was used to analyze the nonstationarity in flood frequency in the Hanjiang River (HJR) Basin. A Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) is employed to characterize nonstationarity in the AMS with time, as well as climatic and anthropogenic factors. Additionally, changes of the AMS in response to future climate change and human activity are also investigated. Results indicate that flood behavior can be better described by the nonstationary model with physically based covariates than that with time and the stationary model, implying that flood regimes of the HJR Basin are mainly influenced by anthropogenic and climatic factors including reservoir, precipitation and temperature. The precipitation and temperature projected by the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) under two climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) in the HJR Basin are characterized by an increasing trend over the period of 2006-2100. Furthermore, an increasing trend was found in the AMS during 2051-2100, indicating that flood risk is likely to increase in the future in the HJR Basin due to the climate change alone without further changes in hydrological engineering and flood management. The results quantified the flood frequency under nonstationarity conditions with physically based covariates and provided information to the decision-makers to address the potential risks posed to the HJR Basin.

Assessing the risk of climate change to aquaculture: a national-scale case study for the Sultanate of Oman	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Aquaculture; Climate resilience; Climate risk assessment; Food security; Sultanate of Oman; Seabream culture; Shrimp culture	FISHERIES; VULNERABILITY; TEMPERATURE; WELFARE; HEALTH; IMPACT; FUTURE	Aquaculture is expanding globally and is an increasingly important component of world food security. However, climate change can impact aquaculture through a variety of mechanisms varying by location and aquaculture type with implications for future productivity. Understanding the risks that climate change poses on different culture systems in different locations is important to enable the design of targeted adaptation and resilience building actions. Here we present an aquaculture climate risk assessment framework, applied to the aquaculture sector of the Sultanate of Oman, that identifies the sensitivity and exposure of different components of the sector to climate change risk.Oman has aspirations to significantly expand aquaculture over the next decade focussing on coastal shrimp ponds, finfish sea cages, land-based recirculating aquaculture systems, and ponds and raceways. We quantify overall climate risk as the combination of four risks: (1) species' temperature sensitivity, (2) flooding and storm surge exposure, (3) low-oxygen hazard and (4) disease vulnerability. Shrimp culture is identified as highest risk due to high exposure of shrimp ponds to flooding and storm surges, and high disease vulnerability. Seabream cage farming also faces high risk due to high thermal sensitivity and high potential of low-oxygen levels affecting sea cages. Following the risk assessment a stakeholder workshop was conducted to identify targeted adaptation measures for the different components of the sector. The framework for assessing climate risk to aquaculture demonstrated here is equally applicable at the regional, national or sub-national scale to support design of targeted resilience building actions and enhance food security.

Controlled by large tides and widely variable river discharge, the delta experiences rising river salinity and salt intrusion, as well as seasonal flooding during the monsoon. Future climate change is projected to increase rainfall in South Asia and river discharge in the GBM system. We address how this process might combine with sea-level rise (SLR) to control future river salinity. Model experiments designed using a range of SLR and climate change scenarios are performed to investigate the forces controlling river salinity in the delta. A flexible mesh modelling approach allows us to investigate the impacts at a wide range of time and space scales. In future projections the disparity between wet and dry season salt intrusion intensifies. In the future, SLR acts to increase river salinity in the GBM delta. During the dry season, this effect is worsened by reduced river discharge. In the wet season, this can be mitigated in the eastern part of the delta by larger seasonal river flows. The central and western delta is dominated by SLR, leading to increased salt intrusion all year round, impacting on water resources and agricultural productivity. In the context of an intensifying hydrological cycle, these conclusions have implications for similar tide-dominated deltas, where SLR can increase tidal range, and therefore exacerbate salt intrusion.

WATER			English	Article						climate change; runoff; variability; seasonality; trends; low flows; floods	FLOOD RISK; RIVER FLOODS; BASEFLOW; RUNOFF; EUROPE; TRENDS; CATCHMENTS; STREAMFLOW; IMPACTS; NO	This study analyzed the long-term alterations in runoff regime, seasonality and variability in headwater montane basins in Central Europe in response to the manifestations of climate change. We tested the common hypotheses on climate change effects on surface runoff dynamics in the Central Europe region, assuming that (i) recent climate warming will result in shifts in the seasonality of runoff, (ii) the runoff balance will remain without significant changes and (iii) that higher variability in runoff can be expected. The analyses were done on eight montane catchments in four mid-latitude mountain ranges in Central Europe, based on the uninterrupted time series of daily discharge observations from 1952 to 2018. We used 33 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA), 34 indicators of environmental flow components, the baseflow index, the calculation of surplus and deficit volumes and the frequency of peak and low flows. Homogeneity testing using Buishand, Pettitt and SNHT tests was applied to test the response of the hydrological alteration indicators to climate warming. We have proved the significant shifts in runoff seasonality, coinciding with the timing of the air temperature rise, marked by earlier snowmelt, followed by a decline in spring flows and a prolonged period of low flows. There was detected a rise in the baseflow index across the mountain ranges. Unlike the common hypotheses, the expected rise of runoff variability and frequency of peak flows was not demonstrated. However, we have identified a significant change of the flood hydrographs, tending to steeper shape with shorter recessing limbs as a sign of rising inner dynamics of flood events in montane catchments.

This results in yield losses, leading to food insecurity in the most affected regions. Multiple plant-beneficial bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas have been shown to improve plant tolerance to these stresses. Various mechanisms are involved, including alteration of the plant ethylene levels, direct phytohormone production, emission of volatile organic compounds, reinforcement of the root apoplast barriers, and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. In this review, we summarize the effects of climate change-induced stresses on plants and detail the mechanisms used by plant-beneficial Pseudomonas strains to alleviate them. Recommendations are made to promote targeted research on the stress-alleviating potential of these bacteria.

Stormwater management (SWM) has emerged as a key policy response to reduce urban vulnerability to flood risk, and it offers an ideal case study for analyzing the governance of climate change adaptation. This article focuses on SWM policy in the Province of Ontario, Canada, with the broader objective of assessing the nature and dynamics of adaptation governance arrangements. The evolution of SWM policy is examined longitudinally to understand how the interaction of policy ideas, actors and institutions have mobilized adaptation principles. The results reveal that, despite consensus on key ideas among policy actors, the institutionalization of adaptation principles into SWM policy lags behind. This finding raises questions about the capacity of regional governments to strengthen local adaptation and underpins the need for further research on the interaction between evolving adaptation priorities and established policy regimes.

The objectives of this study were to develop a calibrated and validated watershed model for daily streamflow and daily fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) concentrations using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Big Sunflower River Watershed (BSRW) and to assess the sensitivity of FCB concentrations to changes in precipitation, temperature, and CO2 concentrations. The model demonstrated reasonable performances in simulating daily stream flow (R-2 = 0.64-0.77, NSE = 0.57-0.75) and FCB concentrations (R-2 = 0.56-0.60, NSE = 0.23-0.40) as compared to the previous literature. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analyses showed that average FCB concentrations were sensitive to changes in rainfall, temperature, and CO2 concentrations. Increased rainfall caused greater wash-off of FCB colonies from soil surfaces, while increased temperatures caused a decrease in surface water bacteria concentrations due to increased bacteria die-off rates. The CO2 concentration parameter was determined as the least sensitive parameter in this study.

A major concern is the increase in extreme weather events (EWE) such as storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, and landslides in SSA and their potential to affect the health and well-being of children and adolescents. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the direct and indirect impacts of EWE on the mental health of children and adolescents living in SSA, in order to inform protective adaptation strategies and promote resilience. A meta-analysis will not be possible, since the assumption is that limited studies have been published on the EWE-associated mental health impacts on children and adolescents living in SSA and that those studies that are available are heterogenous. There is acknowledgement in the global literature of the need to highlight child and adolescent mental health more prominently in climate change health strategies and policies. It is vital that adaptation strategies are informed by research on risk prevention and promotion of resilience to ensure the mental health of children and adolescents is protected.

Due to geomorphological, topographic, and ecological conditions mountainous landscapes of Hindukush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKH) is more vulnerable to climate change effects. A detailed questionnaire survey was conducted in eastern Himalaya (Naltar Valley) to admit people's perception regarding climate change scenario, its impacts on the livelihoods, adaptation and coping measures. Results depicted that people were aware of change in climate, as majority of respondents believed that increase in temperature with decreasing rainfall in winters. They perceived that temperature got more or less extreme as compared to past. Perceptions regarding weather patterns were checked through trend of climate data (1951-2013). Peoples have experienced profusion of issues and foreseeable diseases both in humans and animals, and facing more climate related hazards like landslide, floods and avalanches consequently impacted their social and economic life very badly. The community also professed the climate change associated hazards severely impacted the amount of pastures as the amount of pastures have decreased as compared to past; and people reduced their number of livestock with due reason. Some of them identified some species in pastures and agricultural lands are increasing. Owing to change in climate they identified some coping strategies and adaptation measure to tackle such issues.

J	Uddin, S; Revel, M; Modi, P; Yamazaki, D				Uddin, Shahab; Revel, Menaka; Modi, Prakat; Yamazaki, Dai			Quantifying the relative contributions of climate change and ENSO to flood occurrence in Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						flood risk; attribution; climate change; ENSO	NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; EL-NINO; RISK; VARIABILITY; ATTRIBUTION; ENGLAND; GANGES; ROBUST	Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to flood hazards, and its flood risk is projected to increase with global warming. In addition to climate change, internal climate variation, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), influences flooding in many rivers worldwide. However, the impact of internal climate variability on flooding in Bangladesh remains unclear due to the limited observations. Here, we assess the impacts of ENSO and climate change on flood occurrence in Bangladesh using a large-ensemble climate simulation dataset and a global river model (CaMa-Flood). After separating 6000 years of simulation (100-member ensemble river simulations for 1950-2010) into El Nino, La Nina, and neutral years, we calculated the extent to which each ENSO stage increased flood occurrence probability relative to the neutral state using the fraction of attributable risk method. In addition, we estimated the impact of historical climate change on past flood occurrence through a comparison of simulations with and without historical global warming. Under the no-global-warming climate, La Nina increased the occurrence probability of a 10 year return period flood at Hardinge Bridge on the Ganges River by 38% compared to neutral years. The influence of La Nina or El Nino state on flood occurrence probability in the Brahmaputra River at Bahadurabad station is negligible. Historical global warming increased the occurrence of flooding in the Ganges River, the Brahmaputra River, and their confluence by 59%, 44%, and 55%, respectively. The impact of ENSO on flood occurrence probability decreased in the historical simulation, likely due to the conflation of ENSO and climate change signals, and no significant correlation between ENSO and flood occurrence was detected when only small-ensemble simulations were used. These findings suggest that the use of large-ensemble climate simulation datasets is essential for precise attribution of the impacts of internal climate variability on flooding in Bangladesh.

Public officials might have incentives to solicit bribes when natural disasters occur. This study explores the relationship between firms' perceived corruption and public officials' bribery behavior by analyzing firm-level data for five South Asian countries from the World Bank Enterprise Survey. The results showed that floods positively associated with corruption. Corruption was positively associated with bribery, and probability of soliciting bribery increased by 18% for each consecutive level of corruption perceived by the firm.

Cenk			Impacts of climate change on dogsledding recreation and tourism in Arctic Sweden	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Dogsledding; Tourism; GIS; Sweden; Arctic		The range of Arctic tourism supply is continuously increasing with a variety of tourism products on offer. However, climate change is becoming a more prominent issue threatening the operations of tourism businesses and the livelihood of some tourism actors, such as dogsledders. This article aims to fill the descriptive research gap that exists regarding the dependency on the physical environment, climate, and weather for dogsledding activities. This is achieved by studying how climate change may threaten possible climate and weather thresholds for these activities, and how climate change may affect the future opportunities for dogsledding in northern Sweden. The study is based on interviews with dogsledders in Arctic Sweden and climate projections from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The results demonstrate the following thresholds for dogsledding activities: (1) dogsledding requires 10-20 cm of packed snow and/or solid ice on bodies of water, (2) above 15 degrees C is too hot for dogs to pull (wheeled) sledges, (3) cold weather thresholds are determined by visitors' preferences and are not considered a problem for dogsledders or dogs, and (4) rain can cancel tours for all dogsledders, and strong wind can cancel tours for dogsledders located in the mountain regions. Finally, extreme events such as heatwaves, storms, thunderstorms, forest fires, heavy rain, floods, and more rapid weather changes have already affected some dogsledders. These necessary thresholds for dogsledding activities could already be jeopardized for the southern and coastal locations of Arctic Sweden. In addition, the climate projections from SMHI show that warmer days and more precipitation in the form of rain will become more common in the future, especially in the absence of global mitigation measures. However, further research on vulnerability/resilience and adaption strategies for dogsledding activities is necessary to truly understand the impact of climate change.

Effects of Climate Change and Urbanization on Bridge Flood Vulnerability: A Regional Assessment for Harris County, Texas	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article								The failure of stream-crossing bridges during flood events can endanger human life, impede evacuation planning and emergency response efforts, and cause long-term disruptions to transportation systems and local and regional economies. Expanding urban development and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change can increase the frequency and intensity of high-flow conditions at bridge locations, potentially exacerbating flood-related damages. Thus, there is a critical need to evaluate how shifts in extreme precipitation and continued urban growth will affect peak flows and hydraulic conditions experienced by bridges. This study applies hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to investigate the individual and combined effects of climate change and urbanization on the magnitude of peak discharge, bridge freeboard encroachment, and flow velocity at stream-crossing bridge locations in 19 watersheds of Harris County, Texas. The developed framework provides a screening tool to assess the vulnerability of regional bridge infrastructure to high-flow events and to prioritize maintenance, retrofitting, and replacement efforts. The model results demonstrate that peak flows during a 1% annual exceedance probability event can increase by up to 40% by 2100 when considering the combined impacts of climate change and urbanization, with changes in precipitation generally contributing more than changes in land use. In 16 of the 19 studied watersheds, the 1% annual exceedance probability event is projected to occur at least twice as frequently by 2100. Across the region, an additional 36 bridges experience loss of freeboard due to the effects of urbanization and climate change, while notable increases in flow velocity (>= 10%) are observed at 93 bridge locations, five of which are considered scour critical. Overall, the results of this study show that climate change and urbanization will influence the hydraulic conditions at bridge locations and therefore should be carefully accounted for in the design, operation, and maintenance of bridge infrastructure in the future.

The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities' resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards. Finally, we recommend feasible pathways to overcome present risks and challenges in order to optimize the numerous opportunities offered by digitalization in support of climate change adaptation initiatives.

J	Wilson, MT				Wilson, Michael T.			Assessing voluntary resilience standards and impacts of flood risk information	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						Floods; resilience; climate change; urban planning and design	CLIMATE; ADAPTATION	Voluntary resilience standards are an emerging tool for cities to incentivize developers to incorporate climate change adaptation strategies. Urban planners and researchers, however, are still assessing their relative impacts on the design of recent large-scale development projects. This paper answers the question of whether, and at what scale, anticipated changes to mapped flood risk are associated with mitigation actions to accommodate climate change. A case study of the Climate Change Preparedness and Resiliency Checklist in Boston, Massachusetts presents a database of 171 unique survey responses from 104 proposed projects. Comparing developments with documentation to an internal subset of 54 projects in the Boston Planning and Development Agency's projected Sea Level Rise - Flood Hazard Area (SLR-FHA), this paper finds projects impacted by updated Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are associated with different building uses, higher sea level rise assumptions and greater abilities to endure inundation. There are also neighbourhood-level differences in climate expertise and the projects' ability to withstand utility disruption. Both of these observed impacts may have important implications for the formulation and application of voluntary resilience standards in other coastal cities.

We found that drought, precipitation variability, extreme precipitation and flooding, and extreme heat were the climatic stressors to which responses were most frequently documented. Individuals and households received the most research attention, followed by national government, civil society, and local government. Europe and North America were the geographic foci of more research than other regions. Behavioral responses were more reported than technical and infrastructural responses and institutional responses. Within these types of responses, actors used a wide variety of practices such as replanting, altering species composition, and adopting or changing technology. Adaptation efforts in early planning and advanced implementation received some attention, but early implementation and expanding implementation were most reported. While connections between responses and risk reduction were discussed, there is limited evidence of risk reduction. Our review contributes to the scholarly and practical understanding of how people adapt to climate change in the context of forests. The review also identifies opportunities for future research on adaptation to other climatic stressors, such as wildfires and tree pests and pathogens, adaptation in other geographic areas, especially Oceania, and adaptation by actors beyond the individual and household level and through institutional adaptation efforts.

This study focused on assessing the costs associated with climate change along the coast of Catalonia. An innovative tool in Python called GCIFS (Georeferenced Impact Forecast System) was developed for the assessment, which is based on LiDAR measurements, cartography, and online databases to predict future coastlines and economic impacts. The proposed methodology considered unique beach-specific scenarios, and multiple direction and altitude vectors to identify difficult-to-erode areas and existing protections were generated. Seven approaches based on forecasted sea-level rise with and without coastal geomorphology were applied to 262 beaches. Local impact factors and potential protection, using detailed data on infrastructure and building typology, were included in the cost evaluation, resulting in estimated costs by the year 2100 of EUR 8846.00 million for the worst-case scenario, EUR 3587.36 million for a conservative prediction including geomorphology, and EUR 822.67 million for a prediction based on local erosion and geomorphology. It was concluded that 170,676 m of protection structures is required. The selected approach, technologies, and detailed information are critical for an adequate assessment.

Targeted at building owners and designers, it is intended to support these decision makers in building design to reduce the impacts of climate change. This study presents the technical environment of PTAD and provides a conceptual basis for linking academic information on climate change to building-related data with the cooperation of the relevant authorities. The PTAD development concept was divided into three parts: climate change impact assessment in small areas (i.e., at a construction site scale), building damage analysis of the impacts, and climate-resilient recommendations for building design. Tools such as GIS, HEC-RAS, and ERDAS and the existing outputs of regional climate models were used as the baseline data for analyzing the impacts that may occur at the study site. The impacts in small areas and design strategies to reduce the potential damage were analyzed with the Delphi technique using existing standards and guidelines. A 3-tier architecture was employed for the production and development environments by modularizing the user interface, service object, and data storage layers. The impact data values, namely, the highest annual surface temperatures and flood characteristics, including the maximum flood level, flood duration, and water velocity from 1998 to 2047, were displayed as markers on the satellite maps, tables, and figures. The impacts can be linked to architectural design guidelines to help design buildings that mitigate some of the impacts of climate change.

However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy-focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation-and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.

The Creek is located in the southern portion of the Grand River watershed in the Great Lakes region and is an important water and ecosystem service provider for the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve, the largest (by population) Indigenous community in Canada and the fourth largest in North America.Methods: The Coupled Groundwater and Surface-Water Flow Model (GSFLOW) was used to simulate streamflow from 1951 to 2020 using observed gridded meteorological data from Natural Resources Canada (NRCANmet) and in situ data from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Downscaled data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate warming scenarios, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 were used to run GSFLOW for the historic (1951-2020) and projected (2021-2099) period.Results: Results suggested that streamflow in the McKenzie Creek will be significantly impacted by climate change in winter months when streamflow is projected to increase due to higher temperatures causing early melting of snowpack and increasing winter precipitation. Consequently, spring streamflow is expected to decrease and little or no change in streamflow in the summer and autumn. These changes in streamflow dynamics may lead to more flooding incidents in the winter, while at the same time, the region may face reduced water availability or dry conditions in late spring and summer due to warm temperatures.Discussion: This study provides important information about streamflow and hydrologic dynamics of this watershed that will help managers and planners to better manage water resources and be prepared to deal with climate change and its impacts on water availability and security not only for the Six Nations area but also for Southern Ontario which houses one-third of Canada's population.

This study examines the impacts of climate change on the performance of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) by means of a detailed daily reservoir regulation and hydropower model, linked to a physically-based hydrological model, and driven by an ensemble of five General Circulation Models (GCMs) under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). As precipitation in the basin is expected to increase, the projected mean annual inflow and hydropower generation of the TGR will increase by 3.3-5.6% and 0.9-2.3% in 2040-2065, 7.9%-15.2% and 5.2-8.1% in 2080-2099 respectively. These increases are only statistically significant for 2080-2099 and are seasonally concentrated in the spring before the flood season and the early autumn during the end of the flood season. However, the inter-annual variation of power generation will increase specially in the dry season. The reservoir performance is highly sensitive to the changes in the seasonal distribution and extremes of streamflow. Increases in streamflow that occur in the flood season cause significant increases in the amount of spilled water and advance the time when the reservoir reaches the normal storage level. Additionally, increases in both the inter-annual variation of inflow and the intensity of inflow shortages during extreme drought years in the impounding stage drive decreases in the fully filled rate and average water storage level in the dry season. The utilization rate of water resources under projected extreme streamflow is expected to decrease, reshaping the response of power generation to climate change into a non-linear pattern where increases in streamflow do not proportionally translate to increases in power generation. These findings highlight the complexity of hydropower management and production under future climate change scenarios, motivating the need for introducing detailed regulating models for impact assessment studies and adaptive adjustment of the reservoir management to combat climate change.

This study focuses on changing flood risk in England, UK, and examines the policy framework and actions that underpin England's adaptation from a flood risk management (FRM) perspective. Specifically, the flood risk projections that fed into the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment were analysed alongside newly developed FRM adaptation portfolios that modified the flood risk projections to identify the potential of different measures to reduce Expected Annual Damages (EAD). The key findings indicate that: the range of EAD for all flood sources combined is projected to increase by 18-160% by the 2080s depending on the climate change, population growth and adaptation assumptions applied; adopting an enhanced adaptation approach presents an opportunity to manage much of the climate driven change in flood risk, particularly from river flooding; EAD from coastal flood risk shows the greatest increase relative to present day; and surface water flooding will become an increasingly more significant source of flood risk. Interpretation of the results in the context of the policy framework shows how greater coordination and integration of risk managers and interventions is required to improve adaptation planning.

Snowmelt introduces varying runoff patterns throughout the year depending on the size and saturation of the snowpack. Similarly, burn-scarred landscapes following wildfires can significantly enhance flood flows, sediment, and debris in streams and rivers. Extreme flood and debris flows produced from these conditions significantly affect downstream transportation infrastructure, causing damage to bridges, culverts, and roadways. A baseline stormwater management model (SWMM) was composed to understand the watershed hydrology assuming only rainfall precipitation and natural, healed land cover. Subsequent modeling of the independent variables determined the degree of hydrologic change based on project climate stressors and to what degree the infrastructure is affected. The final goal was to identify the most cost-effective adaptation solution that meets all agency and community standards and needs. The Little Indian Creek Culvert Assessment provides a useful pilot, and draft tools and process, to inform similar projects at departments of transportation.

J	Ylipaa, J; Gabrielsson, S; Jerneck, A				Ylipaa, Josephine; Gabrielsson, Sara; Jerneck, Anne			Climate Change Adaptation and Gender Inequality: Insights from Rural Vietnam	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						agriculture; climate change adaptation; gender inequality; feminist political ecology; vulnerability; policy; sustainability; Vietnam	LAND; VULNERABILITY; URBANIZATION; AGRICULTURE; NGOS	Vietnam is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts, especially from extreme weather events such as storms and floods. Thus, climate change adaptation is crucial, especially for natural resource-dependent farmers. Based on a qualitative research approach using a feminist political ecology lens, this article investigates gendered patterns of rural agrarian livelihoods and climate adaptation in the province of Thai Binh. In doing so, we identify differentiated rights and responsibilities between female and male farmers, leading to unequal opportunities and immobility for females, making them more vulnerable to climate impacts and threatening to reduce their capacity to adapt. This research also shows that demands on farmers to contribute to perpetual increases in agricultural output by the state poses a challenge, since farming livelihoods in Vietnam are increasingly becoming feminised, as a result of urbanisation and devaluation of farming. Past and present national strategies and provincial implementation plans linked to climate change do not consider the burden affecting rural female farmers, instead the focus lies on addressing technical solutions to adaptation. With little attention being paid to an increasingly female workforce, existing gender inequalities may be exacerbated, threatening the future existence of rural livelihoods and the viability of Vietnam's expansion into global markets.

J	Molla, E; Melka, Y; Desta, G				Molla, Esubalew; Melka, Yoseph; Desta, Getnet			Determinants of farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change impacts in northwestern Ethiopia	HELIYON			English	Article						Adaptation; Agro-ecologies; Climate change; Multinomial logit regression; Bure Zuria district	SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; VARIABILITY; CHOICE	Climate change and related extreme events have become global challenges in ensuring sustainable development. This affects water availability and agricultural production, particularly in developing countries. This study explored the factors affecting farmers' adaptation mechanisms to climate change in different agro-ecological zones of the Bure Zuria district of northwestern Ethiopia. A household survey, focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and observations were used to acquire primary data on farmers' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, adaptation strategies and potential barriers. About 190 randomly selected households from different agro-ecologies were included in this study. Moreover, reports and published sources were used to acquire secondary data. Data were analyzed using a multinomial logit regression model and descriptive statistics. The results indicated that soil and water conservation practices (26.7%) were the main adaptation responses in highland agro-ecology. In contrast, supplementary feeding for livestock (56%) was the main adaptation response to the adverse effects of climate extremes in lowland agro-ecology. Farmers identified land scarcity (25.84%) and shortage of water for irrigation (28.57%) as major barriers to adaptation in the highland and lowland agro-ecologies, respectively. In addition, agro-ecology, education level, age, active labor, number of livestock (TLU), off-farm income, frequency of extension contacts, credit access, and market access were decisive factors affecting farmers' adaptation mechanisms to withstand extreme climatic events. In conclusion, soil and water conservation practices are more practiced in highland areas than in lowland areas. Because the steepness of farmlands and erodible soils increase farmers' vulnerability to flood hazards in highland areas than in lowland areas. It is suggested that investigations on the climate change-induced gender-differentiated impacts shall be conducted to design all-inclusive and effective responses.

This study aims to assess the potential influences of climate change on extreme rainfall characteristics in flood-vulnerable city of Adama. Daily precipitation records of 1967-2016 and projection of global circulation models (GCMs): CanESM2 and HadCM3 for 2021-2070 were disaggregated into shorter time resolutions using the Hyetos model. Gumbel type I probability distribution and power-regression model (i = aD(b)) were used for deducing intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and for describing their functions, respectively. The extreme rainfall intensity of the historical and future periods for a range of storm durations and return periods were compared and contrasted. A close agreement is obtained between the observed and the modeled rainfall intensity with high values of coefficient of determination (> 0.996) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (> 0.850). Besides, statistically significant (p < 0.05) direct linear relationship is found between the return periods and the coefficient parameter of the IDF models. Moreover, the intensity of extreme precipitation over 2021-2070 in Adama city would increase up to 49.5%, depending on storm duration and return period considered. This could have consequences of the way the city's drainage infrastructures are designed, operated, and sustained. Hence, flood-prone areas should be recognized in order to formulate effective strategies for mitigation and adaption of potential impacts. The standards for designing future drainage infrastructures should also be updated aiming to reflect the effects of climatic change.

In recent decades, China has experienced rapid economic development and became the second-largest economy in the world. This rapid economic expansion has led to large-scale changes in terrestrial (e.g., land use and land cover changes), aquatic (e.g., construction of reservoirs and artificial wetlands) and marine (e.g., land reclamation) environments across the country. Together with climate change, these changes may significantly influence flood risk and, in turn, compromise SDG achievements. The Luanhe River Basin (LRB) is one of the most afforested basins in North China and has undergone significant urbanisation and land use change since the 1950s. However, basin-wide flood risk assessment under different development scenarios has not been considered, although this is critically important to inform policy-making to manage the synergies and trade-offs between the SDGs and support long-term sustainable development. Using mainly open data, this paper introduces a new framework for systematically assessing flood risk under different social and economic development scenarios. A series of model simulations are performed to investigate the flood risk under different land use change scenarios projected to 2030 to reflect different development strategies. The results are systematically analysed and compared with the baseline simulation based on the current land use and climate conditions. Further investigations are also provided to consider the impact of climate change and the construction of dams and reservoirs. The results potentially provide important guidance to inform future development strategies to maximise the synergies and minimise the trade-offs between various SDGs in LRB.

The effects will not be limited to a rising average temperature and changing rainfall patterns, but also to increasing severity and frequency in droughts, heat stress and floods. Agriculture is not only impacted upon by climate change but also contributes to global warming. However, not all agricultural systems affect negatively climate change. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system that promotes continuous no or minimum soil disturbance (i.e. no tillage), maintenance of a permanent soil mulch cover, and diversification of plant species. Through these principles it enhances biodiversity and natural biological processes above and below the ground surface, so contributing to increased water and nutrient use efficiency and productivity, to more resilient cropping systems, and to improved and sustained crop production. Conservation Agriculture is based on the practical application of three interlinked principles along with complementary good agricultural practice. The characteristics of CA make it one of the systems best able to contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. In this article, the carbon sequestration potential of CA is assessed, both in annual and perennial crops, in the different agro-climatic regions of Africa. In total, the potential estimate of annual carbon sequestration in African agricultural soils through CA amounts to 143 Tg of C per year, that is 524 Tg of CO2 per year. This figure represents about 93 times the current sequestration figure.

In this context, the present study aims at quantifying the potential impacts of climate change for the city of Badalona. A comprehensive pluvial flood multi risk assessment has been carried out for the entire municipality. The assessment has a twofold target: People safety, based on both pedestrians' and vehicles' stability, and impacts on the economic sector in terms of direct damages on properties and vehicles, and indirect damages due to businesses interruption. Risks and damages have also been assessed for the projected future rainfall conditions which enabled the comparison with the current ones, thereby estimating their potential increment. Moreover, the obtained results should be the first step to assess the efficiency of adaptation measures. The novelty of this paper is the integration of a detailed 1D/2D urban drainage model with multiple risk criteria. Although, the proposed methodology was tested for the case study of Badalona (Spain), it can be considered generally applicable to other urban areas affected by pluvial flooding.

As well as offering financial protection against the impacts of climate change, insurers can promote behavioural change by stimulating individuals' preparedness choices. Norm nudges aim to improve preparedness for risks through information provision that appeals to social norms. Based on data collected in an online experiment among homeowners, we tested for the influence on flood insurance demand of providing individuals with a norm nudge about the flood insurance purchase decisions of their neighbours. Potential moderators of the effectiveness of this norm nudge were examined, such as whether the norm is consistent with homeowners' prior beliefs as well as whether homeowners trust insurance agents, who are used as the messenger of the norm. Based on this investigation, we suggest recommendations for policies that aim to improve preparedness against increasing losses related to climate change.	[Robinson, Peter John; Botzen, W. J.

Nevertheless, aquaculture in Bangladesh has faced recent concerns due to climate change. Aquaculture is vulnerable to a combination of climatic factors, such as global warming, rainfall variation, flood, drought, temperature fluctuation, and salinity change. Considering the vulnerability of fish production to the impacts of climate change, tilapia farming is one of the possible strategies for adaptation to climate change. The positive culture attributes of tilapia are their tolerance to low water levels and poor water quality with rainfall variation, temperature fluctuation, and salinity change. In fact, tilapia farming is possible in a wide range of water environments, including freshwater, brackish water, and saltwater conditions. We suggest that appropriate tilapia culture strategies with institutional support and collaboration with key stakeholders are needed for adaptation to environmental change.

However, the relationships among different factors may not be well explained by traditional statistical methods. In this study, we took one of the highly urbanized regions, Central Taihu Basin, as an example. Linear regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) were used for regression and the attributions of climate change and human activities on water level alterations at different scales from 1961 to 2018 were quantified by residual analysis. The regression results indicated that SVM performed best. Water level at each scale showed an increasing trend and human activities were the dominant influence. The altered period was further divided into three sub-periods and human activities contributed the most in the sub-period II (2000-2009). Finally, the importance of thirtyeight factors were quantified by RF based on daily data series from 2008 to 2018. The results showed that cumulative antecedent precipitation (CAP) of five days was one of the important climate factors and daily maximum discharge of sluices were the important human activities factors. The methods and results of this study can help to provide support in flood control.

If such adaptation does not occur in a timely manner, then it could result in socio-economic problems that will reverberate throughout the region. Using examples of coastal Asia-Pacific cities that are characterised by contrasting geographical settings and cultural contexts, this study argues that the main barrier to such adaptation is path dependency. In this sense, path dependency is a legacy of past decisions that have been influenced by topography, economic goals, and the cultural-political characteristics of key decision-making groups. These path dependencies manifest as various adaptation preferences, which to date have been dominated by hard engineering solutions. In an era of accelerating climate change there is now a need to seek alternatives to in-situ urban growth. This paper argues that an understanding of a city's path dependency is key to optimizing the effectiveness of future adaptation.

Climate change has critical consequences for avian breeding ecology, geographic ranges, and migration phenology. Changing precipitation and temperature patterns affect habitat, food resources, and other aspects of birds' life history strategies. Such changes may disproportionately affect species confined to rare or declining ecosystems, such as temperate grasslands, which are among the most altered and endangered ecosystems globally. We examined the influence of changing weather on the dickcissel (Spiza americana), a migratory songbird of conservation concern that is an obligate grassland specialist. Our study area in the North American Great Plains features high historic weather variability, where climate change is now driving higher precipitation and temperatures as well as higher frequencies of extreme weather events including flooding and droughts. Dickcissels share their breeding grounds with brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), brood parasites that lay their eggs in the nests of other songbirds, reducing dickcissel productivity. We used 9 years of capture-recapture data collected over an 18-year period to test the hypothesis that increasing precipitation on dickcissels' riparian breeding grounds is associated with abundance declines and increasing vulnerability to cowbird parasitism. Dickcissels declined with increasing June precipitation, whereas cowbirds, by contrast, increased. Dickcissel productivity appeared to be extremely low, with a 3:1 ratio of breeding male to female dickcissels likely undermining reproductive success. Our findings suggest that increasing precipitation predicted by climate change models in this region may drive future declines of dickcissels and other songbirds. Drivers of these declines may include habitat and food resource loss related to flooding and higher frequency precipitation events as well as increased parasitism pressure by cowbirds. Positive correlations of June-July precipitation, temperature, and time since grazing with dickcissel productivity did not mitigate dickcissels' declining trend in this ecosystem. These findings highlight the importance of empirical research on the effects of increasing precipitation and brood parasitism vulnerability on migratory songbird conservation to inform adaptive management under climate change.

Various climate-driven extremes, i.e., drought, heat waves, erratic and intense rainfall patterns, storms, floods, and emerging insect pests have adversely affected the livelihood of the farmers. Future climatic predictions showed a significant increase in temperature, and erratic rainfall with higher intensity while variability exists in climatic patterns for climate extremes prediction. For mid-century (2040-2069), it is projected that there will be a rise of 2.8 degrees C in maximum temperature and a 2.2 degrees C in minimum temperature in Pakistan. To respond to the adverse effects of climate change scenarios, there is a need to optimize the climate-smart and resilient agricultural practices and technology for sustainable productivity. Therefore, a case study was carried out to quantify climate change effects on rice and wheat crops and to develop adaptation strategies for the rice-wheat cropping system during the mid-century (2040-2069) as these two crops have significant contributions to food production. For the quantification of adverse impacts of climate change in farmer fields, a multidisciplinary approach consisted of five climate models (GCMs), two crop models (DSSAT and APSIM) and an economic model [Trade-off Analysis, Minimum Data Model Approach (TOAMD)] was used in this case study. DSSAT predicted that there would be a yield reduction of 15.2% in rice and 14.1% in wheat and APSIM showed that there would be a yield reduction of 17.2% in rice and 12% in wheat. Adaptation technology, by modification in crop management like sowing time and density, nitrogen, and irrigation application have the potential to enhance the overall productivity and profitability of the rice-wheat cropping system under climate change scenarios. Moreover, this paper reviews current literature regarding adverse climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, associated main issues, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable productivity of agriculture to ensure food security in Asia. Flowing opportunities such as altering sowing time and planting density of crops, crop rotation with legumes, agroforestry, mixed livestock systems, climate resilient plants, livestock and fish breeds, farming of monogastric livestock, early warning systems and decision support systems, carbon sequestration, climate, water, energy, and soil smart technologies, and promotion of biodiversity have the potential to reduce the negative effects of climate change.

This study examines the perception of climate change and its impact on the lives and livelihoods of high mountain communities in Gilgit-Baltistan. Empirical evidence was gathered through four focused group discussions and thirty in-depth interviews with the local communities in Darkut and Shishkat areas. This study found that the local communities perceive a noticeable change in temperature patterns in terms of an increase in average temperatures and shorter winters. Such changes lead to the melting of glaciers and subsequently frequent floods during summer. The communities argue that a decrease in snowfall and alterations in the timing of snowfall directly affect the region's water supply. These changes impact the region's key livelihood activities, such as livestock rearing and agriculture, leading to reduced productivity, and an increased reliance on external food sources. This study emphasizes the urgent need for community-based adaptation strategies and support for climate-resilient livelihoods in these regions. It underscores the importance of incorporating the perspectives and experiences of high mountain communities when formulating policies and strategies to address the multifaceted impacts of climate change in mountainous areas.

We use a world economy model that covers almost all the countries around the world, and distinguishes between rural and urban regions as well as between flooded and unflooded areas. The model is calibrated to match international and internal mobility data by education level for the last 30 years, and is then simulated under climate change variants. We endogenize the size, dyadic, and skill structure of climate migration. When considering moderate climate scenarios, we predict mobility responses in the range of 70-108 million workers over the course of the twenty-first century. Most of these movements are local or inter-regional. South-South international migration responses are smaller, while the South-North migration response is of the "brain drain" type and induces a permanent increase in the number of foreigners in OECD countries in the range of 6-9% only. Changes in the sea level mainly translate into forced local movements. By contrast, inter-regional and international movements are sensitive to temperature-related changes in productivity. Lastly, we show that relaxing international migration restrictions may exacerbate the poverty effect of climate change at origin if policymakers are unable to select/screen individuals in extreme poverty.

Coupling a land surface model with a hydrodynamic model for regional flood risk assessment due to climate change: Application to the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; flood depth; flood inundation; flood risk; global climate models; HEC-RAS; land surface model	UNITED-STATES; HYDROLOGICAL EVALUATION; FREQUENCY; WATER; DROUGHTS	An increase in heavy precipitation associated with climate change has exacerbated flooding in the Eastern U.S. To assess regional flood risk with changing climatic conditions, we demonstrate the application of a novel hydrologic modeling framework that integrates climate projections with a coupled Noah-MP land surface model and a two-dimensional HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model. We employ this framework along a 41 km reach of the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where recent flood damages exceeded $2 billion (2011 Irene and Lee floods). Historical and future 30-year and 100-year peak-discharge estimates were compared to assess how flood risk might be altered due to climate change. Results indicate that precipitation increases from climate change do not always lead to increases in flood risk, because interplay of hydrological components in the watershed, which are considered by Noah-MP, largely controls flooding severity. However, climate change is expected to increase the severity of extreme events; if a 50-year flood (the recurrence interval of Tropical Storm Lee) occurred toward the end of the 21st century in the worst-case emission scenario, then flood volume would increase by 40% and flood extent by 15%, due to an increase in soil moisture from a wetter overall climate.

In particular, changes in precipitation, temperature, and weather systems are increasing the occurrence frequency of natural phenomena such as floods and landslides with consequent negative impacts in exposure and vulnerability of population living in risk areas. Hence, it is important to assess the social vulnerability and the community resilience which describe the ability of social systems to prepare for, absorb, and adapt to risks induced by climate change. In two sample areas located along the Tyrrhenian side of Calabria (Amantea and Lago municipalities, Southern Italy), we performed a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) of community resilience. Based on previous literature, we have selected five macro-indicators of social resilience (awareness, knowledge, information, trust, and social background). As sub-indicators for the characterization of these macro-indicators, we used the answers of the questions on climate change effects of a questionnaire submitted to citizens living in the sample areas, and, then, a specific weight was assigned to each sub-indicator, as well as to the macro-indicators. The multi-criteria analysis allowed to the classification of the studied areas in terms of an index of social resilience and to the individuation of the most influential macro-indicators for each of them. The results show that the two areas, which have similar resilience's values, are influenced by different macro-indicators: knowledge and awareness for Amantea and information and trust for Lago. The findings of this study can be considered very useful for the management of vulnerable areas to climate change, because they are able to underline the aspects needing attention. In fact, providing information about the nuances of the resilience of community exposed to risks may help decision-makers in adopting and implementing more effective preventive measures to mitigate negative effects of climate change, fitting on local characteristics.

One widely used hydrological model SWAT, 11 Global Climate Models (GCMs), two statistical downscaling methods, four dynamical downscaling datasets, and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are applied to construct 22 scenarios to project runoff. Hydrology variables in historical and future periods are compared to investigate their variations, and the uncertainties associated with climate change and downscaling methods are also analyzed. The results show that future temperatures will increase under all scenarios and will increase more under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, while future precipitation will increase under 16 scenarios. Future runoff tends to decrease under 13 out of the 22 scenarios. We also found that the mean runoff changes ranging from -38.38% to 33.98%. Future monthly runoff increases in May, June, September, and October and decreases in all the other months. Different downscaling methods have little impact on the lower envelope of runoff, and they mainly impact the upper envelope of the runoff. The impact of climate change can be regarded as the main source of the runoff uncertainty during the flood period (from May to September), while the impact of downscaling methods can be regarded as the main source during the non-flood season (from October to April). This study separated the uncertainty impact of different factors, and the results could provide very important information for water resource management.

Martin			Climate change contributions to future atmospheric river flood damages in the western United States	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							WATER-VAPOR; PRECIPITATION; CMIP5; CALIFORNIA; PROJECTION; FREQUENCY; AIRCRAFT; TRACKING; WINTER; SCALE	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) generate most of the economic losses associated with flooding in the western United States and are projected to increase in intensity with climate change. This is of concern as flood damages have been shown to increase exponentially with AR intensity. To assess how AR-related flood damages are likely to respond to climate change, we constructed county-level damage models for the western 11 conterminous states using 40 years of flood insurance data linked to characteristics of ARs at landfall. Damage functions were applied to 14 CMIP5 global climate models under the RCP4.5 "intermediate emissions" and RCP8.5 "high emissions" scenarios, under the assumption that spatial patterns of exposure, vulnerability, and flood protection remain constant at present day levels. The models predict that annual expected AR-related flood damages in the western United States could increase from $1 billion in the historical period to $2.3 billion in the 2090s under the RCP4.5 scenario or to $3.2 billion under the RCP8.5 scenario. County-level projections were developed to identify counties at greatest risk, allowing policymakers to target efforts to increase resilience to climate change.

J	Tomby, S; Zhang, J				Tomby, Sasenarine; Zhang, Jing			Vulnerability assessment of Guyanese sugar to floods	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; AGRICULTURAL VULNERABILITY; INDICATORS	Climate change is an ongoing process that has profound impacts on global environment and economy. This study focused on floods impacting Guyanese sugar industry. The study developed a conceptual framework representing an agriculture system's vulnerability to a climate change stimulus/stimuli to assist in selecting indicators that can more accurately and realistically represent vulnerability. The development of a conceptual framework followed the IPCC (2007) framework composing of three vulnerability factors, that is, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity; however, it added some novelty as to how each of these factors is defined, their relationships, sequence of their occurrences, and their attributes. This study uses an impact-based approach to identify sensitivity indicators by investigating the impacts of floods on Guyanese sugar. This methodology resulted in indicators that can realistically measure an agriculture system's vulnerability to a climate change stimulus/stimuli. Multiple indicators were used to measure sugar vulnerability with experts' opinions used to assign weights (by the Analytical Hierarchy Process) to both the vulnerability factors and their indicators to arrive at annual sugar vulnerability indexes for the period 2003 to 2016. The study showed that Guyanese sugar was highly vulnerable to floods and adaptation measures were identified to target specific indicators.

The verification was carried out for two criterial rainfalls: the Euler model rainfall with occurrence frequency C = 3 years and an actual rainfall with C = 5 years. Two parameters: degree of flooding (DOF) and specific flood volume (SPY) were adopted to indicate potential system overloads. The simulations showed numerous outflows from the sewers, which means, that the investigated system needs adapting to climate changes. The causes of this should be sought in the too small diameters of the sewers and so in the insufficient hydraulic capacity of the sewerage system dimensioned in the past using methods which are inadequate today.

Flooding and the interannual variability of hydrologic quantities in the Missouri River basin	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Missouri River; interannual variability; flooding; reservoir release; climate change	ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE TRANSPORT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; US PRECIPITATION; AIR-TEMPERATURE; CHINOOK WINDS; SNOW COVER; WATER; SURFACE; SIMULATIONS; INTERPOLATION	The six mainstem reservoirs in the Missouri River basin (MRB) are managed mainly to prevent flooding from snowmelt and heavy rainfall, a goal for which the interannual variabilities of precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and surface air temperature (T-air) are vitally important. We tested the hypothesis that under the expected higher variability owing to global climate change, the months with the highest contributions to the interannual variability of P, ET, and T-air in the MRB will remain unchanged and quantified likely temporal trends in these quantities. Using high- resolution, downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi- model ensemble data sets, we compared the multi-year ratio of monthly and annual interannual variability and temporal trends in P, ET, and T-air during 2011-2020 with three future decades. Results showed that the 6 months with the highest interannual variability in P and ET(April-September) are the same in all four decades. However, for T-air, only 4 months (December-March) retain their status as highly variable throughout the four decades; September and October variability is exceeded by the variability in other months. This implies that, compared to P and ET, the cyclical change in the probabilities of T-air in the MRB is less stable under future global climate change. This finding can be used to consider the need to alter existing strategies for reservoir release while minimizing the likelihood of aggravating flooding below the reservoirs.

The impact of climate change on the prevalence of mental illness symptoms	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Major Depressive Disorder; Climate Change; Tropical Cyclone; Storm Surge; Sea Level Rise; Hurricane	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; SEA-LEVEL RISE; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; TROPICAL CYCLONES; NATURAL DISASTER; HEALTH; COMORBIDITY; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY	Background:: The repercussions of climate change threaten the population with an increased prevalence of extreme climate events. We explored the impact of climate change induced sea level rise (SLR) and tropical cyclone (TC) exposure on mental illness symptom prevalence. Methods:: Using three datasets, TC exposure scores were calculated for each subject to determine how exposure affects posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptom prevalence. Inundation mapping of various SLR and storm surge (SS) scenarios were performed for the susceptible region of Miami-Dade and Broward counties to determine the population impact of flooding. Results:: We found an elevated risk of mental illness symptoms from exposure to more high- intensity TCs and identified demographic variables that may contribute to this risk. Furthermore, inundation mapping demonstrated severe and widespread impact of SLR and SS on the mental health of communities. Limitations:: This study did not include data directly measuring comorbidity, resilience, preparedness, or ability to adapt to climate change. Also, multiple imputation using chained equations may have been imperfect. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in predicting and mapping SLR and TC intensity, which limits complete confidence in our SS predictions. Conclusion:: The impacts of climate change have been frequently studied in terms of physical health, natural disaster prevalence, and economic impacts, but rarely on mental health burden. However, it is vital that national, state, and local governments develop and deploy plans to address mental health needs along with expenditures for protecting infrastructure, the economy, and physical health from the combined effects of SLR and climate change-induced natural disasters.

J	McCarney, R; Kent, J				McCarney, Rosemary; Kent, Jonathan			Forced displacement and climate change: Time for global governance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Forced migration; climate change; global governance; human rights; international cooperation		Climate change and its relatively slow-onset effects like sea level rise, desertification, and water salinization and associated sudden onset effects like floods, hurricanes and droughts, is perhaps the major emerging risk to rich and poor nations and the most vulnerable people within them. But the current system of global governance is entirely insufficient to cope with, let alone effectively respond to, the looming crisis of climate displacement. This policy brief discusses the current state of the global governance of climate displacement and identifies a number of substantive and organizational legal and policy elements in need of rapid implementation and development. The intent of this brief is to inform public debate and policy discourse on the challenges and opportunities toward improving the global governance of climate displacement.

Climate change is a health crisis with opportunities for health care action: A focus on health care providers, patients with asthma and allergic immune diseases, and their families and neighbors	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review						Greenhouse gas emissions; heat; extreme weather; asthma; atopic dermatitis; mechanisms	MORTALITY; WEATHER; DEATHS	Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events and compounded natural disasters. Heat, wildfires, flooding, and pollen are already threatening public health and disproportionately affecting individuals in susceptible situations and vulnerable locations. In this theme issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, we address what is known and not known about the biologic as well as clinical upstream and downstream effects of climate change on asthma and allergy development and exacerbation. We present potential actions that individuals can take at the family, neighborhood, community, health care system, and national and international levels to build climate resilience and protect their own health and the health and welfare of others. We emphasize the importance of actions and policies that are context specific and just. We emphasize the need for the health care system, which contributes between 3% and 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce its carbon footprint and build resiliency. Health care providers play a pivotal role in helping policymakers understand the effects of climate on the health of our patients. There is still a window to avoid the most serious effects of climate change on human health and our planet. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2023;152:1047-52.)

J	Raghav, P; Eldho, TI				Raghav, Pushpendra; Eldho, T., I			Investigations on the hydrological impacts of climate change on a river basin using macroscale model H08	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE			English	Article						H08 hydrological model; climate change; RCP; CMIP5; regional impacts; GCM	SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER-BALANCE; SURFACE-WATER; RAINFALL; TRENDS; SIMULATION; RESOURCES	In this study, the hydrometeorological impacts of climate change in the Upper Godavari River basin in India are quantified for historical and future periods using a well-calibrated hydrological model H08. The study provides a quantitative assessment of various hydrological fluxes projected for the future that are useful in water resource planning and management. The results revealed that under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) climate scenarios, the rainfall in the entire basin was projected to increase by similar to 24.4% (33%) and temperature by similar to 2.3 degrees C (4.65 degrees C), the runoff increased by similar to 44.8% (63%) and the evapotranspiration increased by similar to 9.8% (12%), by the end of 21st century in the basin. Further, changes were larger in the wet season for all the variables except temperature, which had a larger change in the dry season. This shows that rainfall will be more frequent in the wet season and will result in high runoff generation that may result in a flood-like situation. These results are useful for adaptive measures required to deal with possible climate change impacts in the basin to ensure food and water security.

J	Spence, A; Leygue, C; Andeane, PO				Spence, Alexa; Leygue, Caroline; Ortega Andeane, Patricia			Sustainability following adversity: Power outage experiences are related to greater energy saving intentions in the United Kingdom and Mexico	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Community; Flooding; Power outage; Energy saving intentions; Environmental experience	EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; SECURITY; FLOOD; BEHAVIOR; DETERIORATION; RESILIENCE; MITIGATION	Concerns about climate change and energy security, and related behaviour may be impacted by experiences such as flooding and power outages and we consider that impacts may be different for individual and social actions. Our first study, using online survey data from a quota sample in the UK (N = 1543) found that concerns about climate change and energy security differed for people who had recent power outage experience compared to those who did not; with small but significant effects. A mediation model analysis found that people who had experienced power outages were more likely to intend to engage in social energy saving behaviours, partially mediated by concerns about climate change and energy security. Our second study used survey data from a convenience sample in Mexico City (N = 661). Here a further mediation analysis indicated that people who had experienced higher levels of power outages or flooding were more likely to intend to engage in social energy saving behaviours. In aggregate no significant impacts of experiences on individual energy saving behaviours were found. We conclude that shared adverse experiences may promote prosocial interactions around environmental issues and that there is a key role for communications around environmental experiences in order to promote sustainable behaviour.

J	Plein, C				Plein, Christopher			Resilience, Adaptation, and Inertia: Lessons from Disaster Recovery in a Time of Climate Change	SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY			English	Article							COMMUNITY RESILIENCE	Objectives To examine and assess sociocultural or socioeconomic inertia as an impediment to effective climate change policy response and practice. Methods Two core concepts to climate change policy response, "resilience" and "adaptation," are seen as critical in disaster recovery strategies and practice. As ideal types, these concepts are coalescing in theory and gaining acceptance in the professional community, but not necessarily in practice. These concepts are explored through a study of disaster recovery efforts following the West Virginia floods of 2016. Results Disaster recovery strategies based on ideal forms of resilience and adaptation face significant barriers to adoption and practice. Disjunction between theory and practice constitutes one form of inertia. Other contributing factors include individual and collective behavior that resists change through social justification and insular forms of social capital. Institutional drag, in the form of waning political will and limited administrative capacity, also impedes adoption and use. Conclusion Sociocultural and socioeconomic inertia challenge the development of effective policies and practices to address climate change; social science can contribute to our understanding of these sources of constraint.

S	Evans, GW		Fiske, ST		Evans, Gary W.			Projected Behavioral Impacts of Global Climate Change	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY, VOL 70	Annual Review of Psychology		English	Review; Book Chapter						climate change; droughts; extreme weather; floods; storms; temperature	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; COLD SUMMER WEATHER; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; AIR-POLLUTION; MENTAL-HEALTH; HURRICANE KATRINA; NATURAL DISASTER; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CONSTRAINED RESTORATION	The projected behavioral impacts of global climate change emanate from environmental changes including temperature elevation, extreme weather events, and rising air pollution. Negative affect, interpersonal and intergroup conflict, and possibly psychological distress increase with rising temperature. Droughts, floods, and severe storms diminish quality of life, elevate stress, produce psychological distress, and may elevate interpersonal and intergroup conflict. Recreational opportunities are compromised by extreme weather, and children may suffer delayed cognitive development. Elevated pollutants concern citizens and may accentuate psychological distress. Outdoor recreational activity is curtailed by ambient pollutants. Limitations and issues in need of further investigation include the following: lack of data on direct experience with climate change rather than indirect assessments related to projected changes; poor spatial resolution in environmental exposures and behavioral assessments; few rigorous quasi-experimental studies; overreliance on self-reports of behavioral outcomes; little consideration of moderator effects; and scant investigation of underlying psychosocial processes to explain projected behavioral impacts.
