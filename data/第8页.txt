This brings new challenges to current water management strategies. This research is aimed to create, apply, and provide a novel indicator named Circularity Index for Dams/Reservoirs (CIDR) that allows the determination of the water circularity level on the dual dam/reservoir system; that is to evaluate the water efficiency levels and the circular water flows for the processes at a site. This new method has hydrological, economic, and environmental variables as well as social ones. This indicator is defined as the sum of the scores of the eleven indicators comprising the model multiplied by the weight. The method has been implemented giving the same weight for each indicator. It has been successfully applied in the 18 dam/reservoir systems managed by the Duero River Basin, located in the region of "Castilla y Leon" (Spain). The CIDR provides maximum information in a single indicator value ranging from 0 to 55. A higher value of CIDR indicates a better practice of water circularity management. The results probe the increased utility of the index and suggest that six dams/reservoirs present high circularity of water flow.

J	Tuset, J; Barriendos, M; Barriendos, J				Tuset, Jordi; Barriendos, Mariano; Barriendos, Josep			Historical Floods on the Spanish Mediterranean Basin: A Methodological Proposal for the Classification of Information at High Spatio-Temporal Resolution-AMICME Database (CE 1035-2022)	LAND			English	Article						classification tools; climatic hazards; databases; documentary sources; flood events; historical floods	CATASTROPHIC FLOODS; EVENTS; RIVERS	The uncertainties raised by climate change in the Mediterranean region justify a detailed study on rainfall regime over a long time scale. This study is not just about reconstructing and characterizing climate variability, but also identifying the hydrometeorological episodes of greater severity and low frequency. These phenomena, such as floods and droughts, affect the availability of water resources, generate casualties and have significant impacts on human activity. In this context of global warming, knowledge of past extreme hydrometeorological events has gained importance over time. Moreover, the ability to classify these past extreme events in order to compare them with current ones strengthens research capabilities. For this reason, this paper proposes a multivariable classification system for flood episodes, both historical and recent. The classification considers the physical conditions of a flood, its damage to structures and its social impacts. The proposed methodology has been applied to the AMICME flood database for the Spanish Mediterranean catchment areas from CE 1035 to 2022. This paper shows the application of this methodology for six flood episodes from different centuries and locations. It has been possible to display all the indexed information for the different flood cases of every episode through cartographic summary representations. Results prove the adaptability of the classification system to different hydrographical and historical contexts.

J	Ayyad, M; Hajj, MR; Marsooli, R				Ayyad, Mahmoud; Hajj, Muhammad R.; Marsooli, Reza			Machine learning-based assessment of storm surge in the New York metropolitan area	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							3RD-GENERATION WAVE MODEL; TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; NEURAL-NETWORK; COASTAL REGIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; PROJECTIONS; CITY; HURRICANES; FREQUENCY	Storm surge generated from low-probability high-consequence tropical cyclones is a major flood hazard to the New York metropolitan area and its assessment requires a large number of storm scenarios. High-fidelity hydrodynamic numerical simulations can predict surge levels from storm scenarios. However, an accurate prediction requires a relatively fine computational grid, which is computationally expensive, especially when including wave effects. Towards alleviating the computational burden, Machine Learning models are developed to determine long-term average recurrence of flood levels induced by tropical cyclones in the New York metropolitan area. The models are trained and verified using a data set generated from physics-based hydrodynamic simulations to predict peak storm surge height, defined as the maximum induced water level due to wind stresses on the water surface and wave setup, at four coastal sites. In the generated data set, the number of low probability high-level storm surges was much smaller than the number of high probability low-level storm surges. This resulted in an imbalanced data set, a challenge that is addressed and resolved in this study. The results show that return period curves generated based on storm surge predictions from machine learning models are in good agreement with curves generated from high-fidelity hydrodynamic simulations, with the advantage that the machine learning model results are obtained in a fraction of the computational time required to run the simulations.

Egemen			Analyzing radar rainfall estimate errors with three vector norms: application to weather radar rainfall data in Mugla, Turkey	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							BEAM BLOCKAGE CORRECTION; HOURLY RAINFALL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BAND; ATTENUATION; SENSITIVITY; ADJUSTMENT; ACCURACY; WSR-88D; RANGE	Over the past several decades, weather radar has become an indispensable tool in flood forecasting studies, especially in ungauged regions. However, the rainfall extremes with radar data may contain biases, and this can be removed by using the information provided by rain gauges. For this purpose, a procedure that covers additive and multiplicative error correction methods with three vector norms, taxicab norm (L-1), Euclidean norm (L-2), and maximum norm (L-infinity), is proposed for adjusting radar data. The top 26 flood events with 20 stations in a 5-year database of radar data are used to quantify the overall agreement between radar and gauge datasets. After finding the best model and norm for adjusting the error in radar data, the correction factor in the model is analyzed with the aspects of the season, station height, rainfall amount, and distance between radar location and rain gauge station. Results show that the multiplicative error model with L-1 norm minimization is the best choice given all criteria. It is noted that as the systematic error in the radar data is nonlinear, the additive factors are inconclusive in rainfall variability. Moreover, it is found out that the values in multiplicative constant evaluation are more apparent with grouping done for the season, rainfall amount, and distance, but a consistent result is not found for the grouping done for the station height.

J	Chai, N; Mao, C				Chai, Ning; Mao, Chun			Population management in an urban center using the dynamic integrated solution for an adequate atmospheric environmental quality	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Population management; Urban center; Atmospheric environmental quality; Dynamic integrated solution	ALGORITHM	Accelerated growth in urban populations has become a powerful force for human development, particularly in developed countries. Metropolitan cities are centers for technical and economic advancement, but air pollution, overflowing of water, and other climate effects still pose significant problems related to nature, climate, and the environment. Cities are vulnerable to increasingly dense, diverse, and interdependent urban systems. A single extreme occurrence can contribute to a systemic break-up of a city's infrastructure, often like dominoes. In this paper, a dynamic integration-assisted population management solution (DI-PMS) has been proposed. DI-PMS recognizes that the latest facilities' optimal usage of knowledge and technologies is needed to increase urbanization. They are one of the critical priorities of the weather community. Such integrated urban weather, environmental, and climate services will help cities address dangers including storms, floods, heatwaves, and air pollution, especially in climate change. The goal is to create urban facilities that satisfy communities' unique needs by high-resolution forecasting and pollution reduction climate services, which allow the construction of durable, robust, and thriving cities that support the Sustainable Development Goals. Several recent international surveys to explore these topics have been undertaken. DI-PMS gives a brief description of urban hydrometeorological, climate and air pollution activities, outlines the new urban integrated weather and environmental services concept, and emphasizes the need for science to be implemented.

Interdecadal variability of streamflow in the Hudson Bay Lowlands watersheds driven by atmospheric circulation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Hudson Bay Lowlands; Subarctic region; MESH; Streamflow; ERA5; Atmospheric circulation	HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; TRENDS; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; FREQUENCY; DISCHARGE; IMPACTS; REGIMES; ENSO	Study region: Hudson Bay Lowlands watersheds, Ontario, Canada. Study Focus: The rivers in the Hudson Bay Lowlands are a major source of freshwater entering the Arctic Ocean and they also cause major floods. In recent decades, this region has been affected by major changes in hydroclimatic processes attributed to climate change and natural climate variability. In this study, we used ERA5 reanalysis data, hydrometric observations, and the hydrological model MESH, to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation on the inter-decadal variability of streamflow between 1979 and 2018 in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. The natural climate variability was assessed using a weather regimes approach based on the discretization of daily geopotential height anomalies (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis, as well as large scale oceanic and atmospheric variability modes. New hydrological insights: The results showed an anomalous convergence of atmospheric moisture flux between 1995-2008 that enhanced precipitation and increased streamflow in the western part of the region. This moisture convergence was likely driven by the combination of (i) low pressure anomalies in the East Coast of North America and (ii) low pressure anomalies in western regions of Canada, associated with the cold phase of the pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). Since 2009, streamflow remains high, likely due to more groundwater discharge associated with the degradation of permafrost.	[Champagne, Olivier; Arain, M.

Study focus: For reducing the uncertainty in quantification of flood damage, the development of more reliable flood damage functions (FDFs) is crucial. This study therefore primarily aims to improve the FDFs developed by Win et al. (2018) for rice crops by collecting detailed damage data on recent floods in the Bago River Basin of Myanmar. Depth-duration-damage functions were developed for different growth stages of the rice crops. We then assessed the flood hazard and rice crop damage in the study area by integrating a two-dimensional diffusive-wave rainfall-runoff-inundation model and developed FDFs for validation. The developed FDFs was also applied in five selected river basins in five other Asian countries for validation of the FDFs. New hydrological insights for the region: This study presents new FDFs for rice crops that enable the quantitative estimation of rice yield losses for different growth stages of the rice crops. The estimated results regarding the flood damage to the rice crops agree reasonably with the reported data, indicating better estimations (mean absolute percentage error of 11 %). The developed FDFs can also be used in other areas in Asia where FDFs are unavailable.

Here we utilized high-resolution satellite images of CORONA KHA (1968), LISS IV (2012) and SENTINEL-2 MSI (2019), along with medium resolution images of LANDSAT TM (1990) and SRTM (2000) to carry out the research work. Analytical viewed strongly convinced that the selected glaciers receding continuously with non homogeneous retreat rate since 1968. During 1968 to 2019 the snout of the Swetvarn glacier lost similar to 623m total length with 12.21ma(-1) retreat rate, while the snout of Thelu glacier lost similar to 590m total length (11.56ma(-1)). Results further confirmed that about 16.60% glaciated area of Swetvarn glacier and 24.50% glaciated area of Thelu glacier also vanished completely between 1968 and 2019. During this tenure the ablation zone also shows 160m upward shift for Swetvarn glacier and 145m for Thelu glacier respectively. Overall analysis explains that three climatic trends of Garhwal Himalayan region; (1) catastrophic variation between rainfall and temperature during 1960-1990, (2) gradual increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, (3) increased liquid precipitation and decreased solid precipitation highly influences the process of melting of the study region.

Urban sprawl and green space depletion: Implications for flood incidence in Kumasi, Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urbanization; Urban planning; Urban sprawl; Impermeable space; Urban floods; Africa	LAND-COVER CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; RUNOFF; POLICY; INFRASTRUCTURE; ADAPTATION; METROPOLIS	Urban area expansion has often been cited as a flood inducing factor globally. However, there is a dearth of research on how the phenomenon influences the occurrence of floods in Ghana. This paper examines urban sprawl-induced green space depletion and its attendant implications for urban flood incidence in a developing world context. Focusing on Kumasi, the study employed a combined use of geospatial techniques, key informant interviews and direct observations to explain the relationships between urban sprawl and flood occurrence. The study found that impermeable areas have expanded by 54% from 1986 to 2016 while permeable space correspondingly declined by the same rate within the period due to unplanned and unregulated urban expansion. The high proportion of impermeable surface, caused by urban expansion, underlies the worsening flooding situation in Kumasi. But the myriad of other factors such as poor spatial planning, inadequate storm drain infrastructure, poor waste management practices, and law enforcement lax combine to increase the intensity and severity of the floods. Adopting and enforcing smart growth policies are key in addressing the uncontrolled urban expansion and its associated flood challenges. Besides, land use control through legislative enforcement and prioritizing greening by the city authorities and other key stakeholders are essential for effective flood control and mitigation in Kumasi.y	[Abass, Kabila; Buor, Daniel; Afriyie, Kwadwo; Dumedah, Gift; Segbefi, Alex Yao; Garsonu, Emmanuel Kofi; Forkuor, David; Ofosu, Andrews] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Kumasi, Ghana; [Guodaar, Lawrence] Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Dept Geog Environm & Populat GEP, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Adu-Gyamfi, Samuel; Mohammed, Abass] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Hist & Polit Studies, Kumasi, Ghana; [Gyasi, Razak M.] African Populat & Hlth Res Ctr, Ageing & Dev Unit, Nairobi, Kenya	Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; University of Adelaide; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; African Population & Health Research Centre	Abass, K (corresponding author), Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog & Rural Dev, Kumasi, Ghana.	kabass.cass@knust.edu.gh; drdrbuor@gmail.com; kwadwo_afriyie@yahoo.com; dgiftman@hotmail.com; segbefia@yahoo.com; guodaarlaw@gmail.com; garskofi@yahoo.co.uk; mcgyamfi@yahoo.com; bomsonsempaa@yahoo.com; fosua702@gmail.com; abass2x2@yahoo.com; rgyasi@aphrc.org	Segbefia, Alex Yao/JKH-6640-2023; Gyasi, Razak M/V-2309-2018	Segbefia, Alex Yao/0000-0002-3156-3549; Gyasi, Razak M/0000-0002-6733-1539; Buor, Daniel/0000-0003-1508-0341; Dumedah, Gift/0000-0002-1572-8104; Guodaar, Lawrence/0000-0003-3227-6709; Adu-Gyamfi, Samuel/0000-0002-0193-867X					72	46	46	15	52	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	2212-4209			INT J DISAST RISK RE	Int.

The regional deformation maps encompass various types of periglacial landforms and show that seasonal thaw effects are controlled by the sediment type and local topography. High seasonal ground movements are concentrated on shallow slopes and poor-drainage areas in unconsolidated, frost-susceptible and fine-grained sediments within glacier outwash plains, braided stream plains, alluvial deposits or floodplains. Fast subsidence due to thaw settlement takes place during June/July while frost heave is intense during December/January when two-sided freezing of pore water under pressure causes prolonged ice segregation near the permafrost table. The analysis reveals pervasive subsidence of the ground of up to similar to 2 cm/yr, and increasing by a factor of 2 to 5 from 2003 to today, in high-relief and well-drained areas. The findings suggest that seasonal thaw increasingly affects ice-rich layers at the permafrost table, as well as high-rates of widespread mass movements of non-consolidated sediments, the latter amplified by an increase of effects from frost heave/thaw settlement.

Ethylene Differentially Modulates Hypoxia Responses and Tolerance across <i>Solanum</i> Species	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						ethylene; flooding; hypoxia; phytoglobin; VII Ethylene Response Factor; PRT6 N-degron pathway of proteolysis; Solanum tuberosum; Solanum lycopersicum; Solanum dulcamara	END RULE PATHWAY; SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; ABIOTIC STRESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD SECURITY; OXYGEN; PLANTS; HEMOGLOBIN; EXPRESSION; GROWTH	The increasing occurrence of floods hinders agricultural crop production and threatens global food security. The majority of vegetable crops are highly sensitive to flooding and it is unclear how these plants use flooding signals to acclimate to impending oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). Previous research has shown that the early flooding signal ethylene augments hypoxia responses and improves survival in Arabidopsis. To unravel how cultivated and wildSolanumspecies integrate ethylene signaling to control subsequent hypoxia acclimation, we studied the transcript levels of a selection of marker genes, whose upregulation is indicative of ethylene-mediated hypoxia acclimation in Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that ethylene-mediated hypoxia acclimation is conserved in both shoots and roots of the wildSolanumspecies bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara) and a waterlogging-tolerant potato (Solanum tuberosum) cultivar. However, ethylene did not enhance the transcriptional hypoxia response in roots of a waterlogging-sensitive potato cultivar, suggesting that waterlogging tolerance in potato could depend on ethylene-controlled hypoxia responses in the roots. Finally, we show that ethylene rarely enhances hypoxia-adaptive genes and does not improve hypoxia survival in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We conclude that analyzing genes indicative of ethylene-mediated hypoxia acclimation is a promising approach to identifying key signaling cascades that confer flooding tolerance in crops.

In the upper part of the VMD, compounding environmental challenges presented by climate change, hydropower development upstream, and localised development policies have added greater pressures to rural societies, demanding various governance approaches to deal with change. So far, considerable attention has been devoted to policy narratives of how the bureaucratic approach shapes flood management delta-wide, but little is known about the relevant shift towards adaptive governance at the local level. The analysis presented here is based on qualitative data gathered from fieldworks and desk reviews and argues that the North Vam Nao scheme is an exemplary case for policy transformation in the VMD. A hybrid governance paradigm that is characterised by the participatory and hierarchical approaches allows for the shared learning and interactions of knowledge vertically and horizontally among stakeholders. The study presents nuanced implications of the approach in incorporating both 'integrative' and 'adaptive' components into a long-term water governance strategy, which would serve as a two-pronged contribution to effectively manage environmental uncertainties facing the VMD. It also advocates for the legitimacy of the approach to be institutionalised and widely adopted across the Mekong floodplains and beyond.

J	Atanga, RA				Atanga, Raphael Ane			The role of local community leaders in flood disaster risk management strategy making in Accra	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood-prone communities; Flood disaster risk management; Strategy; Implementation	PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; VULNERABILITY; CITY; STAKEHOLDERS; VARIETIES; POOR	Flood disasters have upward trends and devastating impacts in cities worldwide. This problem could be due to lack of participation of flood prone community leaders in flood risk management strategy making. Institutional challenges, lack of technical expertise and conflicts could exclude stakeholders from flood management. This research investigates the participation of flood-prone community leaders in flood risk management strategy making in Accra. Flood-prone communities bear direct impacts of floods. Community leaders can influence flood risk management in their neighbourhoods if they participate in the strategy making of the city authorities. However, it is unclear if leaders of flood-prone communities participate in strategy making for flood disaster risk management in Accra. This study seeks to answer the following research questions: Do flood prone community leaders in the city of Accra participate in flood risk management strategy making? How are the local community leaders involved in the flood risk management strategy making? This qualitative research obtained data from secondary and primary sources. Documents analysis provided the secondary data whereas the primary data were obtained from face-to-face interviews and focus group discussion. The research findings revealed that flood prone community leaders participate only in the implementation stage of flood risk management strategies. The paper concludes that an effective flood risk management strategy making, and implementation require active participation and role play of flood prone community leaders.

The intensity of this disaster has been increasing due to accelerated impact of human activities. Flood vulnerability is very diverse in nature and is multidimensional and a topic of vital significance. Hence, flood vulnerability assessment assumes greater significance since magnitude of destructions varies over space and time. The study makes a credible attempt to present a coherent review on the approaches and methodologies used for assessing flood and its vulnerability. A time frame of 1990-2018 was chosen for analyzing varied works carried out flood vulnerability and susceptibility assessment. Articles from Scopus and other reputed journals were used to review the works on flood assessments. Methods and approaches were examined by considering most-cited authors and keywords used in their works. The study revealed a gap existing between methods and approaches for evaluating flood vulnerability which can be incorporated by using high-resolution data along with using multidimensional approach for assessing vulnerability. Furthermore, this study calls for comprehensive flood assessment using artificial neural network, hydrodynamic models and geospatial techniques to provide a vivid visualization of flood susceptibility. The study may prove helpful in analyzing different components of vulnerability and guiding research gaps in methodology to be used for assessing flood vulnerability at spatial scales.

However, accurate identification and mapping of GLs in the background of snow-clad mountains through visual interpretation of satellite data is a tedious and challenging assignment when multiyear time-series analysis is considered. To overcome this challenge, automated extraction of GLs in satellite images has been carried out in this study with the help of machine learning (ML). The novelty of this study is identification and tracking of GLs over three decades using ML and geospatial analysis using pixel-based image classification. For this, Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were employed. The methodology is demonstrated here for the identification and mapping of GLs in the Sikkim Himalaya from 1987 to 2020 and for forecasting the possible fate of these GLs through time-series modelling. The geospatial time-series analysis using Google Earth Engine, ML classifiers, and GIS framework, has captured the dynamics of GLs in Sikkim and has revealed the spatial and temporal patterns in GLs' dimensions as well as GLOF risk.

J	Webber, S				Webber, Sophie			For and against climate capitalism	GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						climate capitalism; climate futures; climate reparations; cooperative energy; repair; resilient infrastructure	POLITICAL ECOLOGIES; GREAT-GARUDA; CARBON; INFRASTRUCTURE; ECONOMIES	This paper starts from the point that our current political-economic-climate conjuncture demands new engagements at the dynamic interface of climate capitalism. Using two cases of climate capitalist responses to climate challenges, I demonstrate the reparative potentials that emerge from the tensions and ambiguities that typify that conjuncture. In the first case, I examine financialised climate infrastructure in Jakarta, Indonesia, that promises to protect the city from flooding while enriching city elites, but against which diverse social movements and collectives have organised. The second case is about a cooperative energy provider in Australia, operating on the terrain of a neoliberalised electricity market and climate change, and working towards multifaceted repair by collectivising and redistributing surplus and modelling democratic engagement. Those involved in these vastly different cases both pursue repair and reparations through climate capitalist projects by reckoning with historical and present climate debts while constructing forward-looking programs. As such, they chart the first steps towards reparative climate futures. This paper identifies the political and socioecological potentials from two key climate capitalist projects: flood protection infrastructures in Jakarta and cooperative energy in Australia. From this, it builds a framework of repair and reparations for engaging with climate capitalism and argues that the emerging tensions and ambiguities facilitate steps towards reparative climate futures.

Genetic engineering and genome-editing approaches have been used for developing climate-resilient crops. However, genetically modified crops have yet to be widely accepted, especially for small-scale farmers in low-income countries and some societies. Nano-priming (seed exposure to nanoparticles, NPs) has appeared as an alternative to the abovementioned techniques. This technique improves seed germination speed, promotes seedlings' vigor, and enhances plant tolerance to adverse conditions such as drought, salinity, temperature, and flooding, which may occur under extreme weather conditions. Moreover, nano-enabled seed treatment can increase the disease resistance of crops by boosting immunity, which will reduce the use of pesticides. This unsophisticated, farmer-available, cost-effective, and environment-friendly seed treatment approach may help crop plants fight climate change challenges. This review discusses the previous information about nano-enabled seed treatment for enhancing plant tolerance to abiotic stresses and increasing disease resistance. Current knowledge about the mechanisms underlying nanomaterial-seed interactions is discussed. To conclude, the review includes research questions to address before this technique reaches its full potential.

The annual cost of sinkhole damages exceeds $300 million, although this estimate is likely underestimated due to the need for national tracking. Sinkholes can also alter natural drainage patterns, leading to increased flood risk. While natural sinkholes occur, those in urban areas are predominantly manmade, caused by soil erosion from defective pipes, typically due to aging. Climate change, storm surges, and urbanization have accelerated subsidence in urban environments, posing greater risks to critical infrastructure and densely populated areas. Extensive research has focused on soil erosion in dams; however, this knowledge does not necessarily apply to erosion through orifices, where gravity and other factors play significant roles. This paper presents a critical literature review on internal soil erosion due to defective pipes (SEDP). The review highlights that hydraulic loading, backfill type, and pipe conditions (defect shape, size, and depth) influence SEDP. Key findings from experiments and numerical studies are summarized, while mechanisms and knowledge gaps are identified. However, it is concluded that the current understanding in this field remains limited, underscoring the urgent need for further experimental and numerical research to expand the knowledge base on SEDP.

J	Klipalo, E; Besharat, M; Kuriqi, A				Klipalo, Emmett; Besharat, Mohsen; Kuriqi, Alban			Full-Scale Interface Friction Testing of Geotextile-Based Flood Defence Structures	BUILDINGS			English	Article						climate change; flood protection; flood policy; hybrid infrastructure; urban floods		Open-topped woven polypropylene cellular containers filled with dense granular ballasts are often used as emergency flood defence structures. The effectiveness of these systems is highly dependent on the interaction with their bedding surface. The characteristics of the foundation will often govern the system's overall resistance to applied loading imposed by retained floodwater. However, the frictional relationship between polypropylene bulk bag flood defences and common bedding surfaces has not been extensively investigated. This study aims to reduce the reliance on arbitrary static friction coefficients by measuring and presenting actual data obtained through quantitative testing. This study presents the results of full-scale field testing to quantify the frictional resistance generated between filled polypropylene bulk bags and seven common bedding surfaces. Findings resulting from testing each interface scenario are expressed as coefficients of static friction. Test interfaces affording high frictional resistance comprised an unmade gravel road (mu = 0.74) and grass (mu = 0.64). Contrastingly, interfaces generating significantly lower frictional resistance were steel floated concrete (mu = 0.40) and polypropylene plastic (mu = 0.40). Test interfaces involving asphalt (mu = 0.54) and tamped concrete (mu = 0.56-0.58) were also investigated. This study recommends new friction coefficients necessary to characterise the structural stability analysis of bulk bag flood defences with greater accuracy. Practical advice based on experimental observation and field design experience is also given.

J	Kizielewicz, J				Kizielewicz, Joanna			Monitoring Energy Efficiency and Environmental Ship Index by Cruise Seaports in Northern Europe	ENERGIES			English	Article						energy efficiency; environmental index; port monitoring		Environmental organizations have alerted that rapid weather phenomena have intensified in recent years, such as floods, hurricanes, whirlwinds, droughts, fires and storms, caused by the deteriorating condition of the natural environment. Carbon emissions, which are the main cause of the deteriorating environment condition and dramatic climate change, are largely caused by the use of heavy fuel by shipping companies and generate large quantities of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. These compounds exert a strong negative impact on the environment and human health. Care for improving the marine environment and coastal areas has become the subject of interest of many international institutions, such as the International Maritime Organization, Organization of United Nations, European Sea Port Organization, European Commission and others, which introduce restrictive regulations and guidelines on the level of permissible harmful emissions into the environment as a result of ship operations in ports and at sea. In addition, they propose to monitor the level of pollution through the use of indicators, such as the Energy Efficient Design Index (EEDI), Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) and Environmental Ship Index (ESI), among others. The aim of this paper is to assess the Northern Europe seaports' commitment to monitor the level of pollutants emitted by cruise ships in their ports. This article may constitute a subject of interest for seaport authorities and cruise ship operators.

Rapid urbanization combined with the implications of climate change is one of the major emerging challenges. The increased concerns with water security and the ageing of existing drainage infrastructure are new challenges in improving urban water management. This study carried out in the Seixal area in Portugal examines flood risk analyses and mitigation techniques performed by computational modelling using MIKE SHE from the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI). Several scenarios were compared regarding flood risk and sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) efficiency. To obtain a more accurate analysis, the economic viability of each technique was analyzed as well through (i) life cost analysis and (ii) taking into account the damages caused by a certain type of flood. The results present that the best scenario is the one that will minimize the effects of great urbanization and consequently the flood risk, which combines two different measures: permeable pavement and detention basin. This alternative allows us to fully explore the mitigation capacity of each viable technique, demonstrating a very important improvement in the flood mitigation system in Seixal.

Hence, risk perception plays a critical role in flood response and recovery policies for local communities. However, this perception variation among floodplain residents is not well understood, especially under varying flood threats. The research aimed to characterize how risk perceptions of varying flood threats diverged across groups of people living in floodplains and identify individuals' preferences for response and recovery actions. A household survey was conducted to determine residents' risk perceptions in the 1%- and 0.2% annual chance floodplain in Corvallis, OR. Contingency tables were used to evaluate relationships between respondents' sociodemographics, perceptions, and preferences for flood response and recovery actions. The results highlight that, even when households are exposed to similar threats of floodwater depths, survey respondents' risk perceptions and support for proposed response and recovery actions differed along sociodemographic lines. Understanding the nuanced relationships among socio-demographics, risk perceptions, and response and recovery actions can facilitate practical and better-informed approaches for community-relevant decision-making.

J	Choi, HI				Choi, Hyun Il			Development of Flood Damage Regression Models by Rainfall Identification Reflecting Landscape Features in Gangwon Province, the Republic of Korea	LAND			English	Article						flood damage; rainfall; landscape; simple regression; damage risk map	PRECIPITATION	Torrential rainfall events associated with rainstorms and typhoons are the main causes of flood-related economic losses in Gangwon Province, Republic of Korea. The frequency and severity of flood damage have been increasing due to frequent extreme rainfall events as a result of climate change. Rainfall is a major cause of flood damage for the study site, given a strong relationship between the probability of flood damage over the last two decades and the maximum rainfall for 6 and 24 h durations in the 18 administrative districts of Gangwon Province. This study aims to develop flood damage regression models by rainfall identification for use in a simplified and efficient assessment of flood damage risk in ungauged or poorly gauged regions. Optimal simple regression models were selected from four types of non-linear functions with one of five composite predictors averaged for the two rainfall datasets. To identify appropriate predictor rainfall variables indicative of regional landscape features, the relationships between the composite rainfall predictor and landscape characteristics such as district size, topographic features, and urbanization rate were interpreted. The proposed optimal regression models may provide governments and policymakers with an efficient flood damage risk map simply using a regression outcome to design or forecast rainfall data.

In particular, the threat of accelerated sea level rise (SLR) has increasingly gained the attention of the scientific community recently. However, studies investigating the effect of SLR on plants and vertical marsh accretion are usually restricted to the species or community level and do not consider phenotypic plasticity or genetic diversity. To investigate the response of genotypes within the same saltmarsh species to SLR, we used two known genotypes of Elymus athericus (Link) Kerguelen (low-marsh and high-marsh genotypes). In a factorial marsh organ experiment we exposed both genotypes to different flooding frequencies and quantified plant growth parameters. With increasing flooding frequency, the low-marsh genotype showed higher aboveground biomass production compared to the high-marsh genotype. Additionally, the low-marsh genotype generally formed longer rhizomes, shoots and leaves, regardless of flooding frequency. Belowground biomass of both genotypes decreased with increasing flooding frequency. We conclude that the low-marsh genotype is better adapted to higher flooding frequencies through its ability to allocate resources from below- to aboveground biomass. Given the strong control of plant biomass production on salt-marsh accretion, we argue that these findings yield important implications for our understanding of ecosystem resilience to SLR as well as plant species distribution in salt marshes.

T.D.Penn. is a main component of riparian forests, widely used in agroforestry in many parts of tropical south America and can thrive in a variety of environments that include sites that are flooded for up to six months. Here, we contribute a wood anatomical study in flooded versus non-flooded environments to discover features that enable the wide environmental plasticity of this species. Population differences in anatomical and structural traits point to a drought adaptation syndrome in the flooded population sample. Four anatomical traits, vessel lumen diameter, intervessel pit diameter, fiber lumen diameter and fiber length showed significant population differences. Further, scanning electron microscopy revealed qualitative differences in vestures on the inside walls of vessel elements. Our results support the view that flood conditions can paradoxically induce physiological drought stress due to anaerobic conditions in the root zone, which leads to physiological and structural features normally observed in drought-adapted tree populations. Our observations also suggest that planting stock obtained from flooded areas may contain adaptive traits that could also be useful for cultivation and land reclamation applications under drier conditions that are anticipated in the future due to climate change.

This paper examines the spatial adjustments of populations to the 2008 Hurricane Ike by estimating the effects of damage on the changes of socially vulnerable populations pre- and post-Hurricane Ike. Multivariate regression models are used to understand household-level adjustments in different flood zones and inundation levels at the block-group level in Galveston county. In contrast to past literature that suggests that vulnerable populations remain or move into hazardous areas post-disaster, our results indicate that socially vulnerable populations have moved out of highly damaged areas. The tremendous investment opportunity post-disaster and the slow distribution of funds to recover public housing on Galveston Island provide potential explanation of the estimated adjustment patterns. Analyzing post disaster adjustments offers important insights into the "resilient" recovery of Galveston County post-Hurricane Ike. Our results also point to potential vulnerabilities that may arise in the future because of the change in community identity and the loss of social memory. Understanding disaster-driven changes in community make-up will help inform potential recovery trajectories from future catastrophes.

Extreme rainfall events pulse substantial nutrients and sediments from terrestrial to nearshore coastal communities: a case study from French Polynesia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; FLOOD PLUME; CORAL; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; ASSIMILATION; DYNAMICS; NITRATE; WATERS; BAY	Rainfall mobilizes and transports anthropogenic sources of sediments and nutrients from terrestrial to coastal marine ecosystems, and episodic but extreme rainfall may drive high fluxes to marine communities. Between January 13th and January 22nd, 2017, the South Pacific Island of Moorea, French Polynesia experienced an extreme rainfall event. similar to 57cm of rain was delivered over a 10-day storm. We quantified pulsed sediments and nutrients transported to nearshore reefs. We determined the spatial and temporal extent of the sediment pulse with estimates of water transparency. We quantified pulsed nutrients at multiple spatial and temporal scales. To determine if terrestrial nutrients were incorporated into the benthic community, we collected macroalgae over 10 days following the storm and measured tissue nutrient concentrations and delta N-15. Pulsed sediments impacted water clarity for 6 days following the storm, with greatest impacts closest to the river mouth. Nitrite +nitrate concentrations were >100 times the average while phosphate was >25 times average. Macroalgal tissue nutrients were elevated, and delta N-15 implicates sewage as the source, demonstrating transported nutrients were transferred to producer communities. Future climate change predictions suggest extreme rainfall will become more common in this system, necessitating research on these pulses and their ramifications on marine communities.

The capability of the flow to carry relevant quantities of sediments during these critical events adds to the further complexity of the resulting scenarios. The interaction between the flow and the obstacles in flood-inundated areas contributes to an increase in the hazard level and constitutes a relevant concern in the framework of risk analysis. Despite this relevance, the existing literature on the topic is relatively scarce, especially for the estimation of the forces acting on rigid obstacles in the presence of a mobile bed. In the present paper, a recent two-phase shallow-water morphodynamical model, particularly suited for the analysis of fast geomorphic transients, is applied for the numerical simulation of the propagation of a dam-break wave over an erodible floodplain in the presence of a rigid obstacle. The geometry of the test-case is inspired by a recent fixed-bed study reported in the literature, for which extensive experimental and numerical data concerning the flow field and the dynamic loading against the obstacle are available. Results of the numerical simulations contribute to highlight the effects of the obstacle on the changes in the bottom topography.

J	Vercruysse, K; Dawson, DA; Wright, N				Vercruysse, Kim; Dawson, David A.; Wright, Nigel			Interoperability: A conceptual framework to bridge the gap between multifunctional and multisystem urban flood management	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						integrated flood risk management; resilience; urban drainage; water sensitive urban design	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GREEN-INFRASTRUCTURE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS-APPROACH; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; CHALLENGES; VULNERABILITY; POLICY; STRATEGIES	Urban flood management is increasingly expected to be multifunctional to integrate with the existing functioning of cities. Locally, this led to the development of sustainable urban water drainage designs, while at larger scales, blue-green or water-sensitive cities are considered as examples for how cities should function. Upscaling local designs to city-scale flood resilience is not straightforward, however, due to the complexity of physical infrastructure and socio-economic interactions within urban systems and requires "system-of-systems" thinking. To this end, we introduce the concept "interoperability" to guide transition from local multifunctionality to city-scale multisystem flood management, through actively managing connections between infrastructure systems to convey, divert, and store flood water. While flood management is already based on these connections, interoperability is about explicitly emphasising them to explore and create opportunities to facilitate the integration of systems for flood management. The main research need arising from this conceptualisation is to determine how spatial data on infrastructure, environment, and social characteristics in urban areas can serve as a basis to identify opportunities and barriers for interoperability. By introducing interoperability and the research needs arising from it, a framework is created to facilitate and encourage practical thinking and discussion about system integration in urban flood management.

Despite the recent advances and technologies for risk mitigation, it is acknowledged that public risk perception is a critical factor for these tools to succeed. Greece and the broader Eastern Mediterranean is an area where, despite the diversity of natural disasters, there is a lack of understanding of the hazard types that people are most concerned with and how they measure against other groups of hazards (i.e., geophysical). This work uses an online survey targeting Greek people, aiming to provide a better understanding of their perception of different natural hazards. Statistical results show that people consider climate-related hazards less dangerous and likely to occur than earthquakes, which occur often as zero-impact events. Laymen may thus underestimate certain risks, which may inhibit appropriate preparation. Disaster experience was found to increase threat perceptions and to motivate preparedness. However, in what concerns climate-related hazards, the effect of experience may fade out over time. Awareness activities were found to associate with higher emergency response efficacy. Males exhibit lower risk perception and higher coping appraisals. However, prioritization of risks is almost identical between genders. Implications for risk management are discussed.

The main findings were as follows: (1) due to the obvious north-south gradient of MDI, this province was classified as four climactic sub-regions: north, central-north, central-south, and south Jiangsu, respectively; (2) in central-north, central-south, and south Jiangsu, the maximum length of dry spell during autumn (DI3), the maximum duration of consecutive rainfalls during spring (PI3), and number of rainy days during spring (PI1) were selected as the leading MDI affecting oilseed rape yield, respectively; (3) each 1d of DI3, PI3, and PI1 increase would result in yield losses of 0.7%, 3.6%, and 1.7% in central-north, central-south, and south Jiangsu, respectively; (4) compared to the weak changes in spring rainfall and autumn drought, the significant weakening of winter-spring cold extremes across Jiangsu had more notable yield increasing effects, especially the strong decrease of freezing events during winter had increased yield by up to 1.4-3.0%.

Drier landscapes are more susceptible to fire, however, increases in daily precipitation extremes, and possible expansion of tropical weather systems into higher latitudes, implies that flooding may also become more common. We use the eddy-covariance technique to evaluate turbulent heat fluxes, and a net radiometer to measure surface albedo, over a groundwater dependent barrier island swamp. Measurements are made for dry and vegetated surface conditions, and following the natural occurrences of a wildfire and flooding. Results show that the wetland Bowen ratio has a value near 1 for typical dry and vegetated conditions, and is dominated by the latent heat flux when inundated by water. The largest changes in the partitioning of available energy into turbulent heat fluxes occur in the days immediately after the wildfire when the surface is dry, with the midday sensible heat flux nearly eight times greater than the latent heat flux. The key influences on energy partitioning are the atmospheric conditions for a dry and vegetated surface, and the surface conditions for either a burnt or a flooded surface.

Spatiotemporal patterns of extreme sea levels along the western North-Atlantic coasts	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STORM-SURGE HAZARD; NEW-YORK-CITY; TROPICAL CYCLONES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WIND; MODEL; RISE; IMPROVEMENT; INTENSITY; EUROPE	The western North-Atlantic coast experienced major coastal floods in recent years. Coastal floods are primarily composed of tides and storm surges due to tropical (TCs) and extra-tropical cyclones (ETCs). We present a reanalysis from 1988 to 2015 of extreme sea levels that explicitly include TCs for the western North-Atlantic coastline. Validation shows a good agreement between modeled and observed sea levels and demonstrates that the framework can capture large-scale variability in extreme sea levels. We apply the 28-year reanalysis to analyze spatiotemporal patterns. Along the US Atlantic coasts the contribution of tides can be significant, with the average contribution of tides during the 10 largest events up to 55% in some locations, whereas along the Mexican Southern Gulf coast, the average contribution of tides over the largest 10 events is generally below 25%. At the US Atlantic coast, ETCs are responsible for 8.5 out of the 10 largest extreme events, whereas at the Gulf Coast and Caribbean TCs dominate. During the TC season more TC-driven events exceed a 10-year return period. During winter, there is a peak in ETC-driven events. Future research directions include coupling the framework with synthetic tropical cyclone tracks and extension to the global scale.	[Muis, Sanne; Ward, Philip J.; Aerts, Jeroen C. J.

J	Fekete, A				Fekete, Alexander			Social vulnerability change assessment: monitoring longitudinal demographic indicators of disaster risk in Germany from 2005 to 2015	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Societal resilience; Disaster risk management; Vulnerability index; Vulnerability dynamics; Demographic change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOODS; LIMITATIONS; CHALLENGES; CONTEXT; HAZARDS; IMPACT	Social vulnerability assessments of disaster risks related to natural or man-made hazards have become state of the art, while not undisputed. One critiquethat most assessments are staticis addressed here by analysing indicators over a 10-year period at a research area in Germany using county-level administrative units. The indicators (and an index) are displayed as maps using publicly available statistical data from a single government source to establish consistency. In addition, maps of changes in indicator values per 5 or 10years are visualised. As a result, spatial regions within Germany that have received increases in, for instance, higher numbers of elderly citizens can be visualised. Maps visualise the increasing susceptibility to hazards such as floods, heatwaves, storms or technological accidents. At the same time, increases or decreases in capacities, such as hospital density or care homes, highlight regions that have adjusted or still have to adjust to demographic change demands. The main purpose of this paper is to test stability and heterogeneity of indicators over time and offer advice on a selection of indicators that are not only based on static and singular assessments but also take dynamics and related richness of additional temporal change information into account for longitudinal monitoring of disaster risk with a focus on vulnerability.

Nowadays, several mechanisms can estimate climatic variables like precipitation and temperature. However, no device measures precipitation values in real-time and at a low-cost, much less are these installed in remote areas of difficult access. Therefore, an Automated Hydrological Information System was developed based on low-cost meteorological stations with two communication protocols, Wi-Fi and GSM. The devices are equipped with a self-sustainable power supply, including a solar panel and energy storage that can last for up to three cloudy days. The precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity values are sent to a database, where they are then processed and displayed on a web page, accessible for download. Users can easily access the data from an official application that redirects them to the website without the need for a computer or a mobile browser. Warning systems are feasible due to the use of IoT services such as ThingSpeak and Ubidots. Ultimately, they allow the analysis of information and immediately send alerts if it exceeds the tolerance ranges.

This study reports the discovery of a new type of plastic material in the environment-plastic-rock complexes -formed when plastic debris irreversibly sorbs onto the parent rock after historical flooding events. These complexes consist of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or polypropylene (PP) films stuck onto quartz-dominated mineral matrices. These plastic-rock complexes serve as hotspots for MP generation, as evidenced by laboratory wet-dry cycling tests. Over 1.03 x 108 and 1.28 x 108 items center dot m-2 MPs were generated in a zero-order mode from the LDPE- and PP-rock complexes, respectively, following 10 wet-dry cycles. The speed of MP generation was 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than that in landfills, 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that in seawater, and >1 order of magnitude higher than that in marine sediment as compared with previously reported data. Results from this investigation provide strong direct evidence of anthropogenic waste entering geological cycles and inducing potential ecological risks that may be exacerbated by climate change conditions such as flooding events. Future research should evaluate this phenomenon regarding ecosystem fluxes, fate, and transport and impacts of plastic pollution.

Snow schemes with multiple layers have been shown to better describe the snowpack evolution and bring improvements to soil freezing and some hydrological processes. In this paper, the wider hydrological impact of the multi-layer snow scheme, implemented in the ECLand model, was analyzed globally on hundreds of catchments. ERA5-forced reanalysis simulations of ECLand were coupled to CaMa-Flood, as the hydrodynamic model to produce river discharge. Different sensitivity experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of the ECLand snow and soil freezing scheme changes on the terrestrial hydrological processes, with particular focus on permafrost. It was found that the default multi-layer snow scheme can generally improve the river discharge simulation, with the exception of permafrost catchments, where snowmelt-driven floods are largely underestimated, due to the lack of surface runoff. It was also found that appropriate changes in the snow vertical discretization, destructive metamorphism, snow-soil thermal conductivity and soil freeze temperature could lead to large river discharge improvements in permafrost by adjusting the evolution of soil temperature, infiltration and the partitioning between surface and subsurface runoff.

To protect biodiversity and ecosystem services in Tibet, the Chinese government established a system of nature reserves at a significant cost; however, the effectiveness of nature reserves at protecting both-biodiversity and ecosystem service functions in Tibet is not clear. To determine the success of existing nature reserves, we determined importance areas for the conservation of mammal, plant, bird, amphibian, and reptile species, and for the protection of ecosystem service functions. The results indicated that important conservation areas for endangered plants were mainly distributed in the southern part of Nyingchi City, and for endangered animals, in the southern part of Nyingchi and Shannan Cities. Extremely important conservation areas for ecosystem service functions of carbon sequestration, water and soil protection, and flood regulation were mainly distributed in the southern part of Nyingchi and Shannan Cities, northern and southeastern parts of Nagqu City, and southern part of Ngari area. Based on an analysis of spatial overlap in protection areas, we conclude that existing natural reserves need to be expanded, and new ones need to be established to better protect biodiversity in Tibet Autonomous Region.

Climate model projections for western Norway show that heavy precipitation events, such as the one in 2014, will increase in frequency and intensity in the future. This paper discusses barriers to proactive adaptation to high-impact weather events in two municipalities in western Norway. Interviews were conducted with representatives from municipalities in this region to understand the adaptation measures the municipalities had implemented after this event and the barriers to proactive adaptation to extreme events in the future. We found that the key barriers to proactive adaptation are lack of resources, lack of knowledge and lack of willingness to adapt. The magnitude of the event meant that only a few of the informants expected the municipality to be hit by such an extreme event again in the near future, and as such, they did not see a need for major adaptation measures. Further, some assumed that the municipality was sufficiently protected because their areas either were not directly affected or were secured after the event. Finally, some interviewees assumed that it is not possible to adapt to such high-magnitude events.

To this end, the central government of the People's Republic of China initiated the "Sponge City" programme. However, challenges and gaps exist in current urban planning practice. The operationalizable planning approach to realise the multiple objectives of Sponge City is missing in the existing guidelines. Using a local example of Sponge City planning in Nanjing City as a case study, this paper outlines the current Sponge City approach from the perspectives of planning content and planning process. A qualitative comparative analysis between Nanjing's Sponge City planning and Auckland Water Sensitive Design, as well as an evaluation of the Sponge City approach through the lens of Dutch urban water management, identified key missing elements that would enhance the current Sponge City planning approach. Examples include targets for pluvial flood protection, a strategy for planning interventions, and tools for interdisciplinary cooperation in the planning process. This enhanced approach was successfully applied in the Sponge City planning for Qinhuai District, Nanjing City. Nevertheless, challenges on data availability and the decision-makers' mindsets called for more efforts on the interface of research and policy development for upscaling the Sponge City approach.

J	Bark, RH				Bark, Rosalind H.			Designing a Flood Storage Option on Agricultural Land: What Can Flood Risk Managers Learn from Drought Management?	WATER			English	Article						nature-based solutions; floodplain storage; payments for farmers; drought and flood management	COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM; MITIGATION; INSURANCE; POLICY; CONSERVATION; DECISIONS; COUNTY	The increasing probability of loss and damage to floods is a global concern. Countries are united by an urgent need to reduce flood risk to households, businesses, agricultural land, and infrastructure. As natural and engineered protection erodes with climate change and development pressures, new approaches to flood risk management delivered at the catchment scale that work with nature hold promise. One nature-based solution that aligns with this Special Issue on river flooding is the temporary storage of floodwaters on the floodplain. In many countries, this would involve controlled flooding inland low-lying agricultural land. Designing schemes that farmers and irrigation districts will adopt is essential. To inform future floodplain storage options, we review farm-centred drought management, specifically, agreements that transfer agricultural water to municipalities through fallowing in California, USA and an Australian farm exit scheme. These initiatives reveal underpinning principles around the need to: balance the multiple objectives of the parties, share the benefits and responsibilities, address local impacts and practical guidance on incentive design including the consideration of conditional participation requirements and responding to farmer and public preferences. In terms of funding there is opportunity for blended financing with flood-prone communities, insurers, and conservation charities.

Large-scale interventions may delay decline of the Great Barrier Reef	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						coral reef; Great Barrier Reef; climate adaptation; climate impacts; coral bleaching; meta-community model		On the iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the cumulative impacts of tropical cyclones, marine heatwaves and regular outbreaks of coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (CoTS) have severely depleted coral cover. Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented. Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume impacts, expanding control of CoTS populations, stabilizing coral rubble, managing solar radiation and introducing heat-tolerant coral strains. Without intervention, all climate scenarios resulted in precipitous declines in GBR coral cover over the next 50 years. The most effective strategies in delaying decline were combinations that protected coral from both predation (CoTS control) and thermal stress (solar radiation management) deployed at large scale. Successful implementation could expand opportunities for climate action, natural adaptation and socioeconomic adjustment by at least one to two decades.

Sustainable measures and procedures to strengthen preparedness, response, and recovery of infrastructures are urgently needed, but the standard for measuring such resilient elements has yet to be consensually developed. This study was undertaken with an aim to quantitatively measure transportation infrastructure robustness, a proactive dimension of resilience capacities and capabilities to withstand disasters; in this case, floods. A four-stage analytical framework was empirically implemented: (1) specifying the system and disturbance (i.e., road network and flood risks in Chiang Mai, Thailand), (2) illustrating the system response using the damaged area as a function of floodwater levels and protection measures, (3) determining recovery thresholds based on land use and system functionality, and (4) quantifying robustness through the application of edge- and node-betweenness centrality models. Various quantifiable indicators of transportation robustness can be revealed; not only flood-damaged areas commonly considered in flood-risk management and spatial planning, but also the numbers of affected traffic links, nodes, and cars are highly valuable for transportation planning in achieving sustainable flood-resilient transportation systems.

Since overbank flooding has been considered the driving factor of vegetation distribution on floodplains, sustainable water resource management requires a better understanding of the influence of inundation on vegetation distribution. We examined the relationship between the distribution of four flood-dependant vegetation communities and associated long term inundation metrics on the upper Darling River floodplain using electivity analysis and a generalised additive model (GAM) by generating a total of 10,478 individual inundation maps with a high spatial resolution over a period of 29 years. Our results show that the four dominant vegetation communities are situated differently in relation to inundation attributes. The inundation metrics better explained the variation in the distribution of River Red Gum than those of Black box, Coolabah and Lignum communities. We found that the floodplain forests and woodlands in the upper Darling can survive longer periods of drought and shorter inundation duration than previously reported. The results provide practical information for ecosystem management by offering a means of predicting changes in vegetation distribution in relation to alteration in flow regime resulting from water planning arrangements or climate change.

To analyze the effect of the water level gradients (-60.74-60 cm) on Arundo donax var. versicolor seedlings in terms of their growth characteristics (base stems diameter, plant height, and biomass), leaf characteristics (leaf length, width, area, number, and moisture content), photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll, carotenoids), antioxidant enzymes activity (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase), soluble protein, malondialdehyde and root activity. We determined and quantified the response relationship between A. donax var. versicolor and water level based on the Gaussian model. The result showed that underground biomass and Chl a + b were more sensitive indexes to water level. The Chl a + b was more sensitive to the flooded water depth (61.37 cm), but the underground biomass was influenced by the groundwater depth (-59.09 cm). The result also showed that the ecological amplitude of the water level for A. donax var. versicolor was-59.09 to 61.37 cm, and the optimal range was-13.87 to 10.44 cm. Therefore, we concluded that it could be a suitable species for ecological restoration of the shallow wetland.

These disasters, whose amplitude and frequency have tended to become increasingly irregular in space and time, in the current context of global climate change, encourage us to improve our flood management and forecasting strategies, notably through the re-evaluation of protection structure capacities, designed on the basis of hydrological data analyzed by statistical adjustment of past rainfall hazards. The objective of this study is to develop a minimalist conceptual numerical model for flood forecasting and management under GIS environment for the north-east region of Algeria. This model was developed by analyzing hydrographic data that can be adapted to climate data collected in real time, to predict short-term flood hydrographs in all segments of the hydrographic network, based on the Sokolovsky model for construction of synthetic hydrographs, combined with the Horton architecture for basin discretization. We obtained accuracy on past rainfall hazard simulations around 65.2% for peak flow amplitudes and 88.3% for surface runoff base times. This low-cost simple model opens the way to more possibilities in flood management, and can be improved through better spatialization and calibration with more field data.

The possible causes of hazard, exposure and vulnerability in flood disaster were clearly identified by using a climate risk template. Then, levels of exposure and vulnerability with adaptive capacity and sensitivity were further defined by a quantification approach, and the climate risk maps were consequently provided. The potential possible climate adaptation strategies were investigated through the comparison of climate risk maps with diverse adaptation options. The framework was demonstrated in the Kyoto City in Japan with residents as a target population to reduce the flood risk. The results indicate that the government should pay attention to reducing the population in flood-prone areas and adopt diverse adaptation strategies to reduce the flood risk to the residents. Rainwater storage and green roofs as adaptation strategies as short-term planning options are recommended. The construction of detention ponds has been suggested to prevent flood risks in future as a part of the long-term planning process. In conclusion, the proposed framework is expected to be a suitable tool for supporting climate risk analysis in the context of flood disasters.

The severity of the hazard is closely related to a region's ability to cope and recover from the event, an ability that depends on the region's sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Here, the vulnerability to drought of each state within the contiguous U.S. is assessed as a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, using socio-economic, climatic, and environmental indicators. The division of vulnerability into three sub-indices allows for an assessment of the driver(s) of vulnerability of a state and as such provides a foundation for drought mitigation and planning efforts. In addition, a probabilistic approach is used to investigate the sensitivity of vulnerability to the weighting scheme of indicators. The resulting geographic distribution of relative vulnerability of the states is partially a reflection of their heterogeneous climates but also highlights the importance of sustainable adaptation of the local economy to water availability in order to reduce sensitivity and to limit the impact of drought. As such, the study at hand offers insights to local and regional planners on how to effectively distribute funds and plan accordingly in order to reduce state-level drought vulnerability today and in the future.

Implementing non-stationary flood frequency analysis in the UK	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; flood frequency estimation; non-stationary	STATIONARITY; EXTREMES; CLIMATE; UNCERTAINTY; EVENTS; TRENDS; DEAD	The Environment Agency in England is investing 2.5 pound billion with the aim of reducing flood risk to at least 300,000 homes by 2020/21. Several of the schemes being considered are on rivers that have experienced an upsurge of flooding over recent years. Decisions on whether to invest and how high to build are usually made on the basis of stationary methods of flood frequency analysis that assume the probability of flood flows is unchanging over time. Following successive severe floods in Cumbria, trend tests and non-stationary flood frequency analysis techniques have been applied. These allow parameters of the frequency distribution to change over time or with some other covariate. The resulting estimates of flow, for the present day, were up to 55% higher than the stationary estimates at river gauges in north-west England. The results have been incorporated into the scheme appraisal process. A national analysis indicates that there is evidence of upward trends in peak flows at nearly a quarter of river flow gauges across Great Britain. Many rivers show an abrupt increase in flood flows in the late 1990s. Trends tend to occur in upland areas but they are also seen on some rivers across south-east England.

Based on the daily gridded precipitation dataset and direct economic losses (DELs) of rainstorm and flood disasters in the mainland of China, this paper first filtered a relatively reasonable disaster-triggering daily precipitation threshold (DDPT) combination according to the relationship between extreme precipitation days and direct economic loss (DEL) rates at province level and then comprehensively analyzed the spatial landscape of DDPT across China. The results show that (1) the daily precipitation determined by the combination of a 10 mm fixed threshold and 99.3th percentile is recognized as the optimal DDPT of rainstorm and flood disasters, and the correlation coefficient between annual extreme precipitation days and DEL rates reached 0.45 (p < 0.01). (2) The optimal DDPT decreases from southeast (up to 87 mm) to northwest (10 mm) across China, and the DDPTs of 7 out of 31 provinces are lower than 25 mm, while 5 provinces are higher than 50 mm on average. These results suggest that DDPTs exist with large spatial heterogeneity across China, and adopting regional differentiated DDPT is helpful for conducting effective disaster risk analysis.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is unique in that it is able to grow in both flooded and upland conditions, which have large differences in the concentrations and chemical forms of mineral elements available to plants. To comprehensively understand the mechanisms of rice for coping with different water status, we performed ionomics and transcriptomics analysis of the roots, nodes and leaves of rice grown in flooded and upland conditions. Focusing the analysis on genes encoding proteins involved in transport functions for mineral elements, it was found that, although rice plants maintained similar levels of each element in the shoots for optimal growth, different transporters for mineral elements were utilised for nitrogen, iron, copper and zinc to deal with different soil water conditions. For example, under flooded conditions, rice roots take up nitrogen using transporters for both ammonium (OsAMT1/2) and nitrate (OsNPF2.4, OsNRT1.1A and OsNRT2.3), whereas under upland conditions, nitrogen uptake is mediated by different nitrate transporters (OsNRT1.1B and OsNRT1.5A). This study shows that rice possesses plastic transport systems for mineral elements in response to different water conditions (upland and flooding).

J	Ramalho, J				Ramalho, Jordana			Worlding aspirations and resilient futures: Framings of risk and contemporary city-making in Metro Cebu, the Philippines	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article						disaster risk reduction and management; Philippines; resilience; urban slums; worlding; urban development	GOVERNMENTALITY; BIOPOLITICS	In the Philippines, calls for creating 'global', 'sustainable' and 'resilient' cities are placing urban poor communities in increasingly precarious positions. These communities have long been the targets of urban development and 'modernisation' efforts; more recently the erasure of informal settlements from Philippine cities is being bolstered at the behest of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management (DRM) agendas. In Metro Cebu, flood management has been at the heart of DRM and broader urban development discussions, and is serving as justification for the demolition and displacement of informal settler communities in areas classed as 'danger zones'. Using Kusno's (2010) interpretation of the 'exemplary centre' as a point of departure, this paper interrogates the relationship between DRM, worlding aspirations (Roy and Ong, 2011) and market-oriented urbanisation in Cebu, and considers the socio-spatial implications of these intersecting processes for urban poor communities. Through analysing the contradictions inherent in framings of certain bodies and spaces as being 'of risk' or 'at risk' over others, I argue that the epistemologies of modernity, disaster risk and resilience endorsed and propagated by the state are facilitating processes of displacement and dispossession that serve elite commercial interests under the auspices of disaster resilience and pro-poor development.

In recent decades, an increase in floods in the coastal WMA has been observed. Variations in the rainfall regime and anthropisation have influenced the relevant geomorphological processes. The coastal floodplains analysed include those in Italy, France, and Spain. Geomorphological and land use changes that occurred in the last two centuries were examined using historical and recent maps, historical data, and European big data since the 1800s for 65 basins, for which over 670 flood events and more than 1300 victims were identified. Anthropogenic activities have changed the patterns of floodplains. In most cases, narrowing of the riverbeds, especially in the lower river sections, has been observed. The riverbeds have also changed from braided- to single-channel morphologies. GIS analysis shows reductions in the coastal watercourse widths ranging from 10% to 95%, with an average of 55%. Other changes are related to the deviation in the watercourses, with trends that did not respect the natural river flow. In some cases, the watercourses were covered and have vanished from recent maps. This aspect has reduced or eliminated the perception of the risk not only for the residents but also for land planners.

This catastrophic natural hazard presents a significant threat to critical infrastructure in urban areas, particularly the power distribution system. As modern societies are much more dependent on electrical energy these days, it is essential and imperative to make existing distribution systems resilient against flash flooding. Although researchers in this area have proposed various algorithms to impart resilience to a distribution system, however, the focus in these works is on wind-related events such as hurricanes, cyclones, and windstorms. Therefore, here, the spatiotemporal effects of a flash flood on the distribution system are modelled using a grid-based hydrodynamic model. The evolving line faults are then included in the proposed resilience-oriented time horizon-based service restoration model that also considers dynamic load demand, heavy uncertainties related to renewable generation, and interdependence among critical loads. Finally, the resilience of the distribution system's response is assessed using an operational resilience metric. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems and the results show that the model provides an efficient restoration solution despite increased complexity caused by varying conditions.

Analysis of flood handling in a watershed area requires spatial and temporal study to reveal more complex results. This study aims to analyze the development of deforestation and flood events in the Lasolo watershed and to investigate deforestation proclivity. Purposive sampling was applicable as the method to analyze the data for the case study. Premier data include quantitative data related to deforestation and flood events in the study area whilst the secondary data was obtained from relevant institutions. Moreover, data analysis techniques contain quantitative analysis (i.e. spatial-temporal analysis, descriptivequantitative analysis), and inferential statistic analysis. The result proves three anomalous patterns in relation to deforestation nearby downstream, middle, and upstream of the Lasolo watershed and flood events around the downstream area or in North Konawe Regency, South-East Sulawesi Province. The first pattern reveals sufficient stability on the deforested land surface in 2006-2012 towards rain intensity when flooding, The second pattern claims a more generic response of the land surface to the rainfall in 2012-2017. The third pattern in 2018-2020 results relatively sensitive response against rain particularly when a flood occurs.

Watershed-Scale Strategies to Increase Resilience to Climate-Driven Changes to Surface Waters: North American Electric Power Sector Case Study	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CHANNEL EVOLUTION MODEL; STREAM TEMPERATURE; WOODY DEBRIS; HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY; RIVER RESTORATION; COUPLED HUMAN; BEAVER DAMS; LONG-TERM; SEDIMENT; URBANIZATION	This case study synthesizes strategies that electric power utilities can implement to reduce surface water risks to infrastructure, operations, and regulatory compliance as climate change impacts hydrologic regimes over the next century. The strategies range from the reach scale to watershed scale. A reach-scale example would be evaluating relocation alternatives for a transmission tower along an eroding streambank versus a streambank stabilization strategy. A watershed-scale strategy would involve the value engineering of stormwater management strategies that could be implemented across a catchment that is restorative of a more natural flow regime such as prolonged baseflows and reduced flooding and erosion. The cost-effective watershed-scale strategies highlighted herein include retrofits of existing detention ponds, beaver reintroductions (or discontinued extirpation), riparian reforestation, adding wood to headwater streams, and the removal of postsettlement alluvium from floodplains coinciding with restoration of floodplain wetlands. Many of these strategies are management approaches that could be implemented on utilities' own property for relatively little cost while appealing to broader societal goals such as environmental restoration. Although costs will vary by setting and program goals, we hope that this article is a launching point for infrastructure managers to consider holistic, watershed-scale approaches to provide durable infrastructure resilience in the face of increased extreme events while contributing to long-term economic, social, and environmental sustainability.

Despite the improved global understanding of ESL frequencies and magnitudes, detailed nationwide inundation maps are unavailable for many countries. This study quantifies New Zealand's land area exposure to inundation from ESLs and RSLR by: (i) calculating ESL heights for nine annual recurrence intervals (ARI) between 2 and 1,000-years, (ii) converted into space-varying water surface grids, (iii) developing a composite topographical dataset comprised of Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and bias corrected Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), (iv) modifying topographical data to represent mitigation structures, and (v) executing a scalable static model to map land inundation areas for 0.1 m RSLR increments. This modular approach supports continuous integration of new models and data at resolutions appropriate for quantifying inundation hazard and risk trends. In response to 0.1 m-0.4 m RSLR expected in the New Zealand region from 2040 to 2070 under SSP5-8.5 global mean sea level rise scenarios, a rapid cumulative inundation area increase is observed for 10 and 100-year ESL ARIs at national and regional levels. The RSLR time independent maps developed here supports future investigations of ESL inundation hazards and risks for any prescribed RSLR heights or timeframes.

The impacts of flood-mitigation structures on floodplain ecosystems: a review of three case studies from Australia and France	AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER			English	Review						Floodplains; flood mitigation; humanised floodplain ecosystems; natural and artificial wetland ecosystems; ecosystem values; management; Hawkesbury-Nepean River; Macleay River; Durance River	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; DURANCE RIVER; CHANNEL CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; MANAGEMENT; GEOMORPHOLOGY; CATCHMENT; HYDROLOGY; WETLANDS	This study is concerned with the physical impacts of flood-mitigation structures on 'humanised' and 'natural' floodplain ecosystems. The former constitute fertile, well drained and developed surfaces. The latter are mainly degraded wetland areas located in the backwater zones of wide, low-lying floodplains. Three rivers are investigated: the Hawkesbury-Nepean and the Macleay Rivers in New South Wales, Australia and the Durance River in southern France. Their floodplains, flood-mitigation works and floodplain ecosystems are analysed, together with site- and time-dependent differences in their floodplains, their exploitation and their degradation. Conservation of floodplains seeks to reverse wetland degradation, and to increase biodiversity and sustainability, as well as preserving developed floodplains. This study discusses gaps in our biophysical knowledge of ecosystems and the absence of ecological indicators of degradation. It also considers the lack of data on socio-economic values for what are unique, site- and time-specific, biophysical systems. Only when such inadequacies are addressed will the values of ecosystems be fully understood. Then cost-effective management might be possible. These knowledge gaps contribute to the many problems of floodplain management, which are likely to increase when the additional impacts of population increase and global warming become apparent.

An enhanced understanding of what influences people?s susceptibility to hazards, how and why, is a prerequisite for designing mitigation plans, prioritizing resources for preparedness and formulating an appropriate adaptation strategy. This study therefore, assessed the geographic variation of social vulnerability to natural hazards in Zimbabwe. It used data acquired from the national statistics agency on 24 variables that reflected a wide range of social vulnerability indicators. The variables were carefully selected considering their relevance in increasing social vulnerability in Zimbabwe. Then, the study used a principal component analysis and a factor analysis technique in a GIS environment to quantify social vulnerability and model its underlying drivers respectively. The analyses revealed that 68% of the country has above moderate values of social vulnerability. Very high social vulnerability is in poor rural districts of western and southern Zimbabwe. This coincided with agro-ecological regions with low potential for food production, while the lowest vulnerability scores were in small towns. Poverty, informal employment, household heads, birth rate and the special needs population, which explained 82.065% of the total cumulative variance, drive social vulnerability. The geographic variation of social vulnerability provides policy-makers a scientific basis for resource allocation to vulnerability hotspots or key factors.

J	Wang, D; Scussolini, P; Du, SQ				Wang, Dan; Scussolini, Paolo; Du, Shiqiang			Assessing Chinese flood protection and its social divergence	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RIVER-FLOOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER-RISK; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNICATION; ADAPTATION; RETHINKING; RESILIENCE; EXPOSURE; PREPARE	China is one of the most flood-prone countries, and development within floodplains is intensive. However, flood protection levels (FPLs) across the country are mostly unknown, hampering the present assertive efforts on flood risk management. Based on the flood-protection prescriptions contained in the national flood policies, this paper develops a dataset of likely FPLs for China and investigates the protection granted to different demographic groups. The new dataset corresponds to local flood protection designs in 91 (53.2 %) of the 171 validation counties, and in 154 counties (90.1 %) it is very close to the designed FPLs. This suggests that the policy-based FPLs could be a valuable proxy for designed FPLs in China. The FPLs are significantly higher than previously estimated in the FLOPROS (FLOod PROtection Standards) global dataset, suggesting that Chinese flood risk was probably overestimated. Relatively high FPLs (return period of >= 50 years) are seen in 282 or only 12.6 % of the evaluated 2237 counties, which host a majority (55.1 %) of the total exposed population. However, counties with low FPLs (return period of < 50 years) host a disproportionate share (52.3 %) of the exposed vulnerable population (children and elders), higher than their share (44.9 %) of the exposed population. These results imply that to reduce social vulnerability and decrease potential casualties, investment in flood risk management should also consider the demographic characteristics of the exposed population.

J	Duo, E; Fernández-Montblanc, T; Armaroli, C				Duo, Enrico; Fernandez-Montblanc, Tomas; Armaroli, Clara			Semi-probabilistic coastal flood impact analysis: From deterministic hazards to multi-damage model impacts	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Relative sea level rise; Flooding; Damage; Extreme events; Stavanger; Norway	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; STORM IMPACTS; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; SCALE	Coastal flood impact assessments are important tools for risk management and are performed by combining the hazard component with the vulnerability of exposed assets, to quantify consequences (or impacts) in terms of relative or absolute (e.g. financial) damage. The process generates uncertainties that should be taken into account for the correct representation of the consequences of floods. This study presents a coastal flood impact application at the spatial level of the Stavanger municipality (Norway), based on a multi-damage model approach able to represent impacts, and their overall uncertainty. Hazard modelling was performed using the LISFLOOD-FP code, taking into account historical extreme water level events (1988-2017) and relative sea level rise scenarios. Direct impacts were calculated in the form of relative and financial damage for different building categories, using flood damage curves. The results showed that the expected impacts are fewer than 50 flooded receptors and less than (sic)1 million in damage in the current sea level scenario. The impacts could double by the end of the century, considering the most optimistic relative sea level scenario. The results were discussed considering the limitations of the approach for both hazard and impact modelling, that will be improved in future implementations. The outcome of this study may be useful for cost-benefit analyses of mitigation actions and local-scale plans for adaptation.

The study analysed the operation of a CR by using the MIKE 21 hydrodynamic modelling package. The 2D hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated for the 2013 and 2011 flood events respectively, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E-ns) between 0.87 to 0.97 at all gauges. River right branch widening and dredging produced a 0.16 m reduction in water level at the Brisbane city gauge. The results show that by suitable gate operation of CR, the 2011 flood normal observed level of 4.46 m, with reference to the Australian Height Datum (AHD) at Brisbane city, could have been reduced to 3.88 m AHD, while under the improved management operation of the Wivenhoe Dam, the flood level could be lowered to 4 m AHD at Brisbane city, which could have been reduced with CR to 2.87 m AHD with an overall water level reduction below the maximum flood level. The results demonstrated that the innovative use of a CR could considerably decrease the overall flood peak and lessen flood severity in the coastal city of Brisbane.

In this study, the responses of terrestrial invasive Wedelia trilobata (WT) and congener native Wedelia chinensis (WC) plants were examined under submergence and eutrophication. A greenhouse experiment was conducted in which ramets of WT and WC were investigated under two levels of submergence (S1 and S2) and three levels of nutrients (N1, N2 and N3) along with two cultures (mono and mixed). Submergence (S) did not affect the morphological traits of both the species but nutrients (N), culture (C) and their interaction, along with submergence, had a significant effect on the morphological traits of both the species. The growth of WC under high submergence and high nutrients was decreased compared with low nutrients (N1, N2) but WT maintained its growth in monoculture. In mixed culture, low submergence (S1) and low nutrients (N1, N2) made WC more dominant but high submergence (S2) and high nutrients (N3) made WT more successful than WC due to its high phenotypic plasticity and negative effect of competition intensity. It was concluded that both species survive and grow well under submergence and eutrophication, but high submergence and eutrophication provide better conditions for WT to grow well.

Although E&W's water sector is of international interest, in particular due to the early experience with privatisation, for the time being, few published data on energy usage exist. We analysed telemetry energy-use data from Thames Water Utilities Ltd. (TWUL), the largest water and wastewater company in the UK, which serves one of the largest mega-cities in the world, London. In our analysis, we: (1) break down energy use into their components; (2) present a statistical approach to handling seasonal and random cycles in data; and (3) derive energy-intensity (kWh m(-3)) metrics and compare them with other regions in the world. We show that electricity use in the sector grew by around 10.8 +/- 0.4% year(-1) as the utility coped with growing demands and stormwater flooding. The energy-intensity of water services in each of the utility's service zone was measured in the range 0.46-0.92 kWh m(-3). Plans to improve the efficiency of the system could yield benefits in lower energy-intensity, but the overall energy saving would be temporary as external pressures from population and climate change are driving up water and energy use.

Knowledge of interventions that communities utilize in response to hazards is important to develop local-level capacity and increase community resilience. This paper systematically examines empirical information about local-level responses to hazards based on peer-reviewed, published case studies. We developed a data set based on 188 articles providing information from 318 communities from all regions of the world. We classified response examples to address four key questions: (i) what kinds of responses are used by communities all over the world? (ii) Do communities in different parts of the world use different kinds of responses? (iii) Are communities using hazard-specific responses? (iv) Are communities using a multi-hazard approach? We found that within an extensive literature on hazards, there is relatively little empirical information about community-based responses to hazards. Across the world, responses aiming at securing basic human needs are the most frequently reported kinds of responses. Although the notion of community-based disaster preparedness is gaining importance, very few examples of responses that draw on the social fabric of communities are reported. Specific regions of the world are lacking in their use of certain hazard responses classes. Although an all-hazard approach for disaster preparedness is increasingly recommended, there is a lack of multi-hazard response approaches on the local level.

Reducing human exposure and sensitivity to threats can reduce disaster impact. Prior knowledge about community vulnerability levels is crucial to minimizing potential losses from future threats. Most vulnerability studies focus on high-impact disasters and their temporal and spatial analyses. Yet high-frequency, low-impact disasters have a cumulative potential to severely disrupt or damage socioeconomic systems. There is limited knowledge especially in the global south about the creation of vulnerability to hydrometeorological threats. Using a systems approach, this study explores ways in which communities in the northern semiarid tropics of Zimbabwe are vulnerable to hydrometeorological threats. This predominantly qualitative study used literature review, interviews, transect walks, and focus groups to gather data from selected samples involving smallholder farmers with in-depth knowledge about community vulnerability. The results show that the communities are vulnerable to multiple hydrometeorological threats due to multiple interacting factors including rainfed and flood-based farming, land tenure, topography, climate, and other socioeconomic conditions such as inadequate income sources and high poverty. In order to reduce vulnerability, this study provides five policy options for government and nongovernmental organization interventions, including the need to transform rural economies beyond the traditional rainfed and flood-based farming systems.

J	Lianxiao; Morimoto, T				Lianxiao; Morimoto, Takehiro			Spatial Analysis of Social Vulnerability to Floods Based on the MOVE Framework and Information Entropy Method: Case Study of Katsushika Ward, Tokyo	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood; MOVE framework; information entropy method; GIS; spatial analysis; social vulnerability	RISK; HAZARD; IMPACT	Tokyo is located in a lowland area that is vulnerable to flooding. Due to global climate change, the scalability and frequency of flooding is increasing. On the other hand, population aging and family structural changes, as well as the lack of adaptation measures, would accelerate flooding vulnerability. The key factors involved in social vulnerability must be studied to reduce the risk of flooding. In this study, we refer to the MOVE framework (a disaster vulnerability assessment framework) and analyze it from three perspectives: Exposure to social vulnerability, susceptibility, and resilience. We subsequently develop an index system to complete the evaluation using 11 indicators. The collected data will help reveal social vulnerability to floods in the Katsushika Ward, Tokyo, using the information entropy method and GIS. We found that the western region of the Katsushika Ward is at more risk than the eastern region during flooding. Additionally, the possibility of a serious crisis erupting is greater in the southwestern region than in the northwestern region. Consequently, we conclude that the spatial distribution of flooding varies in the region. The results of this study will help in understanding social vulnerability, in selecting and combining adaptation measures suited to the characteristics of the area, and in the effective and efficient implementation of these measures by the local government's disaster department.

First paleoecological evidence from prehispanic raised fields of Uraba, northwestern South America	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS			English	Article						Wetlands; Raised fields; Uraba; Prehispanic cultures; Geoarchaeology; Holocene; Paleoecology	DRAINED-FIELD; DISSOLUTION; CORDILLERA; HISTORY; LLANOS; RECORD; RIVERS; SOILS; MOXOS; AREA	The raised fields discovered recently in the Gulf of Uraba, northwestern Colombia, extends more than 135,000 ha among the floodplains of the rivers Leon, Suriqui, and Tumaradocito in the Choco biogeographic region. To understand the mechanisms by which people use the wetlands under climate change of the Late Holocene, the paleoenvironmental and cultural conditions were studied using artifacts, soil micromorphology, geochemical, chronostratigraphic and palynological analysis at El Vergel archaeological site. This study aims to discuss the origin of raised fields development in the Leon River floodplain and its relationship with progressive drought, groundwater, and wetland management for permanent human occupation. The results suggest that the raised fields were built around the IX century CE, during a period marked by decreased precipitation, probably related to the Medieval Warm Period. The hydrogeology reveals a multilayer aquifer in the region with some shallow springs in the floodplain where earthworks are located. The poor stratigraphic demarcation of the ridges and well-dug channels, with no evidence for agriculture whatsoever, support the idea that some raised fields were strategic for distributing groundwater and rainwater over a large area and thus preserving the productivity of the wetland for fishing and hunting.

Dams fragment rivers and reduce longitudinal connectivity on a network scale. However, dams may also alter discharge regimes and flood peaks, consequently reducing floodplain inundation and lateral channel floodplain connectivity, which impacts floodplain associated ecosystems. Strategic planning has emerged as a promising approach to find a balance between dam impacts and benefits. Yet, strategic planning has predominantly focused on longitudinal connectivity due to the difficulty of including the complex interactions between dam design and operations, hydrologic regime alteration, and the hydrodynamic processes controlling downstream flood extent. Here, we present how to reduce conflicts between hydropower development and loss of floodplain inundation extent by jointly optimizing siting and design of many dams in a data scarce basin. We deploy a coupled hydrological-hydraulic simulation model linked to a multiobjective optimization framework to find development options with the least trade-offs between power generation and downstream impacts on floodplains. Our results for the Pungwe Basin in Mozambique indicate that whilst portfolios of many small storage and run-of-river diversion hydropower plants might create less impacts on the downstream floodplains, installation of some large storage dams would be necessary to attain higher levels of hydropower generation.

What Floodplain Managers Want: Using Weather and Climate Information for Decision-Making	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Social science; Communications/decision-making; Planning; Policy; Societal impacts	PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; SAMPLE-SIZE; PRECIPITATION; TORNADO; EVENTS; UPDATE	As a result of climate change, extreme precipitation events are likely to become more common in Oklahoma, requiring cities and municipalities to plan for managing this extra water. There are multiple types of practitioners within communities who are responsible for overseeing planning for the future, including stormwater and floodplain management. These practitioners may be able to integrate weather and climate information into their decision-making to help them prepare for heavy precipitation events and their impacts. Floodplain managers from central and eastern Oklahoma were interviewed to learn what information they currently use and how it informs their decision-making. When making decisions in the short term, floodplain managers relied on weather forecasts; for long-term decisions, other factors, such as constrained budgets or the power of county officials, had more influence than specific climate predictions or projections. On all time scales, social networks and prior experience with flooding informed floodplain managers' decisions and planning. Overall, information about weather and climate is just one component of floodplain managers' decision-making processes. The atmospheric science community could work more collaboratively with practitioners so that information about weather and climate is more useful and, therefore, more relevant to the types of decisions that floodplain managers make.

J	Moises, DJ; Kunguma, O				Moises, Deolfa Jose; Kunguma, Olivia			Improving flood early warning systems in Kabbe, Namibia: A situational analysis approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Community; Capacity -building; Resilience; Preparedness; Floods; Early warning systems; Situational analysis	DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; FRAMEWORK; RIVER	The social, economic and environmental construct of communities formulates the core of the resilience capacity paradigm, which requires great consideration when developing, implementing and strengthening early warning systems. Though several guiding principles are documented in research, no single method for assessing community resilience exists, and complexities in quantifying capacities are often exacerbated by the diversity of probable hazard occurrence, interconnections between social, economic and environmental components, and difficulty in variable selection to gather data. By implementing a situational analysis approach, this study details an exploratory investigation into the socioeconomic and environmental constructs of rural high floodrisk communities to identify capacities that may be enhanced for improved flood risk reduction through participatory early warning system approaches. The perception is that, in the face of a disaster, even the most vulnerable communities possess some resilience, and this should be exploited for effective, long-term sustainable disaster reduction. The critical question then is: what social, economic and environmental capacities are available to communities to improve early warning system efficacy while building resilience against flood risks and improving their standard of living? The study reveals multiple options that form effective conduits for tailoring flood early warning systems to the exactitude of target community needs.

There is a benefit to reduced complexity system representations to support these assessments, especially when large ensembles are used to better characterize future uncertainties. An important question is whether the total uncertainty in the output metrics is primarily attributable to the climate ensemble or to the systems model itself. Here we develop a method to address this question by combining time series error models of performance metrics with time-varying Sobol sensitivity analysis. The method is applied to a reduced complexity multi-reservoir systems model of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin in California to demonstrate the decomposition of flood risk and water supply uncertainties under an ensemble of climate change scenarios. The results show that the contribution of systems model error to total uncertainty is small (& SIM;5%-15%) relative to climate based uncertainties. This indicates that the reduced complexity systems model is sufficiently accurate for use in the context of the vulnerability assessment. We also observe that climate uncertainty is dominated by the choice of general circulation model and its interactive effects with the representative concentration pathway (RCP), rather than the RCP alone. This observation has implications for how climate vulnerabilities should be interpreted.

All model simulations perform very similarly using either observed rainfall data from rain gauges inter-polated over the basins or ERA5 rainfall, indicating its value as an alternative to observations in data-scarce areas such as Tunisia. The development of regional databases of river discharge ob-servations in North Africa could allow the calibration of such hydrological models on a larger scale for operational flood modeling and forecasting.

The realisation of these consequences has heightened scholarly inquiry into the method and strategies of flood resilience in cities of global south and north. This study therefore examines determinants of household resilience to floods in Kaduna metropolis, Nigeria. To achieve this, the study examined the socio-economic and housing attributes of households, identified various flood resilience strategies and evaluated determinants of household flood resilience in the study area. This is with a view to providing information that could enhance household resilience to flood in the study area. The metropolis was stratified into three residential zones: government reservation area, transition zone, and the sub-urban zone. Across the residential zones, questionnaires were administered on 357 households in the metropolis. Findings revealed that household flood resilience strategies in the study area were similar and reactive rather than anticipatory. High level of financial constraints, inaccessibility to numerous livelihood sources, services, infra-structure and lack of government supports were identified as the major factors influencing household flood resilience strategies in the study area. The study recommended that government support, as well as improvement in income level and educational level will increase individuals' and households' resilience against flood in the study area.

Flood disaster, narratives and framing under hazardous urbanisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Event; Infrastructure; Narrative; Urban political ecology; Floods; Urban governance	RIO-DE-JANEIRO; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SAO-PAULO; VULNERABILITY; RISK; BIOPOLITICS; GOVERNMENT; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; ECOLOGY	'The river was moved too close to my house!' declared a soon-to-be-displaced resident following flood disaster in Brazil. Infrastructural engineering decades earlier had changed the river's course and led to the flooding of his home, yet the state now blamed a rainstorm for causing the disaster. The narrative of a natural event provided the pretext for urban governance based around evictions and further rounds of infrastructural engineering, nominally aimed at pre-empting a dangerous climate future. The paper takes the circumstances of this case to trigger a conceptual discussion on governance of the disaster event, narratives, and the promise of infrastructures to mitigate alarming urban futures. I draw on urban political ecology, the sociology of the event, and recent social studies of infrastructure, while also questioning understandings of eventful nature in the post-human turn. Tackling urban disaster risk, it is argued, depends on a political reframing of disasters as infrastructural events. This is a reflexive process that challenges how risks are produced through capitalist urbanisation, with the aim of making this longer temporality eventful for social change. A focus on politicised infrastructures reveals and disrupts dominant natural hazard narratives that remain integral to hazardous urban expansion.

The alternative reservoir operation strategies corresponding to the flood storage capacity (V-pl) of 10, 20, and 30% of the active storage capacity (V-hi) are evaluated and compared with the prevailing inter-reservoir operation procedure in terms of inundation effects. The results reveal that increasing the V-pl from 10% to 30% of the V-hi reduces the flooded area by 11.8% and lowers the water level at downstream stations from 6% to 30%. The government's procedure is considered safe to supply water, but the inundation duration is longer, resulting in more damage than the scenario of V-pl=20%V-hi. Regarding urbanization, the expansion of newly urbanized areas has resulted in increased flooding in their surrounding areas, with an increase in flood depth of more than 3 meters. Moreover, the new roads have reduced the capacity of flood drainage and caused severe flooding. The water level difference between the two sides of the road can be as high as 2 meters. This research will assist managers in developing and implementing appropriate downstream flood control measures.

Gomati River basin, the area of the present study, is located within the Ganga River floodplains, which approximately coincide with the north central temperature homogeneous region (NCTHR) of India. Gomati basin is a non-perennial one supporting water intensive agricultural crops. To ascertain the occurrence of droughts (if any) from 1986 to 2015 within Gomati River basin, in terms of inter-dependencies of drought causing variables through study of multivariate drought indices, is the main objective of the present study. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in combination with the Copula approach to construct multivariate standardized drought indices (MSDIs) for drought onset detection through simulation in the face of data scarcity. Although MSDI based assessment of the basin as a whole did not detect any droughts, in the upper basin, MSDIs indicated the possibilities of impending agricultural droughts marked by their consistent variability around near-normal conditions. This methodology can be used to detect drought situations in data scarce non-perennial river basins within the Ganga River floodplains including the NCTHR of India.	[Bhatt, Diva; Mall, R.

Urban pluvial flood adaptation: Results of a household survey across four German municipalities	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						adaptive behaviour; integrated flood risk management; property-level adaptation; urban flooding	DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; RISK PERCEPTIONS; MOTIVATION	In recent years, German cities were heavily impacted by pluvial flooding and related damage is projected to increase due to climate change and urbanisation. It is important to ask how to improve urban pluvial flood risk management. To understand the current state of property level adaptation, a survey was conducted in four municipalities that had recently been impacted by pluvial flooding. A hybrid framework based on the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Protection Action Decision Model (PADM) was used to investigate drivers of adaptive behaviour through both descriptive and regression analyses. Descriptive statistics revealed that participants tended to instal more low- and medium-cost measures than high-cost measures. Regression analyses showed that coping appraisal increased protection motivation, but that the adaptive behaviour also depends on framing factors, particularly homeownership. We further found that, while threat appraisal solely affects protection motivation and responsibility appraisal affects solely maladaptive thinking, coping appraisal affects both. Our results indicate that PMT is a solid starting point to study adaptive behaviours in the context of pluvial flooding, but we need to go beyond that by, for instance, considering factors of the PADM, such as responsibility, ownership, or respondent age, to fully understand this complex decision-making process.

Urban flash floods lead to considerable dangers and risks. In cities and urban areas, the vulnerability to pluvial flooding is particularly high. In order to be able to respond to heavy rainfall events with adaptation strategies and measures in the course of urban development, the spatial hazards, vulnerabilities and risks must first be determined and evaluated. This article shows a new, universally applicable methodical approach of a municipal pluvial flood risk assessment for small and medium-sized cities. We follow the common approaches to risk and vulnerability analyses and take into account current research approaches to heavy rainfall and urban pluvial flooding. Based on the intersection of the hazard with the vulnerability, the pluvial flood risk is determined. The aim of the present pluvial flood risk assessment was to identify particularly affected areas in the event of heavy rainfall in the small German city of Olfen. The research procedure and the results have been coordinated with the city's administration within the framework of a real laboratory. In the course of the science-policy cooperation, it was ensured that the results could be applied appropriately in urban developments.

Estimating surface runoff is an essential process of hydrology, since understanding the fundamental relationship between rainfall and runoff is useful for sustainable water resource management. To facilitate the assessment of this process, the Natural Resource Conservation Service-Curve Number (NRCS-CN) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were integrated. Furthermore, land use and soil maps were incorporated to estimate the temporal variability in surface runoff potential. The present study was performed on the Haridwar city, Uttarakhand, India for the years 1995, 2010 and 2018. In a context of climate change, the spatiotemporal analysis of hydro meteorological parameters is essential for estimating water availability. The study suggested that runoff increased approximately 48% from 1995 to 2010 and decreased nearly 71% from 2010 to 2018. In turn, the weighted curve number was found to be 69.24, 70.96 and 71.24 for 1995, 2010 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, a validation process with an annual water yield model was carried out to understand spatiotemporal variations and similarities. The study recommends adopting water harvesting techniques and strategies to fulfill regional water demands, since effective and sustainable approaches like these may assist in the simultaneous mitigation of disasters such as floods and droughts.

A delicate hydrological balance triggered by prolonged wet or dry underlying condition and variable extreme rainfall makes the rainfall-runoff process difficult to simulate with traditional models. To this end, this study develops a novel vertically mixed model for complex runoff estimation that considers both the runoff generation in excess of infiltration at soil surface and that on excess of storage capacity at subsurface. Different from traditional models, the model is first coupled through a statistical approach proposed in this study, which considers the spatial heterogeneity of water transport and runoff generation. The model has the advantage of distributed model to describe spatial heterogeneity and the merits of lumped conceptual model to conveniently and accurately forecast flood. The model is tested through comparison with other four models in three catchments in China. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and the ratio of qualified results increase obviously.

On the Natural and Anthropogenic Drivers of the Senegalese (West Africa) Low Coast Evolution: Saint Louis Beach 2016 COASTVAR Experiment and 3D Modeling of Short Term Coastal Protection Measures	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Waves; erosion; flooding; climate change; beaches; West Africa; coastal vulnerability	EROSION	West Africa's low and densely populated coasts crystallize most of the environmental and societal problems and resulting vulnerability. It is becoming urgent to document this coast and the natural and anthropogenic forces to understand its evolution. Saint Louis is a historic (World Heritage) city located on the Langue de Barbarie, a 10 km sandspit at the mouth of the Senegal River. Because of its location, it is vulnerable (erosion, flooding) to river and ocean variability. This intermediate barred microtidal beach is located in a storm-free intertropical environment, but is exposed to distant oblique energetic waves from high latitudes, causing one of the highest coastal drifts in the world (similar to 800,000 m(3)/year). As part of the COASTVAR project, an intensive international field experiment was conducted in Saint Louis from 4 to 13 December 2016 to quantify the natural protective role played by the sandbar, coastal currents and transient exchanges with the inner shelf. Many instruments have been deployed to measure waves, currents, bathymetry and topography. This article provides an overview on the objectives of the experiment, the deployment and the first results of the modeling of coastal protection strategy.

However, very few studies have quantified the effectiveness of storm surge height reduction by a real-existing, estuarine-scale, nature-based, and engineered flood defense system, under specific storm surge conditions. Here, we present data and modelling results from a specific storm surge in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium), where a hybrid flood defense system is implemented, consisting of flood control areas, of which some are restored into tidal marsh ecosystems, by use of culvert constructions that allow daily reduced tidal in- and outflow. We present a hindcast simulation of the storm surge of 6 December 2013, using a TELEMAC-3D model of the Scheldt estuary, and model scenarios showing that the hybrid flood defense system resulted in a storm surge height reduction of up to half a meter in the estuary. An important aspect of the work was the implementation of model formulations for calculating flow through culverts of restored marshes. The latter was validated comparing simulated and measured discharges through a physical scale model of a culvert, and through a real-scale culvert of an existing restored marsh during the storm surge.

This study is the first to adopt a critical discourse analysis approach to compare UK newspaper reporting of floods in the developed and developing world. We present our analysis of major flood incidents in Northern England and Chennai, India, in 2015. Our findings identify that UK newspapers not only give greater prominence to flooding events that are local but also frame differently those affected. Reports of floods in Northern England reinforced similarities and shared values between victims and assumed readers by drawing upon personal stories, emotions and suffering. By contrast, reports about floods in Chennai portrayed victims as anonymous 'distant Others', emphasising the drama of the incident rather than the plight of individuals. We argue that the newspapers' approach to covering flooding reveals how the Western-dominated global media continue to emphasise difference rather than similarity between people in the developed and developing world, presenting flooding in the United Kingdom as exceptional and flooding in India as normalised. We believe these findings have important implications in the context of globalisation and increasing migration.

This research examines the efficacy of flood protection systems and land use planning by comparing Amsterdam in the Netherlands (renown for resilience planning methods), with the city of Houston, Texas in the US (seeking ways of increasing resilience due to extreme recent flooding). It assesses flood risk of future urban growth in lieu of sea level rise using the Land Transformation Model, a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) land use prediction tool. Findings show that Houston has currently developed much more urban area within high-risk flood-prone zones compared to Amsterdam. When comparing predicted urban areas under risk, flood-prone future urban areas in Amsterdam are also relatively smaller than Houston. Finally, the increased floodplain when accounting for sea level rise will impact existing and future urban areas in Houston, but do not increase risk significantly in Amsterdam. The results suggest that the protective infrastructure used in the Netherlands has protected its future urban growth from sea level rise more adequately than has Houston.

The methodology is based on the combination of two state-of-the-art numerical models (XBeach and Q2D-morfo) applied in a probabilistic framework and it is implemented in an open sandy beach in Menorca Island (Western Mediterranean). We compute the shoreline response to SLR during the 21st century and we assess the changing impacts of storm waves on the aerial beach-dune system. Results demonstrate the relevant role that the beach backshore features, such as the berm, play as coastal defense, reducing the shoreline retreat and dune vulnerability rates in the near-term (a few decades ahead) and highlighting the importance of simulating the beach morphodynamic processes in coastal impacts assessments. Our findings point at SLR as the major driver of the projected impacts over the beach-dune system, leading to an increase of similar to 25% of the volume eroded due to storm waves by the end of the century with respect to present-day conditions.

To assess the potential consequences of a typical typhoon event, fine-scale simulations of inundation induced by both pluvial and fluvial flooding (known as compound flooding) are crucial for policymakers and concerned stakeholders to develop proper measures. In this study, we develop a cross-scale framework for modeling city inundation arising from typhoon-induced surges and torrential rainfall-runoff by coupling a three-dimensional ocean model (FVCOM) and a one-dimensional and two-dimensional coupling river analysis system (HEC-RAS). The ocean model is applied to capture the mesoscale behavior of surge and tide propagation from the deep sea to shallow offshore areas near the PRD. The river analysis system can simulate storm wave propagation along rivers, overtopping banks on floodplains and rainfall-runoff-induced flooding in urban regions at gradually refined scales. Second, the framework integrates GIS components (network analysis) with these hydraulic models. Through this framework, the urban emergency service coverage can be assessed under various potential flood scenarios during typhoon landfalls. Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018, the most devastating typhoon in the last decade in the PRD, is used as a case study in simulating and studying the flooding process. The simulated results show that in this typhoon event, pluvial and fluvial flooding play different roles in hindering the accessibility of emergency resources. Moreover, the interaction between pluvial and fluvial flooding significantly affects some urban regions.

As the intensity and the number of flooding occurrences increase, real-time solutions for flood risks and hazards mapping are required to assess flooding and its potential impacts on the environment and humans. Flood risk mapping has become an important tool for assessing flood risks in coastal areas to guide planning and mitigation efforts by local officials. However, this tool has not been leveraged to support flood risk analysis. Using GIS weighted sum method, this study mapped and assessed flood risk zones in Limbe, Cameroon, by utilizing a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission-Digital Elevation Model (SRTM-DEM). Flood risk zones were delineated based on several environmental factors, including precipitation, elevation, slope, soil texture, land use/land cover, and flow accumulation. The findings classified about 50% of land in Limbe as having either high or very high vulnerability to flooding. The highest risk areas were concentrated in the upstream and downstream areas of Ejengele and Limbe Rivers. Only about 9% of Limbe was classified as very low risk, suggesting that most of the land area is susceptible to flooding. The study reveals that more than 90% of the Limbe's urban areas are in flood-prone areas, which requires special attention from stakeholders to take necessary steps toward the preparation and mitigation of extreme flood events. The resulting flood risk maps provide vital information for urban and risk management planning professionals.

Green roofs are among the most efficient nature based solutions to address recurrent urban challenges, such as pluvial floods and urban heat islands. Various benefits offered by green roofs are rather known, such as their capacity to enhance buildings thermal insulation; green roofs also favor urban biodiversity, improving buildings aesthetic value and human well being. Multilayer green roofs (MGRs) are green roofs with an additional layer that increases their water storage capacity. Deep analyses on MGRs are still lacking due to their recent development, and the few works in literature are prevalently focused on their stormwater retention primary function. This work explores the thermal function of an experimental MGR prototype installed in Palermo (Italy), comparing its response to local climate with that of an unaltered portion of the rooftop through the analysis of surface temperature time series collected over a two years monitoring period. Performances are evaluated thought various daily thermal indices, also analyzing the role of the water stored into the system. Results contribute to raise awareness about the benefits arising from the use of MGRs in semi-arid Mediterranean urban areas, confirming, as main thermal advantage, their cooling effect, with mean daily surface temperature reduced by 8.4% outdoor and 5.8% indoor; performances increases with water storage and are particularly evident during the hot and dry summers that typically characterize such regions.

Flood susceptibility modeling is an indirect method for reducing flood disaster losses. This study aimed to improve flood susceptibility modeling by developing a sequential ensemble (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)) model utilizing three swarm-based algorithms (bacterial foraging opti-mization (BFO), cuckoo search (CS), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms). Initially, an integration of optical (Landsat-8) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite images were used to monitor the flooded areas during the July 2022 monsoon in the Kazerun region, Iran. A total of 1358 flood occurrence points were considered from the monitored flood areas; 70% (952 points) and 30% (406 points) were used for modeling and evaluating the models, respectively. Based on flood points and thirteen spatial criteria influencing floods, four flood models ((XGBoost, XGBoost-ABC, XGBoost-BFO, and XGBoost-CS)) were used to generate a flood susceptibility map (FSM). According to the results, the XGBoost-CS (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96), XGBoost-BFO (AUC = 0.953), XGBoost-ABC (AUC = 0.941), and XGBoost (AUC = 0.939) models have greater accuracy in flood sus-ceptibility modeling, respectively. The results indicated that the models coupled with the three metaheuristic algorithms (XGBoost-ABC, XGBoost-BFO, and XGBoost-CS) exhibited higher flood susceptibility modeling ac-curacy than the standalone XGBoost model.

Enhancing community resilience in arid regions: A smart framework for flash flood risk assessment	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Classic Delphi method; Flash flood; Risk assessment; Watershed modelling	MEMETIC ALGORITHM; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; QUALITY	This paper presents a novel framework for smart integrated risk management in arid regions. The framework combines flash flood modelling, statistical methods, artificial intelligence (AI), geographic evaluations, risk analysis, and decision-making modules to enhance community resilience. Flash flood is simulated by using Watershed Modelling System (WMS). Statistical methods are also used to trim outlier data from physical systems and climatic data. Furthermore, three AI methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Nearest Neighbours Classification (NNC), are used to predict and classify flash flood occurrences. Geographic Information System (GIS) is also utilised to assess potential risks in vulnerable regions, together with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methods. The decision-making module employs the Classic Delphi technique to classify the appropriate solutions for flood risk control. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the real case study of the Khosf region in Iran, which suffers from both drought and severe floods simultaneously, exacerbated by recent climate changes. The results show high Coefficient of determination (R2) scores for the three AI methods, with SVM at 0.88, ANN at 0.79, and NNC at 0.89. FMEA results indicate that over 50% of scenarios are at high flood risk, while HAZOP indicates 30% of scenarios with the same risk rate. Additionally, peak flows of over 24 m3/s are considered flood occurrences that can cause financial damage in all scenarios and risk techniques of the case study. Finally, our research findings indicate a practical decision support system that is compatible with sustainable development concepts and can enhance community resilience in arid regions.

To examine the relationship between invertebrate community composition and seasonal flooding following periods of drought, we quantified aquatic macroinvertebrate communities monthly in an inundated floodplain during the annual flood pulse (December-April) in two years: one following a multi-year drought and one during a larger than average flood. We predicted that floodplain communities would differ in richness, biomass, and community composition between years and that differences would be driven by the annual flood pulse and organic matter availability. We collected macroinvertebrates from a floodplain of the Altamaha River, a free-flowing 6th order river in the Coastal Plain region of the southeastern US. With invertebrates identified to genus, we estimated richness, abundance, biomass, community composition, and proportions of functional feeding group abundance. Richness was generally higher in the drought year but decreased throughout the flood pulse, while during the flood year richness was lower and increased over time. Biomass decreased throughout the flood pulse following the drought year and increased during the flood year. There was high overlap in invertebrate community composition based on abundance data during both years of the study with collector gatherers being the most abundant functional feeding group. Our study provides insight to the response of aquatic communities to an extended drought and subsequent return to normal flow in a lower river wetland.	[Johnson, Erica L.; Colon-Gaud, J.

Sustainable management of this unique environment as the climate changes requires a quantified understanding of its vulnerability to natural hazards. Here, we outline a structured analysis of novel historical archive information that has uncovered reports of an extreme storm surge associated with a Tropical Cyclone in 1921 that generated remarkable overland flow which left fish and sharks stranded up to 9.66 km (6 miles) inland. Weighted information from historical archives is placed in a new framework and provide inputs to modelling of this event which improves the understanding of its magnitude and furnishes records of the impacts of what occurred on that day and notably also in the years following. The suite of plausible tracks that reproduce the historical data contextualise the storm as a marginal Category 4 or 5 storm and its return interval as equivalent or slightly greater than the current local planning level for coastal flooding in the region. The outcome underscores the global importance of examining the probable maximum event for risk management in areas of marginal cyclone influence where vulnerable ecosystems or vital regional infrastructure of key economic importance are located, and the need to factor in TC risk in marine conservation and planning in the Shark Bay World Heritage Property. A tropical cyclone that made landfall at Shark Bay, Western Australia, in 1921 was likely category 4 or marginal category 5, much larger than previous estimates, according to a five-dimensional assessment of historical records coupled with numerical modelling	[Switzer, Adam D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Switzer, Adam D.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore; [Christensen, Joseph] Univ Western Australia, Sch Humanities, Perth, Australia; [Aldridge, Joanna] Univ Sydney, Sch Geosci, Sydney, Australia; [Aldridge, Joanna] Griffith Univ, Griffith Ctr Coastal Management, Nathan, Australia; [Taylor, David; Churchill, Jim; Watson, Holly] Baird Australia, Level 22,227 Elizabeth St, Sydney, Australia; [Fraser, Matthew W.] Minderoo Fdn, Ocean Ctr, Forrest Hall, Perth, Australia; [Fraser, Matthew W.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, Australia; [Fraser, Matthew W.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, Australia; [Shaw, Jenny] Western Australian Marine Sci Inst, Perth, Australia	Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University; University of Western Australia; University of Sydney; Griffith University; Minderoo Foundation; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI)	Switzer, AD (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.; Switzer, AD (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore.	aswitzer@ntu.edu.sg	Switzer, Adam D/B-7036-2011; IPO, PAGES/JXY-7546-2024	Switzer, Adam D/0000-0002-4352-7852; Christensen, Joseph/0000-0002-0075-0544	Australian Research Council; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund; Earth Observatory of Singapore; National Research Foundation Singapore; Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of Excellence initiative; Swiss Academy of Sciences [LP150100649]; Chinese Academy of Sciences; UWA [MOE2019-T3-1-004]; Integrated Coastal Analyses and Sensor Technology (ICoAST) [003113-00001]; Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre	Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Earth Observatory of Singapore; National Research Foundation Singapore(National Research Foundation, Singapore); Singapore Ministry of Education under the Research Centres of Excellence initiative(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Swiss Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); UWA; Integrated Coastal Analyses and Sensor Technology (ICoAST); Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre	The authors acknowledge the Malgana Peoples as the traditional custodians of Gathaagudu, and pay respects to their Elders past, present and emerging.

The present study is intended to assess flood hazard vulnerability and potential risk areas and aims to ascertain the management strategies in Nabadwip Municipality, a statutory urban area of West Bengal. The multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) of selected criteria and geospatial techniques have been employed to determine the urban flood vulnerability in the study area. The study has been conducted using secondary datasets including relevant remotely sensed data and participant observation. The potential flood-affected zones have been determined using the normalized difference flood index (NDFI) and flood vulnerability index (FVI). The analysis of the standardized precipitation index (SPI) of 20 years of monthly precipitation shows the variability of seasonal rainfall distribution in the study area. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the composite Ibrahim index of socio-economic development accents that the urban development of the study area was uneven. The municipal wards situated in the central and northeastern portions of Nabadwip Municipality were extremely vulnerable, whereas the western and southwestern wards were less vulnerable. It is also revealed from the strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-challenges (SWOC) of the principal management strategies of the flood situation analysis that the unplanned sewerage system is one of the most effective weaknesses in the area. All-embracing and integrative flood management strategies need to be implemented in the study area considering the intra-regional vulnerability and development for the resilient and sustainable development of the study area.

However, researchers are greatly undermined in their efforts to make a comprehensive assessment owing to the multidimensional and non-linear link between different indicators and flood risk. Thus, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to assess the multifaceted vulnerability of rural flooding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. This research presents a hybrid model for flood vulnerability assessment by combining TOPSIS and the entropy weight method. Households' vulnerability to flooding in rural areas is assessed through four components (social, economic, physical, and institutional) and twenty indicators. All indicator weights are derived using the entropy weight method. The TOPSIS method is then used to rank the selected research areas based on their flood vulnerability levels. The ranking results reveal that flood vulnerability is highest in the Nowshehra District, followed by the Charsadda, Peshawar, and D.I. Khan Districts. The weighting results show that physical vulnerability is the most important component, while location of household's house from the river source (< 1 km) is the key indicator for assessing flood vulnerability. A sensitivity analysis is provided to study the impact of indicator's weights on the comprehensive ranking results. The sensitivity results revealed that out of twenty indicators, fourteen indicators had the lowest sensitivity, three indicators were reported with low sensitivity while the other three were considered highly sensitive for flood vulnerability assessment. Our research has the potential to offer policymakers specific guidelines for lowering flood risk in flood-prone areas.

However, coarse mesh resolutions and approximations in physical representations of tidal rivers limit the performance of such models at resolving the complex flow dynamics especially near the river-ocean interface, resulting in inaccurate simulations of flood inundation. In this research, we propose a machine learning (ML) framework based on the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the downscaled flow at the subgrid scale. First, we demonstrate that PINN is able to assimilate observations of various types and solve the one-dimensional (1-D) Saint-Venant equations (SVE) directly. We perform the flow simulations over a floodplain and along an open channel in several synthetic case studies. The PINN performance is evaluated against analytical solutions and numerical models. Our results indicate that the PINN solutions of water depth have satisfactory accuracy with limited observations assimilated. In the case of flood wave propagation induced by storm surge and tide, a new neural network architecture is proposed based on Fourier feature embeddings that seamlessly encodes the periodic tidal boundary condition in the PINN's formulation. Furthermore, we show that the PINN-based downscaling can produce more reasonable subgrid solutions of the along-channel water depth by assimilating observational data. The PINN solution outperforms the simple linear interpolation in resolving the topography and dynamic flow regimes at the subgrid scale. This study provides a promising path toward improving emulation capabilities in large-scale models to characterize fine-scale coastal processes.

In particular, properly assessing damage to agricultural assets is important because they are complex economic systems particularly exposed to floods. The modelling approaches used to assess flood damage are of several types and can be fed by damage data collected post-flood, from experiments or based on expert knowledge. The process-based models fed by expert knowledge are the subject of research and also widely used in an operational way. Although identified as potentially transferable, they are in reality often case-specific and difficult to reuse in time (updatability) and space (transferability). In this paper, we argue that process-based models, based on a rigorous modelling process, can be suitable for application in different contexts. We propose a methodological framework aimed at verifying the conditions necessary to develop these models in a spirit of capitalisation by relying on four axes which are (i) the explicitation of assumptions, (ii) the validation, (iii) the updatability, (iv) the transferability. The methodological framework is then applied to the model we have developed in France to produce national damage functions for the agricultural sector. We show in this paper that the proposed methodological framework facilitates an explicit description of the modelling assumptions and data used, which is necessary to consider for a reuse in time or for transfer to another geographical area. In this sense, this methodological framework constitutes a solid basis for considering the validation, transfer, comparison and capitalisation of data collected around models based on processes relying on expert knowledge. In conclusion, we identify research tracks to be implemented so as to pursue this improvement in a spirit of capitalisation and international cooperation.

This research took place in three coastal lagoons on the southeast coast of the Gulf of California. The objective is to describe environmental factors controlling structure, phenological, and litter productivity in arid zone mangruves. The study sites were established along a latitudinal arid climate gradient, were evaporation (-3000 mm year(-1)) exceeds precipitation (-300 mm year(-1)), and a microtidal regime predominates. The study period was from June 2018 to May 2019. Litter productivity was quantified using litter traps, while piezometer were used to monitor surface, interstitial, and groundwater physicochemical properties and the water level. The different mangrove species present in the study area are influenced by high interstitial salinity, due to scarce freshwater inputs, because precipitation runoff is limited to the monsoon (June-August). The flowering phenophase started before the monsoon and peaked during the monsoon season, propagules production was highest in september and peaked from august to october (highest water level). Air and water temperature in warmer months influenced flower and propagules production. Despite the harsh environmental conditions provide a suboptimal scenario for mangroves to grow, resulting in low structural development and low litter productivity (-4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) influenced by temperature, and water properties (i.e. temperature, salinity and ORP), precipitation and flood pattern. An important highlight of this research is the triggered phenological response to temperature (air and water), therefore the importance of long-term monitoring of such processes and variables.

To reconstruct late Holocene vegetation and environmental dynamics in the coastal lowlands of northern Iran and to detect the possible role of climate, human and Caspian Sea level fluctuation on coastal ecosystems, multi-proxy analysis was applied on the sediment cores from the inland Eynak (EYK) lagoon and near coast Bibi Heybat (BBH) alder swamp. Results shows that in the last 170 years, strong reduction of alder forest occurred around Eynak lagoon, while an expansion occurred in the coastal area in the last 100 years. This indicates that human impact shifted from the near coast to elevated inland, which might be due to the raised water level from the Caspian Sea and the coastal area of BBH region was flooded by brackish water from the Caspian Sea, and was not so suitable for agriculture anymore. This study indicate that alder swamp extent is different between coastal and inland sites, suggesting that further studies of multiple records across the region are needed. Moreover, this study helps to distangle human impacts from wetland processes and thus will be an important contribution to effective climate mitigation and conservation strategies. This multi-proxy study presents important palynological records, which helps to understand past and future impacts of various drivers, such as climate, human impact and sea level changes on wetland ecosystems both regionally and globally.

These disasters leave limited time for the affected population to respond. Hence, Shelter-In Place (SIP) strategies have been suggested to complement large-scale evacuation, aiming to secure individuals within local communities immediately. In the problem context of dam-failure floods, the priority of SIP is to elevate the individuals above the flooded ground, and Vertical Evacuation Structures/Shelters (VESs) are designed to contain these SIP evacuees. However, a portion of the flood-affected population cannot be accommodated because of the limited capacities of VESs. Accordingly, these evacuees must evacuate outside the flooded area, known as Horizontal Evacuation (HE). This study formulates the VES location problem considering VE and HE: the established VESs will cover as many evacuees as possible and reduce the system evacuation time for HE. The VES locations and the HE evacuee assignment are interdependent, as reflected by factoring individual evacuation time. Therefore, this study develops a bi-level programming model to address the interdependence. Furthermore, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to analyze the evacuation time for evacuees at each node. The bi-level model is verified using the network of Tucheng District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, impacted by dam-failure floods. Results show that the total evacuation time can be reduced significantly after integrating HE into VES planning.

An accurate estimation of typhoon disaster risk has important implications in terms of forming disaster reduction strategies. Recent typhoon risk assessments fail to consider mitigation capacity and its quantitative relationships with other risk factors, causing uncertainties. To address this, mitigation capacity was used as the key parameter for building a novel risk assessment model with improved accuracy. A comprehensive assessment framework of mitigation capacity was designed covering the entire process of disaster prevention-resistance-rescue. This proposed method was applied and tested to Hainan Island. When mitigation capacity was included in the typhoon risk model, the correlation coefficient between typhoon risk and disaster losses increased by ca. 0.1 with different functions compared to common models, which do not include mitigation capacity. The typhoon risk model demonstrated better performance in terms of explaining actual disaster losses in the medium and high levels of typhoon hazards. This demonstrates that mitigation capacity plays an important role in controlling disaster losses. Owing to the high correlation and less parameter determination, the negative correlation function was recommended as the optimal equation for typhoon risk estimation when including mitigation capacity. The increased explanatory ability of this typhoon risk estimation model confirms its effectiveness in explaining disaster losses. These improvements can support the design of differentiated typhoon mitigation strategies for varying degrees of typhoon risk to minimise the losses from typhoons.

Therefore, this paper focused on developing the synthetic type of FDFs for agriculture and rural households through the data of a well-structured questionnaire survey conducted in two pilot sub-districts of northeastern Bangladesh in the Meghna River basin. Multiple regression analyses were performed on the collected data, and the best performing models were selected to establish FDFs. The FDF for agriculture (~196 samples) was developed concerning damage to Boro rice, whereas the FDFs for households (~165 samples) were developed concerning damage to the buildings and household property of three house types (Mud, Brick, and Concrete), separately. The results revealed that there were no yield losses when the water levels were lower than 25 cm (~rice tiller height), and the yield losses were ~100% when the water levels were 70-75 cm deep (~rice grain height). Mud houses and their household property were found the most flood-vulnerable and likely to experience total damage when the water levels exceeded 150 cm above the plinth level, whereas the damage to Brick and Concrete houses and their household property was found likely to remain partial even when the water levels exceeded 150 cm above the plinth level. The developed FDFs can be used to assess potential flood risk in the study area for sustainable and effective management of flood disasters and build back better under global change in the future.

Estimation of greenhouse gas emissions of a tropical reservoir in Colombia	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						bubbling; diffusive fluxes; greenhouse gases; reservoir; tropical climate	HYDROELECTRIC RESERVOIRS; GHG EMISSIONS; CARBON EMISSION; SURFACE-WATER; METHANE; RIVER; GENERATION; DIOXIDE; IMPACTS; AMAZON	Tropical reservoirs are generally flooded in soils with a high content of organic matter. This, combined with high temperatures, favors the generation of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) by biological degradation, contributing to the impact on climate change. A tropical reservoir in Colombia was monitored for 7 years in the pre-fill, fill and post-fill stages, for the last of these during the day and night. Emissions from diffusive fluxes at the surface of the water were measured using a floating static chamber, while inverted funnel methodology was used to measure the fluxes by bubbling. The samples collected in the field were analyzed in the laboratory using a gas chromatograph with a mass detector. The results showed average emissions of 70,892.51 +/- 41,079.16-ton CO2eq/year for pre-filling; 178,254.53 +/- 105,838.01-ton CO2eq/year for filling; and 466,946.57-ton CO2eq/year for post-filling (for 5 years), concluding that the weather conditions and the filling percentage (Area surface and volume) had an impact on the generation of greenhouse gases at filling and post-filling stages, as did the organic matter present in the area of influence of the sampling point. Higher greenhouse gas emissions were found during the day compared to the results at night, indicating that temperature affects these processes, especially in tropical reservoirs. This study, currently unique in Colombia, will allow directing efforts towards mitigating the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in tropical reservoirs.

Balancing stakeholders' narratives and interactions in the management of El Hondo Natural Park, Spain	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Coastal wetland; Agriculture; Conservation; Decision-making process; El Hondo Natural Park; Spain	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; VALENCIA WETLAND; WATER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; PARTICIPATION; FLOODPLAIN; CONFLICTS; CONTRACT	Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and valuable ecosystems worldwide, although one of the main factors affecting their survival is the coexistence between agriculture and conservation. This paper analyses the complex balance between agriculture and conservation coexistence in El Hondo Natural Park (Alicante, Spain) coastal wetland by examining stakeholders' narratives, perceptions, and interactions. The aim is to highlight the concurrence between socio-economic progress and socio-environmental justice perspectives by identifying those driving factors motivating stakeholders' conflicts while expanding stakeholders' behaviour and interaction when discussing the current and future management of this socio-ecological system. Data were collected between April and June 2019 from semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to river basin authorities, regional governments, municipalities, irrigation communities, union farms, regional and local ecologist groups, and social movements; and scrutinized through qualitative data analysis and descriptive statistics. Stakeholders discussed the main driving factors identified through the local newspapers to motivating current conflicts and confronting perspectives in El Hondo Natural Park: (1) the origin and evolution of the coastal wetland, (2) the provision and value of ecosystem services, (3) the management of water scarcity and water quality standards, (4) the guarantee and management of public and private investment, and (5) consequences of a natural park declaration. Likewise, the triple-loop analysis of stakeholders' representativeness, relevance and collaboration highlighted examples of stakeholders' underrepresentation and power imbalance, a negative assessment of the stakeholders' actions, and how agreements are based on both stakeholders' predisposition to collaborate and affinity.

Satellite imaging reveals increased proportion of population exposed to floods	NATURE			English	Article							WATER; VULNERABILITY; FRAMEWORK; BENEFITS; RISK	Satellite imagery for the period 2000-2018 reveals that population growth was greater in flood-prone regions than elsewhere, thus exposing a greater proportion of the population to floods. Flooding affects more people than any other environmental hazard and hinders sustainable development(1,2). Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods(3). Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization(4), flood mitigation infrastructure(5) and increasing settlements in floodplains(6). Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty(3,7-11). Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255-290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58-86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates(7). Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods.

La Nina weather impacts dietary patterns and dietary diversity among children in the Peruvian Amazon	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Climate change; Peru; ENSO; Diets; Amazon; Nutrition; Children	EL-NINO; VULNERABILITY; EVENTS; ACCESS	Objective: In 2011-2012, severe El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions (La Nina) led to massive flooding and temporarily displacement in the Peruvian Amazon. Our aims were to examine the impact of this ENSO exposure on child diets, in particular: (1) frequency of food consumption patterns, (2) the amount of food consumed (g/d), (3) dietary diversity (DD), (4) consumption of donated foods, among children aged 9-36 months living in the outskirts of City of Iquitos in the Amazonian Peru. Design: This was a longitudinal study that used quantitative 24-h recall dietary data collection from children aged 9-36 months from 2010 to 2014 as part of the MAL-ED birth cohort study. Setting: Iquitos, Loreto, Peru. Participants: Two hundred and fifty-two mother-child dyads. Results: The frequency of grains, rice, dairy and sugar in meals reduced by 5-7 %, while the frequency of plantain in meals increased by 24 % after adjusting for covariates. ENSO exposure reduced girl's intake of plantains and sugar. Despite seasonal fluctuations in the availability of fruits, vegetables and fish, DD remained constant across seasons and as children aged. However, DD was significantly reduced under moderate La Nina conditions by 0 center dot 32 (P < 0 center dot 05) food groups. Adaptive social strategies such as consumption of donated foods were significantly higher among households with girls. Conclusions: This is the first empirical study to show differential effect of the ENSO on the dietary patterns of children, highlighting differences by gender. Public health nutrition programmes should be climate- and gender-sensitive in their efforts to safeguard the diets of vulnerable populations.

In the last decades, the need to mitigate such phenomena and preserve natural resources, including landscapes, has motivated a number of local and national authorities to promote the use of soil bioengineering techniques. Consequently, these techniques have been increasingly used with variable success rates. This study analysed the efficiencies of different bioengineering structures to mitigate geo-hydrological risks by examining the interventions installed between 2007 and 2013 in the Avellino Province southern Italy. To this end, a specific project consistency analysis and functionality classification were carried out and the causes of inefficiencies were identified. The analysis showed that after a few years, only a small number of the installed bioengineering structures were fully functional and efficient. Overall, the installed structures were generally affected by maintenance issues and in many cases they suffered from design and execution issues, inducing a generally lower degree of efficiency, with most of them classified as 'not very efficient'. The conclusions of this work are that i) the long-term efficiency of a bioengineering structure is related to its correct design, installation, and maintenance; ii) the design of a bioengineering structure should account for the geological, geotechnical and hydrological characteristics of the area of interest, and iii) maintenance must not affect the short-term efficiency of a structure, but may affect the long-term efficiency.

Compared to quantitative aspects of fluvial systems, however, studies describing the physical properties of river sediment are still quite limited. This work examines how an unprecedented engineering effort (the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme, WSRS) within the lower Yellow River system has caused important changes in the volume and grain size patterns of transported sediment. After the implementation of the WSRS, artificial floods dominated the delivery of water and sediment to the delta region-the natural (seasonal) rhythm of the hydrological cycle has been replaced by impulsive delivery. Compared to natural floods, the duration of the artificial flood due to WSRS is substantially shortened, and timing has changed to early summer (June to July), which is two to three months ahead of the usual flood season. Now, as a result of WSRS, there are high sediment loads over a shorter than usual time frame. The Yellow River's sediment load rebounded and coarsened, because artificial floods have strongly scoured the river channel. These changes turned the Yellow River delta from a recession phase to one of progradation, and caused impulsive delivery and rapidly buried of terrestrial organic carbon and pollutants.

This paper describes an empirical method that aims to improve our understanding of the performance of benthic filter feeders experiencing changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature, on time scales of minutes to hours, especially during daily cycles or extreme events such as marine heatwaves or hypoxic upwelling. We describe the Fluorometer and Oximeter equipped Flow-through Setup (FOFS), experimental design, and methodological protocols to evaluate the flood of data, enabling researchers to monitor important energy budget traits, including filtration and respiration of benthic filter-feeders in response to fine-tuned environmental variability. FOFS allows online recording of deviations in chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentrations induced by the study organism. Transparent data processing through Python scripts provides the possibility to adjust procedures to needs when working in different environmental contexts (e.g., temperature vs. pH, salinity, oxygen, biological cues) and with different filter-feeding species. We successfully demonstrate the functionality of the method through recording responses of Baltic Sea blue mussels (Mytilus) during one-day thermal cycles. This method practically provides a tool to help researchers exposing organisms to environmental variability for some weeks or months, to relate the observed long-term performance responses to short-term energy budget responses, and to explain their findings with the potential to generalize patterns. The method, therefore, allows a more detailed description of stress-response relationships and the detection of species' tolerance limits.

Short-term impacts of a record-shattering flood and dam removal on a river turtle assemblage and population placed within the context of a 50 year study	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Long-term study; Turtle; Population; Community; Flood; Dam removal	ADULT STRIPED BASS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; DEMOGRAPHICS; SUBADULT; ECOLOGY; STREAM; DIET	Long-term studies are essential for understanding how and to what extent various stressors impact long-lived species, such as turtles. Turtle populations are declining globally. Empirical data from long-term studies of turtles are largely lacking, which hinders the development of effective conservation programs. We evaluated a river turtle assemblage over a 50 year study period (1969-2019), during which the assemblage was impacted by harvesting, habitat degradation, a record-shattering flood, and the removal of a small dam. Our objective was to determine how the turtle assemblage, Graptemys geographica population (i.e., predominant species), and habitat changed in light of a recent record-shattering flood and the removal of a small dam, and place those changes within the context of other stressors documented within the 50 year study period. The record-shattering flood changed the stream and riparian habitat and, along with the dam removal, the turtle assemblage. In the short term, G. geographica and other turtle species within the assemblage, with the exception of Sternotherus odoratus, either exhibited positive or neutral impacts from the flood. We conclude that turtle species adapted to lotic habitats can cope with extreme flooding if their populations are secure prior to flooding and if the riparian and stream habitats are intact. However, as more threats simultaneously impact turtle populations, we expect fewer populations to be able to withstand such additional stressors. Within the context provided by the fifty year study period, we found that harvesting had more immediate negative impacts on the G. geographica population than did flooding.

CATENA			English	Article						Human-environment interactions; Pedo-sedimentary archives; Geoarchaeology; Soil Micromorphology; Palaeosoils; Limagne; Holocene	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICROMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SOIL FORMATION; RHONE VALLEY; BRONZE-AGE; IRON-AGE; RECORD; LAKE; SEQUENCE; FRANCE	This paper presents a multi-proxy geoarchaeological analysis of the complex pedo-sedimentary archives of a small pond situated within the protohistoric site of Corent, in central France. A robust chrono-stratigraphic framework was developed integrating all chronological data from previous studies. Micromorphological, geochemical and sedimentological analyses were performed on a radiocarbon-dated core. Results are discussed alongside palynological data from previous work on the same core, in order to reconstruct human-environmental interactions on the Corent volcanic plateau since the Neolithic. After intense soil erosion recorded during the Early and Middle Neolithic, the Late Neolithic is characterized by vegetation recovery and soil stability in the basin contemporaneous with site abandonment, perhaps due to pronounced soil degradation in the plateau. During the Early Bronze Age, agropastoral land use contributed to major environmental changes in the pond's basin, including soil profile sealing and gleyfication. Environmental impact patterns detected in the pedo-sedimentary record indicate settlement intensification during the Middle Bronze Age. After the substantial impacts of an intense anthropogenic disturbance in the Early Iron Age, the Lac du Puy becomes a vertic depression recurrently flooded while a late Iron Age Gallic oppidum develops on the plateau, and is finally backfilled at the end of the Iron Age. The detailed multi-proxy picture from this intra-urban wetland helps nuance our understanding of the environmental impacts of prehistoric societies in Western Europe. Indeed, our results highlight the importance of keeping a long term perspective when dealing with past human-environment interactions.

CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Sea-level rise; Coastal adaptation; Retreat; Multiple streams; New institutionalism	MULTIPLE-STREAMS APPROACH; SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS; MANAGED RETREAT; MIGRATION; FRAMEWORK; PATHWAY; IMPACT; MODEL	The predominant responses to rising sea levels are in situ adaptations. However, increasing rates of sea-level rise will render ex situ adaptations-in the form of relocation-sinevitable in some low-lying coastal zones. Particularly small island states like the Maldives face this significant adaptation challenge. Here, government action is necessary to move vulnerable communities out of flood-prone areas. Yet, little empirical knowledge exists about the governance of relocations. While the literature often highlights risks and benefits of relocations, it remains unclear how governments organized relocations and what drove relocation policy. Therefore, we examined Maldivian relocation policies from 1968 to 2018 to explain government support of relocations. For this, we used a qualitative research design and extended the multiple streams approach with the theoretical lens of historical institutionalism. To gather data, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with relocation policy experts and locals affected by relocations. Interview data was complemented with a desk review of relevant laws, historical records, and policy documents. We find 29 completed and 25 failed cases of relocations in the 50-year period. Key drivers of relocation policies are focusing events, socioeconomic development, and institutionalized island autonomy. We find that relocations were predominantly initiated as means to facilitate economic development, not as a response to rising seas or coastal risk. With current rapid economic development and strengthened democratic institutions, relocations are not considered as a policy option anymore. We conclude that implementing relocations proactively will face significant barriers in the future, which highlights the urgency of successful in situ adaptations in the Maldives.

To date, however, there is no robust evidence on projected changes in compound flooding for northwestern Europe. We combine projected storm surges and river floods with probabilistic, localized relative sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios to assess the future compound flood hazard over northwestern coastal Europe in the high (RCP8.5) emission scenario. We use high-resolution, dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCM) to drive a storm surge model and a hydrological model, and analyze the joint occurrence of high coastal water levels and associated river peaks in a multivariate copula-based approach. The RCM-forced multimodel mean reasonably represents the observed spatial pattern of the dependence strength between annual maxima surge and peak river discharge, although substantial discrepancies exist between observed and simulated dependence strength. All models overestimate the dependence strength, possibly due to limitations in model parameterizations. This bias affects compound flood hazard estimates and requires further investigation. While our results suggest decreasing compound flood hazard over the majority of sites by 2050s (2040-2069) compared to the reference period (1985-2005), an increase in projected compound flood hazard is limited to around 34% of the sites. Further, we show the substantial role of SLR, a driver of compound floods, which has frequently been neglected. Our findings highlight the need to be aware of the limitations of the current generation of Earth system models in simulating coastal compound floods.

To understand how different attributes perform across Canada for identifying homogeneous regions, this study examines five distinctive attributes (i.e., geographical proximity, flood seasonality, physiographic variables, monthly precipitation pattern, and monthly temperature pattern) for their ability to identify homogeneous regions at 186 gauging sites with their annual maximum flow data. We propose a novel region revision procedure to complement the well-known region of influence and L-Moments techniques that automates the identification of homogeneous regions across continental domains. Results are presented spatially for Canada to assess patterning of homogeneous regions. Memberships of two selected regions are investigated to provide insight into membership characteristics. Sites in eastern Canada are highly likely to identify homogeneous flood regions, while the western prairie and mountainous regions are not. Overall, it is revealed that the success of identifying homogeneous regions depends on local hydrological complexities, whether the considered attribute(s) reflect primary flooding mechanism(s), and on whether catchment sites are clustered in a small geographic region. Formation of effective pooling groups affords the extension of record lengths across the Canadian domain (where gauges typically have <50 years of record), facilitating more comprehensive analysis of higher return period flood needs for climate change assessment.

To this end, in this study, the effects of the watershed partitioning level and optimization algorithm for hydrological simulation uncertainty were assessed based on the semi-distributed TOPMODEL model, i.e., six watershed partitioning levels and three intelligent global optimization algorithms were used in the source region of the Yellow River. Meanwhile, the uncertainty contribution of the individual and interaction of the watershed partitioning levels and optimization algorithms on the hydrological process were dynamically evaluated using the variance decomposition method based on subsampling. Results showed that the impacts of the watershed partitioning level and optimization algorithm on the runoff simulation were particularly obvious for different characteristic periods. In the flood period, the optimization algorithm was the dominant factor affecting the runoff simulation uncertainty, with the proportion of up to 0.50, whereas the contribution of the watershed partitioning level was only 0.22. In the non-flood period, they contributed substantially to the uncertainty of the runoff simulation, accounting for about 0.30. Moreover, the interactions between the watershed partitioning level and optimization algorithm had a strong influence throughout the year, especially in the non-flood period, which may be because the hydrological model amplifies the output error and increases the interaction effect. Generally, the results shed important insight into reducing the uncertainty of the runoff simulation in future research.

Therefore, this study aims at first to measure the risk perception of the vulnerable households in the rural areas of Pakistan and, second, to assess the determinants and to estimate their impacts on risk perception among different groups of households. Data were collected through questionnaire survey from 382 respondents in two districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. Risk perception was measured through a Likert scale for a set of indicators, and the composite index was calculated. Moreover, univariate and multivariate logistic models were applied to explore the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Results of risk perception show that 50.52% of the respondents perceived a high risk of floods in the study area. Results of regression models show that the age group 40-50 years was less likely to perceive a high risk of floods. Respondents with flood experience, education (higher secondary and above), household location (near the bank of streams) and household distance from the river (<= 500) were more likely to perceive high floods risk. Furthermore, respondents in the riverine flood-prone areas perceived high flood risk than respondents in the flash flood-prone regions. The study contributes in terms of useful information about the risk perception of floods and the determinants of flood risk perception in rural areas. These findings can help the provincial disaster management authorities and local disaster management units in understanding flood risk and implementing relevant interventions at the local level that can be used in adaptation to floods and other climate-induced disasters.

To investigate the resulting changes in flood hazard, we numerically model the February 1996 and January 1923 floods (the largest and third-largest Willamette River floods since 1900) under present and potential future run-off and sea level scenarios. First, we reproduce the actual February 1996 flood to within a root-mean-square error of 0.05 m (N = 7) for peak water levels. Next, we run scenarios in which three SLR scenarios (0, 0.6, and 1.5 m) are combined with two river run-off scenarios (0% and 10% run-off increase). Then the slightly larger 1923 flood scenario is run, but with modern (higher than historical) Columbia River flow. The results indicate that a 10% increase in river run-off increased the1996 flood magnitude by 0.78 m, while 1923 flow increases flood magnitude by 0.82 m. Overall, the type and magnitude of future flood hazards vary with reach. The Portland/Vancouver Metropolitan area is most sensitive to changes in run-off, with a smaller change of similar to 0.2-0.26 m per meter of SLR. By contrast, coastal regions are quite sensitive to amplified sea level and exhibit nonlinear responses based on changes to river slope and tides. Between the fluvial region and the estuary, a region of compound flood hazard exists that is sensitive to changes in river discharge, sea level, tides, and storm surge.

Lipid Biomarker Record Documents Hydroclimatic Variability of the Mississippi River Basin During the Common Era	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						lipid biomarker; leaf wax; brGDGT; Common Era; paleoclimate; hydroclimate	DIALKYL GLYCEROL TETRAETHERS; HOLOCENE DUNE ACTIVITY; WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; LAND-USE; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; CAHOKIA	Floods and droughts in the Mississippi River basin are perennial hazards that cause severe economic disruption. Here we develop and analyze a new lipid biomarker record from Horseshoe Lake (Illinois, USA) to evaluate the climatic conditions associated with hydroclimatic extremes that occurred in this region over the last 1,800 years. We present geochemical proxy evidence of temperature and moisture variability using branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and plant leaf wax hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2(wax)) and use isotope-enabled coupled model simulations to diagnose the controls on these proxies. Our data show pronounced warming during the Medieval era (CE 1000-1,600) that corresponds to midcontinental megadroughts. Severe floods on the upper Mississippi River basin also occurred during the Medieval era and correspond to periods of enhanced warm-season moisture. Our findings imply that projected increases in temperature and warm-season precipitation could enhance both drought and flood hazards in this economically vital region. Plain Language Summary The Mississippi River basin is an economically vital region for industry and agriculture, but it is prone to disruptive flooding and drought. Here we use organic molecules preserved in a lake sediment core to reconstruct the temperature and seasonal moisture patterns of the last 1,800 years. Our reconstruction shows that the Medieval period (ca. CE 1000-1,600) was relatively warm and that warmer temperatures in this region are associated with increased frequencies of severe droughts and floods. These findings generally support climate model projections of increasing drought and flood hazard in the Mississippi River basin as a result of anthropogenic climate change.

Nitrogen and Phosphorus Export After Flooding of Agricultural Land by Coastal Managed Realignment	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Gyldensteen Coastal Lagoon; N and P; Soil inventories; Soil-water flux; Tidal export	SALT-MARSH; SEDIMENT STRUCTURE; REDOX CONDITIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WETLAND SOILS; ESTUARINE; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; CARBON; DENITRIFICATION	Climate-driven sea level rise has severe consequences for drained agricultural areas near coasts. The least productive of these can be restored into marine wetlands of high ecological quality by managed realignment. This study assessed the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balance in a 214 ha coastal lagoon formed after flooding of agricultural land by managed realignment. N and P loss from the soils was monitored over a 5-year period after flooding using three independent approaches: (1) temporal changes in N and P inventories of the soil; (2) flux of dissolved inorganic N and P from the flooded soil; and (3) tidal N and P exchange across the outer boundary in the form of particulate and dissolved nutrients. All three approaches showed similar initial release and tidal export of N and P the first year(s) after flooding followed by decreasing rates. The annual loss ranged from 157 to 299 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)and 29 to 63 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)during the first year. N loss decreased rapidly after the first 2 years and reached a level of 28-65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), while P loss declined after the first year and remained stable and relatively high at 18-32 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)thereafter. High N and P export after implementing managed realignment of agricultural land may deteriorate environmental conditions in the adjacent marine recipients for at least 5 years. Particularly small and stagnant water bodies vulnerable to eutrophication should be avoided as recipients.

Bioretention basins can effectively alleviate urban flooding by short-term water retention. Reclaimed water (RW) is considered an alternative water resource during water shortages. In this study, the abilities for waterlogging tolerance of four herbaceous flowers (angelonia, narrow-leaf zinnia, celosia, and medallion flower) are investigated to screen suitable ornamental plants for bioretention basins, and the influence of RW on the plants is also evaluated. All plants were treated with 10 days of waterlogging (electrical conductivity (EC) of tap water = 110.0 mu S center dot cm(-1)) followed by a seven-day recovery. Angelonia (Angeloniasalicariifolia Humb. & Bonpl) was not affected by waterlogging and showed the best performance, judged from the ornamental quality, photosynthesis rate, and leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) among the tested flowers. Photosynthesis of the narrow-leaf zinnia (Zinnia angustifoliaKunth) decreased during waterlogging but soon recovered after being drained. Celosia (Celosia argenteaL.) and medallion flower (Melampodium paludosumKunth) were significantly affected by waterlogging and did not recover after drainage, in terms of responses to both external and physiological reactions. Moreover, waterlogging by the simulated RW (EC = 542.4 mu S center dot cm(-1)) did not have negative impacts on angelonia and narrow-leaf zinnia, due to the reduced leaf malondialdehyde concentration of angelonia and retarded the decline in the net photosynthesis rate of narrow-leaf zinnia. Thus, RW could be used as an alternative irrigation water resource for bioretention basins during the dry season to maintain plant growth.

The classical view of meandering rivers is a sinuous planform with rounded bends, which grow and migrate until they are cut-off. However, many low-energy meandering rivers have planforms that are much more complex than this classical view due to the heterogeneity of their alluvium, and show relatively limited channel migration. Based on a detailed palaeogeographic study of the Dommel River in The Netherlands, it is inferred that low-energy meandering rivers may develop tortuous planforms with sharp bends, owing to self-formed deposits that increasingly constrain the channel mobility. This mechanism is corroborated by data from 47 meandering river reaches of varied scale from around the world, which show that erosion-resistant floodplain deposits are preserved in the river banks when the river energy is below a critical threshold. The term 'self-constraining' is proposed for low-energy rivers where an increase in bank stability over time results in progressive tortuous planforms and reduced mobility. A conceptual model, based on the dataset, shows that the increase in bank stability over time also increases the energy required to break out of the tendancy to self-constrain. Self-constraining thereby enhances the resilience of the system to bank erosion, while an unexpected increase in bank erosion may occur if river energy exceeds the critical threshold. This study provides a novel explanation for the evolution of low-energy river planforms and dynamics, and provides new insights on their responses to climate changes.	[Candel, Jasper H.

In the past 10 years, urban flooding events have caused huge disaster losses in Chinese cities. This has resulted in significant negative effects on the urban infrastructure, socioeconomic systems, and urban residents, thus causing widespread concern. Studies have confirmed the change in extreme rainstorms is due to the changing environments in many cities globally Conducting studies on the impact of these rainstorms with different characteristics for urban flooding is valuable for coping with unfavorable situations In addition, numerical simulations provide an economical and viable means to perform these studies. This paper presents a numerical model of Xiamen Island in China. Simulations were conducted for 12 design rainstorm events with different return periods, rain patterns, and durations. The results indicate that, in the case of an equal rainfall amount, the rainfall intensity is the key factor that affects the inundated area, depth, and damages. However, the rainfall intensity is not the only determining factor; the rainfall pattern also affects the inundations. In regard to the rainfall pattern, a higher rainfall peak coefficient usually leads to severe urban inundation and damage. As a result, the lag time would be shorter, which may further exacerbate the impact of urban flood disasters. The results of this study provide insights into managing flood risks, developing urban flood prevention strategies, and designing flood prevention measures.

While much ES research has focused on forests and wetlands, synthesizing the currently somewhat sporadic studies of grassland ecosystem services (GESs) is much needed. Objectives We aimed to review the scope, major methods, and key findings of GESs, and identify knowledge gaps and future directions. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles published during 1970-2018 (including 380 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science and 32 book chapters from Google Scholar). Results The number of GES studies has accelerated in recent decades, with China (31%) and the United States (18%) together accounting for almost half of them. A total of 33 GESs were mentioned in the searched articles, of which carbon sequestration, forage production, and water erosion control had the highest frequencies. Methods for evaluating GESs include field survey, field experiments, and statistical and process-based modeling. Grasslands are the primary source of meat and dairy products, account for about one-third of the total carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, and provide numerous other ESs, such as night cooling, soil erosion control, and flood mitigation. Conclusions This review presents the state-of-the-science of GESs, and identifies several future research directions. To move forward, we propose a framework with a 3-M methodology: (1) "Multi-scales"-understanding GESs from various spatiotemporal scales; (2) "Multi-methods"-evaluating GESs with multiple statistical and modeling techniques using multiple data sources; and (3) "Multi-perspectives"-assessing GESs from ecological, social, and economic perspectives for sustainability.

Studies of this type are scarce in the Mexican tropic, specifically those that relate landscape aspects with regional soils. Knowledge of these relations allows more efficient and economic soil surveys. The objective of this work is to zone the geomorphological landscapes and relief/modeling to classify soil units in the plains and terraces of Tacotalpa and Jalapa in Tabasco, Mexico. Based on the geopedological approach, geomorphological landscapes at 1:250000 scale and relief/modeling at 1:50000 scale were classified and mapped. At the same scales, soil groups and soil units were classified and mapped, with the support of orthophotos, a digital elevation model, and field verification. Eighty-two percent of the study area corresponds to a flat area on fluvial and marshy sediments. The remaining area corresponds to terraces and hills. Fourteen reliefs/models were mapped: active channel, inactive channel, high and low natural dam, meander beach, floodplain, decantation basin, cumulative valley, low hillock slightly convex to concave, low lomerio slightly convex, low to high lomerio slightly convex,moderately convex high hill, strongly convex hill, and erosive valley. Six soil groups were classified: Gleysols 65%, Fluvisols 15%, Lixisols 8%, Luvisols 7%, Alisols 4.02%, and Histosols 1%, with 27 qualifiers (primary and secondary). This study at the scale 1:50000 allows explaining the geographical distribution of the soil units in the different geoforms and relief/modeling.

Assessing households' vulnerability therefore becomes critical and urgent to help policy-makers in Vietnam in facilitating the implementation of adaptation strategies for households living in this area. Thus, this paper employed the Household Vulnerability Index method along with the qualitative data analysis to evaluate the vulnerability level of smallholder farmers under the effect of these hazards. Data was collected from 405 households in three communes of Yen Bai province, one of the poorest provinces in the Northern Mountainous Regions of Vietnam with a high proportion of ethnic minorities who have extremely low incomes and education levels. Food and fresh water quality and security are also relatively low in this region. The empirical results indicate that ethnicity, diversified sources of income, organizational membership, health insurance, food security, land tenure documentation, water resources, and locational dimensions are the key factors affecting the vulnerability of farmers under the impacts of flash floods and landslides. Results also suggest that the livelihoods of farmers in the Dai Son commune are the most vulnerable to these natural hazards identified by the Social Network, Socio-Demographic Profile, and Water component factors. We subsequently identify and prioritize measures to ensure sustainable livelihoods for local farmers through practices, such as improving people's literacy, enhancing production systems, and strengthening natural resource management strategies.

The low country is part of the northwest European Loess Belt and is characterised by large plains and minor streams. This configuration allowed for the deposition of original sedimentary records during the Weichselian Upper Pleniglacial. A strong and extensive fluvial activity occured during the Pleniglacial in valley floors. Around 22 ka, the river system retracted and the valleys were filled with loess. The sandy alluvial deposits (S) present on all the valley floors then passed to predominantly silty formations (L): loess or loess reworked by runoff (fluvio-aeolian facies). While flows disappeared on the slopes and in the upstream terminations of basins, they continued in channels further downstream. Small dunes (sand or alternation of sand and loess) developed locally near hydrographic axes and on larger surfaces in the Scarp River plain. The (S) and (L) formations are correlated to the Older Cover Sand 1 of the northern sandy area. The occurrence of thermokarst depressions is suspected in the Scarpe Plain at the end of the Upper Pleniglacial. At the end of the Pleniglacial, linear or meandering channels were present in the upstream basins. Downstream, an active band, possibly braided, was incised in the loessic plains. During the return to temperate conditions, some inherited channels were simply flooded.

There is, thus, a need to create modernized flood risk management tools to support small and rural communities' preparations for future extreme events. In this study, we developed spatial flood information for an indigenous community in Central Saskatchewan using LiDAR based DEM and a spatial modeling tool, the wetland DEM ponding model (WDPM). A crucial element of flood mapping in this study was community engagement in data collection, scenario description for WDPM, and flood map validation. Community feedback was also used to evaluate the utility of the modelled flood outputs. The results showed the accuracy of WDPM outputs could be improved not only with the quality of DEM but also with additional community-held information on contributing areas (watershed information). Based on community feedback, this accessible, spatially-focused modeling approach can provide relevant information for community spatial planning and developing risk management strategies. Our study found community engagement to be valuable in flood modeling and mapping by: providing necessary data, validating input data through lived experiences, and providing alternate scenarios to be used in future work. This research demonstrates the suitability and utility of LiDAR and WDPM complemented by community participation for improving flood mapping in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). The approach used in the study also serves as an important guide for applying transdisciplinary tools and methods for establishing good practice in research and helping build resilient communities in the Prairies.

Management pathways for the floodplain wetlands of the southern Murray-Darling Basin: Lessons from history	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						adaptation pathways; climate change; Murray-Darling Basin; paleolimnology; water resources; wetlands	PALEOLIMNOLOGICAL RECORDS; DEEP UNCERTAINTY; AQUATIC REFUGIA; HUMAN IMPACTS; RIVER; AUSTRALIA; ADAPTATION; CLIMATE; ECOSYSTEMS	The condition of floodplain wetlands of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) reflects the combined effects of climate variability, river regulation, vegetation clearance, and the impacts of human settlement and industry. Today, these systems are degraded, in large part due to changes in the hydroecology of waterways arising from water diversion and abstraction to sustain irrigated agriculture. The MDB Plan directs substantial investment towards the restoration of ecosystems largely via the buy-back of water allocations, under a cap-and-trade system, for use as environmental flows. This region is projected to receive less winter rainfall and run-off, which could exacerbate the impact of water diversions. Long-term climate records suggest a higher level of resilience to drying than may be inferred from modern studies. Further, palaeoecological records of change reveal that many wetlands that are perennial today were once naturally seasonal or intermittent, and that much wetland degradation predates regulation and can be attributed to declines in water quality, rather than quantity. A mix of approaches to rehabilitate this long-degraded system, planned and implemented over an extended period, may meet the demands of the Water Act of 2007, but also support the regional economy. An adaptive management approach offers a framework within which to map system vulnerabilities, characterize climate pressures, identify adaptation options, and monitor outcomes along a pathway to a sustainable future. Early lessons show the extent to which such a deliberative framework can assist water reform under changing socio-economic priorities and external hydroclimatic pressures.

In la Playa site (Sonora, NW Mexico), the evidences of sedentary population, land cultivation, and water management developed after the end of Altithermal period (around 4500 yr BP) include more than 550 archaeological features including hundreds of human cremations and a net of buried artificial channels. These findings were closely associated with several palaeosol levels alternating with sediments within a large alluvial fan. We studied micromorphological features, physical characteristics (color, texture, rock magnetic properties), and composition of organic matter, from three profiles (Maravillas, Zanja, and Cuatro Suelos), to reconstruct pedogenesis and sedimentary environment of the palaeosol sequences. Additional paleoenvironmental information was extracted from pollen assemblages, extracted from the Cuatro Suelos profile. The results pointed to a long period of geomorphic and climatic stability in the early-middle Holocene marked by a well-developed red Cambisol. This period was followed by an unstable interval around 4.5 kyr BP marked by severe erosion of earlier soil profiles and sedimentation of different kind: channel, floodplain, and fluvio-eolian. Later synsedimentary Fluvisols were formed showing signs of predominantly arid pedogenesis, interrupted by occasional flooding; indicators of human impact were also encountered. We conclude that the shift to irrigated agriculture as the main subsistence activity occurred during the period of major climatic and geomorphic fluctuation and then irrigation developed further under dry environment with limited water resources during the Late Holocene.

The Kumgangsan Dam was constructed (in North Korea) in the Transboundary River (North Han river) that affects the water resources downstream (in South Korea) of the dam. The amount of water resource (e.g., streamflow, discharge) downstream of the Kumgangsan dam has decreased after the dam construction which might cause decreased hydroelectric power and water pollution in the downstream dams, especially during the dry season. Thus, this study analyzed the changes in the inflow into the Euiam Lake (North Han River) by the construction of the Kumgangsan Dam through hydrological modeling and examined the discharge of Chuncheon Dam (inflow into Euiam Lake) considering the flow control in the Kumgangsan Dam under the dry condition scenario. In addition, the changes of base flow during different seasons were analyzed because the majority of streamflow is contributed by the base flow during dry and drought seasons. As shown in the results, it was found that the discharge from the Kumgangsan Dam has a wide effect on the downstream dams located in South Korea. The inflow of downstream dams was significantly influenced by the discharge of the upstream dam, and the base flow was also affected by the decreased discharge of dams. Based on these findings, upstream dam managements should be carefully considered to maintain the water resource and aquatic ecosystem for the downstream dam watershed. Furthermore, the results of this study can be used as the preliminary information when discussing the problems of water allocation and flood prevention with North Korea.

Low Impact Development (LID) practices are decentralized alternatives for flood mitigation and prevention. Recently, their potential has increasingly been studied in terms of stormwater harvesting. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about their potentialities in subtropical climate regions. Therefore, this study evaluated the behavior of a bioretention cell in a Brazilian city, during the dry period, which is critical in terms of pollutant accumulation and water availability. In addition to the runoff reduction and pollutant removal efficiency, this paper analyzed the potential for water reuse in terms of the stored volume and water quality guidelines. The results obtained show an average runoff retention efficiency of 70%. Considering only the water availability aspects, the potential stored runoff could be reused for non-potable purposes, reducing the water demand in the catchment by at least half during the dry season. On the other hand, the bioretention presented two different conditions for pollutant removal: Condition A - the concentration values are within the recommended limits for water reuse. The parameters found in this condition were NO3, NO2, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr; Condition B - the pollutant concentrations are above the guideline limits for water reuse and cannot be directly used for different purposes. The parameters found in this condition were Fe, Pb, Ni, Cd and color. Considering water reuse, an additional treatment is required for parameters in this second condition. Further studies should evaluate the design aspects that can allow collection of LIDs effluent, additional treatment if necessary, and reuse in the catchment. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yoon, KS; Lee, SO; Hong, SH				Yoon, Kwang Seok; Lee, Seung Oh; Hong, Seung Ho			Time-Averaged Turbulent Velocity Flow Field through the Various Bridge Contractions during Large Flooding	WATER			English	Article						abutment; overtopping flow; pressure flow; physical hydraulic modeling; scour and velocity field	SCOUR; MODEL	Extreme rainfall events, larger than 500-year floods, have produced a large number of flooding events in the land and also close to the shore, and have resulted in massive destruction of hydraulic infrastructures because of scour. In light of climate change, this trend is likely to continue in the future and thus, resilience, security and sustainability of hydraulic infrastructures has become an interesting topic for hydraulic engineering stakeholders. In this study, a physical model experiment with a geometric similarity of the bridge embankments, abutments, and bridge deck as well as river bathymetry was conducted in a laboratory flume. Flow conditions were utilized to get submerged orifice flow and overtopping flow in the bridge section in order to simulate extreme hydrologic flow conditions. Point velocities of the bridge section were measured in sufficient details and the time-averaged velocity flow field were plotted to obtain better understandings of scour and sediment transport under high flow conditions. The laboratory study concluded that existing lateral flow contraction as well as vertical flow contraction resulted in a unique flow field through the bridge and the shape of velocity profile being fuller, thereby increasing the velocity gradients close to the bed and subsequently resulting in a higher rate of bed sediment transport. The relationships between the velocity gradients measured close to the bed and the degree of flow contraction through the bridge are suggested. Furthermore, based on the location of maximum scour corresponding to the measured velocity flow field, the classification of scour conditions, long setback abutment scour and short setback abutment scour, are also suggested.

One example is flooding, which has driven logistics firms to reconsider their resilience. Although logistics firms can employ digital techniques (DTs) to improve organisational resilience (OR), the interplay of DTs and OR in disruptive events is under-researched. In OR research, few studies have considered the roles of two critical components of DTs, namely digital orientation (DO) and digital competency (DC). This study uses multiple research methods to examine the role of DTs, including DO and DC, in logistics firms' OR during floods. In Phase 1, managers in logistics firms shared their views on the role of DTs for OR during floods through semi-structured interviews, which revealed that DO and DC might affect OR and firm performance through thematic analysis. This study further develops a conceptual framework and the associated hypotheses by combining the findings of Phase 1 with those reported in the literature. In Phase 2, survey data was collected via a self-administrated questionnaire survey, and structural equation modelling was then conducted to test the conceptual model. The results show that DC can positively affect OR and firm performance. DO can directly and positively affect firm performance and indirectly affect OR through the mediation role of DC. This study promotes the development of OR research and bridges the theory-practice gap by clarifying how DTs strengthen OR towards disruptive events.

Burrow nesting can provide protection from predators and buffer against inclement weather. Soil characteristics within and around burrows may determine suitability of sites for burrow-nesting, and parents may choose sites based on factors such as soil compaction, composition, and moisture. Leach's Storm-Petrels (Hydrobates leucorhous) nest in burrows on islands that likely reduce predation and provide thermoregulatory and humidity benefits. We tested for associations between volumetric water content (hereafter, soil moisture) and nest site selection, burrow occupancy, and nest success. Soil moisture readings were taken from inactive and active burrow entrances and comparison points on Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. Soil moisture was significantly higher at comparison points than at burrows in each year; however, there was no difference in soil moisture at inactive versus active burrows or between burrows that were deemed to have or not to have produced a fledgling. Lower moisture content may allow for easier excavation; however, Leach's Storm-Petrels often use the same burrow for many years, and soil moisture almost certainly changes over time, so measurements taken during our study may not be representative of conditions when sites were initially chosen. Nonetheless, burrowing will allow freer exchange of water vapor than burrow-free soil so that burrows are expected to have lower moisture than soil within the same microclimate. With climate change increasing the frequency of inclement weather, soil moisture data and use of weather stations may be useful for predicting which petrel burrows will be more susceptible to loss by flooding, thereby informing threat assessments during conservation planning.

However, the reasons behind precipitation variability over this region remain elusive. In this study, the multi-year moisture sources of water vapour reaching the TRHR were identified to reveal their connection to the interannual variability of summer precipitation by utilizing a Lagrangian diagnosis analysis. The results show that the moisture sources could be tracked backward covering vast areas, with the peak values located mostly at the northern Indian continent and adjacent regions of TRH itself. The variability of integrated moisture sources' contribution agrees well with the summer precipitation on the interannual scale; However, the role of different regions varies in line with their geographical location. More specifically, summer precipitation is positively correlated with the moisture source over the adjacent areas of TRH and the remote terrestrial-oceanic regions, in contrast to a negative correlation to the water vapour departing from the Northeastern Asian and western regions to the TP. The Indian summer monsoon circulation and local recycling process play a dominant role in modulating the summer precipitation on the interannual scale, whereas the role of the westerlies is almost negligible. The abnormal atmosphere circulations triggered by mid-high latitude wave trains and anomalies in SST in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean could serve as possible drivers for the precipitation variability over TRHR.

Therefore, a comprehensive flood risk modeling considering the change in land-use is essential for understanding, predicting, and mitigating flood risk. However, most existing single modeling ignored the derivative effect of landuse change, which may reduce the reality of results. To further address the issue, this study presented an integrated model chain by coupling the Markov-FLUS model, the multiple linear regression and the improved TOPSIS model. By applying it in Guangdong Province, the future land-use simulation, spatialization of hazard-bearing bodies, and determination of flood risk were realized. The results show that the coupled model chain allows for good prediction of flood risk under different scenarios, which could be expressed by flood risk composite index (FRSI). In the natural growth scenario, the flood risk will show markedly increasing trend from 2020 to 2030 (FRSI = 2.06), with the high and highest risk zones will expand significantly. Spatially, these increased high flood risk zones mainly distributed on the periphery of existing built-up lands. On the contrary, the flood risk in ecological protection scenario tends to stabilize (FRSI = 1.98), which may be a reference for alternative development paths. These dynamic information identified by this model chain provides a deeper insight into the spatiotemporal characteristics of future high flood risk areas, which can facilitate reasonable flood mitigation measures to be developed at the most critical locations in the region. In further applications, more efficient spatialization models and climate factor are suggested to be introduced.

Previous studies focused on minimizing flood risk to reduce potential flood damage, however, failure and recovery processes are not considered. To address this shortcoming, this study introduces the concept of resilience to measure the ability of flood control systems to maintain or return to the original states after an extreme flood. The quantitative expression of resilience, resilience metric, is proposed based on the system performance and defined as the summation of system functionality loss throughout the entire flood process. Based on the proposed resilience metric, a multiobjective optimization model with flood risk represented by maximum reservoir water level and downstream peak flow, and flood resilience as objectives, is established. Nierji Reservoir, located in Northeast China is taken as a case study. Results show that the proposed method can improve resilience without increasing flood risks (i. e., maximum reservoir water level and downstream peak flow) compared with the traditional model. Pareto optimates of the optimization model show that there exist tradeoffs between risk and resilience, improving resilience inevitably reducing risk. The resilience improvement is large when the flood risk of the reservoir or downstream is medium and is limited when the flood risk is high. Moreover, the resilience improvement is higher for a smaller flood. The improvement is achieved through pre-releasing at the early stage of the flood and releasing slowly at the recession stage of the flood. Six typical schemes, selected referring to the existing scheme are comprehensively compared, and an operation rule for flood control with the highest resilience but without reducing risks is recommended. This study provides a new way for flood control management.

Drivers and impacts of Eastern African rainfall variability	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review							INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EL-NINO; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; WATER CONSERVATION; DECISION-MAKING; GLOBAL CLIMATE; GREATER HORN	Eastern Africa exhibits bimodal rainfall consisting of long rains (March-May) and short rains (October-December), changes in which have profound socioeconomic and environmental impacts. In this Review, we examine the drivers and corresponding impacts of Eastern African rainfall variability. Remote teleconnections, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole, exert a dominant influence on interannual variability. From the mid-1980s to 2010, the long rains have tended toward a drier state (trends of -0.65 to -2.95 mm season(-1) year(-1)), with some recovery thereafter, while the short rains have become wetter since the mid 1980s (1.44 to 2.36 mm season(-1) year(-1)). These trends, overlain by substantial year-to-year variations, affect the severity and frequency of extreme flooding and droughts, the stability of food and energy systems, the susceptibility to water-borne and vector-borne diseases, and ecosystem stability. Climate model projections of rainfall changes differ, but there is some consensus that the short rains will deliver more rainfall than the long rains by 2030-2040, with implications for sustaining agricultural yields and triggering climate-related public health emergencies. Mitigating the impacts of future Eastern African climate requires continued investments in agriculture, clean water, medical and emergency infrastructures, and development and adoption of adaptation strategies, as well as targeted early-warning systems driven by improved meteorological observations. Rainfall variability in Eastern Africa is associated with considerable social and environmental impacts, including threats to water, energy and food security. This Review outlines the drivers of this rainfall variability, their corresponding impacts, and potential future changes with anthropogenic warming.

J	Lee, HF; Qiang, W				Lee, Harry F.; Qiang, Wei			Climatic extremes, violent conflicts, and population change in China in 1741-1910: An investigation using spatial econometrics	ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Climatic extremes; Violent conflicts; Population; China	DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA; NORTH CHINA; NATURAL DISASTERS; SOCIAL RESPONSES; DROUGHT; MIGRATION; FLOOD/DROUGHT; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; HISTORY	Climatic extremes and violent conflicts can play a significant role in reducing a country's population. However, the occasional coexistence and interplay of climatic extremes and violent conflicts make it difficult to quantify their individual or collective demographic impacts and associated spatial dynamics, and thus to determine which plays the more important part. Can long-term historical data shed more light on this conundrum? This study explores the effect of climatic extremes and violent conflicts on China's population, using data from 1741 to 1910 and spatial econometrics. It differs from other quantitative historical studies by addressing the spatial autocorrelation property of population data and the spatial spillover effect of those population-determining factors. The statistical results show that, in general, violent conflicts reduce population density, and that their demographic impact is stronger than those of climatic extremes. Specifically, while violent conflicts reduce population density in the areas they directly affect, they also increase the population density in neighboring areas, as people flee the affected area and take refuge elsewhere. Alternatively, floods, droughts, and extreme floods cannot suppress the local population density but negatively affect the population density in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, violent conflicts and extreme droughts have a significant synergistic effect in reducing population density. This study provides a more detailed picture of the impact of climatic extremes and violent conflicts on historical population densities, and draws attention to the nuanced spatial dynamics embedded in the nexus between the population and its determinants. More generally, its findings may help future researchers to determine the demographic impact of more frequent climatic extremes and violent conflicts brought on by global climate change.

An optimal design for the scheduling and management of irrigation is thus urgently needed to adapt agricultural activities to the changing climate. The accurate estimation of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0), a vital hydrological component of the water balance and crop water need, is a tiresome task if all the relevant climatic variables are unavailable. This study investigates the potential of four ensemble techniques for estimating precise values of the daily ET0 at representative stations in 10 agro-climatic zones in the state of Karnataka, India, from 1979 to 2014. The performance of these models was evaluated by using several combinations of climatic variables as inputs by using tenfold cross-validation. The outcomes indicated that predictions of ET0 by all four ensemble models based on all climatic variables were the most accurate in comparison with other input combinations. The random forest regressor was found to deliver the best performance among the four models on all measures considered (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, 1.0, root-mean-squared error, 0.016 mm/day, and mean absolute error, 0.011 mm/day). However, it incurred the highest computational cost, whereas the computational cost of the bagging model for linear regression was the lowest. The extreme gradient-boosting model delivered the most stable performance with a modified training dataset. The work here shows that these models can be recommended for daily ET0 estimation based on the users' interests.	[Jayashree, T. R.; Acharya, U.

Towards a unified drag coefficient formula for quantifying wave energy reduction by salt marshes	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Wave attenuation; Flexible vegetation; Unified drag coefficient; Effective plant height	RANDOM BREAKING; VEGETATION; DISSIPATION; MODEL; DYNAMICS; EMERGENT; IMPACT	Coastal regions are susceptible to increasing flood risks amid climate change. Coastal wetlands play an important role in mitigating coastal hazards. Vegetation exerts a drag force to the flow and dampens storm surges and wind waves. The prediction of wave attenuation by vegetation typically relies on a pre-determined drag coefficient C-D. Existing C-D formulas are subject to vegetation biomechanical properties, especially the flexibility. Accounting for vegetation flexibility through the effective plant height (EPH), we propose and validate a species-independent relationship between C-D and the Reynolds number Re based on three independent datasets that cover a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions and vegetation traits. The proposed C-D-Re relationship, used together with EPH, allows for predicting wave attenuation in salt marshes with high accuracy. Furthermore, a total of 308,000 numerical experiments with diverse wave conditions are conducted using the proposed C-D-Re relationship and EPH to quantify the wave attenuation capacity of two typical salt mash species: Elymus athericus (highly flexible) and Spartina alterniflora (relatively rigid). It is found that wave attenuation is controlled by wave height to water depth ratio and EPH to water depth ratio. When swaying in large waves in shallow to intermediate water depth, a 50-m-long Elymus athericus field may lose up to 30% capacity for wave attenuation. As wave height increases, highly flexible vegetation causes reduced wave attenuation, whereas relatively rigid vegetation induces increased wave attenuation. The leaf contribution to wave attenuation is highly dependent on the leaf rigidity. It is recommended that leaf properties, especially its Young's modulus be collected in future field experiments.

Influenced by both regional and local climate fluctuations, the inter-annual variability of ASD represents a climate memory signal, significantly affected when the drought pattern manifests itself in changing climatic regimes. Gaining a better historical perspective on ASD changes requires extended time-series of discharge data and relevant climate drivers. Here, using a parsimonious model, we present a continuous (modelled) time-series of annual ASD for the karst spring of Caposele, in the Cervialto Massif of southern Italy, which is hitherto the longest (1601-2020 CE) such time-series for the entire Mediterranean region. The model was designed to capture the importance of large-scale seasonal (spring, autumn and winter) precipitation (hydro-meteorological factor), and flood and drought indices (climatological factor), and to be consistent with a sample (1920-2020 CE) of actual data. We show a limited overall sensitivity of ASD to climate variability, with a mean of 4.21 m(3) s(-1) and a drop from similar to 1759 CE. With a mean value of similar to 3.60 m(3) s(-1) after similar to 1987 CE, ASD has revealed a substantial descending trend-possibly a fingerprint of recent warming-with a depletion of regional water reservoirs. These results highlight the need to strengthen the capacity of groundwater resources in the face of changing, and possibly enhanced, drought patterns in the Mediterranean region.

However, little is known about their ecosystem services (ES) in the tropics, in particular economic valuation of their ES and its relation to the characteristics of local communities. To fill these gaps, our study aims to elucidate all the major ES as quantitative as possible and investigate factors influencing these services. For this purpose, we surveyed the floodplain of Tonle Sap Lake, the largest flood-pulse lake in Southeast Asia nurturing flooded forests. Ninety-seven households were randomly selected from 22 villages in nine communes, where we adopted the local market value approach for provisioning services (PS), the double-bounded dichotomous choice for cultural services (CS) on willingness to pay (WTP), and structural equation modeling for regulating services (RS) and supporting services (SS). Consequently, PS was estimated to be US$655/person/year on average and the majority of CS was ecotourism, followed by social relations, religious, aesthetic, cultural heritage, and inspirational services. The WTP estimates for these services were heavily influenced by the community characteristics, namely distance, sex, household size, and age. The RS comprised air temperature regulation, water purification, storm regulation, flood control, and carbon fixation, whereas the SS included fish spawning grounds and waterbird habitats. Our results for the first time elucidated the importance of the four main ES categories of the flooded forests to the local communities. The applied and developed approaches provide scientific-based evidence for policymakers to incorporate ES in the conservation and management of flooded forests.

It is crucial for water resources management and hydrologic engineering design to cope with the changing environment. Finding suitable and effective models could help perform better flood frequency analysis and make reliable estimates under the nonstationary environment. This study assesses different modelling techniques for nonsta-tionary flood frequency analysis, including linear, nonlinear, parametric and nonparametric models using an extensive data set of 161 catchments across the UK. It identifies that rejection rates are generally higher for precipitation-informed NFFA models than time-varying NFFA models. For both time-varying and precipitation -informed NFFA, rejection rates for linear and cubic polynomial models are the highest. The models with the fewest rejections are fractional polynomial models followed by cubic spline models. Because of the flexibility, parsimony, and user-friendly features, fractional polynomial models could be a potential alternative for modelling the nonstationary behaviour of flood series. To investigate whether the seasonal flood variation and catchment characteristics influence the goodness-of-fit, a quantified seasonality index was calculated to illustrate the degree of seasonal variation of flooding for each catchment. It was found that the southeast of the UK has more significant seasonal flood variation than the northwest, and most of the catchments with high seasonality indexes are close to the Scotland and England border. Nevertheless, the correlation analysis shows insufficient evidence to conclude that catchment characteristics and seasonal flood variation impact the goodness-of-fit of the NFFA models.

A survey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						bushfires; Disaster communication; Floods; Preparedness; Social network; Trust	EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; RISK PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER; COMMUNICATION; PREPAREDNESS; INFORMATION; GOVERNMENT; HOUSEHOLD; FACEBOOK	People living in Australia are highly exposed to risks from extreme weather events including floods, bushfires and tropical cyclones. Communication is crucial in emergencies, to prepare for risks, warn people, reduce impacts, save lives and increase resilience. Social media has become increasingly important for both sourcing and disseminating information during natural hazards. The vast amount of data generated by social media users can be analysed for situational awareness, impacts and community sentiments during natural hazards. The full potential for social media to fulfil these roles in Australia is not yet well understood. In this study, we provide a literature review about the use of social media during natural hazards in Australia. We then assess public preferences for the use of social media during natural hazards using data collected through an online survey (n = 1665). Results suggest that social media is still largely underutilised for emergency communication. However, those with a high capacity to prepare for emergencies were more likely to use social media during natural hazards than those who relied on decisions being made by local authorities. Respondents' age did not explain the use of social media during natural hazards, but gender did with women more likely to do so than men. The presence of children in a household increased the use of social media during natural hazards, suggesting that the family structure plays a role in disaster communication. Finally, the main barriers to using social media during natural hazards were the spread of conflicting information and rumours on social media.

Nature-based solutions, specifically urban green infrastructures, are seen as a sustainable strategy to increase resilience against extreme weather events, including the escalating occurrence of stormwater runoff flooding. Consequently, urban planners and decision-makers have pushed their efforts toward implementing green infrastructure solutions to reduce the impact of stormwater floods. Among others, green roofs help store water and decrease stormwater runoff impacts on a local scale. This research aims to investigate the effect of surface permeability and green roof implementation on reducing stormwater flooding and subsequently provide urban planners with evidence-based geospatial planning recommendations to improve urban resilience in Helsinki. First, we modeled the current impact of stormwater flooding using the Arc-Malstrom model in Helsinki. The model was used to identify districts under high stormwater flood risk. Then, we zoomed in to a focus area and tested a combination of scenarios representing four levels of green roof implementation, two levels of green roof infiltration rates under 40-, 60-, 80-, 100 mm precipitation events on the available rooftops. We utilized open geographic data and geospatial data science principles implemented in the GIS environment to conduct this study. Our results showed that low-level implementation of green roofs with low retention rates reduces the average flood depth by only 1 %. In contrast, the maximum green roof scenario decreased most of the average flood depth (13 %) and reduced the number of vulnerable sites. The proposed methodology can be used for other cities to develop evidence-based plans for green roof implementations.

This study proposes a methodology based on multicriteria analysis and on-site assessment to develop environmental zoning that enhances the provision of water ecosystem services (WES) from Brazil's agua Quente River Basin. Integrated analysis of multiple criteria enabled identification of degrees of susceptibility to degradation, assessment of effects of land-use changes between 1990 and 2020, and validation of the study's methodology via field protocol. The results indicated that the spatial and temporal patterns of WES susceptibility to degradation varied little within the study area with the most critical levels occurring primarily in the Agua Quente's floodplain, where there are sandy textured soils and coverage with a low degree of soil protection. Zoning analysis designates 40% of the basin`s area as consolidated use, 28% for environmental conservation, 19% as anthropic use, and 13% for environmental restoration. Field analysis indicates that the occurrence of degraded areas and pollution by solid waste and urban effluents are relevant factors that affect the basin's water resources. Linear regression analysis indicated a good fit between the data modeled by the multicriteria analysis and those observed on-site (R-2 = 0.6 p < 0.05). The study's method is effective and its structure can be used in other river basins, as its approach is simple and flexible and can be readily adjusted to fit the characteristics of the study site.

Local decision makers therefore need reliable long-term hydro meteorological forecasts to support the seasonal management of water resources, reservoir operations and agriculture. In this context, an Ensemble Kalman Filter framework is applied to predict sub-basin-scale runoff employing global freely available datasets of reanalysis precipitation (ERA5-Land) as well as bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts (SEAS5BCSD). Runoff is estimated using least squares predictions, exploiting the covariance structures between runoff and precipitation. The performance of the assimilation framework was assessed using different ensemble skill scores. New hydrological insights for the region: Our results show that the quality of runoff predictions are closely linked to the performance of the rainfall seasonal predictions and allows skillful predictions up to two months ahead in most sub-basins. The anthropogenic conditions such as in the Western Bahia state, however, must be taken under consideration, since non-stationary runoff time-series have poorer skill as such unnatural variations can not be captured by long-term co variances. In sub-basins which are dominated by little anthropogenic influence, the presented framework provides a promising and easily transferable approach for skillful operational seasonal runoff predictions on sub-basin scale.

With the risk increasing under climate change, all coastal areas are now in need of flood risk management strategies. Unfortunately, for local water management agencies in developing countries, building such a model is challenging due to the limited computational resources and the scarcity of observational data. We attempt to solve this issue by proposing an integrated hydrodynamic and machine learning (ML) approach to predict water level dynamics as a proxy for the risk of compound flooding in a data-scarce delta. As a case study, this integrated approach is implemented in Pontianak, the densest coastal urban area over the Kapuas River delta, Indonesia. Firstly, we build a hydrodynamic model to simulate several compound flooding scenarios. The outputs are then used to train the ML model. To obtain a robust ML model, we consider three ML algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), multiple linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that the integrated scheme works well. The RF is the most accurate algorithm to model water level dynamics in the study area. Meanwhile, the ML model using the RF algorithm can predict 11 out of 17 compound flooding events during the implementation phase. It could be concluded that RF is the most appropriate algorithm to build a reliable ML model capable of estimating the river's water level dynamics within Pontianak, whose output can be used as a proxy for predicting compound flooding events in the city.

We used eddy covariance and inventory methods to estimate carbon (C) fluxes for an upland mixed grassland and a seasonally flooded forest to determine the correspondence between these methods and assess the contribution of C cycling components to the total NPP. Both techniques provided similar estimates of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (-3.0 - 2.3 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for eddy covariance vs. -2.0 - 4.3 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for inventory), gross primary production (7.5-16.3 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for eddy covariance vs. 8.7-18.4 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for inventory), and total NPP (0.9-7.5 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for eddy covariance vs. 2.0-9.5 MgC ha(-1) y(-1) for inventory). Belowground NPP accounted for 49%-53% of the total NPP for both ecosystems, followed by aboveground litter (26%-27%) and wood (16%-17%) production. Increases in water availability increased the potential for C storage, but the mechanism was different in the savanna types. Compared to other savanna ecosystems, the mixed grassland had a lower productivity and C use efficiency (CUE = NPP/GPP = 0.28), while the Cerrado forest had a high CUE (0.58) and similar C flux rates to other tropical savanna forests. The agreement in the C cycle estimates derived from the eddy covariance and inventory methods increases our confidence in the productivity estimates for these tropical savanna ecosystems.

Floods, cyclones, and climate change phenomena have hammered the natural environment and increased the land dynamic, socio-economic vulnerability, and food scarcity. Saltwater intrusion has also triggered cropland vulnerability and, therefore, increased the area of inland brackish water fishery. The cropland area has decreased due to low soil fertility; around 252.06 km(2) of cropland area has been lost, and 326.58 km(2) of water bodies or inland fishery area has been added in just thirty years in the selected blocks of the North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India. After saltwater intrusion, soil fertility appears to have been decreased and crop production has been greatly reduced. The cropland areas were 586.52 km(2) (1990), 419.92 km(2) (2000), 361.67 km(2) (2010) and 334.46 km(2) (2020). Gradually the water body areas were increased 156.21 km(2) (1990), 328.15 km(2) (2000), 397.77 km(2) (2010) and 482.78 km(2) (2020). The vegetated land area also decreased due to it being converted into inland fishery areas, and around 79.15 km(2) were degraded during the last thirty years. The super cyclone Aila, along with other super cyclones and other environmental stresses, like water-logging, soil salinity, and irrigation water scarcity were the reasons for the development of the new fishery areas in the selected blocks. There is a need for proper planning for sustainable development of this area.

The motivation for this work was the observation that drought/flood intensities are generally increasing, the prediction of drought/flood intensities for the next 50 years, along with their future spatiotemporal patterns. Based on the three approaches, with few exceptions, the results reveal a likely increasing trend for both droughts and floods, with higher intensity under the RCP8.5 scenario for droughts and the RCP4.5 scenario for floods by the year 2050. Notwithstanding this worsening trend, it was found that drought/flood intensities for most regions are projected to neither entirely increase nor entirely decrease in the near future. Drought and flood intensities may alternatively occur on a multi-year or a decadal timescale. Inner Mongolia, located in an arid temperate climate zone, is projected to experience a higher average disaster intensity, followed by the warm monsoon region of Henan, while the humid subtropical region of Guizhou is projected to be the least affected, with high spatial heterogeneity within each region. Climate variation, particularly temperature range and deviation across either the coldest or wettest months, was closely associated with drought/flood intensities. We conclude that the major challenge for drought/flood prediction is not the general change trends or their responses to climate change, but the spatiotemporal heterogeneity at multiple scales.

Poyang Lake is one of the largest freshwater lakes globally and is one of the few that remain naturally connected to the Yangtze River. To investigate the full hydrological conditions (extreme high and low discharge) of Poyang Lake outflow under current bathymetric conditions, a large-scale 1D- and 2D-coupled high-resolution hydrodynamic model of the Poyang Lake basin-Yangtze River system was developed. We simulated the outflow and water levels of Poyang Lake under nine different extreme hydrological scenarios with high precision and computational efficiency. We propose (1) a novel partition calibration method to characterize the roughness coefficient of large water bodies in complicated geographical terrain both for wet and dry seasons; (2) a new method for setting initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulation of large water bodies subject to strong hydrological regulation. Results indicated that (1) maximum outflow and water levels will reach 37,200 m(3)/s and 22.28 m when Poyang Lake basin floodwater coincides with flooding on the Yangtze River; (2) precipitation over the lake has increased outflow but this has had very limited influence on its changing hydrological pattern; (3) the effect of hydrological conditions within the system differs for both the lake outflow and water level. The research provides important reference conditions for the application of the InfoWorks ICM model in future applications and studies of large river-lake systems.

Bolboschoenus planiculmis is a critical target plant species for the restoration of degraded wetland in the Momoge National Nature Reserve (MNNR), Northeast China. To investigate B. planiculmis growth response under different flooding conditions, we conducted comparative field studies of its population traits and ecological characteristics under alternate wetting to flooding (AF) and continuous flooding (CF) conditions. Under AF conditions, the B. planiculmis population significantly increased, its cover differed significantly (except June) compared to CF conditions, and flood stress significantly promoted its height. Flood events caused seasonal changes in morphological characteristics, especially stem and leaf length which increased in the growth period, and leaf width and area that significantly differed in June. B. planiculmis tuber biomass under CF condition was significantly higher than AF condition in May. B. planiculmis biomass was greater in AF, compared to CF conditions in the mid-late growth period, and its below-aboveground biomass ratio initially decreased before increasing, which indicated that the growth strategy was a trade-off between matter production and allocation during flooding. Flooding conditions had a significant effect on population traits and ecological characteristics, and AF conditions more strongly promoted B. planiculmis population development. Appropriate seasonal regulated floodwater management during the growth stage will assist B. planiculmis growth. Our findings provide invaluable supporting information for B. planiculmis MNNR wetlands restoration and management.

The obtained information allowed the recognition of five depositional subenvironments: 1. Dune patches; 2. Aeolian sand sheets; 3. Muddy plains; 4. Active channels; and 5. Abandoned and secondary channels. Moreover, the lithofacies pattern, sedimentary structures and geometry of the beds permitted the definition of ten architectural elements in both channel and interchannel areas. The channel architectural elements comprise active channels with intercalations of aeolian deposits (CHe), abandoned or secondary channels (CHa), aeolian sand ramp (CHsr), lateral bars (CHlb), and aeolian mesoforms (CHem). The architectural elements in the interchannel area include active dunes (Fad), fixed or low-migration rate dunes (Fsd), partially flooded interdunes (Ffd), sandy flats (Fsf), and muddy plains (Fmp). A model of the evolution of fluvial-aeolian interaction environment is proposed in which three types are recognized: dry, intermediate, and wet. Migratory dunes and sand sheets environments dominate the dry interaction systems in the floodplain (Fad, Fsf). At the same time, during the intermediate stage, Fsd and Fsf architectures prevail, together with fluvial bars with thin aeolian intercalations into the channels (CHe and CHa). The wet systems consist of flooded interdunes, muddy plains, and different types of aeolian mesoforms in the channel (Fmp, Ffd and CHem).The analysis of present-day depositional subenvironments in the Guandacol valley and the definition of architectural elements serve as a potential analogue for studying ancient fluvial-aeolian interaction environments.

Modeling the Morphodynamic Response of Estuarine Intertidal Shoals to Sea-Level Rise	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						Sea-level rise; Long-term morphological evolution; Intertidal shoals; Waves; Process-based modeling; Delft3D	SAN-PABLO BAY; MORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; HOLOCENE EVOLUTION; COASTAL HABITATS; SEVERN ESTUARY; SALT MARSHES; TIDAL BASIN; MUDFLAT; IMPACT; NETHERLANDS	Intertidal shoals are key features of estuarine environments worldwide. Climate change poses questions regarding the sustainability of intertidal areas under sea-level rise (SLR). Our work investigates the SLR impact on the long-term morphological evolution of unvegetated intertidal sandy shoals in a constrained channel-shoal system. Utilizing a process-based model (Delft3D), we schematize a short tidal system in a rectangular (2.5 x 20 km) basin with a high-resolution grid. An initial, mildly sloping, bathymetry is subjected to constant semidiurnal tidal forcing, sediment supply, and small wind-generated waves modeled by SWAN. A positive morphodynamic feedback between hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphology causes the emergence of large-scale channel-shoal patterns. Over centuries, tide-residual sediment transport gradually decreases leading to a state of low morphological activity balanced by tides, waves, and sediment supply. Tidal currents are the main driver of the SLR morphodynamic adaptation. Wave action leads to wider and lower shoals but does not fundamentally change the long-term morphological evolution. SLR causes increased flood dominance which triggers sediment import into the system. Shoals accrete in response to SLR with a lag that increases as SLR accelerates, eventually causing intertidal shoals to drown. Seaward shoals near the open boundary sediment source have higher accretion rates compared to landward shoals. Similarly, on a shoal-scale, the highest accretion rates occur at the shoal edges bounding the sediment suppling channels. A larger sediment supply enhances the SLR adaptation. Waves help distribute sediment supplied from channels across shoals. Adding mud fractions leads to faster, more uniform, accretion and muddier shoals under SLR.

Travel demand modeling relies on reasonable and appropriate forecasts of demographic totals at the detail of travel analysis zones. Methodologies for developing scenarios in response to individual and combined climate risk factors are described, drawing on work undertaken for the Southern California Association of Governments SoCal Regional Climate Adaptation Framework. Methodologies for developing scenarios in response to gentrification displacement pressures of low-income workers are described, drawing on work carried out for the California Statewide Freight Forecasting and Travel Demand Model. These methodologies leverage modeling tools that are readily available to agencies, allowing for rapid testing of scenarios and integration with other planning processes. Climate adaptation and housing policy, respectively, are currently in need of greater integration and coordination. Future directions are explored to integrate these methodologies and create a combined demographic relocation model, sensitive to both climate risk factors and the affordability and gentrification displacement pressures arising out of shifting demand-supply dynamics and population-job balance in high growth areas.

This article provides new data and insights into the reconstruction of the Anthemountas River depositional environment. The study was conducted with granulometric analysis and with the lithostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic description of approximately 20000 yr B.P., the area's most extended sedimentary sequence to date. The evolution of the Anthemountas River Valley during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene is closely linked to tectonic activity and changes in the sea-level and climate. The interpretation of grain size cumulative curves, frequency curves, and the Passega C-M diagram is used in conjunction with the textural parameters of the sediments to obtain information about the means of transport and the intensity of environmental conditions. In addition, the loss on ignition method was used to estimate two parameters; organic matter and carbonates. Chronostratigraphic details were also obtained from the A.M.S. dating of charcoal samples. The analysis has identified the Late Pleistocene aggradation materials and the transition to the Holocene. Sedimentation can be described as a fluvial valley-fill sequence with periodical inchannel, off-channel, and floodplain series. After 3500 cal. B.P., the area is affected by the possible formation of a bay-head delta, with fluvial-dominated sands and the development of stable floodplains. Finally, the fluvial records of the Anthemountas River reveal phases of hydrological activity and stability.

Combined Modeling of US Fluvial, Pluvial, and Coastal Flood Hazard Under Current and Future Climates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; floods; inundation; United States	APERTURE RADAR IMAGERY; RASTER-BASED MODEL; STORM-SURGE; SPATIAL DEPENDENCE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RESOLUTION; INUNDATION; RAINFALL; RISK; EXTREMES	This study reports a new and significantly enhanced analysis of US flood hazard at 30 m spatial resolution. Specific improvements include updated hydrography data, new methods to determine channel depth, more rigorous flood frequency analysis, output downscaling to property tract level, and inclusion of the impact of local interventions in the flooding system. For the first time, we consider pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flood hazards within the same framework and provide projections for both current (rather than historic average) conditions and for future time periods centered on 2035 and 2050 under the RCP4.5 emissions pathway. Validation against high-quality local models and the entire catalog of FEMA 1% annual probability flood maps yielded Critical Success Index values in the range 0.69-0.82. Significant improvements over a previous pluvial/fluvial model version are shown for high-frequency events and coastal zones, along with minor improvements in areas where model performance was already good. The result is the first comprehensive and consistent national-scale analysis of flood hazard for the conterminous US for both current and future conditions. Even though we consider a stabilization emissions scenario and a near-future time horizon, we project clear patterns of changing flood hazard (3 sigma changes in 100 years inundated area of -3.8 to +16% at 1 degrees scale), that are significant when considered as a proportion of the land area where human use is possible or in terms of the currently protected land area where the standard of flood defense protection may become compromised by this time.

An Example from the Cierny Hron River Basin, Slovakia	WATER			English	Article						flood protection; river basin management; ecosystem service; hydrological modelling; monetary valuation; land use change	SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND; LAND-USE CHANGE; FRAMEWORK; CONSERVATION; SIMULATION; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENT; CLIMATE; FOREST	Flood protection is considered one of the crucial regulating ecosystem services due to climate change and extreme weather events. As an ecosystem service, it combines the results of hydrological and ecosystem research and their implementation into land management and/or planning processes including several formally separated economic sectors. As managerial and economic interests often diverge, successful decision-making requires a common denominator in form of monetary valuation of competing trade-offs. In this paper, a methodical approach based on the monetary value of the ecosystem service provided by the ecosystem corresponding to its actual share in flood regulating processes and the value of the property protected by this service was developed and demonstrated based on an example of a medium size mountain basin (290 ha). Hydrological modelling methods (SWAT, HEC-RAS) were applied for assessing the extent of floods with different rainfalls and land uses. The rainfall threshold value that would cause flooding with the current land use but that would be safely drained if the basin was covered completely by forest was estimated. The cost of the flood protection ecosystem service was assessed by the method of non-market monetary value for estimating avoided damage costs of endangered infrastructure and calculated both for the current and hypothetical land use. The results identify areas that are crucial for water retention and that deserve greater attention in management. In addition, the monetary valuation of flood protection provided by the current but also by hypothetical land uses enables competent and well-formulated decision-making processes.

Environmental factors controlling phytoplankton dynamics in a large floodplain river with emphasis on cyanobacteria	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						algal blooms; connectivity; cyanobacteria; eutrophication; phosphorus; phytoplankton; Upper Mississippi River	UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER; BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; FRESH-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; MICROCYSTIS BLOOM; PHOSPHORUS; EUTROPHICATION; DOMINANCE; NITROGEN	Harmful algal blooms are occurring in large river ecosystems and at the mouth of large rivers with increasing frequency. In lentic systems, the chemical and physical conditions that promote harmful algal blooms are somewhat predictable but tracking prevalence and conditions that promote harmful algal blooms in lotic systems is much more difficult. We captured two of the most extreme discharge years within the last 20 years occurring in the Upper Mississippi River, allowing a natural experiment that evaluated how major shifts in discharge drive environmental variation and associated shifts in phytoplankton. Statistical models describing significant environmental covariates for phytoplankton assemblages and specific taxa were developed and used to identify management-relevant numeric breakpoints at which environmental variables may promote the growth of specific phytoplankton and/or cyanobacteria. Our analyses supported that potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria dominate under high phosphorus concentration, low nitrogen concentration, low nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, low turbulence, low flushing, adequate light and warm temperatures. Cyanobacteria dominated in 2009 when low discharge and low flushing likely led to optimal growth environments forDolichospermum,AphanizomenonandMicrocystis. Rarely will a single factor lead to the dominance, but multiple positive factors working in concert can lead to cyanobacteria proliferation in large rivers. Certain isolated backwaters with high phosphorus, low nitrogen, warm water temperatures and low potential for flushing could benefit from increased connection to channel inputs to reduce cyanobacterial dominance. Numerous examples of this type of habitat currently exist in the Upper Mississippi River and could benefit from reconnection to channel habitats.

Its concept is based on the kinetic energy of rainfall, rainfall intensity, and maximum rainfall intensity in a 30-min period, and purposes recurrence analyzes involving soil losses. It is a climatic index related to damages caused by erosion, landslides, and flooding. This study sought to: (1) model daily rainfall erosivity in Mantiqueira Range Region (MRR), Southeastern Brazil; and (2) propose the R-maxday as an indicator of the areas prone to natural disasters. R-maxday is defined as the maximum daily rainfall erosivity and is determined from the maximum daily rainfall. It should be calculated from a historical series over the least 22 years. Three seasonal models were fitted using observed historical series. The models exhibited consistent statistical performances (C-NS = 0.55, on average), thereby indicating that they can be used for further studies regarding natural disasters in the MRR. The Center to Northeastern MRR had the most vulnerable areas, as they experienced R-maxday values > 1600 MJ ha(-1) mm h(-1) in the year of 2000 when fatalities were registered. Overall, the first half of January had the greatest R-maxday in MRR. This period has been the most relevant for provoking natural disasters caused by heavy rainfall in MRR. R-maxday is a promising indicator to identify areas prone to natural disasters, as it is more robust than the commonly used rainfall depth intervals, i.e., there is a relationship between its magnitude and the damages provoked by natural disasters.

Green technologies are still developing to provide sustainable solutions to the problems that modern cities and peri-urban areas face at an ever-increasing rate and intensity. Constructed wetlands technology is an established green multi-purpose option for water management and wastewater treatment, with numerous effectively proven applications around the world and multiple environmental and economic advantages. These systems can function as water treatment plants, habitat creation sites, urban wildlife refuges, recreational or educational facilities, landscape engineering and ecological art areas. The aim of this article is to highlight the synergies between this green technology and urban areas in order to reconnect cities with nature, to promote circularity in the urban context and to apply innovative wetland designs as landscape infrastructure and water treatment solutions. This approach could be a step further in the effort to mitigate the current degradation process of the urban landscape. Following the concept of green infrastructure, the article presents and suggests ways to integrate wetland technology in the urban environment, namely: (i) stormwater and urban runoff management (storage and treatment of water during storm events) to provide protection from flood incidents, especially considering climate change, (ii) innovative low-impact infrastructure and design solutions for urban wastewater treatment, and (iii) wetland technology for habitat creation and ecosystem services provision.

Vulnerability of Vietnam to typhoons: A spatial assessment based on hazards, exposure and adaptive capacity	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Vulnerability; Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Disaster risk reduction; Typhoons; Natural hazards	ECO-ENVIRONMENTAL VULNERABILITY; RED-RIVER DELTA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT	Typhoons have devastating impacts across many Asian countries. Vietnam is presently one of the most disaster-prone nations. Typhoons regularly disrupt human lives and livelihoods in various ways and cause significant damage. Making efficient policy decisions to minimize the vulnerability of affected communities is cruciaL This requires a deep understanding of the factors that make a society vulnerable to extreme events and natural disasters. An appropriate approach is integrating the three dimensions of hazard, exposure and sensitivity, and community adaptive capacity. However, the vulnerability and adaptive capacity response to typhoons within Vietnam is poorly investigated. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that incorporates 21 indicators to identify vulnerability and adaptive capacity (VAC) using geospatial techniques at regional scales, applied over Vietnam. We find large spatial differences in VAC and are able to identify the top-priority regions that need to enhance their adaptation to typhoons. The Southern Coastal area, South East and Red River Delta demonstrate high and very high vulnerability because of their physical features and the intensity of typhoons that frequently (TOSS these parts of Vietnam. The lower Mekong Delta and Northern Coastal areas are vulnerable to typhoon-driven flood threats, in particular where compounded by sea-level rise. Our framework successfully identified the spatial distribution and different levels of VAC within acceptable limits of uncertainty. It can therefore serve as a template to tackle national issues in disaster risk reduction in Vietnam and assist in the development of suitable mitigation strategies to achieve sustainable outcomes.

J	Campos-Aranda, DF				Francisco Campos-Aranda, Daniel			Fitting with moments L of the non-stationary distributions GVE<sub>1</sub> and GVE<sub>2</sub> to <i>PMD</i> series	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA			Spanish	Article						L moments; GVE distribution; standard error of fit; linear regression; parabolic regression; determinants; multiple linear regression	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; MODEL	Design floods allow the hydrological sizing of hydraulic works. When hydrometric data is not available, design floods are estimated using hydrological methods that are based on design rains. The most common records used to estimate design rains are the annual maximum daily precipitations (PMD), this, due to the scarcity of rainfall recorder stations. The impacts of climate change and/or the alteration of the geographic environment of rain-gauge stations cause PMD records to show trends and therefore these records become non-stationary. In order to estimate predictions of low probability of exceedance a probabilistic analysis of the non-stationary PMD records can be performed. A simple approach without computational difficulties is based on the extension of the method of L moments applied to the general distribution of extreme values (GVE) with its location parameter (u) variable with time (t) in years, which is entered as a covariate. When the trend in the PMD register is linear, the probabilistic model GVE(1) is applied in which u(t) = mu(0) + mu(1).t and when the trend is curve the model GVE(2) with ut = mu(0) + mu(1).t + mu(2).t(2) is used. Thus, the GVE(1) distribution has four fit parameters (mu(0), mu(1), a, k) and five for the GVE(2) distribution (mu(0), mu(1), mu(2), a, k). Four numerical applications are described and the analysis of their results shows the simplicity of the extension of the L moments method and its versatility to estimate predictions within the historical record and to the future.

This study examines change and trends of 21 climate extremes of temperature and precipitation over Ethiopia by using indices from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The analysis was based on the records of observed meteorological data and the future projected from the CMIP5 model under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The results of the seasonal standardized rainfall anomaly and EOF analysis show a decreasing rainfall in JJAS season and significant variability in the FMAM season. The first mode of EOF in FMAM shows that 49.6% was mostly negative with a high amount of variability. The observed precipitation extreme of annual total precipitation (PRCPTOT), consecutive wet days (CWD), and the number of heavy precipitation days (R10) show a decreasing trend, and consecutive dry days (CDD) shows an increasing trend. Additionally, temperature extremes like tropical nights (TR20) and daily maximum and minimum temperatures show a significantly increasing trend. The projected precipitation extremes of CWD, PRCPTOT, very wet day annual total (R95p), and the number of heavy precipitation days (R10) show a decreasing trend. CDD shows longer periods of dryness and a substantial increase which is conducive to the increase of drought. The projected temperature extremes of the warm spell duration indicator (WSDI), daily maximum temperature (TXx) and daily minimum temperature (TNx), summer days (SU25), and tropical nights (TR20) show an increasing trend, while the diurnal temperature range shows a decreasing trend. The projected changes in temperature and precipitation extremes are likely to have significant negative impacts on various socioeconomic activities over Ethiopia. These results highlight the need for planning and developing effective adaptation strategies for disaster prevention.

Wetlands are also critical habitats for the survival of numerous plant and animal species. In this study, we used satellite remote sensing techniques for classification and change detection at an internationally important wetland (Ramsar Site) in Turkey. Sultan Marshes is located at the center of semi-arid Develi closed basin. The wetlands have undergone significant changes since the 1980s due to changes in water flow regimes, but changes in recent years have not been sufficiently explored yet. In this study, we focused on the changes from 2005 to 2012. Two multispectral ASTER images with spatial resolution of 15 m, acquired on June 11, 2005 and May 20, 2012, were used in the analyses. After geometric correction, the images were classified into four information classes, namely water, marsh, agriculture, and steppe. The applicability of three classification methods (i.e. maximum likelihood (MLH), multi-layer perceptron type artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM)) was assessed. The differences in classification accuracies were evaluated by the McNemar's test. The changes in the Sultan Marshes were determined by the post classification comparison method using the most accurate classified images. The results showed that the highest overall accuracy in image classifications was achieved with the SVM method. It was observed that marshes and steppe areas decreased while water and agricultural areas expanded from 2005 to 2012. These changes could be the results of water transfers to the marshes from neighboring watershed.	[Kesikoglu, M. Hayri; Atasever, U.

J	Madsen, HM; Mikkelsen, PS; Blok, A				Madsen, Herle Mo; Mikkelsen, Peter Steen; Blok, Anders			Framing professional climate risk knowledge: Extreme weather events as drivers of adaptation innovation in Copenhagen, Denmark	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Coastal flooding; Innovation; Pluvial flooding; Risk framing; Risk perception		While existing research suggests that extreme weather events influence perceptions of climate risk, the mechanisms shaping innovation in urban climate adaptation work remain understudied. In this article, we inquire into how recent localized extreme weather events in Copenhagen, Denmark, have spurred processes of innovation in adaptation pathways. We suggest that risk-framing work by professionals plays an important part in understanding urban innovation processes, since changes in public risk perceptions become part of collaborative learning processes amongst communities of professionals. Such learning processes can result in new technological pathways of innovation, as part of wider urban knowledge systems. We analyze these processes through 32 semi-structured interviews with professionals involved in creating knowledge about climate adaptation in urban Copenhagen. Specifically, we compare two knowledge and innovation pathways, for pluvial and coastal flooding, representing, respectively, an actualized extreme event and a near miss. Overall, we find that the presence (pluvial) or absence (coastal) of damage from localized extreme events matters to the knowledge and innovation pathways. Innovation in dominant technological solution spans, as well as related institutional decision-making routines, is more pervasive in pluvial flooding, whereas coastal flooding is widely considered as temporally distant. Analytically, we suggest that a distinction between regulative and expanded institutional framings of risk matters to how professionals understand their own room for manoeuvre. Recent pluvial flood events have not changed the official technical risk assessments. Yet when professionals consider such events in an expanded institutional frame, they incorporate increased public and political risk perceptions as they construct pathways for further innovation.

Tropical rivers are typically characterised by pronounced seasonal changes in precipitation, large sediment loads and high rates of lateral channel migration across often very low-gradient and densely populated floodplains. Understanding the controls on channel migration or change is integral to our ability to fully predict and build resilience against flood risk and wider river-related hazards. Here, we analyse channel and confluence migration over the last similar to 40 years along a similar to 85 km reach of the Cagayan River and one of its tributaries, the Pinacanauan de Ilagan (Luzon, Philippines) using optical satellite imagery captured during this period. Combining this with spatial variations in channel pattern, valley width and new bed material grain size data, we demonstrate that sediment transport and deposition are key drivers of the observed tropical channel morphodynamics in this region. The high sediment supply generated in the catchment headwaters (by mass-wasting of hillslopes triggered especially in typhoons) results in high aggradation rates and channel widening on the lower gradient alluvial plain. We suggest that this aggradation enhances local confluence and lateral channel migration rates, which can reach >300 m per decade, and that lateral migration rates of tropical rivers are typically greater than those of temperate rivers. Channel morphodynamics have implications for how to best manage these types of tropical river systems, where hard bank protection structures may result in a complex geomorphic response and flood risk mapping may need to include assessment of sensitivity to varying channel position and topography.

River dynamics and nanopaticles formation: A comprehensive study on the nanoparticle geochemistry of suspended sediments in the Magdalena River, Caribbean Industrial Area	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Human activities; Suspended sediments; River basin; Sediments geochemistry; Water pollution; Magdalena River	PARTICULATE MATTER; SOIL; METALS; LOAD; DEFORESTATION; NANOMINERALS; DISCHARGE; COLOMBIA; WASTE	The coastal zones on continental shelves are the main channels for the distribution of fluvial-sourced suspended sediments (SSs). In the current research, the monthly average amount of SS draining into the Caribbean Sea from the Magdalena River in northern Colombia was analyzed to detect nanoparticle (NPs) containing potential hazardous elements (PHEs). The ecological authorities of Colombia claimed that the climate change is the key reason behind land erosion and floods occurred in the last years; therefore, an elaborate understanding of NP dynamics between the Magdalena River body and streambed is an essential issue in SS research. In this work, the NP geochemistry of SS in the Magdalena River estuary was studied from the perspective of water quality controls on SS sorting. The morphologies and the structures of NPs (<100 nm) were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)/micro-beam diffraction (MBD)/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The average size of NPs was found to be greater than 2 nm and Al, Ti, Fe oxides, and other hazardous elements were also detected in the SS. The obtained data confirmed that these typical categories of NPs caused the occurrence-dependent intensification of a conjugative transmission rate associated with the regulators. The advanced electron beam technique provided a clear insight into SS transportation; therefore, it could be used as an essential instrument for river supervision/dynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although 30 cities in China have been chosen to implement sponge city construction, there is a lack of a quantitative evaluation method to evaluate the environmental, economic, and social benefits of LID practices. This paper develops a comprehensive evaluation system to quantify the benefits of different combinations of LID units using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The performance of five LID design scenarios with different locations and sizes of the bio-retention facility, the grassed swale, the sunken green space, the permeable pavement, and the storage tank were analyzed for a sports center project in Guangxi, China. Results indicated that the green scenario that contains 34.5% of bio-retention facilities and 46.0% of sunken green spaces had the best comprehensive performance regarding meeting the requirements of 75% annual total runoff reduction and the attainment of good operation performance, rainwater utilization, landscape promotion, and ecological service functions, mainly because they are micro-scale and decentralized facilities that can manage stormwater at the source through the natural process. The optimal scenario was adopted to construct the project, and the proposed evaluation system can also be applied to optimal selection and performance effect evaluation of LID practices in other sponge city projects.

Thus, considering the hydro-climatic effects of reservoirs is important in water cycle studies at a river basin to global scales; yet, reservoirs are represented poorly in large-scale hydrological and climate models. Here we present a high-resolution (5km) continental-scale reservoir storage dynamics and release scheme by enhancing existing schemes and adding critical novel parameterizations to improve reservoir storage and release simulations. The new scheme simulates river-floodplain-reservoir storages in an integrated manner considering their spatial and temporal variations. A new calibration scheme is also incorporated to better simulate reservoir dynamics considering cascade-reservoir effects. Further, since no reservoir bathymetry data are available over large domains, we use a state-of-the-art digital elevation model and reservoir extent data to derive reservoir bed elevation. The new scheme is integrated within the river-floodplain routing scheme of a continental hydrological model LEAF-Hydro-Flood. Results from the simulation of similar to 1,900 reservoirs within the contiguous United States suggest that the model well captures the observed reservoir storage-release dynamics. Comparison of our results with those from the existing schemes suggest a significant improvement; importantly, the new scheme reduces the excessive and frequent reservoir overfilling and underfilling. Comparison of results with satellite-based surface water data shows that the model accurately reproduces the large-scale patterns of reservoir-floodplain inundation extents. It is expected that the results of this study will inform the incorporation of reservoirs in hyper-resolution models to improve simulations of terrestrial water storage and flow and examine reservoir-atmosphere interactions over large domains.

To counteract these threats, different coastal defence tools have been developed, with an increasing emphasis on nature-based solutions. However, tracking the impacts of these interventions on marine benthic organisms requires appropriate sampling designs and timely investigation methods due to the dynamic nature of coastal environments. Environmental DNA metabarcoding is a promising, non-invasive, and quick technique to monitor community changes. Here, environmental DNA COI-based metabarcoding data from sediment and bottom water samples were used to characterize benthic communities at three sites along the Emilia-Romagna coast differing in the topology of coastal defence actions (from no defences to groynes and low-crested barriers) and to evaluate the effectiveness of the two sampling matrices in detecting local biodiversity. The findings revealed significant differences in the structure of the benthic communities depending on site, sample type (i.e., sediment versus bottom water), and their interaction. The three sites differ in abiotic char-acteristic affecting the community composition. Lido di Dante and Riccione showed higher species diversity due to the new type of substrata provided by the hard defence structure, while Foce del Bevano showed the presence of species typical of low impacted areas. Bottom water, hosting more traces of pelagic and nektonic species, showed significantly different species composition compared to sediment samples, suggesting the need to consider both matrices in coastal monitoring.

The substantial material movement increased the geohazard (flash floods, landslides and debris flows) risks induced by extreme precipitation in the area. Intervention measures such as check dams, levees and vegetated slopes have been constructed in specific locations to reduce sediment transport and thereby mitigate the impact of ensuing geohazards.This study assessed the short-medium-term effects of interventions, including multiple control measures, in a post-earthquake mountainous region. Taking the Xingping valley as an example, we used CAESAR-Lisflood, a two-dimensional landscape evolution model, to simulate three scenarios, unprotected landscape, present protected landscape and enhanced protected landscape, between 2011 and 2013. We defined two indices to assess the intervention effects of the three scenarios by comparing the geomorphic changes and sediment yields.The results show that the mitigation measures are effective, especially the geotechnical engineering efforts in combination with ecological engineering in the upstream area. The spatial patterns of erosion and deposition change considerably due to the intervention measures. Additionally, the effectiveness of each intervention scenario shows a gradual decline over time, mainly due to the reduction in the reservoir storage capacity. The enhanced scenario performs better than the present one, with a more gradual downward trend of effectiveness. The simulation results evaluated the ability and effectiveness of comprehensive control measures and will support optimal mitigation strategies.

Methods to assess the spatiotemporal magnitude of UPFS and their impacts are needed to research and explore mitigation measures. This study presents a method for the assessment of UPFs and their impacts by combining a hydrodynamic sewer system model with a GIS-based overland diffusive flow algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in the software GIS-based Agent-based Modeling Architecture (GAMA) along with the depth-damage functions and land use data to estimate financial impacts. The result is a dynamic and interactive model that allows the user to monitor the events in real-time. Functionality is demonstrated in a case study in Dresden, Germany and with ten to 100-year design storms. The majority of flood extents and damages occur in the early stages of the event. Sewer surcharge emerges from few of the manholes, suggesting early action vitally reduces flood risks and interventions at a few hot spots, largely reducing impacts. Flood protection barriers were interactively implemented as a potential response measure in the hot spot areas reducing the damage by up to 90%. The user can compare different parameters in a visually compelling way that can lead to a better understanding of the system and more efficient knowledge transfer.

Flood Protection Reliability: The Impact of Uncertainty and Nonstationarity	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						flood protection reliability; uncertainty; nonstationarity; floodplain; flood risk	DESIGN FLOODS; RISK; TRENDS; MODELS; RIVER; URBANIZATION; INUNDATION; HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE; EVENTS	Recent catastrophic flood events, increasing flood losses, and climate change challenge current reliability estimates defined by the probability that flood levels will not exceed protection measures over a planning horizon. These estimates depict an expected reliability that mask uncertainty in streamflow and the capacity of river channels and floodplains. We described reliability as a random variable whose distribution depends on uncertainty and nonstationarity in annual maximum flood (AMF) distributions and flow capacity uncertainty. Numerical experiments quantified the impacts of nonstationarity and variance in AMFs and flow capacity uncertainty on estimates of flood protection reliability, thereby providing the first examination of their interacting effects. The distribution of reliability along a regulatory floodplain boundary was quantified through a bootstrap scheme that accounts for nonstationarity and uncertainty in AMFs and flow capacity uncertainty. Results indicated that accounting for uncertainty in flow capacity substantially reduces reliability compared to estimates based solely on flood likelihood; the divergence is greater in the presence of nonstationary AMFs. The distribution of reliability along the regulatory floodplain boundary was spatially heterogeneous due to within-reach variation in flow capacity uncertainty. Quantifying the distribution of reliability for flood protection measures enables transparent communication and selection of a desired confidence level that is commensurate with a contextually appropriate risk tolerance. Similarly, we show that a desired level of confidence in reliability can be specified to estimate a design flood protection level. These results reveal how the combined impacts of uncertainty and nonstationarity can impact reliability estimates and confidence in those estimates.	[Stephens, T.

CERNE			English	Article						Fabaceae; Flooded Ground; Tropical Forest; Seasonality	TROPICAL DRY FOREST; PLANT PHENOLOGY; PATTERNS	Background: Neotropical species lack autecological information. Among these, are phenological studies, which help to understand forest dynamics and provide important contributions to the collection, restoration, and conservation programs. This research aimed to characterize the vegetative and reproductive phenological behavior of neotropical species Geoffroea spinosa Jacq. in a seasonally dry tropical forest, as well as to verify if there is a correlation between phenophases and environmental parameters. Twenty individuals were accompanied monthly for two years, to detect and tally the presence of floral buds, flowers, immature fruits, ripe fruits, leaf emergence, presence of mature leaves, and defoliation. A semi-quantitative evaluation was carried out with the Fournier method. Results: The results showed that the population had synchrony of reproductive events, with more than 50% of the individuals blooming and fruiting during the same time interval. Furthermore, the circular statistical test indicated a high seasonality for reproductive events (r >= 0.50 and p < 0.001). Among the vegetative events, all were classified as non-seasonal (r < 0.5). G. spinosa, showed a significant correlation (p <= 0.05) for all meteorological variables evaluated. Conclusion: The reproductive phenophases of G. spinosa showed strongly seasonal behavior, unlike vegetative events. the period between mid-February and the end of March was the most propitious for fruit collection. No seasonality was observed for the vegetative events. The species proved to be sensitive to El ninoconditions. Follow-up phenological studies associated with meteorological variables are important for a better understanding of the dynamics of vegetative behavior in response to climate change.

With landcover change data, digital elevation models (DEM), and self-organizing maps (SOM), this study explores changing landcover and the flood mitigation attributes of wetland areas over a 15-year period in Toronto and Chicago. The results of this analysis show that (1) in the city of Toronto SOM clusters, the landcover change correlations with wetland volume and wetland area range between -0.1 to -0.5, indicating that a more intense landcover change tends to be correlated with small shallow wetlands, (2) in the city of Chicago SOM clusters, the landcover change correlations with wetland area range between -0.1 to -0.7, the landcover change correlations with wetland volume per area range between -0.1 to 0.8, and the landcover change correlations with elevation range between -0.2 to -0.6, indicating that more intense landcover change tends to be correlated with spatially small wetlands that have a relatively high water-storage capacity per area and are located at lower elevations. In both cities, the smallest SOM clusters represent wetland areas where increased landcover change is correlated with wetland areas that have high flood mitigation potential. This study aims to offer a new perspective on changing urban landscapes and urban wetland ecosystem services in Toronto and Chicago.

Tree-ring oxygen isotopes record a decrease in Amazon dry season rainfall over the past 40 years	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Amazon floodplains; Climate change; Macrolobium acaciifolium; Oxygen isotopes	OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATION; AMERICAN SUMMER MONSOON; QUELCCAYA ICE CAP; STABLE-ISOTOPES; EL-NINO; CELLULOSE DELTA-O-18; DROUGHT SENSITIVITY; CO2 CONCENTRATION; RAINY-SEASON; CLIMATE	Extant climate observations suggest the dry season over large parts of the Amazon Basin has become longer and drier over recent decades. However, such possible intensification of the Amazon dry season and its underlying causes are still a matter of debate. Here we used oxygen isotope ratios in tree rings (delta O-18(TR)) from six floodplain trees from the western Amazon to assess changes in past climate. Our analysis shows that delta O-18(TR) of these trees is negatively related to inter-annual variability of precipitation during the dry season over large parts of the Amazon Basin, consistent with a Rayleigh rainout model. Furthermore delta O-18(TR) increases by approximately 2%c over the last four decades (similar to 1970-2014) providing evidence of an Amazon drying trend independent from satellite and in situ rainfall observations. Using a Rayleigh rainout framework, we estimate basin-wide dry season rainfall to have decreased by up to 30%. The delta O-18(TR) record further suggests such drying trend may not be unprecedented over the past 80 years. Analysis of delta O-18(TR) with sea surface temperatures indicates a strong role of a warming Tropical North Atlantic Ocean in driving this long-term increase in delta O-18(TR) and decrease in dry season rainfall.

Urban flood risk assessment is a vital method for preventing and controlling such disasters. This paper takes the central region of Cangzhou city in Hebei Province as an example. Detailed topographical information, such as the buildings and roads in the study area, was extracted from GF-2 data. By coupling the two models, the SWMM and MIKE21, the spatial distribution of the inundation region, and the water depth in the study area under different return periods, were simulated in detail. The results showed that, for the different return periods, the inundation region was generally consistent. However, there was a large increase in the mean inundation depth within a 10-to-30-year return period, and the increase in the maximum inundation depth and inundation area remained steady. The comprehensive runoff coefficient in all of the scenarios exceeded 0.8, indicating that the drainage system in the study area is insufficient and has a higher flood risk. The flood risk of the study area was evaluated based on the damage curve, which was obtained from field investigations. The results demonstrate that the loss per unit area was less than CNY 250/m(2) in each return period in the majority of the damaged areas. Additionally, the total loss was mainly influenced by the damaged area, but, in commercial areas, the total loss was highly sensitive to the inundation depth.

Although water temperature is an important consideration in lake management, information on the water temperature of the lake is limited. Thus, we investigated the characteristics of the daytime water temperatures of the Tonle Sap Lake from 2000 to 2019 using MOD11A1, a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) product. Moreover, the relationship between water temperature fluctuations and hydrological-meteorological conditions was analyzed. The maximum and minimum daytime water temperatures were recorded in May (30.7 degrees C) and January (24.6 degrees C), respectively, each a month after the maximum and minimum air temperatures were recorded. The annual maximum, average, and minimum water levels showed a downward trend (0.14, 0.08, and 0.01 m/y, respectively). The annual maximum water temperature increased at a rate of 0.17 degrees C/decade, whereas the annual minimum water temperature decreased at a rate of 0.91 degrees C/decade. The annual maximum daytime water temperature had a strong negative correlation with water level change (flood pulse) and a weaker correlation with air temperature. The annual minimum daytime water temperature presented the strongest positive correlation with water level change (flood pulse) in the previous year. However, there was no correlation between the annual minimum daytime water temperature and air temperature. These results indicate that water temperature in the Tonle Sap Lake is mainly affected by water level fluctuations, which are mainly driven by flood pulses.

We compare the catch composition and amount from 2007-2013 of two fishery gear types, the bagnets of the largest commercial fishery, the Dai fishery, and gillnets, which are deployed ubiquitously by independent fishers. We found that the two methods captured a similar number of genera (81 and 88 in the Dai and gillnet). Catches of both fisheries were dominated (>75%) by three genera that migrate longitudinally, Henicorhynchus, Labiobarbus, and Paralaubuca. The catch of the Dai fishery followed annual variation in the flood pulse extent, but the gillnet catch did not. We used resource selection ratios to quantify selection pressure by the gillnet fishery, relative to the Dai fishery, on fish from different genera and trait groups. The gillnet selected for fish that migrate laterally from the floodplain to the main river and for higher trophic level fish. Gillnets may target groups of fish that are less impacted by the long-standing Dai fishery. For both fisheries, we note a need for monitoring fish lengths in order to understand the effects of selection on population dynamics and species-specific trait changes.

We determined the clay mineralogy in both hemipelagites and turbidites in the top 50 cm of the deep-sea sediment cores to infer how sediments are dispersed through river-fed turbidity currents, hypopycnal plumes, and oceanic currents. Our results show that the clay mineral assemblages in both hemipelagites and turbidites of different provinces change gradually between two major end-members: illite+chlorite and smectite. They are predominantly sourced from Taiwan and Luzon, respectively. The relative abundances of clay minerals in turbidites and hemipelagites are quite similar in most of the cores. Therefore, we argue that the adjacent turbidites and hemipelagites of a core share common detrital clay sources. We found that smectite is relatively abundant around Taiwan, indicating that the Kuroshio Current is an important transportation system, which brings smectite from Luzon. Besides, the river-related canyon systems consist dominantly of illite and chlorite, and less smectite, indicating that the smectite brought about by the Kuroshio Current is diluted by river-fed hyperpycnal and hypopycnal flows. This also implies that flood-induced turbidity currents are efficient agents for transporting Taiwan-derived sediments into the neighboring deep-sea basins.

They often employ awareness campaigns in order to educate the public about flood risk and possible coping strategies. However, the effectiveness of these awareness campaigns has hardly been examined empirically, and the available analyses come to ambiguous conclusions. Evaluations based on longitudinal data of actual household behavior are missing. In this study, we perform two independent empirical analyses to assess whether a large-scale awareness campaign in Germany affected private flood protection or insurance behavior. We thereby exploit the fact that different federal states initiated the campaign at different points in time between 2009 and 2017. In the first analysis, we use a longitudinal data set of a national sample of 6,729 household heads in the years 2012 and 2014 and focus on three federal states that launched the campaign in 2013. In the second analysis, we use flood damage and insurance penetration data at the federal state level from 2002 to 2018 (N= 256). Based on a fixed effects difference-in-differences estimator, we do not find that the campaign had a significant effect on households' behaviors, damage, or insurance penetration. The results show that large-scale flood risk awareness campaigns, as they are currently conducted in many countries, have a limited effectiveness in terms of strengthening actual flood protection or insurance behavior of households.

The western Mediterranean region is a very sensitive area, since climate change can enhance these weather extremes. In the present study we created a catalogue of the extreme torrential episodes (>= 200 mm in 24 h) that took place in Catalonia (NE Iberia) during the 1951-2016 study period (66 years). We computed daily WeMOi values and constructed WeMOi calendars. Our principal result reveals the occurrence of 50 episodes (0.8 cases per year), mainly concentrated in the autumn. We confirmed a threshold of WeMOi <= -2 to define an extreme negative WeMO phase at daily resolution. Most of the 50 episodes (60 %) in the study area occurred on days presenting an extreme negative WeMOi value. Specifically, the most negative WeMOi values are detected in autumn, from 11 to 20 October, coinciding with the highest frequency of extreme torrential events. On comparing the subperiods, we observed a statistically significant decrease in WeMOi values in all months, particularly in late October and in November and December. No changes in the frequency of these extreme torrential episodes were observed between both subperiods. In contrast, a displacement of the extreme torrential episodes is detected from early to late autumn; this can be related to a statistically significant warming of sea temperature.

J	Chouari, W				Chouari, Walid			A methodological approach for mapping Tunisia's lower coast's risk of submersion: The case of the coastal sabkhas of Sidi Khlifa and Halq El Minjel (Central-East Tunisia)	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Cartography; Submersion; Sabkha; Climate change; Forecasting analysis	EXTREME WATER LEVELS; EMPIRICAL-MODEL; FLOOD HAZARD; WAVE RUNUP; IMPACT; SWASH; LEVEL; SCALE; BEACH; BAY	This study presents a method to map the risk of submersion of the lower Tunisian coasts, by taking as an example the coastal sabkhas system of a part of the bottom of the gulf of Hammamet between the sabkhas of Sidi Khlifa and Halq El Minjel. Total Water Levels (TWLs) were estimated by considering a water level rise for 2100 estimated by IPCC scenarios (2007) and the runup during storms. Similarly, local hydrodynamic parameters such as tidal level, storm surge, wave setup, swash and coastal erosion have been taken into consideration. The mapping approach of potentially submersible areas is based on geographic information system (GIS) modeling. Based on a static method, the approach relies on the crossing of topographic data and extreme water levels in order to assess potentially floodable areas. The mapping application has shown that the areas that are likely to be annexed to the sea are important (17.5 km(2)). Part of the Halq El Minjel sabkha of 16.1 km(2) will be transformed into a permanent lagoon. Thus, coastal wetland ecosystems will be threatened by changes in living conditions since the rather saline biocenosis will be transformed into euryhaline and eurytherm lagoon biocenosis. However, reforestation and conservation of the coastal dune in these low-lying areas could help protect the backshore from expected risk of storm surges.

Lithology, organic matter, biological proxies and high-resolution chronology provide estimations of sediment accumulation rates and changes in environmental conditions in relation to sea-level change and climate variability during the Holocene. Results show that the wet dune slack was formed 7.5 cal. ka BP, contemporaneous with the last stages of the rapid sea-level rise. This depositional environment formed under frequent freshwater flooding and water ponding that allowed the development and post-mortem accumulation of abundant plant remains. The wetland evolved into mostly palustrine conditions over the next 2000 years, until a phase of stabilization in relative sea-level rise, when sedimentation rates slowed down to 0.04 mm yr(-1), between 5.3 and 2.5 cal. ka BP. Later, about 0.8 cal. ka BP, high-energy events, likely due to enhanced storminess and more frequent onshore winds, caused the collapse of the foredune above the wetlands' seaward margin. The delicate balance between hydrology (controlled by sea-level rise and climate change), sediment supply and storminess modulates the habitat's resilience and ecological stability. This underpins the relevance of integrating past records in coastal wet dune slacks management in a scenario of constant adaptation processes.

The present study addressed this anxiety by assimilating satellite data products and auxiliary datasets in the Bhagirathi River basin of the Indian Himalayas. Snow Covered Area (SCA) is a critical indicator of the ecosystem that influenced the flash flood along different terrain features such as Altitude, Hill-Gradient, and Aspect. GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) technique is used to analyze the possible landslide zones and flood extent along the river basin, and MODIS Terra (MOD10A2) data products derived annual SCA is 4278 km(2) for the year 2021, the analysis of geospatial maps at 25(degrees) intervals of Altitude, hill-gradient, and Aspect. The SCA distribution reveals that apart from the Altitude, the Aspect of the hill gradient significantly impacts snow accumulation. HillGradient, ranging from 13.06 to 19.52, occupies 24.7% of the total area, and 45.3 to 51.83 are found without snow. The highest variation of SCA is along the Western direction (9.19%), followed by North-East (8.79%), while the least (3.78%) variance is in the Southwest direction. Additionally, it was found that many bridges, roads, and other properties are under threat in this study area, even with a moderate flash flood. Findings from this study provide the spatiotemporal status of SCA in various geological stress conditions during the last decades and probable landslide zones. This will be a preliminary pathway to policymakers in rehabilitation and early evacuation of human lives due to flash flood occurrence.

Here, we present a high resolution (similar to 4 years) and precisely dated (+/- 25 years) speleothem multi-proxy record from Zhangjia Cave (northern margin of Sichuan basin, China) spanning the 7.2 and 8.2 ka events within the transition of early to middle Holocene. The speleothem delta O-18 mainly reflects the dynamic facets of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system, while its delta C-13 and trace elements ratios serve as an indicator of local hydrological conditions. Our results reveal intense dry conditions in southwest China during the 7.2 ka event, despite the 7.2 event was characterized by a relatively stronger monsoon compared to the 8.2 ka event. Furthermore, the hydrological conditions during the 7.2 ka event and the middle Holocene appear to exhibit "north flood and south drought" pattern when compared to different paleoclimate records in EASM domains, while it can be summarized as "spatially consistent drought" in the 8.2 ka event. These different hydrological conditions are a response to the weakening of the EASM, a phenomenon also observed in modern climatic observations and empirical simulations, which underpins our understanding that the speleothem delta O-18 variations are mainly dynamical manifestations of the EASM system, likely different with its thermodynamical appearances.

Pyrite content, size distribution, and morphology are influenced by depositional conditions and are sensitive to environmental changes. This study investigated the authigenic pyrites or gypsums of core JC-1 offshore of Zhoushan. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the pyrites and identify various aggregations. Changes in lithology, chlorine content, and stable isotope values of organic matter were analyzed to indicate the evolution of ancient marine, floodplain estuary, tidal flat environments, and shallow marine sedimentary facies. The morphology and microcrystalline structure of these types of pyrites can be divided into spherical framboid aggregates, sub-euhedral aggregates, and microcrystalline euhedral pyrites with different sedimentary facies. Gypsum minerals and the coexistence of pyrite and gypsum were found in the enriched authigenic pyrites at the SMTZs. The sources of sulfate formed by authigenic gypsums may originate from overlying seawater and pyrite oxidation, whereas calcium ions may come from the dissolution of carbonate or calcareous shells caused by local environmental acidification. The various aggregations of pyrites observed may be related to SO4-AOM in different environments. The findings suggest that authigenic gypsums form due to local environmental acidification and that the sources of the formed sulfate may be from overlying seawater and pyrite oxidation. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the responses of different sedimentary environments to sea level rise and climate change.

However, spatial resolutions in current hydrological modeling studies have been mostly constrained to relatively coarse resolution (similar to 10-100 km), and they therefore have a difficult time addressing flooding or drought issues with fine resolutions. In this study, a continental-scale high-resolution hydrological modeling framework (0.0625 degrees, similar to 6 km) driven by remote sensing products was used to detect extreme hydrological event occurrences in China and evaluated based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The results showed that the developed model provided more detailed information than the coarser resolution models (a 0.25 degrees and 1 degrees), thereby capturing the timing, duration, and spatial extent of extreme hydrologic events regarding the 2012 Beijing flood and 2009/10 drought in Hai River Basin. Here, the total water storage changes were calculated based on the VIC model (-0.017 mm/year) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite (-0.203 mm/year) to reflect the water availability caused by climate change and anthropogenic factors. This study found that the 0.0625 degrees dataset could capture detailed changes, thereby providing reliable information during occurrences of extreme hydrological events. The high-resolution model integrated with remote sensing products could be used for accurate evaluations of continental-scale extreme hydrological events and can be valuable in understanding its long-term occurrence and water resource security.

Hong Kong is a typical economically and socially developed coastal area. However, in such an important coastal city, the mechanisms of local sea-level dynamics and their relationship with climate teleconnections are not well explained. In this paper, Hong Kong tide gauge data spanning 68 years was documented to study the historical sea-level dynamics. Through the analysis framework based on Wavelet Transform and Hilbert Huang Transform, non-stationary and multi-scale features in sea-level dynamics in Hong Kong are revealed. The results show that the relative sea level (RSL) in Hong Kong has experienced roughly 2.5 cycles of high-to-low sea-level transition in the past half-century. The periodic amplitude variation of tides is related to Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). RSL rise and fall in eastern Hong Kong often occur in La Nina and El Nino years, respectively. The response of RSL to the PDO and ENSO displays a time lag and spatial heterogeneity in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's eastern coastal waters are more strongly affected by the Pacific climate and current systems than the west. This study dissects the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of relative sea-level change and helps to better understand the response of RSL to the global climate system.

Nation-wide surveillance data of HFRS cases were collected during 2008-2020.The seasonality and epidemiological features were presented by combining the HFRS incidence and the endemic types data. Factors potentially involved in affecting incidence and shaping disease seasonality were investigated by generalized additive mixed model, distributed lag nonlinear model and multivariate meta-analysis. A total of 76 cities that reported totally 111,054 cases were analyzed. Three endemic types were deter-mined, among them the Type I cities (Hantaan virus-dominant) were related to higher incidence level, showing one spike every year in Autumn-Winter season; Type II (Seoul virus-dominant) cities were related to lower incidence, showing one spike in Spring, while Type III (Hantaan/Seoul-mixed type) showed dual peaks with incidence lying be-tween. Persistently heavy rainfall had significantly negative influence on HFRS incidence in Hantaan virus-dominant endemic area, while a significantly opposite effect was identified when continuously heavy rainfall induced floods, where temperature and relative humidity affected HFRS incidence via an approximately parabolic or linear manner, however few or no such effects was shown in Seoul virus-dominant endemic areas, which was more vulnerable to tem-perature variation. Dual seasonal pattern of HFRS was depended on the dominant genotypes of hantavirus, and impact of climate on HFRS was greater in Hantaan virus-dominant endemic areas, than in Seoul virus-dominant areas.

J	Hinis, MA; Yurekli, K				Hinis, Mehmet Ali; Yurekli, Kadri			Changing Characteristics of Regional and Site-based Frequency Distribution Under the Non-Stationary Process	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Maximum rainfall; L-moment; ITA test; Regionalization under non-stationarity	L-MOMENT; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; TREND; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; HOMOGENEITY; BASIN	The probability of the occurrence belonging to heavy rainfalls that directly triggers the flood is estimated with the common assumption that the process by which it occurred is under stationary conditions. By accepting this threat as if it does not exist in our globe, which is faced with the reality of global warming and climate change, estimating the required design values in the construction of hydraulic structures with frequency analysis of the relevant data would cause the failure of the water-related structures. This study was carried out to come up with how the regional and site-based frequency distribution would change under non-stationary conditions. The L-moments algorithm, Monte Carlo Simulation technique, and the magnitude of the trend calculated by Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) were involved in scrutinizing the impact of non-stationary conditions on frequency analysis of annual maximum daily rainfall data sets. By including the own time-dependent change (trend) of each data in synthetic data, synthetically produced rainfall data was intended to reflect the actual conditions effectively. The simulated data has increased the heterogeneity of the entire region compared to the observed data and led to considerable differences in regional and site-based quantile estimates, and this difference became a nonlinear increase, especially after the 90% probability level. Based on this study, by considering stations with longer and equal or nearly equal observation periods in alternative regions, the change of frequency distribution behaviour in non-stationary conditions can be scrutinized with different methodologies.

Quantifying and understanding the impacts of past storm surges, therefore, has significant implications for the management and conservation of coastal wetlands worldwide. However, short-term (< 10 year) increases in salinity driven by storm surges are problematic to reconstruct via the palaeolimnological record due to sampling resolution and smoothing of trends. Here, we propose that the geochemistry (Sr/Ca and delta O-18) of calcitic shells of ostracods (small bivalved crustaceans readily preserved in lacustrine sediments) is a potentially sensitive proxy for reconstructing salinity, in some cases quantitatively, in comparison with sedimentary proxies of allochthonous sediment inputs (XRF and grain size) or other biological proxies. The coastal lakes of the Thurne Broads (Norfolk and Suffolk Broads National Park) in East Anglia, UK, have a long history of sea floods associated with storm surge events in the North Sea, providing a test bed to compare ostracod palaeosalinity reconstructions (using a site-specific calibration) with known storm surges in the region. We show that Sr/Ca-shell values closely match known salinity changes associated with storm surges; archival records of the salinity of Horsey Mere in CE 1940 suggest a maximum salinity of 13.4 PSU with ostracod Sr/Ca-shell palaeosalinity calibrations giving a maximum value of 18.3 PSU. Ostracod shell chemistry, therefore, has the potential to afford more reliable reconstructions of high intensity short-term increases in salinity in mid-latitude low-lying coastal lakes.

The significant advantages of hydrogen, such as cleanliness, high efficiency, and a wide range of sources, make it quite promising. Hydrogen is prone to material damage, which may lead to leakage. High-pressure leaking hydrogen is highly susceptible to spontaneous combustion due to its combustion characteristics, which may cause jet fire or explosion accidents, resulting in serious casualties and property damage. This paper presents a detailed review of the research progress on hydrogen leak diffusion characteristics, leak spontaneous combustion mechanisms and material hydrogen damage mechanisms from the perspectives of theoretical analysis, experiments and numerical simulations. This review points out that although a large number of research results have been obtained on the safety characteristics of hydrogen, there are still some deficiencies and limitations. Further research topics are clarified, such as further optimizing the kinetic mechanism of the high-pressure hydrogen leakage reaction and turbulence model, exploring the expansion and dilution law of hydrogen clouds after liquid hydrogen flooding, further studying the spontaneous combustion mechanism of leaked hydrogen and the interaction between mechanisms, and investigating the synergistic damage effect of hydrogen and other components on materials. The leakage spontaneous combustion process in open space, the development process of the bidirectional effect of hydrogen jet fuel and crack growth under the impact of high-pressure hydrogen jet fuel on the material may need to be explored next.

Knowing why farmers value FGs is important because this can increase livelihood security and the skillful governance of land. We chose Sri Lanka to investigate farmers' values for land, contextual factors that effect valuation, stressors that impact agriculture, and farmers' current and future response strategies. Mixed methods were used to collect data from 85 farming households in landholdings across nine locations of the Intermediate agroecological zone (1750-2500 mm). Landholdings comprise land uses with short-term, annual, and semi-perennial crops (paddy, swidden, and cash crop plots) and long-term, perennial or tree crops (FGs, plantations). Farmers' values were categorised, ranked, and aligned with Utility, Environmental, Aesthetic, Intrinsic, Option and Bequest themes of the Total Economic Value framework (TEV). Farmers give the highest importance to Utility (income, food) and Environmental (friendly biodiversity, leaf litter and soil fertility) values mainly from tree crops. Timber and fuelwood are biological assets that can be optionally converted to cash. Farmers have Intrinsic values (contentment, tranquility, pride) for land bequeathed to future generations. Nevertheless, since livelihoods are stressed by climate variability and extreme events, animal and insect pests, and labour scarcities, farmers adopt diverse response strategies. Of these, farmers favour long-term crop cultivation because trees are relatively resilient to droughts, floods, animal, and insect pests, and require less labour. This study validates why farmers' pluralistic values for land, trees, and biodiversity must be integrated into national decision-and policy-making for agriculture, forest and biodiversity conservation.

Effective prevention of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in this region has recently become an urgent priority. As a major element of an integrated risk management strategy, the GLOF early warning system is a viable and promising tool for mitigating climate change-related risks. It prevents loss of life and reduces the economic and societal impacts of disasters. Within the framework of the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research program, we developed and implemented a monitoring and early warning system (EWS) for Cirenmaco, a transboundary high-risk glacial lake located in the central Himalayas. The EWS consists of monitoring lake-level change, end-moraine displacement, ice collapse, and downstream runoff. The monitoring data can be transmitted via the Beidou and Inmarsat satellites and a mobile network to the data center. The in-situ and real-time monitoring guarantee captures the precursors of ice collapse and glacial lake outburst and raises alarms in advance for downstream communities. In terms of data transmission, monitoring elements, and warning thresholds, the Cirenmaco EWS scheme is one of the most advanced among all similar GLOF early warning systems. Implementing an early warning system is the most practical strategy for mitigating potential threats to Himalayan high-risk glacial lakes. The EWS system is less expensive than lake dam immobilization and artificial drainage projects, and it provides more valuable environmental monitoring data in high mountain areas. The Cirenmaco EWS serves an effective demonstration for the construction of similar projects to prevent and mitigate GLOFs in the Himalayas.

Expert interviews and a community survey were conducted. Using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and GIS technique, the results indicated that land-use, drainage density, and annual maximum rainfall were the most heavily weighted factors in flood hazard mapping in Bangkok. About half (50.32%) of Bangkok's total area was defined as high flood hazard area. A total of 736 questionnaires were distributed in flood-prone areas and in the areas with the highest percentage of elderly population. The results of both SWOT and survey analysis found that many senior citizens have low digital and media literacy and limited experience in using information technology for flood preparedness. Lack of integration of disaster risk reduction and aging population policy, ineffective warning system, and lack of access to disaster preparedness training were the key barriers in reducing vulnerability to flood hazard. The survey revealed that the majority of elderly respondents (75%) have neither used online applications for their flood hazard management both before and during flood disaster nor shared/communicated information via online platforms. Some respondents (13%) used Facebook and Line applications to obtain information before a flood event. Very few of the elderly respondents (<2%) accessed the national/provincial web-based platform to find out flood-related information. Almost all respondents, especially who are living in high-risk flood zones, had never participated in the community training of flood preparedness and management. Therefore, effective strategies in enhancing social engagement of the elderly and their literacy skills in flood risk preparedness and management are urgently needed.

J	Garnaud, C; MacKay, M; Fortin, V				Garnaud, C.; MacKay, M.; Fortin, V			A One-Dimensional Lake Model in ECCC's Land Surface Prediction System	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						lake model; lake temperature; lake ice	ICE COVER; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; ASSIMILATION; IMPACT; SCHEME; FLAKE; IMPLEMENTATION; RETRIEVALS; OFFLINE	In most of Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) current operational systems, inland water physical processes are simulated using a simple water scheme. Water surface temperatures and ice cover fractions are updated daily using analyses. However, ECCC recognizes the need for interactive lakes in its weather and environmental prediction systems, such as those used to forecast surface conditions and floods. As a first step toward this goal, the current study evaluates the impact of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM) in an offline context on surface water temperature, ice phenology and near-surface atmospheric conditions. The use of CSLM increases lake surface temperatures and decreases its RMSE during ice-free months, which has a direct impact on the 2-m air temperature by reducing the cold bias observed in the simulation without CSLM, particularly over larger lakes. CSLM improves ice cover in subgrid lakes, while having a neutral impact on intermediate lakes. On large lakes, CSLM tends to degrade ice cover simulation in southernmost lakes, while improving ice cover in northernmost lakes. The increased lake ice cover in CSLM, particularly over subgrid lakes and in the northern latitudes, has a strong impact on humidity fluxes at the surface during wintertime with a near-interruption of evapotranspiration over lakes. In summertime, increased water temperature with CSLM leads to a 38% increase in evapotranspiration. With these results, it is expected that the synergy of CSLM and lake-related observations will improve the simulation and initialization of lake conditions in ECCC's systems.

Understanding the orographic impact on the statistics of precipitation extremes is therefore crucial for improving hydrological design and risk management strategies. Here, we use a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events to improve our understanding of the omgraphic impact on extreme precipitation of durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h. We focus on Trentino, a rough omgraphic region in the eastern Italia Alps, and use data from 78 quality-controlled rain gauges with 5-minute resolution. We show that our framework well reproduces the statistical properties of the observed annual maxima (Nash-Sutcliffe 0.82-0.95, Bias from -4% to 7%) as well as their relation with orography. We then exploit the reduced uncertainty of this approach to quantify the omgraphic impact on precipitation right-tail statistics and on extreme return levels using a regression analysis. We identify two main modes of orographic relationship: a reverse orographic effect for hourly and sub-hourly durations (10-20% decrease per 1000 m elevation) and an orographic enhancement for durations of similar to 8 h or longer (7.5-10% increase per 1000 m elevation). We observe that these two modes result from three main precipitation regimes, which show different proportion between extreme and very-extreme events and which emerge at very short durations (similar to 20 min or shorter), mid durations (similar to 30 min-1 hour) and long durations (similar to 2 h or longer). These findings are of interest for risk management applications and climate change impact studies.

Modeling Salinity Response to Relative Sea Level Rise in a Brackish Floodplain Region	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Relative Sea Level Rise; Salinity Response; Brackish Region; Accretion Deficit; Numerical Modeling	ESTUARINE SALINITY; COASTAL WETLANDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOUISIANA; VULNERABILITY; INTRUSION; ZONE	A model-based assessment of the response of mean salinities to relative sea level rise (RSLR) in a brackish floodplain region is presented. The study area is located on the Gulf coastal region of Louisiana which is experiencing some of the highest rates of relative sea level rise in the world. A two-dimensional modeling approach is developed, and the local hydrodynamic model is well calibrated for scenario testing purposes. Numerous alternative scenarios of RSLR are evaluated to simulate the salinity response in both the open water and adjacent floodplain areas under a range of wetland roughness and dispersion factors. The analysis reveals key insights on the mean salinity response patterns to RSLR including the sensitivity to deterioration of wetlands and offshore boundary conditions. Also developed are expressions describing the qualitative nonlinear response. A novel partitioning strategy is also employed in the simulation trials to analyze the effect of various accretion deficit scenarios on the nonlinear RSLR-induced salinity response. The analysis shows that the fraction of the floodplain which is able to keep pace with RSLR has an effect an order of magnitude larger than transport parameters associated with marsh deterioration on the RSLR salinity response. Sites exhibiting sustained accretion surpluses over the long term are able to keep pace and would likely contribute to greater overall resilience to future RSLR-induced salinity changes. The robust scenario analysis and findings of this study are widely applicable to the global challenge of managing the effects of RSLR in coastal wetland areas.

Changes in the frequency of global high mountain rain-on-snow events due to climate warming	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						rain on snow events (ROS); sensitivity analysis; climate warming; snow hydrology; hydrological modelling; high mountains	COVER; SIMULATION; ENERGY; PHASE; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; PRAIRIE; TRENDS; MODEL	Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can trigger severe floods in mountain regions. There is high uncertainty about how the frequency of ROS events (ROS) and associated floods will change as climate warms. Previous research has found considerable spatial variability in ROS responses to climate change. Detailed global assessments have not been conducted. Here, atmospheric reanalysis data was used to drive a physically based snow hydrology model to simulate the snowpack and the streamflow response to climate warming of a 5.25 km(2) virtual basin (VB) applied to different high mountain climates around the world. Results confirm that the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming is highly variable among sites, and also with different elevations, aspects and slopes in each basin. The hydrological model predicts a decrease in the frequency of ROS with warming in 30 out 40 of the VBs analyzed; the rest have increasing ROS. The dominant phase of precipitation, duration of snow cover and average temperature of each basin are the main factors that explain this variation in the sensitivity of ROS to climate warming. Within each basin, the largest decreases in ROS were predicted to be at lower elevations and on slopes with sunward aspects. Although the overall frequency of ROS drops, the hydrological importance of ROS is not expected to decline. Peak streamflows due to ROS are predicted to increase due to more rapid melting from enhanced energy inputs, and warmer snowpacks during future ROS.

Evaluating the relationship between hydrological extremes and groundwater in Luvuvhu River Catchment, South Africa	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Drought; Floods; Groundwater; Rainfall; Sequential Mann-Kendall; Streamflow; Trends; Water table fluctuation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RECHARGE; FLOW; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; PROVINCE; IMPACT; MODEL	Extreme hydrological events have been reported to be on an increase in terms of magnitude and frequency in southern Africa. Groundwater in this area plays a significant role in domestic water supply and agriculture. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between groundwater levels and hydrological extremes in north-eastern South Africa. An index-based approach was used to determine the drought and flood events over the study period while the Water Table Fluctuation approach was used to determine groundwater recharge. Flow duration curves were further employed to determine the exceedance period of high and low flows in the study area. Mann-Kendall and Sequential Mann-Kendall were used to detect trends and the point of change. Both floods and drought were found to have occurred in the study area at different magnitudes, however both the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) found that majority of these were not categorized as mild to near normal conditions. Specific yield determined using the simple linear regression method ranged between 0.04 and 0.06. Groundwater recharge estimates ranged between 1.1 and 11.5 % of mean annual rainfall ranging between 167-1000 mm/a. About 60 % of the stations (i.e. rainfall, streamflow, and groundwater) show significantly decreasing trend. This therefore indicates that there is a decreasing trend in groundwater levels, streamflow, and rainfall over the study area. Based on the trend analysis findings, it suggests that extreme events in the catchment influences groundwater resources.	[Mathivha, F. I.; Nkosi, M.; Mutoti, M.

Water saving practices often reduce the GHG emissions from rice paddies, yet increase the risk of rice yields loss due to drought stress. Water-saving and drought-resistance rice (WDR) has high drought-tolerant, suggesting that WDR with water-saving management could reduce GHG emissions while maintaining rice yields. However, the effect of WDR on GHG emissions is still unclear. Therefore, we conducted a 2-yr field experiment to assess the effect of WDR on rice yields and GHG emissions under continuous flooding (F), alternate wetting and drying (AWD), and dry cultivation (D) conditions, using a WDR variety and a common variety. Compared to the common variety, the WDR did not affect the rice yields under F and AWD treatments, but increased rice yields by 24% under D treatment. The methane (CH4) emissions and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of the two rice varieties were similar. Compared to the F treatment, AWD treatment reduced CH4 emissions by 7%-64% and area-scaled global warming potential (GWP) by 9%-39% and D treatment reduced CH4 emissions by 70%-90% and area-scaled GWP by 65%-74%. The WDR with dry cultivation (D-WDR mode) had the lowest area- and yield-scaled GWP. Our findings indicate that it is possible to produce optimal rice yields with low GHG emissions in the D-WDR mode, and suggest that drought-resistance rice variety breeding may benefit climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Determination of flood probability and prioritization of sub-watersheds: A comparison of game theory to machine learning	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Machine learning; Game theory; Flood probability; Tajan watershed	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RANDOM FOREST; LAND; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; VULNERABILITY; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; RESERVOIR; PATTERNS	Floods often significantly impact human lives, properties, and activities. Prioritizing areas in a region for mitigation based on flood probability is essential for reducing losses. In this study, two game theory (GT) algorithms - Borda and Condorcet - were used to determine the areas in the Tajan watershed, Iran that were most likely to flood, and two machine learning models - random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) - were used to model flood probability (the probability of flooding). Twelve independent variables (slope, aspect, elevation, topographic position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), land use, soil, lithology, rainfall, drainage density, and distance to river) and 263 locations of flooding were used to model and prepare flood-probability maps. The RF model was more accurate (AUC = 0.949) than the ANN model (AUC = 0.888). Frequency ratio (FR) was calculated for all factors to determine which had the most influence on flood probability. The values of twelve factors that affect flood probability were estimated for each sub-watershed. Then, game-theory algorithms were used to prioritize sub-watersheds in terms of flood probability. A pairwise comparison matrix revealed that the sub-watersheds most likely to flood. The Condorcet algorithm selected subwatersheds 1, 2, 4, 5, and 11 and the Borda algorithm selected sub-watersheds 2, 4, 5, 20 and 11. Both models predicted that most of the watershed has very low flood probability and a very small portion has a high probability for flooding. The quantitative analysis and characterization of the watersheds from the perspective of flood hazard can support decision making, planning, and investment in mitigation measures.

However, most flood risk analysis and categorization efforts have been focused on the hydrologic features of flood hazards (e.g., inundation depth, extent, and duration), rarely considering the resulting long-term losses and recovery time (i.e., the community's flood resilience). This paper aims at developing a data-driven community flood resilience categorization framework that can be utilized for the development of realistic disaster management strategies and proactive risk mitigation measures to better protect urban centers from future catastrophic flood events. This approach considers key resilience goals such as the robustness of the exposed community and its recovery rapidity. Such categorization that calls on the two resilience means, namely resourcefulness and redundancy, can empower decision makers to learn from past events and guide future resilience strategies. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed framework, a data-driven framework was applied on historical mainland flood disaster records collected by the US National Weather Services between 1996 and 2019. Descriptive analysis was conducted to identify the features of this dataset as well as the interdependence between the different variables considered. To further demonstrate the utilization of the developed data-driven framework, a spatial analysis was conducted to quantify community flood resilience across different counties within the affected states. Beyond the work presented in this paper, the developed framework lays the foundation to adopt data driven approaches for disasters prediction to guide proactive risk mitigation measures and develop community resilience management insights.

Though mostly deemed a natural phenomenon, floods can be anthropogenic and can be equally devastating in modern times. Remote sensing with its non-evasive data availability and high temporal resolution stands unparalleled for flood mapping and modelling. Since floods in India occur mainly in monsoon months, optical remote sensing has limited applications in proper flood mapping owing to lesser number of cloud-free days. Remotely sensed microwave/synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has penetration ability and has high temporal data availability, making it both weather independent and highly versatile for the study of floods. This study uses space-borne SAR data in C-band with VV (vertically emitted and vertically received) and VH (vertically emitted and horizontally received) polarization channels from Sentinel-1A satellite for SAR interferometry-based flood mapping and runoff modeling for Rupnagar (Punjab) floods of 2019. The flood maps were prepared using coherence-based thresholding, and digital elevation map (DEM) was prepared by correlating the unwrapped phase to elevation. The DEM was further used for Soil Conservation Service-curve number (SCS-CN)-based runoff modelling. The maximum runoff on 18 August 2019 was 350 mm while the average daily rainfall was 120 mm. The estimated runoff significantly correlated with the rainfall with an R-2 statistics value of 0.93 for 18 August 2019. On 18 August 2019, Rupnagar saw the most devastating floods and waterlogging that submerged acres of land and displaced thousands of people.

However, uncertainties about how the water cycle is being affected by the climate change still remain. Henceforth, this study analyses the recent variability of winter precipitation (WP) in Andalusia, the southern Iberian Peninsula (IP), and their relationship with the Atlantic and Mediterranean sources. For that purpose, two representative teleconnection patterns were used: the NAO (Atlantic influence) and WeMO (Mediterranean) indexes. The results of this contribution revealed that WP mostly decreased in the target region, only increasing over south-eastern Andalusia. Also, the influence area of WeMO increased and its modulation magnitude in WP behaviour. In addition, series of these atmospheric patterns presented a breakpoint since 1980s towards NAO+ and WeMO-. Therefore, this contribution concludes that Andalusia can be divided into three areas based on the WP behaviour: (1) NAO-correlated (WeMO uncorrelated) where WP decreased; (2) NAO and WeMO-correlated, where WP did not change; and (3) WeMO correlated (NAO uncorrelated) where WP increased. Likewise, the extent of those regions mostly is determinate by geographical features. The orography does not allow the enhancement of the WeMO influence across large areas of Andalusia. As a result, WeMOcannot compensate reductions of WP caused by NAO+, which concentrates WP reductions on its windward (most areas of Betic Mountains, where WeMO uncorrelated). Meanwhile, WeMOpromote WP increases on its windward in the Betic Mountains (eastern slopes, south-eastern Andalusia); and coastal areas/Guadalquivir Valley where Mediterranean influence does not find a barrier effect caused by the relief.

A microbial perspective on balancing trade-offs in ecosystem functions in a constructed stormwater wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Greenhouse gases; Denitrification; Methane; Stormwater; Urban ecosystems	NITROGEN REMOVAL; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; WASTE-WATER; DENITRIFICATION; METHANE; CARBON; SOIL; METHANOTROPHS; DYNAMICS; NITRATE	Green stormwater infrastructure, such as constructed wetlands (CWs), is a type of stormwater control measure that can decrease nutrient and pollutant loads from urban stormwater runoff. Wetland soil microorganisms provide nutrient and pollutant removal benefits which can also result in ecosystem disservices such as green-house gas (GHG) emissions and can inadvertently exacerbate climate change. Microbial respiration by facultative anaerobes in anoxic conditions is the primary pathway for nitrogen removal (benefit). Similar anoxic conditions that support denitrifying microorganisms can also support obligate anaerobes that produce methane (CH4) via methanogenesis (disservice). We examined nitrogen removal potential, GHG production, and microbial community structure within permanently flooded and shallow land or temporarily-flooded areas of a stormwater CW to identify zones for CW design optimization. Results indicate that permanently flooded zones compared to shallow land zones are greater sources of CH4 emissions (80.80 +/- 118.31, 2.32 +/- 9.33 mg CH4-C m(-2) h(-1), respectively) and emit more carbon to the atmosphere (7161.27 kg CO2, 93.20 kg CO2 equivalents, respectively). However, nitrogen removal potential rates were similar across both flooded and shallow land zones (24.45 +/- 20.18, 20.29 +/- 15.14 ng N2O-N hr(-1) g(-1) dry soil, respectively). At this particular CW, reduction of permanently flooded zones within the wetland could decrease GHG emissions (disservice) without limiting nitrogen removal (benefit) potential of the wetland. Holistic development and design of stormwater control measures, which account for microbial activity, provides the opportunity to maximize benefits (i.e., nutrient and pollutant removal) and reduce disservices (i.e., GHG emissions) of green stormwater infrastructure.

Here we quantify the pure effect of historical and future climate change on the exposure of land and population to extreme climate impact events using an unprecedentedly large ensemble of harmonized climate impact simulations from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b. Our results indicate that global warming has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population annually exposed to all six categories of extreme events considered: river floods, tropical cyclones, crop failure, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves. Global warming of 2 degrees C relative to preindustrial conditions is projected to lead to a more than fivefold increase in cross-category aggregate exposure globally. Changes in exposure are unevenly distributed, with tropical and subtropical regions facing larger increases than higher latitudes. The largest increases in overall exposure are projected for the population of South Asia. Plain Language Summary Global warming changes the frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of extreme events. We analyze computer simulations of river floods, tropical cyclones, crop failure, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves under past, present-day, and potential future climate conditions. Our results show that global warming increases the number of people around the world that are affected by these events each year, both for all event types combined and each type individually. Changes in the chance of being affected by extreme events are unevenly distributed in space. Particularly large increases are simulated for tropical and subtropical regions.

Owing to the influence of real-time inflow forecast uncertainty, determining an informed operation plan necessitates resolution of the conflict between upstream flood risk, downstream flood risk, and water scarcity risk. This study developed a multiobjective stochastic programming with recourses (MOSP) model to seek robust risk-averse plans under multiple risks. In the proposed approach, inflow forecast errors are modeled and sampled as spatially and temporally correlated stochastic processes using a copula function. The multiobjective stochastic programming is solved using the epsilon constraint method based on explicit formulation of multiple risk objectives with discretized inflow scenarios, and a rolling horizon with recourses for real-time operational updating is modeled to address the dynamic decision-making characteristics. The proposed methodologies were applied to the multireservoir system of the Pi River Basin (China), and comparisons with model results of a traditional coupled simulation and a deterministic single objective optimization model were conducted. Results indicated that capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of forecast uncertainty provides informative forecast support. Moreover, noninferior solutions obtained from MOSP dominate the deterministic optimal solution, which could either conserve 4.86 million m(3) (12%) more water without increase in flood risk, or reduce the upstream flood risk by 3.1% without increase in either water scarcity or downstream flood risk during a typical receding flood. The proposed methodology provides a dynamic decision-making modeling tool that could reduce overall risk and determine a compromise for flood water conservation under uncertainty.

Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Para state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of high-resolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000-2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.

Compound effects correspond to events with multiple concurrent or consecutive drivers, e.g., heavy storms, coastal flooding, high tides, and sea level rise (SLR). There is a recent evidence on inundation caused by SLR-driven groundwater rise, and there is a distinct knowledge gap in understanding the compound inundation effects of this phenomenon considering the important hydrologic and hydraulic considerations under compound events. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a novel analytical framework to understand the movements of the surface flow under typical precipitation events considering their interaction with uprising groundwater and SLR in a coastal watershed located in Oakland Flatlands, CA, USA, home to several disadvantaged communities. This modelling approach simulates the dynamics of compound flooding in two dimensions of the earth surface in a fine resolution, which is critical for devising proper flood management strategies. The reason to focus on disadvantaged coastal communities is that such communities typically encounter disproportionate environmental injustices due to the lack of sufficient drainage capacity in their infrastructure. Our results show that by considering the compound effect of SLR, groundwater inundation and precipitation flooding, the drainage capacity of infrastructure will be substantially exceeded, such that over 700 acres of the built infrastructure could be flooded. This is a considerable increase compared to scenarios that do not consider compound effect, or scenarios that consider inappropriate combinations of driving factors. In sum, our results highlight the significance of considering compound effects in the coastal inundation analyses, with a particular emphasis on the role of groundwater rise.

The shifting position of homeowners in flood resilience: From recipients to key-stakeholders	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						flood protection; flood resilience; flood risk governance; flood risk management; homeowner involvement	RISK-MANAGEMENT; PRIVATE RESPONSIBILITIES; MITIGATION MEASURES; GOVERNANCE; PERCEPTION; ADAPTATION; COPRODUCTION; UNCERTAINTY; EXPERIENCE; DISCOURSE	The academic debate on flood risk governance is paying increased attention to the shifting position of homeowners. Homeowners are increasingly expected to adapt their homes to protect against possible floods. Although an overall agreement seems to exist on the involvement of homeowners in flood risk governance, the academic literature is dispersed in its argumentation on why homeowners should be involved. Therefore, this article provides a coherent overview of the transition from flood protection to flood risk management, and subsequently of the arguments that unfold regarding the shifting position of homeowners within this debate. This overview, based on a systematic review of the academic literature, helps to shed light on the changing role of homeowners in flood risk governance and contributes to categorizing the arguments used in current academic reasoning on homeowner involvement in flood risk governance. We use a conceptual distinction between macro-level and micro-level arguments, and between individual and collective efforts to structure our results. This conceptual overview illustrates the potential gap in convincing homeowners of the urgency to take action, because the connection between the macro-level arguments (i.e., climate change and responsibility) and the micro-level arguments (i.e., minimizing flood damage on privately owned properties) is generally not made. We, therefore, suggest that a stronger coherence in the argumentation would contribute to increase homeowner awareness of their changing responsibilities, which might bring about a future shift toward a new phase in flood risk governance, in which the responsibilities of homeowners are more explicitly acknowledged and integrated into climate adaptation strategies.

Therefore, undertaking risk studies of urban floods, especially the depth prediction of urban flood is very important for urban flood control. In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. Based on this, a regression model to predict the depth of urban flooded areas was constructed with deep learning algorithm, named Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). The flood condition factors used in modeling were rainfall, rainfall duration, peak rainfall, evaporation, land use (the proportion of roads, woodlands, grasslands, water bodies and building), permeability, catchment area, and slope. Based on the rainfall data of different rainfall return periods, flood condition maps were produced using GIS. In addition, the feature importance of these conditioning factors was determined based on the regression model. The results demonstrated that the growth rate of the number and depth of the water accumulation points increased significantly after the rainfall return period of 'once in every two years' in Zhengzhou City, and the flooded areas mainly occurred in the old urban areas and parts of southern Zhengzhou. The relative error of prediction results was 11.52%, which verifies the applicability and validity of the method in the depth prediction of urban floods. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for urban flood control and drainage. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed framework is able to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which coordination among actors and integration among plans reflect infrastructure dependencies in resilience planning. Because resilience planning involves multiple actors and various plans, it is critical that actor coordination and plan integration are consistent with infrastructure dependencies. The absence of an objective evaluation of infrastructure dependencies during the resilience planning process inhibits the formation of integrated plans that reduces the vulnerability to hazards. The proposed metanetwork framework provides quantitative measures to identify missing links in actor coordination and plan integration. The application of the proposed framework is indicated using a case study of Houston in the context of flood resilience planning. Three different regional plans representing infrastructure development, flood control, and environmental conservation are examined to map the Actor-Plan-Task-Infrastructure networks. The results of the analysis reveal that (1) dependencies between flood control and transportation infrastructure systems are not fully considered in the studied plans, which leads to inconsistent plans, policies, and tasks, and (2) the plans do not highlight the required level of coordination among actors to implement them based on the consideration of infrastructure dependencies. The application reveals the capabilities of the proposed framework for modeling Actor-Plan-Task-Infrastructure dependencies and evaluating the gaps in actor coordination and plan integration related to the resilience planning of a dependent infrastructure. The proposed framework not only contributes to the dependency modeling among actor, plan, task, and infrastructure networks but also provides a new means to help stakeholders improve their coordination and plan integration by taking into account infrastructure dependencies in resilience planning.

Analysis of the observed trends in daily extreme precipitation indices in Gaza Strip during 1974-2016	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; extreme precipitation; Gaza Strip; trend analysis	MIDDLE-EAST; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; OSCILLATION; EVENTS; REGION	There is a high-risk attendant on the changes in precipitation in developing countries, for example, Gaza Strip (GS). These changes have far-reaching social and economic ramifications by causing devastating flash floods and droughts. Based on the daily precipitation observations of eight meteorological stations over GS, from 1974 to 2016, the trends of 11 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) were estimated using linear least squares method and then assessed statistically by Mann-Kendall test. The results show that, on average, most of the indices exhibited increasing trends during 1974-2016. It includes total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT), simple daily intensity index (SDII), and max 1-day precipitation (RX1day). Others were the max 5-day precipitation (RX5day), very wet day precipitation (R95p), extremely wet day precipitation (R99p), number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm), number of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm), and the number of consecutive dry days (CDD). Three of these indices passed the significance test (with p < .05): RX1day, RX5day, and R95p. Other EPIs, including number of wet days (R1mm) and consecutive wet days (CWD), exhibited non-significant decreasing trends. Spatially, many stations over GS exhibited opposite trends, especially in R1mm and CDD; however, they are separated by a few kilometres. Moreover, all EPIs have significant positive correlations with PRCPTOT at the 99% confidence level, except CDD (trend was non-significant). The contribution of extreme precipitation to annual PRCPTOT exhibited an increasing trend, which was significant at 62% of GS stations. The study indicates a potential increase in summer (drought) season.

The concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and HCB from this study were compared with results from samples collected in 2009 and 2010 from the same areas. Our results showed that the concentrations of PCBs, DDTs and HCB have increased over time. A large proportion (similar to 68%) of the sampled population accumulated organochlorines contaminants above thresholds over which immunosuppression and reproductive anomalies are known to occur. Results also suggest a general enrichment of some trace elements above natural levels in humpback and snubfin dolphins from the Fitzroy River estuary and Port Curls. Extensive flooding in adjacent catchments is the most likely primary factor responsible for increased distribution and bioavailability of these contaminants into coastal waters. Land-based pollution from the adjacent catchments is an ongoing threat to coastal systems and particularly for top predators such as dolphins in the Great Barrier Reef. Climate change models predict increasing frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events that will impact coastal Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef. Reduction of land-based persistent pollutants into coastal waters of the Great Barrier Reef will be critical for the health and survival of humpback and snubfin dolphins in this region.

The aim of this work was to assess the application of nanotechnologies for the restoration of the water quality in the Cascajo Wetlands, Peru, where the water quality was deteriorated. Ceramic-based bio-filters (CBBFs) were used to reduce and buffer the contamination rates of pollutants, whereas micro-nano bubbles (MNBs) were applied to increase the dissolved oxygen and release free radicals in water. Additionally, bio-fence was implemented to prevent water intrusion from the ocean. Remote sensing data through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was used to monitor the water surface condition. With treatment of CBBFs and MNBs for 13 months, we observed reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphate (TP) in the water body, showing removal percentages of 98.5%, 97.5%, 98.1%, 98.5%, and 94.6%, respectively, in comparison with values before starting the implementation. The trends of NDVI and EVI over seasons are not completely aligned with the results taken from the wetlands treated with MNBs, CBBFs and bio-fence. While TN was highly correlated with the empirical value of TN based on remote sensing, no correlation was observed between COD and empirical COD. The use of eco-friendly techniques has performed efficiently to remove the pollutant.	[Jindo, Keiji] Wageningen Univ & Res, Agrosyst Res Grp, NL-6708PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Sakura, Marino S.

Therefore, there is a need of high spatial and temporal monitoring of precipitation, and further to assess susceptible rainfall-induced debris flow zones in the area. We assessed the rainfall data collected at two gauge stations and observed a significant increase in the rainfall amount over the study region during summer-monsoonal period 1997-2017. Increasing trend was also observed from CRU gridded precipitation dataset. A GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) method was performed by combining topographical, environmental and hydrological parameters for mapping of rainfall-induced susceptible zones. Suitability analysis of precipitation forecasts from WRF model at higher resolution (3 km) was also performed. A good agreement (r = 0.76) was observed between 4-day model forecast and field observed rainfall. Further, the simulated precipitation from WRF was incorporated into GIS model for assessment of debris flow susceptible zones for two cases of heavy precipitation events. The modelled high, medium, low and very low risk susceptible zones identified for the year 2015 events are validated with field survey and pre-post satellite imageries, and found in good agreement (ROC = 76.6%). The model was able to identify affected areas during the Leh cloud burst event in year 2010. In addition, a threshold value of rainfall for initiation of debris flow in the region was also reported.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Active Perirheic Zone in a Natural Wetland Floodplain	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						perirheic zone; integrated hydrological modelling; floodplain water; river water; hydraulic mixing-cell; hydrogeosphere	ATCHAFALAYA RIVER-BASIN; WATER; FLOW; GROUNDWATER; PERFORMANCE; BASEFLOW; DENITRIFICATION; HYDROCHEMISTRY; SIMULATIONS; CATCHMENT	The ecologically and biogeochemically significant perirheic zone is a part of the floodplain where waters originating from both the river and adjacent floodplain are present. In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the active perirheic zone, that is, river and floodplain waters and their transient mixing extent. This is achieved by using the Hydraulic Mixing-Cell method, a complement to a fully integrated surface-subsurface hydrological model, in the Biebrza catchment, northeast Poland. The model performance is verified against hydrological and hydrochemical data sets. The simulations show that overbank flooding river water is unable to penetrate deeply into the floodplain due to the presence of floodplain water. However, the active perirheic zone moves toward the floodplain and back within a buffer of at least 1 km from its initial position located approximately 0 to 2.5 km from the Biebrza River. The active perirheic zone is also present further away from the river due to the discharge of tributaries and surface runoff. The active perirheic zone exhibits multidirectional movement and can reappear in different places after a period of time. Effectively, during the flooding period, the active perirheic zone moves over 38% of the floodplain area, while the maximum daily extent is 24% of the floodplain. These dynamics imply that biogeochemical processes related to the perirheic zone, for example, denitrification, also vary in space and time. Due to the strong correlation of the perirheic zone extent with the meteorologically dependent variables, especially the snowmelt water extent, it is vulnerable to climate change.

Geomorphic, sedimentary and hydraulic reconstruction of a glacial lake outburst flood in northern Alberta, Canada	BOREAS			English	Article							LAURENTIDE-ICE-SHEET; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SASKATCHEWAN; DEPOSITS; MICHIGAN; AGASSIZ; ORIGIN; DEGLACIATION; JOKULHLAUPS; ENTRAINMENT	Glacial lake outburst floods occurred frequently during the last deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Within the Interior Plains, these floods carved large spillway systems; however, due to a lack of abundant sediment, deposits within prairie spillways are rarely preserved. Here, we present geomorphic and sedimentary evidence and hydraulic modelling of the eastern Beaver River Spillway, formed by the catastrophic drainage of the ice-dammed glacial Lake Algar, in north central Alberta. During this flood, coarse-grained sediment eroded from local till formed large pendant bars. Within the first ~50 km of the spillway (Reach 1), pendant bars contain downstream orientated foresets overlain by horizontally bedded coarser gravels. The remaining pendant bars (Reach 2), present downflow of a moraine barrier, differ, comprising massive, matrix-supported, inversely graded gravels capped by a boulder layer. We use a HEC-GeoRAS/HEC-RAS system in conjunction with palaeostage indicators to estimate the steady-state water surface elevation. Modelling results show that peak discharge within Reach 1 of the eastern Beaver River Spillway was approximately 14 000-21 000 m(3) s(-1). For Reach 2, 30 km downstream, the peak discharge was estimated at 23 000-40 000 m(3) s(-1) (n(bulked) 18 000-26 000 m(3) s(-1)). The downstream discharge increase, consistent with the sedimentary change in pendant bar deposits, is attributed to sediment bulking of the flood flow. This provides the opportunity to observe a range of flow conditions, and associated sedimentology, from a single flood event. The reconstructed flow conditions, coupled with lake volume estimates from the ponding above the moraine barrier suggest a minimum flow duration of 3-5 days.

Challenges in forecasting such events are uncertainties in meteorological input variables, the accurate estimation of snow cover and deficits in process understanding during runoff formation. Here, we evaluate the potential of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF IFS) to forecast RoS disposition (i.e., minimum rainfall amounts, initial snow cover, and meltwater contribution) several days ahead. We thereby evaluate forecasts of rain and snowfall with disdrometer observations and show that ensemble-based forecasts have larger potential than the high-resolution forecast of ECMWF IFS. Then, we use ECMWF IFS weather forecasts as input to a conceptual hydrological model, which is calibrated using estimates of snow-covered area (SCA), snow water equivalent (SWE), and discharge observations. We show that the forecast skill of this model chain is reasonably high with respect to SCA and SWE, even several days ahead. However, a number of RoS events are missed in the forecast, mainly due to an underestimation of rainfall amounts. These misses can be reduced by lowering the rainfall amount threshold for the forecast as compared to the analysis, being accompanied by only a moderate increase in false alarm rates. In contrast, the forecast of RoS disposition is found to be less sensitive to thresholds of initial snow cover and meltwater contribution. We conclude that valuable disposition warnings for RoS events can be issued several days ahead, and we illustrate this idea with a case study.

While vegetation is directly changed by fire events, animals are often indirectly affected through changes in habitat and food availability. Globally, fire frequency and the extent of fires are predicted to increase in the future. The impact of fire on the biodiversity of temperate wetlands has gained little attention so far. We compared species richness and abundance of plants and birds in burnt and unburnt areas in the Amur floodplain/Russian Far East in the year of fire and 1 year after. We also analysed vegetation recovery in relation to time since fire over a period of 18 years. Plant species richness was higher in burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. This suggests that fire has a positive short-term effect on plant diversity. Bird species richness and abundance were lower on burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. Over a period of 18 years, high fire frequency led to an increase in herb cover and a decrease in grass cover. We show that the effects on biodiversity are taxon- and species-specific. Fire management strategies in temperate wetlands should consider fire frequency as a key driving force of vegetation structure, with carry-over effects on higher trophic levels. Designing fire refuges, i.e., areas that do not burn annually, might locally be necessary to maintain high species richness.

J	Zhang, YJ; Fu, L; Meng, CC; Zhang, L; Xu, YL				Zhang, Yujing; Fu, Liang; Meng, Chunchun; Zhang, Lei; Xu, Yinlong			Projected changes in extreme precipitation events over China in the 21st century using PRECIS	CLIMATE RESEARCH			English	Article						Extreme precipitation events; China; Representative Concentration Pathway; Climate change; PRECIS	REGIONAL CLIMATE; EAST-ASIA; FUTURE CHANGES; CMIP5; TEMPERATURE; MULTIMODEL; SIMULATION; MODEL; SCENARIOS; INDEXES	This study evaluates possible spatial and temporal changes in precipitation extremes over China under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios using the regional climate model system 'Provide Regional Climates for Impacts Studies' (PRECIS), driven with HadGEM2-ES. The extreme precipitation indices applied are consecutive dry days (CDDs), simple daily precipitation intensity index (SDII), maximum consecutive 5 d precipitation (RX5D) and total precipitation amount on extremely wet days (R95P). PRECIS can satisfactorily reproduce the spatial distribution of extreme precipitation indices compared to the observed data. By the end of the 21st century, CDD and SDII are projected to increase under all RCP scenarios in southern China, and R95P and RX5D are projected to increase under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, which indicates the possible increasing risks of prolonged dry spells and heightened floods in these regions. In northern China, CDDs are expected to decrease, while other indices are expected to increase in the future, implying a decrease in the risk of prolonged drought periods and an increase in flood risk; this pattern is most prominent over northwestern China. For the temporal evolution of the extreme precipitation indices, the change rates are most significant under the RCP8.5 scenario. Compared to present-day levels, from low to high emission scenarios, CDDs would decrease by similar to 1-10%, SDII would increase by similar to 6-14 %, R95P would increase by similar to 9-21 %, and RX5D would increase by similar to 6-26%, respectively, suggesting that dry extremes would be alleviated, while wet extremes would become more pronounced in general over China toward the end of the 21st century.

This study aims to provide an analysis of future rainfall patterns and flood occurrences specifically for the Kelantan River Basin which is identified as one of flood prone areas in Malaysia. The study area was divided into five regions of the Kelantan River Basin, - Kota Bharu (Northern), Kuala Krai (Center), Pos Lebir (Southeastern), Pos Hua (Southwestern) and Pos Gob (Northwestern). The historical rainfall data (1986-2019) was then retrieved from the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD) based on the five regions. The statistical approach was applied to downscaled climate model data from the CanESM2 GCM forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5. The reliability assessment using a Cronbach's Alpha, Linear Regression and Pearson Correlation results show that local climates (2006-2019) forced by RCP4.5 have a similar trend to historical rainfall within the same period. The spatial analysis outcomes showed that the northeastern region of the Kelantan River Basin received its highest average annual rainfall (5,000 mm) in 1990 and caused severe flooding in the area. However, there is a significant change of rainfall pattern in all regions, with a steady increase in annual rainfall in the southwestern region (2021-2100).

How to quantitatively portray the spatiotemporal characteristics of the exposed population to multi-hazards in the LECZ is an important subject of risk reduction. In this study, the overall characteristics, spatial patterns, and main impact hazard in the LECZ from 1990 to 2020 were investigated using a multi-hazard population exposure model, spatial autocorrelation method, and principal component analysis (PCA) method. The results show that among the four hazards (earthquake, tropical cyclones (TCs), flood, and storm surge), TCs cover the largest area, accounting for 90.1% of the total LECZ area. TCs were also the hazard with the largest average annual growth rate of the exposed population (2.36%). The central region of China's LECZ is the cluster of exposed populations and the main distribution area with the largest increase in exposed populations. Therefore, the central region is a hotspot for multi-hazard risk management. Additionally, flood contributes the most to the multi-hazard population exposure index; thus, flood is a key hazard of concern in the LECZ. This study identifies the hotspot areas and priority hazards of multi-hazard exposed populations in the LECZ and provides important policy recommendations for multi-hazard risk management in the LECZ, which is important for LECZ to enhance the resilience of hazards.

ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article; Early Access						Adaptation; Protection; Relocation; Sea level rise	RETREAT; COSTS	Sea level rise (SLR) due to climate change poses a serious threat to human populations in coastal areas. As a result, assessing the impacts of SLR and evaluating potential adaptations is essential. This study assesses the impacts of SLR and ocean tides on coastal Japanese prefectures by estimating the extent of potentially inundated areas, affected populations, and economic damages. The latest climate scenarios, tidal data, and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) are used to estimate the SLR and its inundation effects at a resolution of 1 km. Economic damages are estimated following the methods outlined in the "Manual for economic evaluation of flood control investment (draft)." It was found that all impacts (inundated areas, affected populations, and economic damages) under RCP2.6-SSP1 are significantly smaller than those under RCP8.5-SSP5, suggesting the importance of mitigation efforts. In addition, the study evaluates the cost and effectiveness of protection and relocation adaptations using data on the cost of constructing dikes and the cost of relocating houses and infrastructure. While relocations due to SLR have not yet been undertaken in Japan, the relocation costs could be estimated based on the conventional scheme of community relocation for natural disasters such as life-threatening floods and tsunamis caused by major earthquakes. It was found that the costs of relocation can exceed those of protection under the current framework of Japanese relocation policies.

Moreover, they are expected to increase in frequency, and this will exacerbate their impact on vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. But how farmers could adapt to extreme weather events by adopting different conservation practices has received slight attention in the literature. This study examines how farmers' perceptions of drought and flooding influence their decisions to implement conservation practices in their conventional crop fields. Out of the 350 farmer responses we received, fewer than half indicated a likelihood to adopt no-tillage/reduced tillage (43%), cover crops (40%), crop diversification (37%), and integrated crop-livestock grazing (29%). Using this data and a multivariate probit modeling framework, we show that farmers' decisions can be partly explained by their perception of drought but not by their perception of flooding. Specifically, the perceived number of drought years significantly increases the likelihood of adopting no-tillage/reduced tillage and diversified cropping in the future. However, the number of drought years is not significantly associated with the use of cover crops and integrated crop-livestock grazing. These results suggest that the effects of extreme weather events on adoption of conservation practices as adaptive measures vary across different practices. Therefore, adaptation policies that make use of conservation practices must be tailored to farmers' needs and priorities to be effective.

In Australia, these global shocks followed a series of localized climate-induced crises from forest fires, floods and drought. There is a pressing need to increase our understanding of ways to strengthen the resilience of agri-food systems to multiple shocks and stresses that co-occur or follow on each other. The aims of this study in Melbourne, Australia, were to investigate how forest fire and pandemic shocks affected the agri-food system, to identify vulnerabilities in the system, and to explore opportunities to build resilience to future shocks and stresses. MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted during 2020-21 with 41 key stakeholders from government, industry and civil society organizations. Results and discussionVulnerabilities identified in agri-food supply chains included geographic and corporate concentration, complex "just in time" supply chains, critical infrastructure and logistics, and workforce availability. Strategies identified to build the resilience of agri-food systems include increasing the diversity of supply chains, decentralization, collaboration throughout agri-food supply chains, and ensuring sustainable livelihoods. ConclusionOur study highlights the cascading effects of multiple shocks and stresses on agri-food systems, and the need for greater policy focus on transformative actions that build the resilience of agri-food systems to any future shock, and that counter the cumulative effects of underlying environmental stresses.

Assessing and ranking the vulnerability of those assets can provide insights that support planning and projects that can reduce those vulnerabilities. In this study, we develop a quantitative, data-drive framework for calculating a sea level rise vulnerability score, using publicly available spatial data, for 111,239 parcels in Puget Sound, Washington State, USA. Notably, our approach incorporates an assessment of coastal erosion, as well as coastal flooding, in an evaluation of the exposure of each parcel, and impacts to habitats are quantified alongside impacts to existing infrastructure. The results suggest that sea level rise vulnerability in Puget Sound is widely distributed, but the overall distribution of scores is heavily skewed, suggesting that adaptation actions directed at a relatively small number of parcels could yield significant reductions in vulnerability. The results are also coupled with a concurrently developed social vulnerability index, which provides additional insight regarding those people and places that may be predisposed to adverse impacts from SLR-related hazards. We find that the proposed approach offers advantages in terms of advancing equitable SLR-related risk reduction, but also that the results should be carefully interpreted considering embedded assumptions and data limitations.

Existing studies mainly focused on typhoon disaster prevention and reduction by examining the impact of the public's trust on risk perception. However, these studies overlooked the influence of government ability, even though government plays an important role in disaster management. Therefore, this study takes Ningbo, China as an example to analyze the impact of trust on risk perception and explore the role of government ability on the referred relationship. High school students are taken as the research targets as they are vulnerable but important in typhoon disaster mitigation, which may have been overlooked in existing studies. Regression is used to examine these relationships. The findings of this study are as follows. First, students' trust in meteorological departments, expert institutions, and government agencies positively impact economic, personal, and environmental risk perception. Second, government ability negatively moderates the relationships between students' trust in meteorological departments and expert institutions and all types of risk perception. Moreover, it only has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between students' trust in government agencies and economic risk perception. The study reveals the moderating role of government ability between trust and risk perception and provides references for further study on the relationship between trust and risk perception.

In response to environmental changes, communities reconfigure their abilities by reshaping their everyday lives for sustainability and survival. This study's main objective is to examine how social capital was utilized by selected community members of Brgy. San Antonio and Brgy. Tagumpay in Bay, Laguna, Philippines as a form of adaptation to flooding. Households from Purok 6 of Brgy. San Antonio and Brgy. Tagumpay were selected through purposive sampling and complete enumeration, respectively. Utilization of the means of association at 0.05% level of significance showed that specific socio-demographic variables had a direct association with social capital resources within the community. The adaptive capacity of the participants was strengthened through relationships with their support system and their active participation in group/ association activities. For attachment to neighborhood, the variable that had the most significant relationship with most of the socio-demographic characteristics was the strengthening of the spirit of collective community through the existence of formal and informal organizations. Access to resources and services helped to enhance the adaptive capacity of the community members. Adaptability became more apparent when financial and social services were within one's reach. The closeness of relationships between neighbors helped to strengthen their adaptive capacity. In community relationships, trustworthiness was considered as the most significant value. It is recommended that social capital be strengthened to enhance adaptive capacity.

They can pose a risk of inundation to a human habitat but can also be utilized as a resource with hydraulic engineering. Improving the knowledge of flood characteristics is the basis and premise of improving water resources management and ecological environmental protection. Presently, the quantitative evaluation of flood characteristics needs to gradually evolve from a single indicator to a systematic one. In this paper, by introducing the concepts of ecohydrology on magnitude, frequency, and duration, a set of flood characteristics indicators evaluation system is constructed based on the hydrological characteristics for the section where Danjiangkou Reservoir is located at the middle reach of the Yangtze in China. The results showed that the Danjiangkou Reservoir has changed the flood characteristics to a great extent both of seasonal or annual floods, and the mean degree of the flood characteristic alteration indicators is about 19%. The changing trend of the flood indicators upstream showed an increasing trend from the 1970s to 2010s, while downstream were divided into two periods by the year of about 1975. The methodological system provided by this paper can effectively evaluate flood characteristics quantitatively, provide technical guidance and a useful reference for flood process analysis, and provide support for flood management and river ecosystem protection.

In the last decades, these events result in forthcoming losses of life and damages to private and public properties and criticalities increase due to very often increasing losses as consequence of changes in the rainfall regimes as well as the increase in average temperatures. This paper describes an applied hydrogeological risk assessment methodology carried out as part of an interdisciplinary European project between France and Italy (Interreg Alcotra ARTACLIM). We developed a practical framework to assess the risk of urban settlements and infrastructural assets within a sub-regional area of Piedmont (north-west of Italy). Past and future climate drivers are here analyzed using high-resolution data to highlight the temporal and spatial distribution of elements under threat. Using geographic information systems, we elaborate climate and socioeconomic data to develop an effective procedure for a sub-regional integrated research on the intrinsic and external conditions of potential instability. The results of the analyses produce a geo-localized risk score that can be used to rank assets in a screening process that aims to assist urban planner and local policymaker to prioritize the adaptation measures required for taking action to reduce hydrogeological damages to their assets.

In order to reduce the potential of climate-induced flooding risks, it is necessary to reconstruct or upgrade the existing levees. Flood risk management aims to reduce the probability of floods and their potential adverse effects on the population, economy, and environment. This paper presents the novel application of reliability analysis for risk ranking in the Otok Virje-Brezje levee reconstruction project in the Republic of Croatia. To identify, verify and analyse key risks, a group of 35 experts, who were directly involved in the levee reconstruction project or have extensive experience in similar projects, was selected. An Analytic network process (ANP) was used for group multi criteria decision-making. Quantitative and qualitative approaches to risk analysis were combined. Different experts from the various organisations may have diverse interests and goals. The geometric mean method was chosen to reach group consensus. The resources that will be allocated to the risk responses are proportional to the risk exposures. To analyse the reliability of the group consensus-reaching method a determination of the risk ranking probability matrix is proposed by using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Different decision-making approaches are proposed for cases in which consensus is not reached with satisfactory reliability.

The water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake has recently decreased considerably in China However, their variation characteristics and major driving factors remained unclear. In this study, Mann Kendall trend and Pettitt abrupt tests were employed to determine the changes of time series. Double mass curve analysis and regression analysis were used for the qualitative analysis of the impacts of climate change and human activity. Results revealed that precipitation change trends significantly decreased in autumn. The water discharge at the trunk Yangtze River had a decreasing trend in autumn and an increasing trend in winter. The annual and seasonal water discharge diverting from the Yangtze River to the Dongting Lake, except at Xinjiangkou in summer, exhibited significant downward trends. No consistent trends in precipitation and water discharge were identified, thereby indicating that the seasonal relationships between them had been disturbed by human activities. Human activities had a dominant effect on the water discharge exchange between them during 1967-2018. Along with the intensification of human activities, the hydrological connectivity between the Yangtze River and the Dongting Lake would probably be further changed in the near future.	[Li, Y.

Flow intermittency influences the trophic base, but not the overall diversity of alpine stream food webs	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article						allochthonous; glacier; high altitude ecosystem; macroinvertebrates; organic matter; stable isotopes	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHAIN LENGTH; LEAF-LITTER; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; FLOODPLAIN; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; LONG; COMMUNITIES	Alpine streams can exhibit naturally high levels of flow intermittency. However, how flow intermittency in alpine streams affects ecosystem functions such as food web trophic structure is virtually unknown. Here, we characterized the trophic diversity of aquatic food webs in 28 headwater streams of the Val Roseg, a glacierized alpine catchment. We compared stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) trophic indices to high temporal resolution data on flow intermittency. Overall trophic diversity, food chain length and diversity of basal resource use did not differ to a large extent across streams. In contrast, gradient and mixing model analysis indicated that primary consumers assimilated proportionally more periphyton and less allochthonous organic matter in more intermittent streams. Higher coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) C:N ratios were an additional driver of changes in macroinvertebrate diets. These results indicate that the trophic base of stream food webs shifts away from terrestrial organic matter to autochthonous organic matter as flow intermittency increases, most likely due to reduced CPOM conditioning in dry streams. This study highlights the significant, yet gradual shifts in ecosystem function that occur as streamflow becomes more intermittent in alpine streams. As alpine streams become more intermittent, identifying which functional changes occur via gradual as opposed to threshold responses is likely to be vitally important to their management and conservation.

We investigated effects of microtopography on hydrology, phenol oxidase activity (POX) and nutrient availability in a freshwater forested wetland of coastal North Carolina. Water table depth (WTD) was measured from September 2012 to August 2013. Ion exchange probes were used to measure nutrient concentrations prior to soil sample collection in August 2013. WTD fluctuated seasonally with maximum and minimum WTD resulting in 92% (September 2012) to 8% (June 2013) of the site in flooded and non-flooded conditions, respectively. Hummocks had greater POX activity (12 +/- 2.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) compared to hollows (4 +/- 0.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and greater concentrations of potassium and sulfur, but lower concentrations of calcium, iron, zinc, boron, and lead. POX was negatively correlated with soil water content. Higher enzyme activity in hummocks likely drives greater rates of carbon and nutrient cycling compared to hollows, consistent with observations that hummocks are hotspots for CO2 fluxes. Microtopography altered site-level hydrologic conditions, phenol oxidase activity and nutrient availability with important implications for understanding carbon and nutrient cycling in forested wetlands and response to changes in hydrology.

However, quantitative knowledge about vulnerability reduction via private precautionary measures is scarce and their effects are hardly considered in loss modeling and risk assessments. However, this is a prerequisite to enable temporally dynamic flood damage and risk modeling, and thus the evaluation of risk management and adaptation strategies. To quantify the average reduction in vulnerability of residential buildings via private precaution empirical vulnerability data (n = 948) is used. Households with and without precautionary measures undertaken before the flood event are classified into treatment and nontreatment groups and matched. Postmatching regression is used to quantify the treatment effect. Additionally, we test state-of-the-art flood loss models regarding their capability to capture this difference in vulnerability. The estimated average treatment effect of implementing private precaution is between 11 and 15 thousand EUR per household, confirming the significant effectiveness of private precautionary measures in reducing flood vulnerability. From all tested flood loss models, the expert Bayesian network-based model BN-FLEMOps and the rule-based loss model FLEMOps perform best in capturing the difference in vulnerability due to private precaution. Thus, the use of such loss models is suggested for flood risk assessments to effectively support evaluations and decision making for adaptable flood risk management.

However, for over a century, Central Asian river systems have been severely affected by dam regulation, water withdrawals for large-scale irrigated agriculture, and deforestation. To support sustainable use and protection of this threatened forest type, we provide information on the distribution and degradation status of Tugai wetlands in the Syr Darya floodplain using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from Landsat 7 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). An accuracy assessment confirmed the validity of the MODIS-based wetland map, with an overall accuracy of 78.6%. This was considerably better than the Landsat product, mainly due to the greater temporal frequency of the MODIS time series. We further calculated trends and breakpoints between 2001 and 2016 using the BFAST algorithm. We found negative trends for nearly a third of the wetlands. Breakpoint detection showed major stress events in the years 2001, 2009, and 2016. Our study revealed the temporal and spatial distribution and vitality of an endangered forest ecosystem that has rarely been studied thus far. Climate change may accelerate the destabilization of the Tugai forests at the Syr Darya floodplain.

A multi-index (grain size, end-member model, and geochemistry elements) approach of core sediments from the upper Yellow River was used to reconstruct its flood history. A high-resolution geochemical profile of the 20.71-m-deep core was obtained by an XRF core scanner. A comparison of sediment grain size with geochemical element ratios indicated that ln(Zr/Ti) can be used as a grain size proxy for the core sediment. Combined with the end-member modeling analysis, the flood energy index (FEI) was constructed to highlight the flood signals and their similar trends with sediment ln(Zr/Ti). Coarsened grain size and increased ln(Zr/Ti) suggested that a high-frequency flood phase appeared to occur in the early Holocene (11-6.5 ka) and late Holocene (3.5-0 ka), while low-frequency floods occurred in the middle Holocene (6.5-3.5 ka). An extreme hydrological phase occurred during 5.8 ka-5.9 ka, which coincided with a sharp increase in sedimentation rates from 0.14 mm/yr to 0.48 mm/yr. The flood activities at the upper reach of the Yellow River are considered to respond to climate variability with the monsoonal shift.

Surprisingly, anthropogenic activities have increased atmospheric CO2 by 50% in less than 200 years, causing more frequent and severe rainfall, snowstorms, flash floods, droughts, heat waves, and rising sea levels in recent times. Hence, reducing the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is imperative to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 & DEG;C. Among many CO2 mitigation approaches, CO2 capture using porous materials is considered one of the most promising technologies. Porous solid materials such as carbons, silica, zeolites, hollow fibers, and alumina have been widely investigated in CO2 capture technologies. Interestingly, porous silica-based materials have recently emerged as excellent candidates for CO2 capture technologies due to their unique properties, including high surface area, pore volume, easy surface functionalization, excellent thermal, and mechanical stability, and low cost. Therefore, this review comprehensively covers major CO2 capture processes and their pros and cons, selecting a suitable sorbent, use of liquid amines, and highlights the recent progress of various porous silica materials, including amine-functionalized silica, their reaction mechanisms and synthesis processes. Moreover, CO2 adsorption capacities, gas selectivity, reusability, current challenges, and future directions of porous silica materials have also been discussed.

J	Das, S; Islam, AMT				Das, Samiran; Islam, Abu Reza Md Towfiqul			Assessment of temporal changes in frequency characteristics of annual maximum rainfall of daily duration over Bangladesh	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTIONS; OF-INFLUENCE APPROACH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION CONCENTRATION; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; NON-STATIONARITY; MANN-KENDALL; RIVER-BASIN; TRENDS; VARIABILITY	Understanding the changes in the frequency characteristics of extreme rainfall can lead to building an appropriate frequency model which ultimately plays a pivotal role in assessing flood risk. However, little attention is invested into the temporal changes of frequency characteristics of extreme rainfall in a monsoon dominated region like Bangladesh. This study assesses the temporal change in extreme rainfall frequency behaviour using a number of methods in an innovative way based on annual maximum rainfall data of 1-day duration over Bangladesh. The probable teleconnection of extremes with large-scale climate indices is also examined. Results suggested that the extreme rainfall data can be aptly described by the generalised extreme value distribution. The trend analysis shows interesting results: over 60% of stations show significant trends in all the three parameters; amongst them, about 75% show significant negative trends of location parameter which lead to decrease in the mean of extremes, while about 62% show unbounded trends of shape parameter which direct the increase of quantiles at the high return period. The correlations with climate indices show that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation has more influence on rainfall extremes than Indian Ocean Dipole; however, the outcome is inconclusive. Overall, majority of the stations display significant variation of frequency behaviour over time and non-stationary frequency analysis could be an option in estimating the extremes.

However, the explanatory power of index-based approaches and subjective selection of vulnerability factors are still in dispute. This study aims to introduce a stochastic coastal vulnerability model and assess its skill in characterizing and preserving simultaneous information about various comprising factors. Two common coastal vulnerability indices, Additive Coastal Vulnerability Index and Multiplicative Coastal Vulnerability Index are formed, and then their performances are compared to the proposed Probabilistic Coastal Vulnerability Index (PCVI) for the coastal counties of South Carolina. PCVI is developed based on the joint-probability analysis of vulnerability factors using copula functions, which makes it capable of preserving the importance of multivariate information, and in turn, forms a more informative index. The performance of indices is benchmarked against post-hazard flood maps and the cost of fatalities from Hurricane Florence (2018) and Hurricane Matthew (2016). The PCVI revealed more accurate results in terms of explaining the importance of vulnerability associated with biophysical and socio-economic factors. The capability of PCVI to preserve multivariate vulnerability information offers a more pragmatic approach to reflect the exposure and adaptive capacity of coastal communities facing coastal hazards.

Anthropogenic factors associated with insufficient water resource management can be another cause. Among natural causes, rainfall intensity and volume often induce flooding. Therefore, accurate rainfall estimation and prediction can prevent and mitigate damage caused by these hazards. Sadly, uncertainties often hinder accurate rainfall forecasting. This study investigates the uncertainty of the Korean rainfall ensemble prediction data and runoff analysis model in order to enhance reliability and improve prediction. The objectives of this study include: (i) evaluating the spatial characteristics and applicability of limited area ensemble prediction system (LENS) data; (ii) understanding uncertainty using parameter correction and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and grid-based rainfall-runoff model (GRM); (iii) evaluating models before and after LENS-GRM correction. In this study, data from the Wicheon Basin was used. The informal likelihood (R2, NSE, PBIAS) and formal likelihood (log-normal) were used to evaluate model applicability. The results confirmed that uncertainty of the behavioral model exists using the likelihood threshold when applying the runoff model to rainfall forecasting data. Accordingly, this method is expected to enable more reliable flood prediction by reducing the uncertainties of the rainfall ensemble data and the runoff model when selecting the behavioral model for the user's uncertainty analysis. It also provides a basis for flood prediction studies that apply rainfall and geographical characteristics for rainfall-runoff uncertainty analysis.

Multiple drivers can amplify each other and lead to greater impacts than when they occur in isolation. A better understanding of the interdependence between flood drivers would facilitate a more accurate assessment of compound flood risk in coastal regions. This study employed the D-Flow Flexible Mesh model to simulate the historical peak coastal water level, consisting of the storm surge, astronomical tide, and relative sea level rise (RSLR), in Shanghai over the period 1961-2018. It then applies a copula-based methodology to calculate the joint probability of peak water level and rainfall during historical tropical cyclones (TCs) and to calculate the marginal contribution of each driver. The results indicate that the astronomical tide is the leading driver of peak water level, followed by the contribution of the storm surge. In the longer term, the RSLR has significantly amplified the peak water level. This study investigates the dependency of compound flood events in Shanghai on multiple drivers, which helps us to better understand compound floods and provides scientific references for flood risk management and for further studies. The framework developed in this study could be applied to other coastal cities that face the same constraint of unavailable water level records.

Consistent with recent acquisitions in the Tiber Valley, we identify a Bronze Age (4500-3000 yr BP) paleogeographic setting characterized by the lowering of the drainage network base level. This would have created a dry alluvial plain, suitable for human settlement. We also find evidence for dramatic overflooding which occurred during the 6th century BCE and was responsible for the rapid rise from 2 to 6 m a.s.l. of the valley floors within the Tiber catchment basin in Rome. We suggest that these paleogeographic features can be identified in mythical and ethno-historical accounts of early Rome. Besides providing insights into the paleolandscape and anthmpogenic interventions in the Murcia Valley, these previously unrecognized hydrological dynamics may attest to paleoclimatic fluctuation that have occurred since 5000 yr BP. Contrary to the dry and cold conditions prevalent during the Bronze through the Iron Age, the exceptional flooding events of the archaic period suggest a shift in climatic trends. However, tectonic and anthropogenic factors could have also had a combined and cumulative effect, requiring detailed paleoenvironmental and palaeolandscape studies.

In this study, we present a general framework that measures urbanization-induced variation in hourly extreme wet season precipitation (April-October) from 1985 to 2012, with reference to a dynamic urban-rural station classification based on annual changes in urban extent. We found that urbanization in south China (<29 degrees N) brings more extreme precipitation to urban areas than to suburbs, and reduces extreme precipitation continually over urban areas in parts of the north and northeast. Over 60% of provincial capital cities show significant changes in extreme precipitation due to urbanization, including smaller size cities separated from large urban clusters. Urbanization enhances extreme precipitation mainly in the local main part of the rainy season, which refers to May in the south (e.g. urban-rural differences of 0.70 mm h(-1) in Guangzhou) and July-September in the central and north (1.16 mm h(-1) in August of Beijing). Urbanization also increases hourly extreme precipitation at peak times in diurnal cycles. The results indicate that urbanization has caused overall more and more heterogeneous spatial patterns over China and concentrated distributions during the rainy season and peak time. These patterns warrant attention when assessing the risk of increased waterlogging and flash flooding in urban areas.

The model enabled us to control the distribution of commodities among different consumers whose demand cannot be fully met. Incorporating time-variance in the model allowed for evaluating the time evolution of the functional level of the infrastructure systems and quantifying their resilience. As a demonstration of the model's capability, the network model was coupled with a raster-based hydraulic flooding model in the way of Monte Carlo simulations. It was then used to investigate the cascading effects of flood-related failures of individual infrastructure assets on the performance of the critical infrastructure systems of a coastal community under different flooding scenarios and future climate impacts. The coupled modelling framework is essential for correctly assessing the interdependences and cascading effects in the infrastructure systems in the case of flood hazards. While in the considered example, the extent of inundation becomes less severe with a changing climate, the risk to infrastructure does not recede because of the cascading effects. This behaviour could not be captured by the flood model alone.

The current study examined precipitation on a monthly, seasonal, and annual scale at varying amplitudes. Moreover, the Mann-Kendall and Sen Innovatiove trend analysis (ITA) approaches are used to examine precipitation variations. This study aims to evaluate the Mann-Kendall and Sen Innovative Trend Analysis techniques to understand better how they apply to the topic under consideration. Overall, 84.16% of testing months showed trendless precipitation based on the MK trend test. Comparatively, the ITA monthly analysis showed statistically significant variation in 80% months and 88% considerable rate in seasonal perspective over the entire study regions. The research recognized that the Sen Innovative trend test outperforms the Mann-Kendall analysis in a range of circumstances. First of all, Sen Approach has simple assumptions, and the study of skewed distributions with fewer data could apply. Another benefit of using the ITA was that all data sets could be viewed on a graph, making it easier to see patterns and interpret the trends. Thus, the research recommends that the Sen Trend Method (ITA) analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation patterns to facilitate water resource scheduling and establish natural disaster strategies in the future.

Wood is a renewable resource, and engineered wood products are proving to be competitive against concrete and steel while having several advantages. However, while the renewable nature of wood in construction is a beneficial property for climate mitigation policies, the process of biodegradation introduces a challenge for service life planning. A review of hazard mapping is presented while developing contemporary hazard maps, occurrence maps and projected hazard maps for 2050 using representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. The risk of timber decay is expected to increase in most of Europe as the temperatures rise, with a decrease expected in dryer regions. Termites are likely to experience a range expansion as more areas become suitable, while human activity and an increase in extreme weather events like floods are expected to facilitate dispersion. Marine borer species already present a risk in most European coastal regions; however, the effect of changes in water temperatures are likely to shift the boundaries for individual borer species. Overall, warmer climates are expected to increase the metabolic activity of all of these organisms leading to a general reduction in service life.

These events include times of marine and non-marine extinctions, major ocean-anoxic events, continental flood-basalt eruptions, sea-level fluctuations, global pulses of intraplate magmatism, and times of changes in seafloor-spreading rates and plate reorganizations. The aggregate of all 89 events shows ten clusters in the last 260 Myr, spaced at an average interval of similar to 26.9 Myr, and Fourier analysis of the data yields a spectral peak at 27.5 Myr at the >= 96% confidence level. A shorter period of similar to 8.9 Myr may also be significant in modulating the timing of geologic events. Our results suggest that global geologic events are generally correlated, and seem to come in pulses with an underlying similar to 27.5-Myr cycle. These cyclic pulses of tectonics and climate change may be the result of geophysical processes related to the dynamics of plate tectonics and mantle plumes, or might alternatively be paced by astronomical cycles associated with the Earth's motions in the Solar System and the Galaxy.

Effects of Sulfur Dioxide Exposure on Leaf Mass per Area of Selected Gymnosperms and Implications for Interpreting the Plant Fossil Record	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						sulfur dioxide; mass extinctions; plants; fossil record; leaf mass per area	TRIASSIC-JURASSIC BOUNDARY; FLOOD-BASALT ERUPTIONS; ATLANTIC MAGMATIC PROVINCE; GRASS POPULATIONS; POLLUTED AREAS; TRIASSIC/JURASSIC BOUNDARY; STOMATAL DENSITY; VOLCANIC TRIGGER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WINTER BARLEY	Premise of research. The role of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in plant responses to large igneous province volcanism is difficult to determine but important in relation to understanding ecosystem responses during mass extinction events. Leaf mass per area (LMA) is an important leaf measure for tracking plant responses to environmental pressures in the fossil record, but how it responds to SO2 exposure is unclear, particularly for nonangiosperm taxa. Methodology. Five gymnosperm species were grown in simulated paleoatmospheric conditions that included SO2 to determine how the plants responded. Pivotal results. All plants' growth in high SO2 showed a significant decrease in LMA compared with the control (with no SO2). When grown in a high CO2, low O-2, and high SO2 treatment, most plants continued to show a decrease in LMA compared with the control but an increase compared with the high SO2 treatment with ambient CO2 and O-2. Conclusions. These findings suggest that exposure to SO2 significantly decreases LMA, potentially reducing preservation potential in the fossil record. Exposure to combined SO2 and high CO2 reduces this effect, but this may also obscure the effects of SO2, leading to interpretations that ecosystem instability is primarily driven by increasing CO2, which may not be the case.

The growing drought and flood risks that increase despite the taken measures have led to the adoption of an integrated understanding on the topic of water management in recent years. To manage the increased risk of drought and to make sustainable planning, the dimensions of drought should be known first. For this purpose, many drought indices have been developed. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which determined by remote sensing, are two of these. In this study, in which the agricultural drought was analyzed with vegetation indices by taking into consideration the historical drought archive, the Asi Basin was addressed. The data of the Asi Basin, which covers an area of 7800 km(2) and was obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellites, was used in this study. With the satellites benefited in remote sensing and with the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE), where the layers of vegetation were determined, agricultural and forest areas were evaluated separately. The vegetation indices, which change with the increase in temperature, have revealed the necessity of a long-term drought management for the Asi Basin. Result of the work pointed that NDVI index is more appropriated to the Asi Basin than the VCI index to monitor drought.

Existing structures can be many years old and changes in rainfall patterns due to global warming might not have been considered in their original design. While correctly designed culverts can effectively drain water during high-intensity rainfall events, poorly designed or outdated structures could cause upstream flooding resulting in costly damage and losses. Hydraulic improvements to prepare existing culverts for greater discharge rates could be a favorable alternative to rebuilding every failing structure. Modern design guidelines calculate the performance for inlet and outlet controlled flows on the basis of established hydraulic theories. After calculating the headwater levels for both flow controls, the inferior one is then chosen, based on the assumption that the culvert will operate in its least efficient state. Flow improvements could be made by enforcing the better performing option. Outlet control can be ensured by raising the tailwater levels as high as the outlet thereby utilizing the entire cross-sectional area of the culvert. It was found that, in some cases, an enforced outlet control enables culverts to perform better than operation under inlet control. However, only smooth and short culverts with high losses at the inlet were identified as benefiting from this approach and many existing structures could be improved by better inlet designs.

The number of approved flood insurance policies and insurance claims were used to calculate loss frequency. Loss severity was estimated using flood damage ratio map that was developed by applying the equation calculating damage ratio of detached house according to flood depth to flood inundation map. Analysis results of flood insurance rate for Ulsan City, the percentage of area that flood insurance rate was less than 0.02% was 96.51%, over than 0.02% and less than 0.04% was 0.04%, over than 0.04% and less than 0.06% was 0.75%, over than 0.06% and less than 0.08% was 1.03%, and over than 0.08% was 0.53%. In particular, low lying districts near Dong Stream located in western region of Buk-gu have the highest insurance rate ranging in from 0.06 to 0.08. The low lying area near estuary of Hoeya River, Cheongryang Stream, and upstream of Taehwa River in Ulju-gun have higher insurance rate ranging in from 0.04 to 0.08. Flood insurance rate of most area in Ulsan City was calculated to be less than 0.02, which is less than existing uniform insurance rate executed by Korean government.

However, sparse gauging and irregular measurement constrain the vulnerability assessments of floods and landslides, which rely highly on the accuracy of precipitation. Therefore, this study evaluates the performance of Satellite-based Precipitation Products (SPPs) in the Himalayas region by comparing different datasets and identifying the best alternative of gauge-based precipitation for hydro-meteorological applications. We compared eight SPPs using statistical metrics and then used the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique to rank them. Secondly, we assessed the hydrological utility of SPPs by simulating them through the GR4J hydrological model. We found a high POD (0.60-0.80) for all SPPs except CHIRPS and PERSIANN; however, a high CC (0.20-0.40) only for CHIRPS, IMERG_Final, and CMORPH. Based on MCDM, CMORPH and IMERG_Final rank first and second. While SPPs could not simulate daily discharge (NSE < 0.28), they performed better for monthly streamflow (NSE > 0.54). Overall, this study recommends CMORPH and IMERG_Final and improves the understanding of data quality to better manage hydrological disasters in the data-sparse Himalayas. This study framework can also be used in other Himalayan regions to systematically rank and identify the most suitable datasets for hydro-meteorological applications.

Tree-based models were applied to the comprehensive numerical database of Pearson et al. (J. Geophys. Res. Oceans. 122, 10099-10117) to identify the essential predictor parameters for runup in coral-reef environments and classify different runup regimes on which a set of runup formulae was developed. It was found that, wave conditions, reef roughness, and reef-flat length are generally crucial for predicting runup, while the importance of forereef and beach slopes depends on the relative reef submergence (reef submergence normalized by off-reef wave height). The forereef slope is more important than the beach slope when waves mainly break over the forereef at low relative reef submergences but less important when waves mainly break over the reef flat and the beach at middle and high relative reef submergences. The proposed formula set was validated against data from laboratory and field coral reefs, which implies that the formula set has the potential for fast prediction of runup along coral-reef islands at broad scales for flooding assessment.

Therefore, it is important for relevant government agencies to effectively respond to both extreme climate conditions and their impacts by providing more efficient asset management strategies. Although international research projects on water-sensitive urban design and rural drainage design have provided partial solutions to this problem, road networks commonly serve unique combinations of urban-rural residential and undeveloped areas; these areas often have diverse hydrology, geology, and climates. Resultantly, applying a one-size-fits-all solution to asset management is ineffective. This paper focuses on data-driven flood modelling that can be used to mitigate or prevent floodwater-related damage in Western Australia. In particular, a holistic and coherent view of data-driven asset management is presented and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used to define the high-risk hotspots for asset damage in Western Australia. These state-wide hotspots are validated using road closure data obtained from the relevant government agency. The proposed approach offers important insights with regard to factors influencing the risk of damage in the stormwater management system.

Landsystem analysis of a tropical moraine-dammed supraglacial lake, Llaca Lake, Cordillera Blanca, Peru	BOREAS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROGLACIAL LAKE; OUTBURST FLOOD; EVEREST REGION; GLACIAL LANDSYSTEM; PROCESS CHAIN; ICE; ANDES; WATER; RECONSTRUCTION	Tropical glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru are rapidly thinning and retreating as a result of climate warming. The retreat of these glaciers along narrow linear bedrock valleys has increased the number and size of moraine-dammed glacial lakes formed in the valleys. This study aims to identify the geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics of an enlarging moraine-dammed supraglacial lake (Llaca Lake) in the Cordillera Blanca. Field-based sedimentological observations and geomorphological mapping were combined with remotely sensed data and a photogrammetric model derived from aerial surveys by an uncrewed aerial vehicle to identify landform-sediment assemblages. The geomorphological and sedimentological characteristics of Llaca Lake are synthesized into three landsystem zones: Zone 1: distal portions of Llaca Lake and the latero-frontal moraine; Zone 2: the central zone of ice-cored hummocks; and Zone 3: the active glacier margin. These zones are differentiated based on the spatial distribution of landforms, sediments, and active geomorphological processes. This is the first study to describe the landform-sediment assemblages in a tropical moraine-dammed supraglacial lake system and provides a framework for further landsystem element analysis of these growing supraglacial lakes in rapidly deglaciating high-altitude environments.

To accurately predict the depth and duration of the flood, a coupled model of the extreme gradient boosting and long short-term memory algorithms was proposed. A practical application of three representative flooded points in the Zhengzhou city, China, the results showed the coupled model could fit and forecast the flood. The average of Mean relative error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and Qualified rate of validation data were 9.13%, 0.96 and 90.3% respectively, which verified the superiority of the method in the flood prediction. And the flood processes at the flooded points caused by design rainfall under different return periods were predicted by the coupled model. The growth rates of the flood duration and peak flood depth were all the highest during the return periods 1a-2a. This study proves that the coupled model has great potential in predictions of flood and could provide scientific basis guidance for disaster reduction.

Here, we investigate natural (e.g., rainfall, snow accumulation/melt, soil moisture) and anthropogenic drivers (e.g., deforestation, urbanization, and management practices) of these events using a range of ground-based data and satellite observations. These drivers can range from exceptionally extreme rainfall intensities, to cascades of several extreme and moderate events, and various anthropogenic interventions that exacerbated flooding. Our results reveal strong compounding impacts of natural drivers and anthropogenic triggers in escalating flood risks to unprecedented levels. We argue that a new form of floods, i.e. anthropogenic floods, is becoming more common and should be recognized during the "Anthropocene ". This specific form of floods refers to high to extreme streamflow/runoff events that are primarily caused, or largely exacerbated, by anthropogenic drivers. We demonstrate how the growing risk of anthropogenic floods can be assessed using a wide range of climatic and non-climatic satellite and in-situ data.

Satellite-Based Nowcasting of West African Mesoscale Storms Has Skill at up to 4-h Lead Time	WEATHER AND FORECASTING			English	Article						Cloud tracking; Satellite observations; Mesoscale systems; Africa; Nowcasting	RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; CONVECTION	The ability to predict heavy rain and floods in Africa is urgently needed to reduce the socioeconomic costs of these events and increase resilience as climate changes. Numerical weather prediction in this region is challenging, and attention is being drawn to observationally based methods of providing short-term nowcasts (up to similar to 6-h lead time). In this paper a freely available nowcasting package, pySTEPS, is used to assess the potential to provide nowcasts of satellite-derived convective rain rate for West Africa. By analyzing a large number of nowcasts, we demonstrate that a simple approach of "optical flow" can have useful skill at 2-h lead time on a 10-km scale and 4-h lead time at larger scales (200 km). A diurnal variation in nowcast skill is observed, with the worst-performing nowcasts being those that are initialized at 1500 UTC. Comparison with existing nowcasts is presented. Such nowcasts, if implemented operationally, would be expected to have significant benefits. Significance StatementA freely available, easy-to-use nowcasting package has been applied to satellite-retrieved rainfall rates for West Africa, and extrapolations have useful skill at up to 4 h of lead time.

Particularly notable are the embracement of flood risk management (FRM) and comparative analysis of flood risk governance (FRG), meaning the complex institutional arrangements that shape the behavior of state and societal actors concerning FRM. Thousands of publications have addressed these themes, and this field of study is ripe for a systematic analysis that consolidates and structures this rapidly evolving literature. This study employed a bibliometric methodology to analyze the metadata (including authorship, keywords, abstracts, and citations) of 3059 such publications. The results reveal that both FRM and FRG scholarship have expanded over the past two decades; the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are the most prominent countries of origin, a small number of prolific authors stands out as major contributors, and a relatively small number of journals dominate as publication venues. The text mining results reveal that the bodies of FRM and FRG scholarship are highly correlated but yet differ in core subject matter, as demonstrated by the unique keywords found in the analysis. The findings are useful for researchers seeking relevant clusters for study and therefore offers reference value for future research and practice.

The Role of Intensifying Precipitation on Coastal River Flooding and Compound River-Storm Surge Events, Northeast Gulf of Mexico	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						coastal flooding; compound event; climate change; coastal hydrology; ENSO; Gulf of Mexico	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; MARINE TRANSITION; DISCHARGE; TRENDS; TIME; PATTERNS; RAINFALL	Destructive coastal floods are commonly increasing in frequency and may be caused by global precipitation intensification. Such connections through climate, watershed, and river processes are poorly understood because of complex interactions in transitional fluvial-marine environments where flooding is caused by rivers, marine storm surge, or both in compound events. To better understand river floods along the fluvial-marine transition, we study watersheds of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico using long-term observations. Results show intensifying precipitation decreased precipitation-discharge lag times, increasing river-flood frequency and the likelihood of compound events in fluvial-marine transitions. This reduction in lag time occurred when the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and El Nino Southern Oscillation began strongly affecting river discharge through the advection of moist air, intensifying precipitation. Along the fluvial-marine transition, compound events were largest in inland reaches. However, for inland reaches, compound event water levels did not exceed the floods caused solely by river flooding, the largest flood hazard in these systems. Our results demonstrate precipitation and river discharge play critical roles in coastal flooding and will likely escalate flooding as the climate continues to warm and intensify precipitation.

To understand individual flood risk within this changing climate, local community resiliency and infrastructure impacts must also be considered. Past research has attempted to capture this but has faced several limitations. This study provides a nation-wide model of community flooding impacts within the United States currently and in 30 years through the use of high-resolution input data (parcel-level), multi-source flood hazard information (four major flood types), multi-return period hazard information (six return periods), operational threshold integration, and future-facing projections. Impacts are quantified here as the level of flooding relative to operational thresholds. This study finds that over the next 30 years, millions of additional properties will be impacted, as aspects of risk are expected to increase for residential properties by 10%, roads by 3%, commercial properties by 7%, critical infrastructure facilities by 6%, and social infrastructure facilities by 9%. Additionally, certain counties and cities persistently display impact patterns. A high-resolution model capturing aspects of flood risk as related to community infrastructure is important for an understanding of overall community risk.

J	Blondin, S				Blondin, Suzy			Staying despite disaster risks: Place attachment, voluntary immobility and adaptation in Tajikistan's Pamir Mountains	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Place attachment; Voluntary immobility; Adaptive capacity; Pamirs; Tajikistan	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MIGRATION; COMMUNITY; MOBILITY; ENVIRONMENT; RESILIENCE; MOVEMENT; IDENTITY	Individuals threatened by environmental risks may choose migration as a survival or adaptation strategy. However, various factors such as attachment to place may encourage immobility despite disaster risks. Since the collapse of the USSR, residents of Tajikistan's Pamir Mountains have faced significant political and socioeconomic difficulties and been exposed to environmental hazards such as floods, rockslides, landslides, and avalanches. These hazards put human security, infrastructure, food security, and accessibility to mountainous areas at risk and call into question aspirations to remain. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the Bartang Valley, this article addresses immobility in a context of changes and risks. The concept of place attachment is used to explore people-place relationships, voluntary immobility and in-situ adaptation. Results show that place attachment is shaped by cultural, socioeconomic, ecological, and historical variables and that the relationship between place attachment and mobility is complex. The strong place attachment of the Bartangis influences immobility aspirations, short-distance displacements, and return after international out-migration. Findings suggest a mutually reinforcing relation between place attachment, immobility aspirations, and adaptive capacity to disasters, which points to a need for more attention to voluntary immobility and people-place relationships within environmental mobilities research.

Detectable anthropogenic changes in daily-scale circulations driving summer rainfall shifts over eastern China	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						circulation pattern; southern flood-northern drought; anthropogenic influence; dynamic and thermodynamic contribution	SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; MONSOON; ATTRIBUTION; WEATHER; CMIP5; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE	Wetting in the south while drying in the north during the last few decades constitutes the well-known 'southern flood-northern drought' (SFND) precipitation pattern over eastern China. The fingerprint of anthropogenic influence on this dipole pattern of regional precipitation trends has not been confirmed, especially for forced changes in relevant dynamics at the synoptic scale. Using a process-based approach involving model experiments both with and without anthropogenic inputs, it is demonstrated that the occurrences of daily circulation patterns (CPs) governing precipitation over eastern China during 1961-2013 have been altered by human influence. Due to anthropogenic forcing, CPs favoring SFND have become more likely to occur at the expense of CPs unfavorable to SFND. Regression analysis shows that changes recorded in the occurrence of CPs from the factual simulations could explain a large part of the precipitation trends over eastern China. CP frequencies driven by purely natural forcing do not reproduce this dipole pattern nor the inferred magnitude of precipitation trends over eastern China. These results suggest that human influence has played a critical role in shaping the contrasting north-south precipitation trends.

Intense extreme hydro-climatic events take a toll on society	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Letter						Extreme rainfall; Flood; Water governance; Climate change	FLOOD	In March 2019, the Iranian meteorological organization warned of the formation of several dense precipitation systems throughout the country. This was followed by a chain of storm events that ended up with three major floods with heavy damages, including at least 78 fatalities. Reportedly, within the first 48 h of the storm, the cumulative rainfall reached about 400 mm. Soon after, 23 provinces of Iran received a severe storm warning and an imminent flood alert as the second wave of rainfall was forming in the region. What was striking about these events was that, according to the historical data, the local rainfall rarely caused such extreme floods, indicating the dominant role of human alteration to natural cycles in these damaging flood events. Extreme hydro-climatic events are unavoidable, yet damages by such events are, to some extent, preventable. With proper, efficient, and timely decision making, the threat of natural hazards can be reduced or avoided. On the other hand, hasty and short-sighted decisions can be costly in the face of a natural catastrophe. This study evaluates the 2019 flood events in Iran and assesses the potential causes that amplified the damages, in search for clues to prevent future flood losses.

Most coastal populations live in subsiding areas and experience average rates of relative sea-level rise three to four times faster than due to climate change alone, indicating the need for policy to address subsidence. Climate-induced sea-level rise and vertical land movements, including natural and human-induced subsidence in sedimentary coastal lowlands, combine to change relative sea levels around the world's coasts. Although this affects local rates of sea-level rise, assessments of the coastal impacts of subsidence are lacking on a global scale. Here, we quantify global-mean relative sea-level rise to be 2.5 mm yr(-1) over the past two decades. However, as coastal inhabitants are preferentially located in subsiding locations, they experience an average relative sea-level rise up to four times faster at 7.8 to 9.9 mm yr(-1). These results indicate that the impacts and adaptation needs are much higher than reported global sea-level rise measurements suggest. In particular, human-induced subsidence in and surrounding coastal cities can be rapidly reduced with appropriate policy for groundwater utilization and drainage. Such policy would offer substantial and rapid benefits to reduce growth of coastal flood exposure due to relative sea-level rise.

For cities such as Mombasa, the problems will be further compounded by high prevalence of informal economies and settlements superimposed on western style governance systems. Yet, right from colonisation to the present day, the water supply and sewage systems have been characterised by a series of inequalities in access. This review paper, discusses the water and sanitation backlogs in the coastal city of Mombasa, tracing them from the colonial times to the post colonial period. Against this background, we overview the current situation of the water and sanitation sector in the city and discuss possible sustainable interventions. We argue that any analysis of the water and sanitation challenges must consider the motive of the development of the infrastructure during the colonial times. We conclude that sustainable water and sanitation services are likely to remain a mirage unless the issues of funding, cost recovery, data availability and overall governance are fully addressed. A good understanding of both historical inadequacies and current investments would help in designing sustainable interventions going forward.

To date, most flood vulnerability research has focused on one type of flood, such as a pluvial or fluvial flood. However, cities can suffer from urban flooding for several reasons, such as precipitation and river levee overtopping. Therefore, a vulnerability assessment considering different types of floods (pluvial floods, fluvial floods, and compound flooding induced by both rainfall and river overtopping) was conducted in this study. First, a coupled urban flood model, considering both overland and sewer network flow, was developed using the storm water management model (SWMM) and LISFLOOD-FP model to simulate the different types of flood and applied to Lishui, China. Then, the results of the flood modeling were combined with a vulnerability curve to obtain the potential impact of flooding on different land-use classes. The results indicated that different types of floods could have different influence areas and result in various degrees of flood vulnerability for different land-use classes. The results also suggest that urban flood vulnerability can be underestimated due to a lack of consideration of the full flood-induced factors.

In the current scenario, studies must be conducted to verify the possible environmental impacts and production viability in order to determine sites most suitable for installing hydroelectric units. A process was developed to identify potential sites to install hydroelectric units using geotechnology, considering morphometric analysis of watershed obtained using python scripts, PLpgSQL, and R. This process enabled the generation of multiple regression models for flow estimates, flooded areas, and estimates of the hydropower potential of the region. From the 3899 points analyzed, 3477 points showed potential for run of river hydroelectricity-generating plants (production up to 3 MW) and 48 points showed potential for small hydroelectric plants (SHPs; production between 3 MW and 30 MW). The limiting factors were assessed by using the intersect geoprocessing tool, where points that intersected with excluding factors, such as environmental or infrastructure elements, were excluded from the analysis. In addition, an efficiency coefficient was established for the SHPs by correlating potential and flooded areas, demonstrating the best points for the implementation of SHP, and considering the potential impacts of the reservoir.

Most work in this direction theorises co-production as an 'iterative and interactive' process between climate service providers and users, with success measured mainly in terms of the usefulness and usability of the information product for the user. But notwithstanding these first important steps, this perspective paper argues that the current study of climate service co-production is too narrowly framed, and fails to properly engage with the broad and rich literature that conceives of co-production processes in a diversity of ways. The authors suggest a fresh look on co-production as a process best examined simultaneously from several complimentary perspectives, with reference to recent work reconceptualising co-production as an eight-sided 'prism'. Using an illustrative example of climate services developed to predict and visualise future flooding in the municipality of Voss, in Norway, the paper demonstrates how this prism concept of co-production can enable a more comprehensive view on co-production as a multi-faceted phenomenon, improve mutual understanding among actors and, ultimately, help design climate services that are better tailored for climate change responses in particular contexts.

J	Silva, RF; Marques, R; Zêzere, JL				Silva, Rui Fagundes; Marques, Rui; Zezere, Jose Luis			Spatial distribution, temporal trends and impact of landslides on Sao Miguel Island from 1900 to 2020 based on an analysis of the Azores historical natural hazards database	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Landslides; Rainfall; NATHA database; Sao Miguel Island; Azores	ERUPTIVE HISTORY; VOLCANO; INVENTORY; PORTUGAL; RAINFALL; ARCHIVES; NORTH; CHINA; FLOOD; TOOL	Landslides are the most frequent type of natural hazard in the Azores archipelago, primarily due to the volcanic nature and geomorphologic features of the islands. The NATHA (Natural Hazards in Azores) database is a repository of documents reporting those natural disaster events that have occurred on the Azores since their settlement in the mid-fifteenth century. This work presents and explores the landslide events that have occurred on Sao Miguel Island in the period 1900-2020. A total of 236 landslide events were catalogued. The temporal distribution of the landslide events reveals a higher concentration of events after 1996, which is related to a change in the rainfall regime but also to the increasing dissemination of information. The influence of climate change on landslide occurrence is demonstrated for the first time in the Azores. The landslide events catalogued in the NATHA database were responsible for 82 fatalities, 41 injuries and 305 people made homeless, while 66 buildings were partially or completely destroyed. The spatial distribution of landslide events shows that Povoacao is the municipality most prone to landslide occurrence as well as to landslide impact. Rainfall was the triggering factor of most landslide events (70%) on Sao Miguel Island, and landslide events have been most frequent during the wettest months of the year from November to March. The obtained results demonstrate the need of landslides prevention and preparedness programs in specific areas of Sao Miguel Island.

Aquatic macrophytes can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and their reproductive fragments are spread in various ways (e.g. by water). Although these plants are obviously exposed to hydrological changes, the degree of vulnerability may depend on the types of their reproduction and distribution, as well as the hydrological differences of habitats. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of the cosmopolitan macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum in hydrologically different aquatic habitats, i.e. rivers and backwaters separated from the main river bed to a different extent. For this purpose, the first microsatellite primer set was developed for this species. Using 10 developed primer pairs, a high level of genetic variation was explored in C. demersum populations. Overall, more than 80% of the loci were found to be polymorphic, a total of 46 different multilocus genotypes and 18 private alleles were detected in the 63 individuals examined. The results demonstrated that microsatellite polymorphism in this species depends on habitat hydrology. The greatest genetic variability was revealed in populations of rivers, where flowing water provides constant longitudinal connections with distant habitats. The populations of the hydrologically isolated backwaters showed the lowest microsatellite polymorphism, while plants from an oxbow occasionally flooded by the main river had medium genetic diversity. The results highlight that in contrast to species that spread independently of water flow or among hydrologically isolated water bodies, macrophytes with exclusive or dominant hydrochory may be most severely affected by habitat fragmentation, for example due to climate change.

Evidence from Pakistan	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Armed conflict; Political trust; Disaster relief; Floods; Pakistan; Watan card	NATURAL DISASTERS; STATE; TERROR; LONG; WAR; CONSEQUENCES; PREFERENCES; ENGAGEMENT; REPRESSION; DROUGHT	Climate change and violent conflict present two of the most substantial barriers to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Many of the countries bearing the greatest impacts of a changing climate also grapple with protracted armed conflict. Despite this, we still have limited knowledge about how political and environmental insecurities affect trust in the institutions that are responsible for disaster management, security and conflict resolution. In this paper we explore whether being exposed to violent armed conflict is associated with low levels of political trust, and whether this can be mitigated by state action. Relying on a household survey covering some 2000 rural households in Pakistan, we investigate how state disaster response shaped trust in conflict-affected contexts in the years following the severe flooding of 2010. Our study suggest that negative implications of violence exposure on political trust can be offset by disaster relief efforts by the state, but only in instances when the government is not involved in the violent activities. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the joint impact of conflict and disasters on political trust, and importantly shows that in some instances, government interventions in a different political domain can reduce negative consequences of armed conflict on trust. Understanding the interplay of compound risks in contexts where multiple risks are occurring simultaneously is crucial because without adequate, coordinated government action, it will be impossible to protect the lives, health and livelihoods of affected people in Pakistan and beyond.

A decision framework for potential dam site selection using GIS, MIF and TOPSIS in Ulhas river basin, India	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Dam site selection; Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); Geographic information system (GIS); MIF; TOPSIS; Sensitivity analysis	ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; MODELING OPTIMUM SITES; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; TAMIL-NADU; WATER; DELINEATION; MANAGEMENT; DISTRICT; ZONES; GOVERNANCE	The Ulhas River Basin, India has been severely impacted by climate change, frequent rainfall, and an ineffective drainage system in recent years, resulting in flooding. To alleviate flood and water scarcity issues, constructing dams in suitable locations is a crucial water management strategy. In this study, potentiality of sites for dam construction have been evaluated by integrating spatial analytical Multi Influencing Factor (MIF), and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Twelve climatic, geophysical, and accessibility factors were considered to delineate the dam site suitability. The dam site selection suitability map produced using the weighted overlay to delineate the suitability zones as 5 distinct classes "very high (15.36%)," "high (27.90%)," "moderate (25.74%)," "low (22.05%)" and "very low (8.95%). Total five suitable locations for dams have been recommended based on MIF and TOPSIS evaluation. Based on their maximum storage capacity, width, height, and cost, Dam E was given the highest ranking followed by Dam - C, A, B, and D, respectively. The majority of the chosen locations for dam construction were situated in the elevated and gently sloping eastern portion of the Ulhas River Basin. The ROC curve's AUC value was computed to be 0.806, indicating that the model's performance was "good" and suitability map exhibited a strong correlation with the available dam data. This study provides decision-makers with an inexpensive and useful tool to eliminate less suitable sites and concentrate on those with fewer limitations for constructing dams, resulting in valuable insights.

Safer this way: Identifying flooded roads for facilitating mobility during floods	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Floods; Radar; Urban mobility; Situational awareness; Emergency response; Alert systems	WARNING SYSTEM; ACCESSIBILITY; IMPACTS; MODEL; YORK	Severe storms and associated flooding pose a significant risk to urban mobility. Consequently, 40 to 63% of flood-related deaths are linked to roadway-related incidents in developed countries. The dynamic nature of flooding and the lack of real-time information make it challenging to sense flooding and its impact on roadways. Hence, existing state-of-the-art methods fall short of providing a robust, reliable, and affordable tool to facilitate situational awareness during storms. Such a tool is indispensable to aid emergency response, especially considering the potential increase in risk to flood exposure due to climate change and other factors. This study addresses this need by providing an open-source framework that couples real-time rainfall data, a physics-based flood model, and network and spatial analyses to sense real-time flood impact on the road transportation system. Case studies using three recent storms in Houston, Texas demonstrate the framework's ability to provide vehicle-class specific roadway conditions for even minor roads and residential streets-a problem existing approaches struggle with. Aside from road-link conditions, the framework can also estimate network-level flood impacts, such as identifying regions without access to critical facilities like hospitals, giving decision-makers a more holistic view of network performance. Further, the framework is interoperable with existing situational awareness tools and could augment their ability to sense road conditions during flooding. Finally, the proposed framework can equip flood-prone communities and emergency responders with reliable and accessible situational awareness content using open-source tools and data to promote safer mobility during flooding-a key goal of intelligent transportation systems.

There are many types of droughts, among which socioeconomic drought can directly affect socioeconomics. Due to population growth and increasing water demand, socioeconomic drought has become increasingly important. The socioeconomic drought index (SEDI) provides a good framework for analyzing socioeconomic droughts, but it has some deficiencies such as ignoring watershed resilience. This study sought to improve the SEDI framework through adding water resources system resilience index (WRSRI) and run theory to the original SEDI method. Such improvement can help to identify the start and end times of socioeconomic drought events (SEDEs) more accurately. Taking the East River Basin (ERB) as the study area, socioeconomic drought characteristics from 1954 to 2014 were evaluated using the improved SEDI method and bivariate copula models. First, an improved SEDI method was used to identify SEDEs over the past 60 years, which could perform better in identifying drought than the original one. The variable distribution was more continuous after improvement, so that the copula model could be used for comprehensive drought assessment in the ERB. There was a large difference between the univariate and bivariate return periods. Comparing SEDEs with hydrological droughts and socioeconomic data, we concluded that although hydrological drought was the main cause of socioeconomic drought, the two were not completely synchronized. In the ERB, severe SEDEs could lead to economic slowdown, while minor water deficit events could hardly affect the socioeconomic development.

It is thus critical to provide possibilistic scheduling schemes that simultaneously involve emergency evacuation and relief allocation. But the existing literature seldom takes emergency evacuation and relief supplies as a joint consideration, nor do they explore the impact of an unpredictable flood disaster on the scheduling scheme. A multi-stage stochastic programming model with updating information is constructed in this study, which considers the uncertainty of supply and demand, road network, and multiple types of emergency reliefs and vehicles. In addition, a fuzzy algorithm based on the objective weighting of two-dimensional Euclidean distance is introduced, through moderating an effect analysis of the fuzzy number. Computational results show that humanitarian equity for allocating medical supplies in the fourth period under the medium and heavy flood is about 100%, which has the same as the value of daily and medical supplies within the first and third period in the heavy scenarios. Based on verifying the applicability and rationality of the model and method, the result also presents that the severity of the flood and the fairness of resources is not a simple cause-and-effect relationship, and the consideration of survivor is not the only factor for humanitarian rescue with multi-period. Specifically, paying more attention to a trade-off analysis between the survival probability, the timeliness, and the fairness of humanitarian service is essential. The work provides a reasonable scheme for updating information and responding to sudden natural disasters flexibly and efficiently.

We assess the importance of sea-level rise and future weather pattern changes on UK coastal flood impacts. Historical weather pattern classifications are matched with the observed skew surges and significant wave heights. Coastal-risk weather patterns are then defined as >= 1% of events in the distribution exceeding the local warning threshold. We combine this methodology with projections of sea-level rise and weather pattern frequency occurrences, to determine the relative importance of each on future coastal risk. A deep low-pressure system situated to the west of Ireland (WP29) has the highest probability (6.3%) of exceeding Newlyn's present-day warning threshold; this is projected to increase under climate change to 46.2% by 2050 under RCP2.6. This work found that weather patterns associated with storm surges are increasing and decreasing in frequency; a synoptic situation causing windy conditions in the north of the UK (WP23) will increase by > 40% under RCP8.5 by the end of the century (2079-2090). When combining the impact of sea-level rise and changing frequency of weather patterns, this study found that sea-level rise dominates future coastal risk and is highly linked to the future emission scenarios. The need for successful adaptation, such as coastal defence improvements and early warning systems, will become even more important under the higher emission pathway. The most significant increases in coastal risk are found along the east coast, through the English Channel to the north Devon coastline.

Typically, an event attribution study focuses on one individual extreme event that has just occurred. Studies rarely examine human influence on multiple extreme events in different times of the past. Here we conduct a comprehensive attribution analysis on the four heaviest precipitation events in the Yangtze River Valley during the past 100 years. We start by defining extreme precipitation events as the heaviest precipitation over a fixed size area that is of direct relevance to flood preparedness and management. When examining the events over the historical time, we allow the precise location of the area to change in different years. By definition, four extremely strong events are identified, and they happened in the summer of 1931, 1954, 1998 and 2020. We find that the impacts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols (AAs) on these events show clear difference in different time period. The impacts were negligible in the early period and became more and more discernible since the late 20th century. The GHGs have gradually increased the occurrence probability of extreme precipitaiton while the AAs have decreased the occurrence of extrem precipitation. These competing effects from the GHGs and AAs have led to a slight and then gradually increasing human influence on extreme precipitation over time. GHGs have exerted a larger influence on short-duration precipitation events while AAs have had a larger influence on monthly mean precipitation. The more extreme the precipitation event, the clearer the anthropogenic influence.

The aim of this review is to outline expected changes in soil biological activity by discussing the combined effects of salt stress and flooding on plants productivity and soil microbial communities, which determine consequences on fluxes of C, N and P. Finally, it outlines the expected repercussions on greenhouse gases emissions. The prediction of outcomes is made difficult by the concomitant and sometimes contrasting actions of flooding and seawater intrusion on partly acclimated and non-acclimated environments. Non-salt acclimated plants suffer from osmotic stress, but also from reduced O-2 solubility. Microbial biomass declines with increasing salinity and microbial communities shift in composition. Large concentrations of Cl- inhibit nitrification, but salinity stimulates N2O fluxes. Impacts on C mineralisation rates is variable but enhanced by the larger availability of terminal electron acceptors. The reduction of Fe combined with that of SO4 (2-) could enhance P mobility. Salinization affects methanogenesis which is constrained in favour of SO4 (2-) reduction. Consequences are largely site specific and difficult to predict because of the complex network of processes occurring simultaneously in different compartments (i.e., soil, microbiome, vegetation). The distinction between short and long term effects is also important. A reliable prediction of outcomes at a planetary scale will only result from more precise inventories and monitoring of areas displaying specific similarities and from the implementation from these well-defined data sets of specifically devised models whose results can be finally combined on a weighted basis.

Existing studies have focused on coupling the hydrological model with optimization methods, but little is known about the effects of the spatial discretization of the model on the optimization results. In this study, the scale effects were examined in a case study in Guangzhou, China. Four models at various spatial discretization levels, namely models R1, R2, R3, and R4, with an average unit size of 0.022*10(4), 0.405*10(4), 2.43*10(4), and 4.865*104 m(2), respectively, were constructed to investigate the performance difference caused by delineation scales. The results show that the highest-resolution model R1 (one unit represented one type of land cover) provides more cost-effective layout schemes, but during a heavy rainstorm, the solution set provided by a coarser model are very similar to that generated by the finest model R1. A coarser model can provide wider solution sets, but most of these schemes overshadow some types of LID practices such rain garden and bio-retention cell, which also have a critical role in urban heat mitigation, air quality improvement, and so on. Due to the cumbersome work of catchment subdividing and time-consuming optimization process, a coarse model would be a good substitute to a large area. These findings provide new insights on how to achieve better performance by subdividing the catchment at a proper scale when optimizing the spatial layout of LID practices.

In the FANFAR project, a pre-operational flood early warning system (FEWS) for western Africa was co-designed in workshops with 50-60 stakeholders from 17 countries, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). We aimed at (i) designing a FEWS with western African stakeholders using MCDA and (ii) evaluating participatory MCDA as a transdisciplinary process. To achieve the first aim (i), we used MCDA methods for problem structuring and preference elicitation in workshops. Problem structuring included stakeholder analysis, creating 10 objectives to be achieved by the FANFAR FEWS and designing 11 possible FEWS configurations. Experts predicted FEWS configuration performance, which we integrated with stakeholder preferences. We tested MCDA results in sensitivity analyses. Three FEWSs showed good performance, despite uncertainty, and were robust across different preferences. For stakeholders it was most important that the FEWS produces accurate, clear, timely, and accessible flood risk information. To achieve the second aim (ii), we clustered common characteristics of collaborative governance frameworks from the sustainability science and transdisciplinary literature. Our framework emphasizes issues crucial to the earth systems sciences, such as uncertainty and integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. MCDA can address both well. Other strengths of MCDA are co-producing knowledge with stakeholders and providing a consistent methodology with unambiguous, shared results. Participatory MCDA including problem structuring can contribute to co-designing a project but does not achieve later phases of transdisciplinary processes well, such as co-disseminating and evaluating results. We encourage colleagues to use MCDA and the proposed framework for evaluating transdisciplinary hydrology research that engages with stakeholders and society.

SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Rohingya; refugee adolescents; Bangladesh; environmental risks; climate change; Cox's Bazar; adolescent capabilities	COXS BAZAR; REFUGEE CRISIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; CAPABILITIES; JUSTICE; STRESSORS; FRAMEWORK; CHILDREN	Integration of environmental, economic, and social approaches to development is crucial to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Global evidence reflects that this integration is often imbalanced, with development policies and programs in many low- and middle-income countries placing greater emphasis on economic needs than environmental vulnerabilities. Drawing on qualitative research undertaken in mid-2021, this article explores how limited integration of environmental, economic, and social aspects has affected the development of Rohingya refugee adolescents who were forcibly displaced from Myanmar to the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh. Cox's Bazar is one of the most climate-vulnerable areas in Bangladesh and is subject to extreme rainfall, landslides, and flash floods. The article highlights the ways in which Rohingya adolescents are highly vulnerable to both the direct and indirect consequences of these environmental conditions due to poverty, and inadequate housing infrastructure and water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. It discusses the ways in which these environmental challenges intersect with socioeconomic disadvantage, especially limited education, skills development, and livelihood opportunities for young people, which are in turn compounded by limited voice and agency, and a dearth of security and protection measures. For some Rohingya adolescent girls and boys, the findings suggests that these multi-dimensional vulnerabilities place them at risk of exploitation by traffickers, smugglers, extremist groups, and criminals. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of explicitly integrating environmental aspects into policy and programs that support Rohingya adolescents to develop their full capabilities, and encouraging their meaningful participation in policy dialogues and accountability processes.

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Sahara; African humid period; Inverted channel; Human migration; Quaternary climate; Fluvial ridges	HOLOCENE CLIMATE-CHANGE; LATE-PLEISTOCENE; WESTERN DESERT; EASTERN SAHARA; RIVER DYNAMICS; PRECIPITATION; EGYPT; WATER; RECONSTRUCTION; LUMINESCENCE	During the Quaternary period, the eastern Sahara's hydroclimate oscillated between wet and dry intervals. These oscillations caused drastic changes in precipitation rates, often associated with ancient human migrations. In particular, significant migration of riparian populations from the Nile Valley to the west and northwestward of the Sahara occurred during the African Humid Period (AHP), an episode of increased monsoons, which characterized North Africa in response to increasing insolation. Several fossil rivers, now preserved as ridges throughout southern Egypt due to their floodplains' deflation, contain archeological artifacts and thus represent a potentially important record of fluvial activity during this episode of past human dynamics and environmental change. Here we present C-14 and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) ages of sediments preserved in these palaeorivers, which cluster within the AHP and are thus consistent with increased fluvial activity during this distinct humid period. Palaeohydraulic reconstructions based on grain size, channel geometry, and drainage area suggest typical precipitation intensities of 55-80 mm/h during sediment transport events. Given previous annual rainfall estimates, these hydrologic conditions may have lasted, or occurred, during the AHP up to 3-4 times more frequently than before and after this period. Such intense fluvial activity is consistent with monsoon intensification and may have rendered the area inhospitable for human settlements, congruent with population migration out of the Nile Valley during the AHP. These findings highlight links between past human ecodynamics and environmental signals, providing a concrete narrative of human population response to warming with potential echo in the current situation.

Temporal and Spatial Variabilities of Chemical and Physical Parameters on the Heron Island Coral Reef Platform	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Coral reef; Ocean acidification; Carbonate chemistry; Heron Island; Great Barrier Reef; Metabolism	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CALCIUM-CARBONATE DISSOLUTION; SEAWATER CO2 SYSTEM; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM CALCIFICATION; KANEOHE BAY; CHEMISTRY; COMMUNITY; PACIFIC	Globally, coral reefs are threatened by ocean warming and acidification. The degree to which acidification will impact reefs is dependent on the local hydrodynamics, benthic community composition, and biogeochemical processes, all of which vary on different temporal and spatial scales. Characterizing the natural spatiotemporal variability of seawater carbonate chemistry across different reefs is critical for elucidating future impacts on coral reefs. To date, most studies have focused on select habitats, whereas fewer studies have focused on reef scale variability. Here, we investigate the temporal and spatial seawater physicochemical variability across the entire Heron Island coral reef platform, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, for a limited duration of six days. Autonomous sensor measurements at three sites across the platform were complemented by reef-wide boat surveys and discrete sampling of seawater carbonate chemistry during the morning and evening. Variability in both temporal and spatial physicochemical properties were predominantly driven by solar irradiance (and its effect on biological activity) and the semidiurnal tidal cycles but were influenced by the local geomorphology resulting in isolation of the platform during low tide and rapid flooding during rising tides. As a result, seawater from previous tidal cycles was sometimes trapped in different parts of the reef leading to unexpected biogeochemical trends in space and time. This study illustrates the differences and limitations of data obtained from high-frequency measurements in a few locations compared to low-frequency measurements at high spatial resolution and coverage, showing the need for a combined approach to develop predictive capability of seawater physicochemical properties on coral reefs.

R.Br.) is important in Namibia, in sub-Saharan Africa, owing to the prevailing low precipitation conditions. Most fields supporting crop production in northern Namibia are located in a network of seasonal wetlands. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of ridging and fertilizer application on the yield and the growth of pearl millet in the seasonal wetlands under different rainfall conditions. The study was conducted for two years (2017-2018) in the experimental fields in northern Namibia, and yield, yield components, and growth parameters were evaluated in relation to the application of different fertilizers (manure and mineral) with and without ridge-furrows. Manure fertilizer application presented the highest yield in 2018, whereas mineral fertilizer application showed the highest yield in 2017. The proportion of rainfall was the highest during the mid-growth period in 2017, and the reproductive stage in 2018. Thus, pearl millet plants under manure fertilization overcame damage resulting from waterlogging stress during the seed setting stage by improving the soil and plant nutrient conditions. In contrast, the plants under mineral fertilization were more tolerant to large amounts of rain during the mid-growth period. In this study, yield was mainly determined by total dry weight, and it was closely related to panicle density in both years. Therefore, we concluded that fertilizer application, including additional fertilizer based on the growth diagnostic, could be important for improving crop production in seasonal wetlands.

It is therefore important to efficiently manage integrated water resources, which includes basins, watersheds, and wadies. In this study, the freely available data was used, which included a digital elevation model, soil and geological maps, satellite imageries, and daily precipitation records. Furthermore, remote sensing techniques and geographic information system were also integrated in this study. The linear and areal aspects, along with the longitudinal profile were also included, and the hydrologic soil groups (HSGs), land use/land cover (LULC), and curve number (CN) were identified for the main basin of the Riyadh capital. The morphometric analysis indicated that the total area of the main basin was 8500 km(2), with 40 watersheds and the highest stream order as eighth. The drainage density of the main basin was 1.57 km/km(2). Impermeable surface constituted most of the basin area, as group D was the most prevalently found HSG, constituting 71% of the total basin area. Additionally, the main basin had a highly steep slope, with varying elevations. Furthermore, four types of LULC were identified in the basin namely urban-based, barren land, cultivated land, and ways. The CN for every cell of the main basin ranged from 64 to 98, and the basin weighted CN was found to be 92. The potential direct runoff ranged from 10 to 59 mm. More than 70% of the total area was found to be vulnerable to high and very high runoffs (> 35 mm). These values confirmed the occurrence of flood events, particularly in urban areas and cultivated lands.	[Radwan, Farid; Alazba, A.

This has until recently been the case for Italy, the heart of the Roman Empire, during the transition between Antiquity and the Middle Ages. In this paper, we present new high-resolution speleothem data from the Apuan Alps (Central Italy). The data document a period of very wet conditions in the sixth c. AD, probably related to synoptic atmospheric conditions similar to a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. For this century, there also exist a significant number of historical records of extreme hydroclimatic events, previously discarded as anecdotal. We show that this varied evidence reflects the increased frequency of floods and extreme rainfall events in Central and Northern Italy at the time. Moreover, we also show that these unusual hydroclimatic conditions overlapped with the increased presence of "water miracles" in Italian hagiographical accounts and social imagination. The miracles, performed by local Church leaders, strengthened the already growing authority of holy bishops and monks in Italian society during the crucial centuries that followed the "Fall of the Roman Empire". Thus, the combination of natural and historical data allows us to show the degree to which the impact of climate variability on historical societies is determined not by the nature of the climatic phenomena per se, but by the culture and the structure of the society that experienced it.

Due to its high-level funding requirements as a mitigation solution, it requires extensive benefits and costs analysis for the selected region. Many communities in the State of Iowa experienced extreme flood events (i.e., 1993, 2008, 2014, 2019), which resulted in a heavy economic impact over the last couple of decades. Nearly 3000 property acquisitions have been made between 2007 and 2017 using federal programs. This study presents a web-based Flood Risk Assessment and Mitigation Environment (FRAME), which provides visual data analytics capabilities to analyze property and community level benefit-cost analysis for property acquisitions. The FRAME allows users to explore and visualize historical mitigation projects and buyouts, and evaluate avoided damages for their communities. As a case study, a detailed benefit-cost analysis of historical property buyouts and direct losses of existing properties in the Middle Cedar watershed in Iowa is studied using stream gauge data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Projected stream gauge datasets, which are outputs of two climate scenarios (A1FI-fossil intensive and A2-low emission), are also utilized to assess future avoided losses for acquisitions and possible direct economic losses for existing properties. Case study results indicate that the average benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for buyouts in the studied region is around 0.86. Nearly half of the buyouts reached 4.72 BCR in low emission and 6.3 BCR in fossil intensive climate projections if future floods are considered.

The belief that exceptionally high stream acidity levels during hydrological events was caused by anthropogenic deposition resulted in a governmentally funded, multi-million dollar surface-water liming program. This program was heavily criticized by a large part of the scientific community arguing that the acidity of northern streams was primarily caused by naturally occurring organic acids. Here, we revisit the acid deposition legacy in northern Sweden two decades after the culmination of the controversy by examining the long-term water chemistry trends in the Svartberget/Krycklan research catchment that became a nexus for the Swedish debate. In this reference stream, trends in acidic episodes do show a modest recovery that matches declines in acid deposition to pre-industrial levels, although stream acidity continues to be overwhelmingly driven by organic acidity. Yet there are legacies of acid deposition related to calcium losses from soils, which are more pronounced than anticipated. Finally, assessment of these trends are becoming increasingly complicated by new changes and threats to water resources that must be recognized to avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially counterproductive measures to adapt and mitigate human influences. Here we make the argument that while the acidification era is ending, climate change, land-use transitions, and long-range transport of other contaminants warrant close monitoring in the decades to come.

In most cases, impacts related to the occurrence of such phenomena can be amplified due to the lack of planning and structure. In this context, the main objective of the study is to estimate the period and level of return of intense rainfall events in homogeneous subregions of the Sao Francisco hydrographic region, as well as to define which of these subregions are most vulnerable to the recurrence of these episodes. We used rainfall data from 105 rain gauges and streamflow data from 103 stream gauges comprising the years from 1988 to 2017. Through cluster analysis, four homogeneous rainfall subregions were defined and validated by the silhouette index, capable of identifying misallocated stations in the clustering process. A generalized Pareto distribution from the extreme value theory was used to calculate the period and level of return of intense rainfall events in each subregion. We then related the retrieved estimates with information about the drainage network, streamflow, land use and occupation, and socioeconomic and demographic factors in the watershed region. Results indicated the existence of subregions vulnerable to hydrological and geological processes intensified due to human activity and the recurrence of hydrometeorological phenomena. The scenarios found for the recurrence of intense rainfall events indicated the severity to which some subregions may be subjected, moreover, they reinforce the need for the development of public policies for the prevention and minimization of impacts.

J	Liang, CM; Zhang, X; Xu, J; Pan, GY; Wang, Y				Liang, Changmei; Zhang, Xiang; Xu, Jin; Pan, Guoyan; Wang, Yao			An integrated framework to select resilient and sustainable sponge city design schemes for robust decision making	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Resilience; Sustainability; Sponge city; Design schemes selection; SWMM	LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION; MITIGATION; LEVEL	To mitigate the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change on hydrology and water quality, the new concept of urban stormwater management, sponge city, has been proposed to increase the city's resilience. Although 30 cities in China have been chosen to implement sponge city construction, there is a lack of a quantitative evaluation method to help decision makers select resilience and sustainability schemes. This paper proposes a new integrated framework in selecting the resilient and sustainable sponge city design schemes. The developed framework consists of the following 10 indicators: resilience, flood volume, flood duration time, hydraulic performance index, annual runoff volume control, rainfall usage, pollution control, social acceptability, greenhouse gas emission, and cost. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to simulate the rainfall-runoff process to calculate the indicators. The multi-criteria analysis methods of the improved AHP were used to calculate the weights of indictors, while the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to rank the design schemes. The proposed framework was then applied to Xining, China, as a case study. The performances of three sponge city design schemes (51, S2, and S3) with different sponge city construction areas and different low impact development (LID) controls were analyzed for the LID construction project. The results identified 51 as the best scheme where 50% permeable pavement and 30% rain barrel are implemented in residential areas. In contrast, S3 had the lowest scores, with the largest LID construction area. This integrated framework will assist policy-makers in the selection of optimal sponge city design schemes.

J	Qi, M; Huang, HB; Liu, L; Chen, X				Qi, Man; Huang, Huabing; Liu, Lin; Chen, Xi			Spatial heterogeneity of controlling factors ' impact on urban pluvial flooding in Cincinnati, US	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Urban pluvial flooding; Rainfall intensity; Topographic control index; Spatial heterogeneity; Depression; Cincinnati	RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DRAINAGE SYSTEMS; SEWER SYSTEM; URBANIZATION; VULNERABILITY; INFILTRATION; RAINFALL; SURFACE; MODEL	Urban pluvial flooding has become a common threat for urban areas. Intensified rainfall, increasing imperviousness, and insufficient drainage capacity contribute to the increase of pluvial flood risk. The strategy of risk mitigation relies on the understanding of these controlling factors of urban pluvial flooding. However, spatial heterogeneity of the impacts of controlling factors has received limited attention. This study analyzes how topography, rainfall, impervious surfaces affect urban pluvial flooding and how the effects vary in space. A case study in the city of Cincinnati, US based on four storm events in recent years is conducted. The impact of topography is measured by a depression-based empirical parameter, Topographic Control Index (TCI), which is generated based on depression ponding volume, contributing area, and upstream slope. Rainfall depth estimated from kriging interpolation method is used to measure how the rainfall affect the urban pluvial flooding. The impervious area ratio of the contributing area of each depression as well as that of observed flooded locations are calculated to analyze the influence of impervious area. The results showed that TCI value and rainfall intensity are spatially correlated with the presence of flooded locations, and flooded locations can be classified into two types: rainfall control or topography control. The imperviousness of land surface does not show a significant correlation with pluvial flood due to the relatively small spatial variation of impervious area in a well-developed city. The framework in this study could identify the spatial distribution of dominant controlling factors for pluvial flooding, which is critical for the effective planning of mitigation measures.

For LVS modelling, field and remote sensing based 26 parameters were selected. We classified the parameters as exposure (11 parameters), sensitivity (4 parameters) and adaptive capacity (11 parameters). We modelled LVS for overall condition, exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity. Application of these algorithms in this field is unique and its robustness and precision in result is highly satisfactory. LVS models clearly identified 39% to 53% of areas having high to very high vulnerability and these are located at the edge of the charlands. Among the models, SVM outperformed as per the result of accuracy assessment. Therefore, it can be treated as a representative algorithm for LVS modelling. Among the 26 parameters, bank erosion, unhygienic condition, and Below Poverty Level (BPL) household parameters were found as highly dominating based on the findings of information and gain ratio. The correlation with LVS and three individual models (exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity) exhibited that the Exposure model was highly correlated (r = 0.87) with high statistical significance (0.001 level).

This paper reviews the literature at the interface of ABM and flood-related studies in view of understanding the technique's advantages and limitations to flood risk management, based on a set of 61 representative articles. In particular, to understand how this process-based technique can help to link human (also institutional) decisions and behaviour with flood risks through the whole human-flood systems. Overall, the temporal and spatial distributions demonstrate a growing interest in this research area around the world, especially since 2017. Three topic areas are identified, addressing different research challenges in the field: real-time flood emergency management, long-term flood adaptation planning, and flood hydrological modelling. The review has shown that the potential contribution of ABM to future flood risk management lays in its practical application to decision-making in adaptation policy and strategy planning. The review also critically reveals the limitation of ad hoc implementations of decision-making and behaviour in the ABM models that could make the application less realistic in the field. It is recommended that the future development should be guided/influenced by the continuing development and refinement of ABM modelling framework and theoretical foundations, and enhancement of model testing and documenting capabilities. More importantly, active collaborations between disciplines and sectors such as to involve more social and psychological sciences in ABM decision-making modelling should be encouraged; and knowledge sharing will encourage more effective uses of ABM by wider audiences.

The study was set up by selecting four high-precipitation events from 30 years of present and future climate simulations of the high-resolution global climate model EC-Earth. The two most extreme precipitation events within the selection area for the present and future climate were identified, and EC-Earth was rerun creating 10 perturbed realizations for each event. All realizations were further downscaled with the regional weather prediction model, AROME-MetCoOp. The events were thereafter used as input to the operational Norwegian flood-forecasting model for 37 selected catchments in western Norway, and the magnitude and the spatial pattern of floods were analyzed. The role of the hydrological initial conditions, which are important for the total flooding, were analyzed with a special emphasis on snow and soil moisture excess. The results show that the selected future extreme precipitation events affected more catchments with larger floods, compared to the events from present climate. In addition, multiple realizations of the meteorological forcing and four different hydrological initial conditions, for example, soil saturation and snow storage, were important for the estimation of the maximum flood level. The meteorological forcing (e.g., the internal variability/perturbed output) accounts for the highest contribution to the spread in flood magnitude; however, for some events and catchments the hydrological initial conditions affected the magnitudes of floods more than the meteorological forcing.

The Influence of Tropical Cyclones on the Evolution of River Conveyance Capacity in Puerto Rico	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							FLOOD RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM ERIKA; TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; MORPHOLOGY; VEGETATION; TRANSPORT; DOMINICA; EXTREMES	Tropical cyclones (TCs) in Puerto Rico and other tropical environments cause some of the world's most intense rainfall rates and pose major challenges to current and future flood resilience. One potential consequence of TC-induced floods is the reconfiguration of river channels due to sediment scour or deposition. This reconfiguration has the potential to alter subsequent flood hazard by changing channel conveyance capacity, violating statistical independence assumptions that underpin conventional recurrence interval concepts. In this study, we examine changes in channel conveyance capacity in Puerto Rico and compare these changes to streamflow trends. Results show that relatively modest long-term changes in river channel capacity are composed of numerous short-term transients which are of much larger magnitude. These transients are most often caused by abrupt scour or deposition during TCs and are comparable in magnitude to long-term trends in peak streamflows. An abrupt change is typically followed by a multiyear "recovery period" as the channel reestablishes quasi-equilibrium. Flood events with recurrence intervals of approximately 10 years and above appear to be sufficient to cause these changes; channel reconfiguration thus may be more common in Puerto Rico than in less extreme hydroclimates. Short-term conveyance capacity changes are not considered in typical flood hazard assessments, which could substantially overstate or understate flood threat at any particular time, depending on the recent history of TC rainfall and flooding. Improving flood resiliency in Puerto Rico and elsewhere will require better understanding of rapid conveyance capacity changes, their causes, and how they influence flood hazard and risk.

J	Loughran, K				Loughran, Kevin			Urban parks and urban problems: An historical perspective on green space development as a cultural fix	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article						built environment; environment; sustainability; green space; nature; planning; public space; theory	HIGH LINE; PUBLIC SPACE; CITY; RACE; ECOLOGIES	Why does everyone think cities can save the planet? Contemporary planning interventions promise salvation via spatial fixes that might reduce carbon emissions, boost metropolitan economies, and allow urban society to thrive in spite of rising seas and climate disasters. New wetlands, floodgates, and other adaptive infrastructures allow water to coexist with urban space; new parks, such as New York's High Line and Chicago's 606, celebrate the interweaving of built and natural environments and suggest how outmoded infrastructure can be repurposed for civic benefit. While the climate dilemmas at hand are historically new, the use of landscaped environments in the service of solving social problems is not. Dating to the first generation of urban park development in the 19th century, planners have deployed green spaces as solutions to various cultural, political, and economic conundrums of the city. Offering an historical parallel and counterweight to investigations of contemporary urban-environmental dynamics, this paper investigates the period of park development that occurred in the 19th century in North America and Europe, using Chicago's Olmsted-designed South Park (the contemporary Washington and Jackson Parks) as a case study. I argue that green spaces' distinct nexus of (1) normative cultural meanings around nature, (2) power relations bound up in dominant landscape aesthetics, and (3) direct link to the economic realm via the structuring of land values have made green space development a powerful 'cultural fix': a means of using social space to mitigate perceived social crises. Understanding the historical foundations of green spaces' use as cultural fixes can inform contemporary analyses, particularly as new landscape ideologies emerge as part of broader green urbanism development and climate change adaptation strategies.

This study demonstrates that SSS variability can also be used as a measure of terrestrial precipitation on interseasonal to interannual time scales, and to locate the source of moisture. Seasonal composites during El Nino-Southern Oscillation/Indian Ocean dipole (ENSO/IOD) events are used to understand the variations of moisture transport and precipitation over Australia, and their association with SSS variability. As ENSO/IOD events evolve, patterns of positive or negative SSS anomaly emerge in the Indo-Pacific warm pool region and are accompanied by atmospheric moisture transport anomalies toward Australia. During co-occurring La Nina and negative IOD events, salty anomalies around the Maritime Continent (north of Australia) indicate freshwater export and are associated with a significant moisture transport that converges over Australia to create anomalous wet conditions. In contrast, during co-occurring El Nino and positive IOD events, a moisture transport divergence anomaly over Australia results in anomalous dry conditions. The relationship between SSS and atmospheric moisture transport also holds for pure ENSO/IOD events but varies in magnitude and spatial pattern. The significant pattern correlation between the moisture flux divergence and SSS anomaly during the ENSO/IOD events highlights the associated ocean-atmosphere coupling. A case study of the extreme hydroclimatic events of Australia (e.g., the 2010/11 Brisbane flood) demonstrates that the changes in SSS occur before the peak of ENSO/IOD events. This raises the prospect that tracking of SSS variability could aid the prediction of Australian rainfall.

Leveraging public adaptation finance through urban land reclamation: cases from Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							POLITICAL-ECONOMY; MANAGEMENT; COSTS; VULNERABILITY; HAMBURG; CITIES; RISK	Flood risk in urban areas around the world is increasing due to socio-economic development and climate change. Urban climate adaptation measures are beneficial over the longer term, particularly in coastal areas, yet the upfront costs of such measures are significant. Moreover, public actors responsible for adaptation to flood risk face constrained budgets. A promising strategy for overcoming these constraints and enabling greater adaptation investment is land reclamation that includes adaptation, i.e. flood risk reduction. Land reclamation in high-value urban areas can generate substantial revenues through the sale or lease of new land, or taxes on increased economic activities, thus offsetting public adaptation investments. This paper explores the potential of land reclamation for leveraging public adaptation investments and associated distributional issues, by analysing 3 urban land reclamation and adaptation projects in Germany, the Netherlands and the Maldives. We find that all projects have leveraging potential, and leveraging in projects primarily aimed at land creation is particularly high. Further, due to low adaptation costs needed to protect revenue streams in such projects, these investments appear to be 'low-regret'. Regarding distributional aspects, high project costs and limited public budgets for adaptation constrain public actors' ability to ensure equitable outcomes through planning instruments, for example, social housing. Further, in implementation, competition for project benefits can lead to further inequalities. We conclude that urban land reclamation presents a significant opportunity to leverage public adaptation investments under certain conditions. We further outline future research needs including to extend land-based financing theory from related urban infrastructure sectors to inform the design of equitable governance arrangements and to better understand the role of such urban land reclamation projects in regional or national development pathways.

In the future, flood events during storms are expected to occur more frequently and to be more severe due to sea-level rise, changes in wind and weather patterns, and the deterioration of coral reefs. Hence, disaster managers and coastal planners are in urgent need of decision-support tools. In the short-term, these tools can be applied in Early Warning Systems (EWS) that can help to prepare for and respond to impending storm-driven flood events. In the long-term, future scenarios of flooding events enable coastal communities and managers to plan and implement adequate risk-reduction strategies. Modeling tools that are used in currently available coastal flood EWS and future scenarios have been developed for open-coast sandy shorelines, which have only limited applicability for coral reef-lined shorelines. The tools need to be able to predict local sea levels, offshore waves, as well as their nearshore transformation over the reefs, and translate this information to onshore flood levels. In addition, future scenarios require long-term projections of coral reef growth, reef composition, and shoreline change. To address these challenges, we have formed the UFORiC (Understanding Flooding of Reef-lined Coasts) working group that outlines its perspectives on data and model requirements to develop EWS for storms and scenarios specific to coral reef-lined coastlines. It reviews the state-of-the-art methods that can currently be incorporated in such systems and provides an outlook on future improvements as new data sources and enhanced methods become available.

We propose a hybrid machine learning framework to predict the water level and validate the framework in five representative high sediment load reaches of the Lower Yellow River (LYR) in China. This framework can automatically generate ensemble prediction models for different flood-sediment scenarios by integrating clustering, classification, and regression models. We compared the proposed framework with two benchmark frameworks and evaluated performances using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The results demonstrated the following: (1) The water level cannot be accurately predicted (NSE < 0.50 in the testing period) using only upstream discharge and sediment load because of the fluctuating reach terrain. Model performance is significantly improved (NSE > 0.85) by adding the time factor in model development. (2) The proposed frame-work can successfully identify different flood-sediment combinations with a high classification accuracy of 98% by adopting K-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM) classification models. (3) The proposed framework can provide reliable water level prediction for flood early warming in the LYR with an average NSE of 0.83 and 0.89 in the training and testing periods, respectively. It outperformed traditional single and rule-based model frameworks in all reaches with different degrees of improvement between 3% and 13%. The best performance indicated that the proposed framework can take advantages of different types of machine learning models and could provide reliable prediction for flood mitigation in high sediment load reaches.

When such dams break, glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) can cause catastrophic societal and geomorphic impacts. We present a robust probabilistic estimate of average GLOFs return periods in the Himalayan region, drawing on 5.4 billion simulations. We find that the 100-y outburst flood has an average volume of 33.5(+3.7)/(-3.7) x 10(6) m(3) (posterior mean and 95% highest density interval [HDI]) with a peak discharge of 15,600(+2.000)/(-1,800) m(3).S-1. Our estimated GLOF hazard is tied to the rate of historic lake outbursts and the number of present lakes, which both are highest in the Eastern Himalayas. There, the estimated 100-y GLOF discharge (similar to 14,500 m(3).s(-1)) is more than 3 times that of the adjacent Nyainqentanglha Mountains, and at least an order of magnitude higher than in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Western Himalayas. The GLOF hazard may increase in these regions that currently have large glaciers, but few lakes, if future projected ice loss generates more unstable moraine-dammed lakes than we recognize today. Flood peaks from GLOFs mostly attenuate within Himalayan headwaters, but can rival monsoon-fed discharges in major rivers hundreds to thousands of kilometers downstream. Projections of future hazard from meteorological floods need to account for the extreme runoffs during lake outbursts, given the increasing trends in population, infrastructure, and hydropower projects in Himalayan headwaters.

We studied nest survival of MacGillivray's seaside sparrow Ammospiza maritima macgillivraii and Worthington's marsh wren Cistothorus palustris griseus in smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora and black needlerush Juncus roemerianus dominated salt marshes in northeast Florida, USA, during 2015-2017 to understand why both species have undergone range contractions. We evaluated the effects of tides, habitat features, and weather on nest survival. The probability of a nest surviving from laying to fledging young was low for both species (seaside sparrow: 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00, 0.10; marsh wren: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.18), suggesting that nest survival may limit population growth. The most substantial threat to marsh wren and seaside sparrow nest survival was from greater than normal high tides. However, there was limited evidence of direct nest loss due to flooding. An analysis of only fledged and depredated nests suggests that higher tides influenced nest survival by increasing nest predation, substantially so for marsh wrens. Other factors negatively associated with marsh wren nest survival, albeit less strongly, included precipitation and the amount of black needlerush at and within 50 m of the nest. The effect of tide height on nest survival suggests that salt marsh birds in northeast Florida are vulnerable to continued sea-level rise, which is exacerbated by upland development that will hinder marsh migration. Monitoring and protecting northeast Florida's high-elevation, cordgrass-dominated marshes should be a priority.	[Cox, W. Andrew; Schwarzer, Y.

J	Pall, P; Tallaksen, LM; Stordal, F				Pall, Pardeep; Tallaksen, Lena M.; Stordal, Frode			A Climatology of Rain-on-Snow Events for Norway	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Europe; Rainfall; Snow; Climate change; Climatology	VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; FLOOD; ASSOCIATION; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; IMPACT; ENERGY; ALPS	Rain-on-snow (ROS) events are multivariate hydrometeorological phenomena that require a combination of rain and snowpack, with complex processes occurring on and within the snowpack. Impacts include floods and landslides, and rain may freeze within the snowpack or on bare ground, potentially affecting vegetation, wildlife, and permafrost. ROS events occur mainly in high-latitude and mountainous areas, where sparse observational networks hinder accurate quantification-as does a scale mismatch between coarse-resolution (50-100 km) reanalysis products and localized events. Variability in the rain-snow temperature threshold and temperature sensitivity of snowmelt adds additional uncertainty. Here the high-resolution (1 km) seNorge hydrometeorological dataset, capturing complex topography and drainage networks, is utilized to produce the first large-scale climatology of ROS events for mainland Norway. For daily data spanning 1957-2016, suitable rain and snowpack thresholds for defining ROS events are applied to construct ROS climatologies for 1961-90 and 1981-2010 and to investigate trends. Differing ROS characteristics are found, reflecting Norway's diverse climates. Relative to 1961-90, events in the 1981-2010 period decrease most in the southwest low elevations in winter, southeast in spring, and north in summer (consistent with less snow cover in a warming climate) and increase most in the southwest high elevations, central mountains, and north in winter-spring (consistent with increased precipitation and/or more snow falling as rain in a warming climate). Winter-spring events also broadly correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Scandinavia pattern-and more so with the Arctic Oscillation, particularly in the southern mountain region where long-term ROS trends are significant (+0.50 and +0.33 daily ROS counts per kilometer squared per decade for winter and spring).

Todd			Possible Increases in Flood Frequency Due to the Loss of Eastern Hemlock in the Northeastern United States: Observational Insights and Predicted Impacts	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							ADELGID ADELGES-TSUGAE; CENTRAL NEW-YORK; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-UPTAKE; SOIL-WATER; FOREST MANAGEMENT; STABLE-ISOTOPES; GLOBAL EVIDENCE; CANADENSIS L.	Trees exert a fundamental control on the hydrologic cycle, yet previous research is unclear about the nuanced relationship between forest cover and riverine flood frequency. In the Northeastern United States, warming air temperatures have resulted in a decline of Eastern Hemlock (EH), and subsequent increases in observed catchment water yield. We evaluated the possibility of EH loss leading to a changed flooding regime. We first investigated plant hydraulic regulation by root water uptake in EH and American Beech (AB; a candidate successional species) through stable isotope analysis of stream, soil water, and plant xylem water. EH xylem water showed evidence of deeper soil water uptake than AB during both wet and dry seasons, suggesting species succession may be an important mechanism for altering catchment "plant accessible water." Next, we estimated catchment flood frequency with mechanistic hydrologic simulations for present conditions, and two hypothetical cases where all EH is succeeded by AB. The largest change to catchment extreme discharge after AB succession coincided with fall season tropical moisture export-derived precipitation. We observed reduced sensitivity under future climatic forcing with an ensemble simulation of five localized constructed analogs downscaled general circulation models. Thus, the influence of forest composition on the flood regime may be most related to the temporal alignment of the synoptic-scale processes that generate Atlantic Basin tropical cyclones and regional plant phenology of the Northeast United States. Our results provide a justification for using physically based hydrologic models incorporating plant hydraulic regulation when evaluating future flooding frequency.

J	Elliott, R				Elliott, Rebecca			'Scarier than another storm': values at risk in the mapping and insuring of US floodplains	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						Risk; insurance; flood; value; map	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSURANCE; RESPONSIBILITIES; MANAGEMENT; POLITICS; EMOTION; SOCIETY; CULTURE; PLACE; STATE	How do people respond to the ways in which insurance mediates environmental risks? Socio-cultural risk research has characterized and analyzed the experiential dimension of risk, but has yet to focus on insurance, which is a key institution shaping how people understand and relate to risk. Insurance not only assesses and communicates risk; it also economizes it, making the problem on the ground not just one of risk, but also of value. This article addresses these issues with an investigation of the social life of the flood insurance rate map, the central technology of the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), as it grafts a new landscape of 'value at risk' onto the physical and social world of New York City in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Like other risk technologies, ubiquitous in modern societies as decision-making and planning tools, the map disseminates information about value and risk in order to tame uncertainty and enable prudent action oriented toward the future. However, drawing together interview, ethnographic, and documentary data, I find that for its users on the ground, the map does not simply measure 'value at risk' in ways that produce clear strategies for protecting property values from flooding. Instead, it puts values-beyond simply the financial worth of places-at risk, as well as implicates past, present, and future risks beyond simply flooding. By informing and enlarging the stakes of what needs protecting, and from what, I argue that plural and interacting 'values at risk' shape how people live with and respond to environmental risks that are mediated by insurance technologies.

(Rens)			High-Resolution Global Water Temperature Modeling	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							AIR-TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAM; DISCHARGE; FLOWS	The temperature of river water plays a crucial role in many physical, chemical, and aquatic ecological processes. Despite the importance of having detailed information on this environmental variable at locally relevant scales (<= 50 km), high-resolution simulations of water temperature on a large scale are currently lacking. We have developed the dynamical 1-D water energy routing model (DynWat), that solves both the energy and water balance, to simulate river temperatures for the period 1960-2014 at a nominal 10-km and 50-km resolution. The DynWat model accounts for surface water abstraction, reservoirs, riverine flooding, and formation of ice, enabling a realistic representation of the water temperature. We present a novel 10-km water temperature data set at the global scale for all major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Validated results against 358 stations worldwide indicate a decrease in the simulated root-mean-square error (0.2 degrees C) and bias (0.7 degrees C), going from 50- to 10-km simulations. We find an average global increase in water temperature of 0.16 degrees C per decade between 1960 and 2014, with more rapid warming toward 2014. Results show increasing trends for the annual daily maxima in the Northern Hemisphere (0.62 degrees C per decade) and the annual daily minima in the Southern Hemisphere (0.45 degrees C per decade) for 1960-2014. The high-resolution modeling framework not only improves the model performance, it also positively impacts the relevance of the simulations for regional-scale studies and impact assessments in a region without observations. The resulting global water temperature data set could help to improve the accuracy of decision-support systems that depend on water temperature estimates.

S.; Sebastian, Leocadio			Development of a participatory approach for mapping climate risks and adaptive interventions (CS-MAP) in Vietnam's Mekong River Delta	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Participatory mapping; Climate risk and adaptation; CS-MAP; Rice production; Vietnam	INFORMATION	The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 2016 adversely affected Vietnam particularly in the Mekong River Delta (MRD), where more than 90% of the country's rice export is produced annually. During that time, salinity intrusion and drought significantly affected agricultural production in the area. Furthermore, flooding is another recurring event in the area that is increasing in frequency. An assessment conducted by CGIAR Centers showed that even as warnings were provided by the government for the 2016 ENSO, these were not translated into appropriate preparations and responsive actions for agriculture. To address this critical issue, the Department of Crop Production (DCP) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) of Vietnam, and CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security in Southeast Asia (CCAFS-SEA) collaborated to develop and test an participatory approach for mapping climate risks and adaptive interventions (CS-MAP) to recognize climate-related risks, identify potentially affected areas and develop regional and provincial adaptation plans for rice production. The CS-MAP is a participatory approach involving experts from various local and national offices for: (1) identifying climate-related risks; (2) delineating affected areas and risk levels; (3) proposing corresponding adaptive plans; (4) fine tuning and verifying proposed measures; and (5) developing integrated provincial and regional adaptation plans. Risks and adaptive interventions maps were developed for normal and ENSO years by using technical data (i.e. topography and hydrology), infrastructures (i.e. dikes, road and canals), and local observations. CS-MAP is now is under various stages of development and implementation in 13 MRD provinces highlighting the organizational uptake and integration of the approach.

J	Thrysoe, C; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K; Borup, M				Thrysoe, Cecilie; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten; Borup, Morten			Identifying fit-for-purpose lumped surrogate models for large urban drainage systems using GLUE	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydraulic modelling; Surrogate models; Urban drainage; Computational time; Uncertainty; GLUE	PLUVIAL FLOOD RISK; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; IDENTIFICATION; CALIBRATION; INUNDATION; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS	Distributed physically based models (DPMs) have become the standard tool for urban drainage modelling. However, high computational demands limit these in applications where fast or multiple simulations are needed. This paper presents simple fit-for-purpose cheaper-to-run surrogate models (SMs) for pipe network simulations which are validated against a DPM. The SMs are set up by lumping the DPM network into compartments in which the volume of water is governed by mass balances. Outgoing discharges to downstream compartment(s) and surcharging are computed from unambiguous volume-discharge curves. The SMs are applied on a 45 km(2) catchment, Elster Creek in Melbourne, Australia. The number of simulated states and simulation times are reduced by approximately 3 and 6 orders of magnitude, respectively. Different SM complexities are examined. The simplest SM using steady state training data performed well with NSE of 0.98 for volume in the most upstream compartment. When emulating the aggregated surcharge from that compartment, the SM captured all surcharge events correctly. NSE improved from 0.35 to 0.84 when subdividing the compartment into 17 subcompartments. Uncertainty of SM parameters was examined using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Two different sampling methods were applied. Limits of acceptability for real-time control, warning and planning, resulted in many accepted models upstream and few to none in downstream backwater-prone areas. All applications showed SM uncertainty bands within expected uncertainty bands for DPM, supporting the use of a simpler conceptual model in fit-for-purpose modelling in urban water systems when computational demands of DPMs are prohibitive.

Resilience is defined as the capability of the system to maintain an acceptable level of performance against a severe disturbance and return to its original condition in an appropriate period of time, which demonstrates the degree of endurance, vulnerability, and reversibility of an infrastructure system. The occurrence of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters causes extensive losses and power outages in distribution networks; and the number and severity of such incidents have seen an increase in recent years. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate the resilience of the network and its reversibility capability in dealing with adverse weather conditions. In this paper, after defining the concept of resilience in distribution networks, its characteristics are determined; and then, modeling common natural events such as floods and storms, and introducing a new index to evaluate resilience in distribution networks with digital directional overcurrent relays (DOCR) and Digital dual-setting directional overcurrent relays (DS-DOCR) in the presence of renewable energy sources (RES), the proposed scheme is presented.

Since 1950 s, Taihu Lake has experienced three stages of anthropogenic management. Due to these managements, the natural hydrologic properties of Taihu Lake are gradually disappearing, and the Taihu Lake tends to become an artificially controlled lake. Study focus: To understand how anthropogenic activities have impacted the hydrological regime of Taihu Lake at different stages, this study has analyzed daily average water level of Taihu Lake for 70 years and daily average precipitation data of the Taihu Lake Basin for 60 years. And finally it reveals the natural and anthropogenic effects on trend, amplitude, period and extreme water level of Taihu Lake. New hydrological insights for the region: The multi-year average water level of Taihu Lake witnesses an increment of 0.23 m, and the contribution from anthropogenic activities account for 34.78%. The maximum decrements of frequency of extreme high and low water level drops by 29.55% and 7.69% recently due to anthropogenic activities. The anthropogenic activities on the hydrological regime in Taihu Lake has become increasingly pronounced, and these hydrological changes are beneficial for basin flood control and water resources.

The Music of Rivers: The Mathematics of Waves Reveals Global Structure and Drivers of Streamflow Regime	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						ecohydrology; streamflow regime; wavelet; machine learning; timeseries	NATURAL FLOW REGIMES; HYDROLOGIC REGIMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DAM; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; WILDFIRE; DYNAMICS; COLORADO	River flows change on timescales ranging from minutes to millennia. These vibrations in flow are tuned by diverse factors globally, for example, by dams suppressing multi-day variability or vegetation attenuating flood peaks in some ecosystems. The relative importance of the physical, biological, and human factors influencing flow is an active area of research, as is the related question of finding a common language for describing overall flow regime. Here, we addressed both topics using a daily river discharge data set for over 3,000 stations across the globe from 1988 to 2016. We first studied similarities between common flow regime quantification methods, including traditional flow metrics, wavelets, and Fourier analysis. Across all these methods, the flow data showed low-dimensional structure (i.e., simple and consistent patterns), suggesting that fundamental mechanisms are constraining flow regime. One such pattern was that day-to-day variability was negatively correlated with year-to-year variability. Additionally, the low-dimensional structure in river flow data correlated closely with only a small number of catchment characteristics, including catchment area, precipitation, and temperature-but notably not biome, dam surface area, or number of dams. We discuss these findings in a framework intended to be accessible to the many communities engaged in river research and management, while stressing the importance of letting structure in data guide both mechanistic inference and interdisciplinary discussion.

Future projections of sea-level rise (SLR) and storm surges identified cultural resources at high risk for inundation by the years 2030, 2050, 2080, and 2100. The projections are aimed to be high-end estimates preparing for long-term planning and "worse-case" scenarios. Sites located along the riverbanks are facing the highest threats from SLR. Coastal sites will be more frequently impacted by storms as surge levels increase with SLR. Storm-surge simulations predicted a non-linear increase in surge levels, reaching greater heights along the New Jersey side of the Bay compared to the Delaware side. Coastal sites without a protective dune system, or a dune less than 2 m in elevation, should be considered at immediate risk from coastal flooding. Shoreline erosion, and more frequent storms combined with SLR will increase vulnerability of coastal sites in the future. All endangered sites cannot be protected, therefore the results of the study should be of particular interest to historic preservation planners, cultural resources managers, Indigenous community leaders, and scholars to prioritize resources, develop the most effective preservation strategies, and plans for reconnaissance, survey, or data recovery from threatened sites and landscapes.

The present study focuses on the Black Sea's immediate riparian area over which the Danube Delta extends. Due to the accelerated increase in the severity of floods, the vulnerability of the deltaic areas is augmenting. Therefore, it is very important to adopt measures to mitigate the negative effects of these phenomena. The basis of the measures to limit the negative effects is the activity of identifying areas prone to flooding. Thus, this research paper presents a methodology for estimating flood susceptibility using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) models. To determine the susceptibility to these natural risk phenomena, the following eight flood predictors were taken into account: slope, elevation, altitude above channel, land use, hydrological soil group, lithology distance from the river, and distance from water bodies. Furthermore, the weights that each flood predictor has in terms of determining flood susceptibility were determined through the previously mentioned models. The results revealed that the slope is the most important predictor, followed by elevation, distance from the river, and land use. These weights were used in the GIS environment to evaluate the susceptibility to floods from a spatial point of view. The areas with a high/very high value for these phenomena occupy over 70% of the surface of the Danube Delta.

Study focus: This study evaluated the amount of flooding that could occur in the carbon-neutral era, and optimized low-impact development (LID) technology for an urban flood adaptation. The optimal scenario of LID technologies was proposed for the Sangdo-dong area at the urban level, and the amount of runoff and flood reduction was evaluated. New hydrological insights: The LID controls provided by the storm water management model were used to analyze the flood damage that may occur under RCP 2.6 scenario. The evaluation simulated eight combinations of three optimized techniques: green roofs, permeable pavements, and vegetative swales to construct evidence-based data for the use by decision makers. In Scenario 8, which was evaluated as the most efficient, both peak and total flooding could be reduced by 55-60% respectively. This study not only evaluate the runoff but also the flooding value reflecting the interactions among LID-pipe networks. The LID installation area and runoff damage scale are inversely proportional. In contrast, as total flooding considers the capacity of the sewage network, a non uniform graph can be seen compared to the runoff. Results of this study can be used as guidance for LID evidence-based design and construction as well as strategies for decision maker.

The observation has been closely linked to anthropogenic activities and climate change. The events have been studied on the basis of their trends, frequency, geographical distribution and impacts. A flash flood from 2018 in a small catchment in Uttarakhand, North West Himalayas is reported here. The event has been characterized based on the possible causes and observed effects. The runoff generation tendency of major sub-catchments within the study area was assessed and the area was mapped based on sediment connectivity. The hydrological characteristics of the event was calculated using Manning's equations. The event generated a peak discharge of 9953 m(3)/s flowing at 15 m/s with a stream power of 6.4 MW. Based on the hydrological assessment, the thresholds of bedload movement, sediment transport and redistribution was analysed. The peak flow had a capacity of mobilising boulders of 6m diameter. Putting together the field and modelled data, the difference in the nature of the of the topography was analysed that caused only a particular sub-catchment to respond to the same climatic forcing significantly more than the others and also highlighted the significance of such high magnitude stochastic events in controlling the rates of long term geomorphic processes that shape the landscape.

Deriving First Floor Elevations within Residential Communities Located in Galveston Using UAS Based Data	DRONES			English	Article						first-floor elevation (FFE); Unmanned Aerial System (UAS); Structure-from-Motion (SfM); photogrammetry; flood risk reduction; UAS flight parameters	STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOW-COST; PHOTOGRAMMETRY; ORTHOIMAGERY; SYSTEMS; MODELS; GIS	Flood damages occur when just one inch of water enters a residential household and models of flood damage estimation are sensitive to first-floor elevation (FFE). The current sources for FFEs consist of costly survey-based elevation certificates (ECs) or assumptions based on year built, foundation type, and flood zone. We sought to address these limitations by establishing the role of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to efficiently derive accurate FFEs. Four residential communities within Galveston Island, Texas were selected to assess efficient flight parameters required for UAS photogrammetry within the built environment. A real-time kinematic positioning enabled (RTK) UAS was then used to gather georeferenced aerial imagery and create detailed 3D photogrammetric models with +/- 0.02 m horizontal and +/- 0.05 m vertical accuracies. From these residential models, FFEs and other structural measurements present in traditional ECs were obtained. Comparative statistical analyses were performed using the UAS-based measurements and traditional EC measurements. UAS based FFE measurements achieved 0.16 m mean absolute error (MAE) across all comparative observations and were not statistically different from traditional EC measures. We conclude the RTK enabled UAS approach is an efficient, cost-effective method in establishing accurate FFEs and other flood-sensitive measures in residential communities.

We examined climatic, environmental, and subsurface conditions and evaluated vulnerability of ice wedges to thermokarst in undisturbed and road-affected areas. Vulnerability of ice wedges strongly depends on the structure and thickness of soil layers above ice wedges, including the active, transient, and intermediate layers. In comparison with the undisturbed area, sites adjacent to the roads had smaller average thicknesses of the protective intermediate layer (4 cm vs. 9 cm), and this layer was absent above almost 60% of ice wedges (vs. similar to 45% in undisturbed areas). Despite the strong influence of infrastructure, ice-wedge degradation is a reversible process. Deepening of troughs during ice-wedge degradation leads to a substantial increase in mean annual ground temperatures but not in thaw depths. Thus, stabilization of ice wedges in the areas of cold continuous permafrost can occur despite accumulation of snow and water in the troughs. Although thermokarst is usually more severe in flooded areas, higher plant productivity, more litter, and mineral material (including road dust) accumulating in the troughs contribute to formation of the intermediate layer, which protects ice wedges from further melting.

J	Ribeiro, DF; Saito, SM; Alvalá, RCD				Ribeiro, Daniela Ferreira; Saito, Silvia Midori; dos Santos Alvala, Regina Celia			Disaster vulnerability analysis of small towns in Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Municipal master plan; Resilience; Capacities; Urban development; Vulnerability indicators	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; MASTER-PLAN; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; URBAN-DEVELOPMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; MEGACITIES; CITIES; DIFFERENTIATION; PARTICIPATION	Most of the global urban population lives in cities with less than one million people, whereas in Brazil, more than 45% of the population is estimated to live in cities with up to 100,000 people. As in both the global and Brazilian contexts, many of these people live in disaster-prone areas, there has been an increasing demand for research on small cities to subsidize actions contributing to disaster risk reduction. Thus, this study evaluates the vulnerability and capacities of small Brazilian municipalities to reduce risks, especially those related to landslides and floods. To this end, 234 municipalities located in the southern and southeast regions of the country were classified into two population classes, that is, cities from 20,000 to 50,000 people and those from 50,000 to 100,000 people. These municipalities are characterized by high levels of municipal human development and availability of municipal master plans. Statistical analysis of a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators revealed that the vulnerability of populations and municipal capacities is mainly related to the economic sectors, public policies, and city size. Municipal master plans and high levels of municipal human development guarantee neither better urban infrastructure nor specific risk management legislations. Although there are legal tools recommending disaster risk management policies, such tools are insufficient to reduce vulnerabilities and increase capacities in small Brazilian cities.

In outdoor built environments, flood risk to evacuees depends on interactions between floodwater spreading, built environment features, flood-induced modifications, and individuals' reaction in emergency phases. Disaster risk reduction strategies should mitigate the immediate flood impacts and improve the community resilience, while being easy-toimplement and effectively supporting evacuees during the initial phases of the emergency. Simulation-based methodologies could support safety planners in evaluating the effectiveness of such strategies, especially if basing on a micro-scale-oriented approach that represents emergency interactions between each individual and the surrounding outdoor built environment. This study adopts an existing micro-scale simulator (FlooPEDS) reproducing experimental-based flood evacuation behaviours. According to a behavioural design-based approach, simulation results focus on individual responses in the outdoor built environment through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) aimed at providing evidence of critical interactions between evacuees, floodwaters and the outdoor built environment. A case study is selected by considering different flood scenarios to test such KPIs. Risk reduction solutions are then provided, and their effectiveness is checked by simulations. Results show the micro-scale and behavioural design-based approach capabilities in proposing multi-scenarios solutions (e.g.: architectural elements to support evacuees; emergency planning).

This is not achievable by current agronomical and breeding practices, due to the impact of climate changes and associated abiotic stresses on agricultural production systems. Here, we analyze the impact of global climate trends on crop productivity and show that the overall loss in crop production from climate-driven abiotic stresses may exceed US$170 billion year(-1) and represents a major threat to global food security. We also show that abiotic stress tolerance had been present in wild progenitors of modern crops but was lost during their domestication. We argue for a major shift in our paradigm of crop breeding, focusing on climate resilience, and call for a broader use of wild relatives as a major tool in this process. We argue that, while molecular tools are currently in place to harness the potential of climate-resilient genes present in wild relatives, the complex polygenic nature of tolerance traits remains a major bottleneck in this process. Future research efforts should be focused not only on finding appropriate wild relatives but also on development of efficient cell-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms allowing assessment of the in planta operation of key genes.

The Kabul River then re-enters Pakistan near Laalpur, Afghanistan making it a true transboundary river. The catastrophic flood events due to major snowmelt events in the Hindu Kush mountains occur every other year, inundating many major urban centers. This study investigates the flood risk under 30 climate and dam management scenarios to assess opportunities for transboundary water management strategy in the Kabul River Basin (KRB). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a watershed-scale hydraulic modeling tool that was employed to forecast peak flows to characterize flood inundation areas using the river flood routing modelling tool Hydrologic Engineering Center-Analysis System -HEC-RAS for the Nowshera region. This study shows how integrated transboundary water management in the KRB can play a vital catalyst role with significant socio-economic benefits for both nations. The study proposes a KRB-specific agreement, where flood risk management is a significant driver that can bring both countries to work together under the Equitable Water Resource Utilization Doctrine to save lives in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The findings show that flood mitigation relying on collaborative efforts for both upstream and downstream riparian states is highly desirable.

The MIS5 chronozone is presented by a continuous pedosedimentary sequence with three well-developed paleosols. The paper is based on the study of depositional environment and pedostratigraphy, with OSL chronological framework and precise altitude references. Field data are supported by chemical analyses, micromorphology, and clay mineralogy. A detailed study of MIS5 paleosols was first conducted for the Lower Volga area. Pedosedimentary sequence at that time developed on the river terrace in a backswamp and/or wetland influenced by extremely slow-moving stream after long seasonal floods. Thin loess layers were deposited during the brief episodes of low flood activity, while fluvial heavy loams - at the time of more intensive flooding. Mollic Gleysols and Fluvic Chernozems have been formed in the arid or semi-arid climate with seasonal freezing under productive wet meadows. Changes in the depositional environment resulted in the formation of welded paleosols, marked by textural difference, cryogenic levels, and accretionary humus horizons. Despite the complicated depositional pattern and the influence of seasonal floods, the MIS5 pedosedimentary sequence may serve as a good stratigraphic marker for the onset of Late Pleistocene allowing correlation with loess-paleosol sequences of the whole Ponto-Caspian region and linking it with the global stratigraphic schemes.

To identify the determinants of this effect, we also estimate how floods affect per capita yearly household income and poverty status. We find that exposure to flooding during a 12-month period decreased daily calorie consumption by approximately 60 kcal while increasing the probability of iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C deficiency by 11, 12, and 27 percentage points, respectively. Controlling for price shocks and income only marginally reduces this flood effect on food security, suggesting that impaired livelihoods (rather than price hikes) are its primary driver. We further determine that exposure to this natural disaster decreases income by about 3% and makes flood-affected households about 3 percentage points more likely to be poor. Lastly, we show that experience of floods is strongly and significantly associated with lower diet quality and quantity, and with engaging in consumption smoothing coping strategies, such as buying food on credit and taking loans. These findings underscore the serious direct impact of floods on both diet and effective behavioral responses to such shocks while emphasizing the need for targeted micronutrient supplementation in disaster relief and food aid measures even after the period of natural disaster emergency.

Accumulation of copper and cadmium in soil-rice systems in terrace and lowland paddies of the Red River basin, Vietnam: the possible regulatory role of silicon	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH			English	Article						Rice; Copper; Cadmium; Terrace; Lowland; Paddy soil; Silicon	ABIOTIC STRESSES; TRANSPORTER; DELTA; DISSOLUTION; MECHANISMS; PLANTS	Rice production in floodplain deltas is currently vulnerable to climate change and contamination from anthropogenic activities. The relocation of rice production to upland regions could be an option for increasing the sustainability of rice production. Our study evaluated the spatial patterning of heavy metals, i.e., copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd), in rice along a topogradient from terrace to lowland areas in the Red River basin. The dataset obtained from the analysis of 61 farm sites throughout the whole basin indicated a large discrepancy in the Cu and Cd contents in rice grains from terrace and lowland paddies. While Cu and Cd were not found in most of the rice grain samples from the terrace paddies, the median Cu and Cd contents of the lowland paddy rice were 1.895 and 0.033 mg kg(-1), respectively. Assessing the relationship of Cu and Cd in the soil-rice system to soil properties revealed possible correlations between soil available silicon (Si) and the Cu and Cd contents in rice grain. The enrichment of Si in rice plants likely reduces the translocation of Cu and Cd from soil to grain. Therefore, management of the Si supply, particularly in lowland paddies, should be highlighted as a way to reduce dietary intake of Cu and Cd.	[Bui, Anh T.

In this study, the change characteristics of both maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures at daily, monthly, and annual scales were fully examined, and their relations with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) were also explored. The modified Mann-Kendall trend test method (MMK) and heuristic segmentation method were employed to detect the trends and change points of the Tmax and Tmin at multiple scales, respectively. Subsequently, the cross wavelet transform was adopted to reveal the correlations between Tmax/Tmin and AO. Results indicated: (1) both monthly and annual Tmax and Tmin showed significantly increasing trends, whilst at daily scale they generally exhibited no obvious trends; (2) change points were found in monthly, seasonal, and annual Tmax and Tmin, implying that the stationarity of Tmax and Tmin series in the WRB has been ineffective; (3) AO had strong impacts on Tmax and Tmin changes in the WRB.

Biochar application in agroecosystems: a review of potential benefits and limitations	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review; Early Access						Biochar; Soil physics; Soil chemistry; Plant growth; Contaminants; Climate change	WATER-HOLDING CAPACITY; PYROLYSIS TEMPERATURE; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; DIFFERENT FEEDSTOCKS; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; SOIL PROPERTIES; SLOW PYROLYSIS; COASTAL SOIL; GROWTH; IMPACT	Biochar (BC), a carbon-rich material produced by pyrolysis, has recently demonstrated promising results for the sustainable management of agroecosystems. It can enhance plant growth and improve soil health. The application of BC can significantly shrink soil's bulk density while improving the porosity, water-holding capacity and aggregation, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and pH. Additionally, BC addition was a promising method to manage environmental stresses (heavy metals (HMs), drought, salinity, and flooding). On the other hand, several adverse effects of BC application were also observed, such as decreased water-holding capacity, increased soil erosion, and salinization, altered pH, imbalanced nutrients, influenced soil biota, and the addition of HMs. Overall, it can be concluded that although BC has been introduced as an potent approach for improving soil characteristics, further studies should be conducted, particularly on prolonged and large scale, to comprehensively assess the adverse effects of BC. Considering these pros and cons of BC applications, especially in soil systems and for sustainable agriculture, the present review aimed to explore insights into the contribution of BC to improving soil physicochemical properties, mitigating environmental stresses, and promoting plant growth and development. Moreover, drawbacks associated with this approach towards enhancing soil health have also been elucidated.

However, various aspects have attracted hyperspectral imaging due to there being informative discriminative features, such as spectral-spatial features. To this end, this paper is a comprehensive and systematic review of LULC classification using hyperspectral images by reviewing four significant research investigations. Moreover, the four investigations have addressed the following points: (1) the main components of the hyperspectral imaging, the modes of hyperspectral imaging with data acquisition methods, and the intrinsic differences between hyperspectral image and multispectral image, (2) the role of machine learning in LULC classification, and the standard deep learning methods: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), (3) the standard benchmark hyperspectral datasets and the evaluation criteria, (4) the main challenges of LULC classification with the possible solutions for the limited training samples issue, the promising future directions, and finally the recent applications for LULC classification.

Quantitative assessment requires hydrodynamic modelling of the flooding process in order to calculate the spatial distribution of suitable flood hazard indicators representative of flooding intensity and frequency, hence its potential to result in harm. Flood hazard indicators are usually defined by combining relevant flooding parameters, mainly flood depth and flow velocity, but also flooding arrival time, flooding duration, sediment or contamination load, and so forth. A flood hazard classification is commonly introduced to assign a hazard level to areas potentially subject to flooding. This article presents a systematic review of quantitative methods proposed in the scientific literature or prescribed by government authorities to assess the hazard associated with natural or anthropic flooding. Flood hazard classification methods are listed and compared by specifying their underlying approach (heuristic, conceptual, empirical), the exposed element which they were designed for (people, buildings, vehicles, etc.), and their fields of application (river overflow, dam-break, levee breach, debris flow). Perspectives and future challenges in quantitative flood hazard analysis are also discussed. This review aims to help modellers and practitioners to select the most suitable flood hazard assessment method for the case study of interest.

Communities relocated after a disaster may continue to be exposed and ill-prepared to respond to hazards. To investigate the efficacy of relocation, we studied exposure and preparedness at relocation sites in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. We evaluated selected elements of risk reduction, such as the establishment of a community disaster warning system, at relocation sites and compare these to households' locations before the typhoon. Results revealed that decision making for post-disaster relocation needs to better consider multi-hazard risks. Although relocated community members were less exposed to storm surge, nearly all had increased exposure to flooding, with several households forced to evacuate during a flood event. Furthermore, preparedness decreased, as relocated communities were less likely to have a response plan, warning system, or leaders ready to meet the challenges hazards present. The frequency of flooding at relocation sites coupled with low community-level capacity illustrate a need for improved planning and development of post-disaster relocation sites. By demonstrating that relocation is not always effective at creating a wholly safer environment for households, the findings indicate the need for considering additional risks within the decision-making process around relocation as a method of disaster recovery and risk reduction.

Global climate-driven trade-offs between the water retention and cooling benefits of urban greening	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HYDROLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; VEGETATION CONTROL; HEAT ISLANDS; ROOF; RUNOFF; SCALE; SURFACE; FUTURE; PRECIPITATION; EVAPORATION	Urban greening can potentially help mitigate heat-related mortality and flooding facing the >4 billion urban population worldwide. However, the geographical variation of the relative combined hydrological and thermal performance benefits of such interventions are unknown. Here we quantify globally, using a hydrological model, how climate-driven trade-offs exist between hydrological retention and cooling potential of urban greening such as green roofs and parks. Using a Budyko framework, we show that water retention generally increases with aridity in water-limited environments, while cooling potential favors energy-limited climates. Our models suggest that common urban greening strategies cannot yield high performance simultaneously for addressing both urban heat-island and urban flooding problems in most cities globally. Irrigation, if sustainable, may enhance cooling while maintaining retention performance in more arid locations. Increased precipitation variability with climate change may reduce performance of thinner green-infrastructure more quickly compared to greened areas with thicker soils and root systems. Our results provide a conceptual framework and first-order quantitative guide for urban development, renewal and policymaking. Urban greening can help to mitigate both heat as well as flooding risks, but how these effects interact is not well known. Here, the authors provide a global analysis and show that most cities benefit from one of these two effects, but only few from both.	[Cuthbert, M.

It is increasingly necessary to study hydrodynamics and instabilities of human on staircases in the flood-prone underground space for risk identification and disaster reduction. However, the turbulent complexity and complicated fluid-human interaction still challenge the study of flow structure and the calibration of human instability model. In this work, a hydrodynamic model coupled with the mechanics-based method was proposed to study fluid-human interactions and hazard risks on flooding stairways. Numerical validations show that the model can obtain reliable solutions of flow characteristics on staircases. It is found that there exists a jet flow downstream the rest platform and the critical region after the 3rd step downstream the platform is identified as a high risk area to cause sliding instability. The risk of sliding instability for a child is higher than that for an adult in jet flow region. In addition, results show that the downstream vortical flow structure and turbulent effect are obviously enhanced because of the interdict of jet flow by the human obstacle.

National-scale exposure of residential properties to fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flooding was estimated at the 100-year return period. A social vulnerability index (SVI) was developed and included 49 variables from the national census that represent demographic, social, economic, cultural, and infrastructure/community indicators of vulnerability. Geographic information system-based bivariate choropleth mapping of the composite SVI scores and of flood exposure of residential properties and population was completed to assess the spatial variation of flood risk. We found that about 81% of the 985 Indigenous land reserves had some flood exposure that impacted either population or residential properties. Our analysis indicates that residential property-level flood exposure is similar between non-Indigenous and Indigenous communities, but socioeconomic vulnerability is higher on reserve lands, which confirms that the overall risk of Indigenous communities is higher. Findings suggest the need for more local verification of flood risk in Indigenous communities to address uncertainty in national scale analysis.

IBWTs present a challenging decision context with complex operational dynamics and conflicting objectives. Information-based coordination between donor and recipient basins is likely to play a role in the success of these large-scale projects, so it is important to explore its potential impact. We developed an IBWT design framework to quantify the multiobjective gains from information coordination between participating basins. For a large-scale IBWT in Southern India, we compared four design paradigms in which transfer decisions are based on (1) the storage states of both reservoirs (cooperative), (2) the storage state of the donor reservoir only (noncooperative), (3) the rule proposed by regional authorities, and (4) status quo (no transfer). The evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search (EMODPS) framework was used to discover the state-aware control strategies that compose the trade-offs between flood protection, demand satisfaction, and environmental flow maintenance. We found that cooperative strategies are substantially more efficient in balancing conflicting objectives, utilizing much lower annual transfers (6,460 +/- 2,600 Mm(3)) compared with noncooperative strategies (9,728 +/- 5,000 Mm3), and both outperform the proposed regional rule (16,400 Mm(3)).

J	Wahiduzzaman, M				Wahiduzzaman, Md			Major Floods and Tropical Cyclones over Bangladesh: Clustering from ENSO Timescales	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						flood; tropical cyclone; El Nino Southern Oscillation; Bangladesh	NORTH INDIAN-OCEAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EL-NINO; MODEL; BAY; CYCLOGENESIS; BENGAL	The present study analyzed major floods and tropical cyclones (TCs) over Bangladesh on El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) timescales. The geographical location, low and almost flat topography have introduced Bangladesh as one of the most vulnerable countries of the world. Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the extreme hazard events like floods and cyclones which are impacted by ENSO. ENSO is mainly a tropical event, but its impact is global. El Nino (La Nina) represents the warm (cold) phase of the ENSO cycle. Rainfall and cyclonic disturbances data have been used for the period of 70 years (1948-2017) and compared with the corresponding observations of the Southern Oscillation Index. Result shows that major flood events occurred during the monsoon period, and most of them are during the La Nina condition, consistent with the historical archives of flood events in Bangladesh. Synoptic conditions of these events are well matched during La Nina condition. On the other hand, the major TC cases are in the period of either pre-monsoon or post-monsoon season. The pre-monsoon cases are under neutral (developing La Nina) or El Nino and the post-monsoon cases are under La Nina, consistent with climatology studies that La Nina is favorable to have more intense TCs over the Bay of Bengal.

A resilience assessment simulation tool for distribution gas networks	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Natural gas; Distribution networks; Fault management; Resilience; Failure; Pipeline	NATURAL-GAS; FLOW; PERFORMANCE; METERS; RISK	Energy networks, especially the ones of natural gas, electric energy and district heating, are crucial infrastructures for the everyday life of our countries and cities. Thus, resilience and security of networks are becoming increasingly critical issues due to: a) the vulnerability of the territories, b) the effects of climate change (e.g. landslides, floods) and/or natural events (e.g. heartquakes) and c) cyber and terrorist attacks. In recent years, more attention has been paid to transmission networks rather than to urban distribution ones, although important consequences in terms of economic and public health damages can arise for urban distribution networks too. In this paper, the authors propose a resilience assessment methodology for natural gas distribution networks. The methodology allows simulating fault conditions in the network leading to quality of service issues (e.g. methane dispersion in the atmosphere, prolonged service interruption) and to disservices (e.g. disrupted final users). In such way, it could be possible to define effective operational management strategies to reduce the risk of service disruption and to increase the network resilience evaluating structural network improvement measures. The proposed methodology has been experimented in a case study of a real distribution network and the results show it is possible to avoid or minimize the risk of service.

This paper assessed the economic impacts of extreme climatic events including sea-level rise and storm surge risk and the benefits of the adaptation strategies in the Pearl River Delta, a lowing-lying area located in southern China. An economic benefit-cost model was established for the estimation of the impacts and benefits. The damage of the extreme events was calculated using the damage rate modeled from the historic disaster database, and then the difference between the damage and the cost of heightening dikes was investigated under different scenarios. The results showed that the damage rate and storm surge level were positively related. The adaptation strategies benefited when the dike was heightened by 1.43-12.67 m, with the optimum reached at 5.15 m, and the dike did not exceed 12.67 m. The maximum benefits were obtained when the dike was designed to defend a 20-year return period storm surge in 2100, and the minimum when the dike is heightened to defend a 100-year return period storm surge in 2100.

In western North America and elsewhere, alterations in natural flow regimes and swimways through dams, levees, and floodplain development, work in concert with fire regime, forest management practices, as well as agriculture and urban development, to change recovery trajectories of river systems. Hydroregime scenarios for coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum, 1792), were investigated in Washington and Oregon, USA, where long-term records of discharge, water temperature, and upstream fish passage are available. This novel approach combines hydrological and ecological data in a single visualization, providing empirical foundations for understanding upstream behavioural movement and tolerances of native fishes. The timing of coho salmon movement with respect to temperature and discharge were compared with scenarios representing possible future hydrological conditions associated with a changing climate. This approach provides a framework for the study of future hydrological alterations in other locations, and can inform local and regional conservation planning, particularly in view of water management policy. Management implications and recommendations for action that may expand the capacity of riverscapes to absorb perturbations are discussed.

Reconstructing the Frequency of Catastrophic Floods on the Western Coast of the Sea of Japan Based on Sedimentary Proxy	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Paleoclimatology; bottom sediments; bromine; X-ray fluorescence; floods; typhoons; Sea of Japan; Amur Bay; Little Ice Age	BAY	The history of coastal catastrophic floods was reconstructed for the first time using the geochemical proxy in shelf sediments. The reconstruction is based on the identification of sediment layers accumulated on the shelf during the intensive discharge of the river runoff suspended matter from the land which does not contain bromine. The set of isotopic (AMS C-14, Pb-210, Cs-137), tephrastratigraphic, and paleomagnetic methods was used for the detailed chronology of sediments. The scanning of chemical composition of sediments with the step of 0.5-0.8 mm is performed using the synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence in the VEPP-3 storage of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences. The history of catastrophic floods for the past 1800 years is reconstructed based on the typical variations in bromine concentration in one of the cores from the Amur Bay (the Sea of Japan). New methodological approaches to the flood signal extraction are proposed. The revealed inverse correlation between the frequency of floods caused by typhoons over the coast of the Sea of Japan and southern China agrees with the existing assumption on the change in their trajectories in different periods of global climate change.

Recent Warming of Landfalling Atmospheric Rivers Along the West Coast of the United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						atmospheric rivers; regional climate change; Western United States; rain versus snow	NORTH PACIFIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; CALIFORNIA; WINTER; SNOW; VARIABILITY; MOISTURE; CONNECTION; PROJECTION	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) often generate extreme precipitation, with AR temperature strongly influencing hydrologic impacts by altering the timing and magnitude of runoff. Long-term changes in AR temperatures therefore have important implications for regional hydroclimate-especially in locations where a shift to more rain-dominated AR precipitation could affect flood risk and/or water storage in snowpack. In this study, we provide the first climatology of AR temperature across five U.S. West Coast subregions. We then assess trends in landfalling AR temperatures for each subregion from 1980 to 2016 using three reanalysis products. We find AR warming at seasonal and monthly scales. Cool-season warming ranges from 0.69 to 1.65 degrees C over the study period. We detect monthly scale warming of >2 degrees C, with the most widespread warming occurring in November and March. To understand the causes of AR warming, we quantify the density of AR tracks from genesis to landfall and analyze along-track AR temperature for each month and landfall region. We investigate three possible influences on AR temperature trends at landfall: along-track temperatures prior to landfall, background temperatures over the landfall region, and AR temperature over the coastal ocean adjacent to the region of landfall. Generally, AR temperatures at landfall more closely match coastal and background temperature trends than along-track AR temperature trends. The seasonal asymmetry of the AR warming and the heterogeneity of influences have important implications for regional water storage and flood risk-demonstrating that changes in AR characteristics are complex and may not be directly inferred from changes in the background climate. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric river (AR) storms are well known for their ability to accumulate snowpack, provide drought relief, and generate extreme precipitation and flooding along the West Coast of the United States. AR temperature is an important variable for determining the water resource impacts of a given event, such as the ratio of rain to snow delivered by an individual storm. As a result, changes in AR temperature have implications for both water storage and flood risk. We find substantial warming in ARs at both the seasonal and monthly scales, as well as seasonal and regional variations in the amount of warming along the U.S. West Coast. To understand the warming of ARs at the landfall regions, we compare these trends with trends in temperature along the AR tracks, background temperature over the landfall region, and temperature over the coastal ocean adjacent to the landfall region. The most robust warming occurs in November and March, which has important implications for increased regional flood risk and decreased water storage, and motivates further investigation in other AR-prone regions around the globe.

J	Zhang, JH; Yang, L; Yu, M; Chen, XD				Zhang, Jinghan; Yang, Long; Yu, Miao; Chen, Xiaodong			Response of Extreme Rainfall to Atmospheric Warming and Wetting: Implications for Hydrologic Designs Under a Changing Climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						extreme rainfall; moisture content; temperature; sensitivity; PMP; China	PROBABLE MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION; FUTURE CHANGES; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; SPATIAL EXTENT; WRF MODEL; FLOOD; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; EVENT; SCALE	Understanding the processes of rainfall extremes and their response to anthropogenic climate change is pivotal for improved adaptation of unprecedented flood hazards around the world. Here we take the record-breaking 20 July 2021 storm over central China as an example. We investigate the response of this particular storm to atmospheric warming (i.e., increase in air temperature) and wetting (i.e., increase in atmospheric moisture content) based on a series of convection-permitting model simulations. Our results show non-monotonic changes of the space-time rainfall variability to either increased temperature or atmospheric moisture content. The most extreme rain rate is produced when relative humidity is increased by 20%-40% or temperature is increased by less than 2 degrees C. The non-monotonic rainfall response is more clearly revealed at fine spatial (100-1,000 km(2)) and temporal scales (less than 6 hr) rather than over the entire domain (similar to 10(4) km(2)) and aggregated over the storm duration (around 2 days). This is mainly attributable to the distinct feedbacks from atmospheric dynamics (i.e., moisture convergence and interaction with regional topography) rather than regulated by thermodynamic changes alone. Atmospheric warming poses notable changes in the vertical structure of storm cells, contributing to reduced areal reduction factors at small spatial scales and short durations, while atmospheric wetting additionally modifies storm evolution properties. Our modeling analyses challenge the existing practices for hydrologic designs under a changing climate, highlighting particular vulnerability for cities or small basins to short-duration rainfall extremes and the resultant flash flood hazards. Plain Language Summary Understanding rainfall extremes and their response to climate change plays a pivotal role in improved hydrologic designs and flood adaptation strategies. In this study, the 20 July 2021 storm that produced record-breaking rainfall over central China is used to examine the response of rainfall extremes to atmospheric warming and wetting (i.e., increase in air temperature and atmospheric moisture content, respectively) through a series of high-resolution model simulations. Our results find that the coverage of heavy rainfall and peak rain rate show non-monotonic changes with either atmospheric warming or wetting. It is tied to modified atmospheric dynamics in the changing storm environment. Insights into rainfall processes at finer spatial scales and shorter durations reveal more details about the factors that dictate the non-monotonic responses. We imply that it is not safe to adopt conventional practices in hydrologic designs, including the estimation of probably maximum precipitation, areal reduction factors for hypothetical extreme storms (or design storms). We also highlight the great sensitivities of short-duration rainfall extremes due to changes in either temperature or moisture content. This would pose great challenges to safe designs for cities or small basins that are particularly vulnerable to these types of hydrological extremes.

Fish living in lakes and their habitat quality are significant indicators of the overall health of the lake ecosystem. In recent years, the impact of climate change and human activities on lake habitats has become an important research topic. In this paper, using fish as an indicator species, the habitat factors of lake fish were classified into hydrological factors, water quality factors, topographic and substrate factors, and biological factors, based on which the influence mechanism of each factor of the lake habitat system on fish was sorted out. We used the VOSviewer bibliometric analysis tool to visualize the knowledge map and identify current research hotspots and development trends related to simulation and assessment methods for lake fish habitats. Additionally, we reviewed the research progress of four types of lake habitat models. Based on the current research perspectives and shortcomings, a research framework for assessing the risk of lake habitat degradation is proposed, which consists of four parts. This framework could establish a theoretical foundation for the protection and restoration of lake ecosystems.

Better floodplain management in and near urban areas is required to produce the New Urban Agenda's 'just, safe, healthy, accessible, affordable, resilient and sustainable cities'. Many jurisdictions are looking to move or keep people out of human-constructed residential 'niches' on hazardous floodplains, but this has proved difficult to achieve. Our historical case studies of colonial societies in ancient Rome, as well as on the Yangtze, Mississippi and Brisbane rivers, show the deep roots of many contemporary flood risk issues, such as failures of risk perception related to recent settlement, the moral hazard of spending on flood defence infrastructure, the creeping nature of floodplain encroachment into 'niches' of perceived protection created by structural interventions, the need for a central, 'whole of river' approach, and the difficulties of implementing this approach locally. These case studies also suggest solutions, including the adoption of Indigenous perspectives, benefits to incentivise local actors and a historical education strategy to increase appetite for more sustainable flood risk mitigation.

Traditional risk assessment methods are mostly based on experts' experience and focus on just one type of failure mode of flood defensive structures. The risk resources, including the analytical factors and non-analytical factors, were summarized firstly according to the general experience of dikes. The uncertainty of the resources that affect dike safety can be quantified by membership degree. Hence, a fuzzy influence diagram based on fuzzy mathematics was proposed to assess the safety of the dikes. We evaluated the multi-failure modes at the same time by a fuzzy influence diagram. Taking a dike as an example, the expected value of the dike failure was 6.25%. Furthermore, the chance of damage to this dike was "very unlikely" according to the descriptive term of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The evaluation result was obtained as a probabilistic value, which enabled an intuitive perception of the safety of the dikes. Therefore, we provided some reasonable suggestions for project management and regular maintenance. Since the proposed method can account for uncertainties, it is well suited for the risk assessment of dikes with obvious uncertainties.

In order to this conflict resolution, in this paper a new methodology is proposed based on game theoretic approach by using Nash equilibrium method, that for the first time, the payoff functions of insurance companies and government have been associated to each other. In this method, according to maximization of player's payoffs, the best response has been found and for the first time, comprehensive financial model has been developed for sharing players' financial responsibilities in flood risk management plans. In order to increase the accuracy of flood insurance calculations, the parameters of deductible and franchise have been applied. The key findings indicate, success of flood risk management plans depend on purchasing flood insurance with full coverage and government financial assistances simultaneously. The developed flood insurance plan has most sensitivity to parameters of deductible and insurance rate. This model could be utilized as practical and academic model in flood risk management. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in Northeast of Tehran as capital of Iran.

Based on the survey data of 327 residents in Wenchuan and Lushan County, Sichuan earthquake-stricken areas in 2019, the research analyzed the influence of peer effects on disaster preparedness and its mechanism by using instrumental variable method. The results show that: (1) the level of disaster preparedness of residents in the earthquake-stricken areas still needs to be improved, with the highest level of important items placement preparation and the lowest level of disaster insurance preparedness; (2) convergence effect is the key path for peer household to influence other families' disaster preparedness; (3) the general public learn from opinion leader to take disaster Insurance preparedness, important items placement preparation and house reinforcement preparation. Based on this, it is recommended to select model residents who are well prepared for disaster preparedness. Establishing a platform for communication between opinion leaders and the general public as well as preventing inaction of opinion leaders. The findings of this study can provide a reference for improving disaster prevention and mitigation policies.

Unequal Retreats: How Racial Segregation Shapes Climate Adaptation	HOUSING POLICY DEBATE			English	Article						Urban environment; Urban planning; Spatial; Neighborhood; Mobility	MANAGED RETREAT; ECOLOGY; HOUSTON; STATE	Recent research on climate adaptation points to the need to take flood control seriously as a state-led process that organizes and responds to the racial and environmental spaces of cities. The present study advances that agenda by focusing on the federally funded retreat of homes and residents from flood-prone urban neighborhoods. While officially organized by rational engineering and technocratic calculations, its implementation cannot escape the racialized landscapes of U.S. cities. To illustrate, we review how a century of unequal environmental planning and housing policy has forged today's racialized urban landscapes. Then, we turn to the federal government's entrance into those landscapes via its policy of managed retreat that purchases flood-prone homes and returns them to nature. Here we draw on nationwide data to reveal the policy's increasing urban orientation. We then present evidence from Houston to reveal how the racial composition and turnover of local neighborhoods influence program implementation and subsequent relocation. While not every city may experience the same racialized patterns as Houston, they will exhibit some patterns due to the powerful social and environmental force that race has long exerted in U.S. cities. Failing to account for that force will compromise efforts to adapt effectively to climate change.

In parallel, urban centres are also expected to grow significantly in the next years, making necessary to implement the adequate mechanisms to tackle such threats, more specifically flooding. This project aims to develop a flood prediction system using a combination of Machine Learning classifiers along with GIS techniques to be used as an effective tool for urban management and resilience planning. This approach can establish sensible factors and risk indices for the occurrence of floods at the city level, which could be instrumental for outlining a long-term strategy for Smart Cities. The most performant Machine Learning model was a Random Forest, with a Matthew?s Correlation Coefficient of 0.77 and an Accuracy of 0.96. To support and extend the capabilities of the Machine Learning model, a GIS model was developed to find areas with higher likelihood of being flooded under critical weather conditions. Therefore, hot spots were defined for the entire city given the observed flood history. The scores obtained from the Random Forest model and the Hot Spot analysis were then combined to create a flood risk index.

Global-scale benefit-cost analysis of coastal flood adaptation to different flood risk drivers using structural measures	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; LAND SUBSIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROTECTION; WATER; RIVER; REANALYSIS; FRAMEWORK; EXPOSURE; DAMAGE	Coastal flood hazard and exposure are expected to increase over the course of the 21st century, leading to increased coastal flood risk. In order to limit the increase in future risk, or even reduce coastal flood risk, adaptation is necessary. Here, we present a framework to evaluate the future benefits and costs of structural protection measures at the global scale, which accounts for the influence of different flood risk drivers (namely sea-level rise, subsidence, and socioeconomic change). Globally, we find that the estimated expected annual damage (EAD) increases by a factor of 150 between 2010 and 2080 if we assume that no adaptation takes place. We find that 15 countries account for approximately 90% of this increase. We then explore four different adaptation objectives and find that they all show high potential in cost-effectively reducing (future) coastal flood risk at the global scale. Attributing the total costs for optimal protection standards, we find that sea-level rise contributes the most to the total costs of adaptation. However, the other drivers also play an important role. The results of this study can be used to highlight potential savings through adaptation at the global scale.

This study characterised planform changes and floodplain dynamics of the Tana River fluvial systems, Kenya, between 1975 and 2017 using an integrated remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) methodological framework. The river has witnessed significant alterations in channel morphology over a period of 42 years, indicating a highly active and meandering nature with a generally rising sinuosity in the downstream direction. The annual lateral river movement rate reduced significantly after the river regulation, which occurred between 1981 and 1988. Land cover change detection of the study reaches revealed tremendous spatial and temporal progressive disappearance of the riparian vegetation and dynamic channel morphological characteristics, trends that may continue in the coming years. The approach adopted in this study can be applied to other river reaches within study area with similar protocols or modifications according channel type and reach condition to provide water managers with evidence on the dynamic fluvial channel plan morphology for sustainable planning management and restoration activities.

It also explored the challenges faced by the community for providing healthcare and referring the pregnant women experiencing complications during flood disaster. Three focus group discussions (FGDs) and eight in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in the marginalized rural communities in the flood-prone Khaliajhuri sub-district, Netrakona district, Bangladesh. Flood is one of the major risk factors for influencing maternal death. Pregnant women seriously suffer from maternal complications, lack of antenatal checkup, and lack of doctors during flooding. During the time of delivery, it is difficult to find a skilled attendant, and referring the patient with delivery complications to the healthcare facility. Boats are the only mode of transport. The majority of maternal deaths occur on the boats during transfer from the community to the hospital. Rural people feel that the maternal deaths influenced by natural disaster are natural phenomena. Pre-preparation is needed to support pregnant women during disasters. There is unawareness of maternal health, related care, and complications during disasters among local health service providers and volunteers.	[Abdullah, Abu Sayeed Md.; Halim, Abdul; Rahman, A. K.

The research was carried out in the Vistula River valley (Poland) in an area of shallow groundwater occurrence, defined as a Groundwater-Dependent Ecosystem area. The goal of this study was to identify the average, maximum, and minimum depths of the groundwater table for variant assessment of groundwater vulnerability to contamination. The variants correspond to the average vulnerability, the vulnerability during hydrogeological drought, and the vulnerability during the flood risk period. Theoretical and effective weights of vulnerability parameters were calculated using the DRASTIC method. Vulnerability maps constructed for the various vulnerability variants and by using different parameter weights show the spatial variability of the individual vulnerability classes. Due to the specifics of this protected area, the expected dependency between vulnerability index and chloride concentrations in the monitoring points was not found. Comparison showed strong dependency of water chemistry and the value of recharge, lithology of aquifer, and unsaturated zone. The research results confirm the need for variant vulnerability assessment to protect against floods or predict the effects of climate change.

Here, a statistical approach for describing the dynamics of monthly snow depth loss (SDL) is developed and tested in 67 climate stations throughout southern Canada. The framework fuses an input selection scheme with multiple linear regression to approximate the SDL using a set of climate proxies, either explicitly or implicitly through modeling snow depth. Our findings suggest that statistical models-if properly developed and used-have the potential to form effective tools for describing the dynamics of SDL. In particular, the implicit statistical model, in which climate proxies are selected globally among all stations, provides an accurate model (expected R2=0.75), which can outperform a frequently-used temperature-index model in a majority of stations. In addition, parameters of the statistical model can be regionalized efficiently (expected R2=0.71 for the generalized model) using latitude, longitude, and altitude. This ability can provide a basis to extend the model application into ungauged sites.

Cabbage is one economically important vegetable that is likely to be affected by increased flooding in Europe. This review investigates the potential of biostimulant applications based on algae extracts, amino acids, microorganisms, and nano-CaCO3 to assist cabbage plants subjected to waterlogged conditions. The overall findings from the studies reviewed indicate that these biostimulants could aid plants suffering from anoxic stress due to waterlogging through their ability to improve nutrient availability and plant nutrient status, modulate phytohormones and phytohormone signalling, increase compatible solutes, and enhance the antioxidant system. The effect of biostimulants is influenced by multiple factors; therefore, field studies are required to determine the most valuable biostimulant combination and application dose, type, and timing for cabbage, as well as any economic benefits that could arise. More precise information would benefit food producers by providing them with additional adaptation tools to use in a changing climate as well as natural products that are compatible with the agriculture sector's transition to more sustainable and ecological management.

For this purpose, a time series spanning 54 years (1963-2017) was processed and filtered for one (yearly averages), four, and twelve (monthly averages) elements per year. In addition, possible climate teleconnections were verified through the SOI, TSA, and AMM indices for the same period, resulting in non-existent or weak correlations. MSL trends were calculated using first, second, and third-degree polynomials. Sea level projections for 2100 were compared with scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The lowest MSL rising rate, 2.42 mm/year, was determined through linear regression (first-degree polynomial), with a slight deceleration from 1989 to 2016 (1.93 mm/year). The contours of possible future coastlines of the southern Rio de Janeiro area were drawn, illustrating the implications of shoreline retreat ranging between similar to 40 and similar to 500 m by 2100. In general, the projection for the end of this century points to relevant impacts on the studied area, including breaching the Marambaia barrier island central sector, where an opening as wide as 12-14 km could develop.

Since the 1990s, the advances have caused the formation of ice-dammed Dan & PRIME; Zhur Lake, which has filled and drained in summers following a surge event. Here, we report how these drainages initially occur through a subglacial channel under the glacier terminus, which then typically closes the following winter, enabling another lake to form and drain the next summer. However, our remote sensing and field observations indicate that after several drainage events, a subaerial ice canyon is formed through the glacier terminus, which prevents another lake from forming until after the glacier surges again. We predict that the next surge of Dan & PRIME; Zhur Glacier will occur around the mid-2020s, causing the formation of a larger Dan & PRIME; Zhur Lake during the following quiescent phase because, despite periodic advances, a long-term trend of glacier recession is exposing a larger basin for the lake to form in. However, each subsequent surge is causing less terminus advance than the previous one, until ultimately the surges will be insufficient to dam Dan & PRIME; Zhur Chu' (Donjek River), and lakes will cease to form.

We expected to find (i) lower temporal environmental variability and lower beta diversity among months during the prolonged drought period, and (ii) a more pronounced decrease in beta diversity for aquatic organisms with active dispersal (fish) than for small organisms with passive dispersal (phytoplankton and zooplankton) during the prolonged drought period. We estimated the beta diversity among months using the Sorensen and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and their components separately for each lake and each period. We used paired t tests to compare the periods. Although the prolonged drought reduced environmental variability, the homogenization of biota was dependent on the considered beta diversity component. In the face of climate change and a higher frequency of severe droughts, biotic variability can decrease over time, thereby changing the dynamics of floodplain ecosystems. We emphasize the importance of natural flood events for maintaining environmental variability and ecosystem functioning in floodplains.

Its main potential lies in the provision of services including increasing economic yield in agriculture and providing anti-erosion measures. The main objective of this research is to assess the perception of the providing ecosystem services of woody plants growing in agroforestry by farmers as key land users in the Czech Republic. Different aspects influencing farmers' subjective perceptions were identified, especially depending on conventional versus organic farming methods. Respondents' views were mapped using a structured questionnaire, which allowed for independently assessing the importance of windbreaks. Respondents considered regulatory ecosystem services the most important ones, in particular reducing soil erosion and flood risk, or increasing the resilience of the landscape to drought. Respondents perceived the physical obstruction of trees during mechanical tillage and the tenancy relationship with the land as the most significant problem with the introduction of agroforestry systems. The aim of this study is to promote innovative approaches in the national agricultural strategy in agroforestry as one of the tools for climate change adaptation towards sustainable agricultural production.

Urbanizing the floodplain: global changes of imperviousness in flood-prone areas	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						urbanization; floodplain; flood exposure; global flood modeling; big data	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESOLUTION; URBANIZATION; HAZARD; VALIDATION; EXPANSION; IMPACTS; WATER; RISK	Cities have historically developed close to rivers and coasts, increasing human exposure to flooding. That exposure is exacerbated by changes in climate and population, and by urban encroachment on floodplains. Although the mechanisms of how urbanization affects flooding are relatively well understood, there have been limited efforts to assess the magnitude of floodplain encroachment globally and how it has changed in both space and time. Highly resolved global datasets of both flood hazard and changes in urban area from 1985 to 2015 are now available, enabling the reconstruction of the history of floodplain encroachment at high spatial resolutions. Here we show that the urbanized area in floodplains that have an average probability of flooding of 1/100 years, has almost doubled since 1985. Further, the rate of urban expansion into these floodplains increased by a factor of 1.5 after the year 2000. We also find that urbanization rates were highest in the most hazardous areas of floodplains, with population growth in these urban floodplains suggesting an accompanying increase in population density. These results reveal the scope, trajectory and extent of global floodplain encroachment. With tangible implications for flood risk management, these data could be directly used with integrated models to assess adaptation pathways for urban flooding.

Integrated multi-scalar analysis of vulnerability to environmental hazards: Assessing extreme flooding in western Amazonia	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Vulnerability; Environmental hazards; Flooding; Peruvian Amazon	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL NETWORKS; UCAYALI RIVER; RURAL POOR; POVERTY; COMMUNITIES; CULTIVATION; RISK; ACCESSIBILITY; LIVELIHOODS	Environmental change is significantly altering hydrological systems worldwide, with substantial impacts for the people who live on floodplains and depend on rivers for their livelihoods and lifeways. Amazonia is a region significantly affected by these changes, particularly more severe flooding. This paper proposes a multi-scalar approach to vulnerability, applying it empirically to the analysis of household vulnerability to the 2011 flood --the second largest flood event along the Ucayali River in 30 years-in terms of exposure, impacts, and re-sponses. Locally relevant indicators for assets, social identity, and social networks at the community and household levels are used to examine their role in shaping flood vulnerability, the interplay of community-level and household-level factors, and differential vulnerability across exposure, impacts, and responses to the same hazard event. We find that the most common impacts of severe flooding in rural Amazonia are on agriculture and that fishing is the dominant response strategy. This study suggests that covariate shocks, like floods, can have distinct idiosyncratic impacts and responses among households. We demonstrate that more integrated ap-proaches to vulnerability analysis offer potential for better understanding differential vulnerabilities within populations as well as for drawing comparisons across hazard events and different settings.

Three groups of stakeholders were individually surveyed during September-December 2020: (i) 72 farmers, (ii) 15 officials, and (iii) 14 academicians. We used descriptive statistical analysis, cross-tabulation and the Fisher test to explore the pattern of responses across the groups. The main problems in the canal water distribution system were expressed by the farmers as limited water allocation, while academicians were concerned mostly with inflexibility and officials indicated discussion among neighbors. According to the farmers' responses, the conventional depth/interval of irrigation is flooding the field with water and observing the plants, indicating over-irrigation behavior. Moreover, the most important barriers in the adaptation of the interventions that were highly rated by the three groups were low awareness, lack of training and financial resources. Additionally, farmers' education revealed a statistically significant influence on awareness of soil moisture sensors and water storage facilities, while large farm holders showed a positive relationship to conducting a joint experiment with scientists and farmers' associations on part of their land to improve water use efficiency.

The escalation in the intensity and number of flooding events as a result of the combination of climate change and anthropogenic factors motivates the need to adopt real-time solutions for mapping flood hazards and risks. In this study, a methodological framework is proposed that enables the assessment of flood hazard and risk levels of severity dynamically by fusing optical remote sensing (Sentinel-1) and GIS-based data from the region of the Trieste, Monfalcone and Muggia Municipalities. Explainable machine learning techniques were utilised, aiming to interpret the results for the assessment of flood hazard. The flood inventory was randomly divided into 70%, used for training, and 30%, employed for testing. Various combinations of the models were evaluated for the assessment of flood hazard. The results revealed that the Random Forest model achieved the highest F1-score (approx. 0.99), among others utilised for generating flood hazard maps. Furthermore, the estimation of the flood risk was achieved by a combination of a rule-based approach to estimate the exposure and vulnerability with the dynamic assessment of flood hazard.

Therefore, atmospheric-hydrological modeling, which could effectively extend the forecast period and support related research in regions lacking precipitation data, has received increasing attention in relation to urban hydrology. In this study, considering more comprehensive optimization of the physical parameterization schemes of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, an atmospheric-hydrological modeling system based on the WRF model and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was proposed and applied to Beijing's sub-center. Results showed that the cumulus parameterization scheme has greatest impact on simulation of heavy rainfall. Overall, the combination of the WRF Single Moment 5-class scheme, Grell-Freitas scheme, Yonsei University scheme, the newer version of the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model, Revised MM5 Monin-Obukhov scheme, Noah land surface model, and the Urban canopy model produced the best performance.

Two types of analysis were applied (i.e., spatial data and non-spatial data analysis) at four river basin areas in Central Java-Indonesia. The spatial analysis is focused on the assessment of LULC change in 2009-2018 based on Landsat Imagery. The non-spatial data (i.e., rural-urban classification and flood events) were overlaid with results of spatial data analyses. Our findings show that urbanization, as indicated by the growth rate of built-up areas, is very significant. Notable exposure to flood has taken place in the urban and potentially urban areas. The emerging discussion indicates that river basins possess dual spatial identity in the urban system (policy- and land-use-related). Proper land use planning and control is an essential instrument to safeguard urban areas (such as the case study area) and the entire island of Java in Indonesia. More attention should be put upon the river basin areas in designing eco-based approach to tackle the urban flood crises. In this case, the role of governance in flood management is crucial.

Although the contributions of increase in rainfall intensity to larger total rainfall amounts have been extensively examined, observational evidence on impacts of the recently reported but still debated long-term slowdown of TCs on local total rainfall amounts is limited. Here, we find that both observations and the multimodel ensemble of Global Climate Model simulations show a significant slowdown of TCs (11% in observations and 10% in simulations, respectively) from 1961 to 2017 over the coast of China. Our analyses of long-term observations find a significant increase in the 90th percentile of TCinduced local rainfall totals and significant inverse relationships between TC translation speeds and local rainfall totals over the study period. The study also shows that TCs with lower translation speed and higher rainfall totals occurred more frequently after 1990 in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Our probability analysis indicates that slow-moving TCs are more likely to generate heavy rainfall of higher total amounts than fast-moving TCs. Our findings suggest that slowdown of TCs tends to elevate local rainfall totals and thus impose greater flood risks at the regional scale.

J	Hudson, P				Hudson, Paul			The Affordability of Flood Risk Property-Level Adaptation Measures	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Affordability; flood risk; social justice; risk reduction	DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INSURANCE; REDUCTION; POLICY; FUTURE; EXPERIENCE; HOUSEHOLDS	The affordability of property-level adaptation measures against flooding is crucial due to the movement toward integrated flood risk management, which requires the individuals threatened by flooding to actively manage flooding. It is surprising to find that affordability is not often discussed, given the important roles that affordability and social justice play regarding flood risk management. This article provides a starting point for investigating the potential rate of unaffordability of flood risk property-level adaptation measures across Europe using two definitions of affordability, which are combined with two different affordability thresholds from within flood risk research. It uses concepts of investment and payment affordability, with affordability thresholds based on residual income and expenditure definitions of unaffordability. These concepts, in turn, are linked with social justice through fairness concerns, in that, all should have equal capability to act, of which affordability is one avenue. In doing so, it was found that, for a large proportion of Europe, property owners generally cannot afford to make one-time payment of the cost of protective measures. These can be made affordable with installment payment mechanisms or similar mechanisms that spread costs over time. Therefore, the movement toward greater obligations for flood-prone residents to actively adapt to flooding should be accompanied by socially accessible financing mechanisms.

At Mubarraz, near Abu Dhabi in the Arabian Gulf, mass plantings of >500 000 nursery-reared seedlings of the mangrove Avicennia marina were conducted over 30 years in response to erosion of an artificially created, 17-km-long causeway of dredged material. Planting efforts resulted in successfully established mangrove vegetation along 6.7 km of shoreline, covering an area of 16.5 ha. Survival rates of planted mangrove seedlings to healthy saplings or trees were in the order of 26% averaged over all years, with best results obtained at planting sites established in artificial tidal channels excavated parallel to the causeway, ensuring appropriate tidal hydrological conditions. The mangroves and causeway have attracted a high diversity of birds (48 species), some of which breed on the island, and there are significant densities of crabs and gastropod snails in the mangroves. These results demonstrate that planting mangroves on dredged material is feasible (even under extreme climatic conditions) and may offer a cost-effective alternative for shoreline protection, with added benefits for biodiversity through the creation of new habitats.

The aim of the government is to reduce the vulnerability of these areas by relocating property and infrastructure. These measures have, however, come up against considerable opposition from the population concerned. Using a survey of 421 inhabitants of Hyeres, a coastal town in the South of France, this article proposes the study of resistance to relocation through the creation of an index for resistance that incorporates attachment to place, residential mobility and risk perception. The results show a correlation for the index and distance from the sea that highlights the existence of conflicting interests with adaptation measures depending upon population categories. Key policy insights In France, although coastal flooding risk is a key issue in numerous populated coastal areas, coastal dwellers show little willingness to relocate. Resistance to relocation can be assessed through a composite index integrating place attachment, residential mobility and risk perception. Application of such an index shows a correlation between willingness to relocate and distance from the sea. Conflicts of interest with adaptation measures also depend on the age of the dwellers, their standard of living and on home ownership.

Quantifying related risks is, therefore, an important societal task, particularly in view of future climate change. For this task, climate risk assessment increasingly uses model chains, which mainly build on data from the last few decades. The past record of events could play a role in this context. New numerical techniques can make use of historical weather data to simulate impacts quantitatively. However, using historical data for model applications differs from using recent products. Here, we provide an overview of climate risk assessment methodologies and of the properties of historical instrumental and documentary data. Using three examples, we then outline how historical environmental data can be used today in climate risk assessment by (1) developing and validating numerical model chains, (2) providing a large statistical sample which can be directly exploited to estimate hazards and to model present risks, and (3) establishing "worst-case" events which are relevant references in the present or future. The examples show that, in order to be successful, different sources (reanalyses, digitized instrumental data, and documentary data) and methods (dynamical downscaling and analog methods) need to be combined on a case-by-case basis.

J	Herbeck, J; Flitner, M				Herbeck, Johannes; Flitner, Michael			Infrastructuring coastal futures: Key trajectories in Southeast Asian megacities	ERDE			English	Article						infrastructure; adaptation planning; securitization; greening; waterfront development	SINGAPORE; POLITICS	The search for suitable adaptation pathways to accommodate for rising sea levels resulting from global climate change is an ongoing concern for many megacities in Southeast Asia and beyond. Addressing already existing challenges resulting from land subsidence and increased occurrence of inland flooding, adaptation can take varied forms and cover widely differing concerns, spaces and time spans. Based on research carried out in the cities of Singapore, Jakarta (Indonesia), and Manila (Philippines), this paper looks at some key trajectories of current adaptation planning. We argue that the processes of infrastructuring coastal futures in these cities are characterized by different aims and measures that overlap and converge in their material effects but also compete in articulating diverging new claims to the coast. In this perspective, we describe and analyze three main trends of infrastructuring coastal futures: the securitization of coastal futures by way of transforming disaster risk reduction practices and integrating new policy concerns, the greening of coastal spaces in material and operational terms, and finally, the valorization of coastal areas through reclamation, waterfront development and the creation of high-end real estate. Along these three trajectories, coastal adaptation planning becomes a key force that can influence virtually every sector of urban development and governance, and has strong implications for the futures of coastal cities in social and political terms.

In this study, the variability and trends of extreme precipitation in both time and space in the Poyang Lake basin over the period of 1960-2012 are analyzed. Also, changes in precipitation extremes with topography are investigated, and possible causes are briefly discussed. The results show that extreme precipitation over the Poyang Lake basin is intensified during the last 50years, especially the increasing trends are more significant before the end of the 1990s. Moreover, high contribution rates of extreme precipitation to the total rainfall (40-60%) indicated that extreme precipitation plays an important role to the total water resources in this area. The precipitation extremes also exhibited a significant spatial dependence in the basin. The northeastern and eastern areas are exposed to high risk of flood disaster with the higher frequency of extreme precipitation events. In addition, the distribution of precipitation extremes had a clear dependence on elevation, and the topography is an important factor affecting the variability of extreme precipitation over the Poyang Lake basin.

In this study, three periods of land-use data were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of land-use changes in different urbanization periods. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was then coupled with the MIKE model to analyze the total effects of land-use changes on watershed flood during different urbanization periods in the Qianshan River Basin, China, including both the direct and indirect effects. In addition, the previous research methods that only consider the direct effects were evaluated by quantifying the proportions of the direct and indirect effects, so as to provide more scientific ideas and references for future related research. The results show that land-use changes increase the peak water level, peak flow, submergence areas, and risk areas in both the pre- and posturbanization period, with the increase in posturbanization exceeding that in preurbanization. This is consistent with the temporal characteristics of urban expansion in the Qianshan River Basin. Moreover, the proportions of the direct and indirect effects of land-use changes on the peak water level and peak discharge are similar, while the direct effects on the submergence and risk areas dominate those of the indirect effects. When only considering the direct effects, the increases in peak water level, peak discharge, submergence areas, and risk areas are reduced by 45%-55%, 57%-62%, 23%, and 19%, respectively. Therefore, both the direct effects and indirect effects of land-use changes must be considered in future related research.

Effect of Drought and Heavy Precipitation on CH<sub>4</sub> Emissions and δ<SUP>13</SUP>C-CH<sub>4</sub> in a Northern Temperate Peatland	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Methane emissions; Peatlands; Wetlands; Stable isotopes; Drought; Precipitation; Methanogenesis; Methanotrophy	STABLE-ISOTOPE DISTRIBUTION; METHANE EMISSIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BOREAL; FEN; FLUX; METHANOGENESIS; PERMAFROST; OXIDATION; PATHWAYS	Shifting precipitation patterns due to climate change may impact peatland methane (CH4) emissions, as precipitation affects water table level which largely controls CH4 cycling. To investigate the impact of variable precipitation on peatland CH4 emissions, we measured CH4 fluxes and their C-13 isotope composition (delta C-13-CH4) across two summers marked by drought (2020) and heavy precipitation (2021) in a northern temperate poor fen in New Hampshire, USA. Monthly variation in CH4 fluxes and delta C-13-CH4 was larger than interannual variation and variation between peatland microforms. While the seasonal pattern of CH4 emissions was not significantly different between years, the magnitude of seasonal changes in CH4 flux and delta C-13-CH4 provided insight regarding the processes controlling CH4 emissions. Between July and August 2020, water table levels dropped > 15 cm, CH4 emissions decreased by an order of magnitude, and delta C-13-CH4 increased similar to 10 parts per thousand, suggesting lower water table levels promoted CH4 oxidation and reduced emissions in late summer. Rainstorms in July 2021 caused flooding and stimulated high CH4 emissions, but the impact of increased water table levels due to heavy precipitation on CH4 fluxes was transient and did not have an apparent effect on emitted delta C-13-CH4. While drought conditions had a clear impact on CH4 fluxes and delta C-13-CH4, our results suggest rainstorms and subsequent flooding do not have a sustained impact on CH4 emissions from temperate peatlands.

Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) is a remote sensing technology that generates high-resolution topographic data and can therefore produce higher accuracy floodplain maps, an important tool that communities use to assess their flood risk. Despite the promise of lidar for flood risk mitigation, both the availability of lidar data and the use of that data when available varies across the U.S. What factors drive the adoption of technology, such as lidar, for flood risk management? How can we better promote the use of technologies when available? Previous research has identified the importance of various factors in flood risk management, such as risk perception, direct experience, and knowledge of future risk. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how peer influence impacts an individual's choices about how to manage risk. In this study, we examine the adoption of lidar by flood risk managers for risk mitigation, as a function of several factors including risk perception, direct experience, and social networks. We conducted semistructured interviews with flood risk managers in Idaho to inform the development of an online survey for flood risk managers in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Using this survey, we found that flood risk managers who share information with others using lidar are also more likely to use lidar themselves. Furthermore, the more frequently these flood managers communicate, the stronger this peer influence is. This research demonstrates the potential for harnessing social networks to help communities more effectively adapt to changing flood risk hazards.

In the present study, we have utilized the RClimDex software to compute the trend in temperature and precipitation extreme events in the Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, India, from 1980 to 2018. We employed both Mann-Kendall test and linear regression to test the statistical significance of the computed trend. Out of 13 temperature indices, 8 showed a significant trend while the remaining showed a non-significant trend. The annual mean maximum temperature, warm days, diurnal temperature range and a monthly minimum of maximum temperature had decreased significantly by 0.029 & DEG;C, 0.159 days, 0.032 & DEG;C and 0.122 & DEG;C/yr respectively, whereas cool days and cold spell duration had increased significantly by 0.264 & DEG;C and 0.372 days/yr respectively, indicating an increased cooling effect over the study area. Similarly, out of the 11 rainfall indices, only two showed a significant trend, while the remaining showed a nonsignificant trend. The increasing drought over the study area is evident as the number of rainy days and consecutive wet days have decreased significantly by 0.262 days and 0.058 days/yr respectively, with a non-significant increase in consecutive dry days during the same period. The weak negative non-significant trend of a maximum of five consecutive days of rainfall, very heavy rainfall days and total annual precipitation indicate the decreasing trend of floods. This study stresses the development of adaptation plans to overcome the adverse consequences of extreme weather events in Varanasi district.

Therefore, water tankers are used for the dewatering process to take the extra rainwater from the streets to keep a smooth flow of vehicles and to use the water in agriculture and industry. Water is taken to a water treatment plant. Performing the dewatering process as fast as possible, especially in crowded streets, was ignored by researchers. In this study, at first, the problem was solved using two mixed integer programming (MIP) models. A new variant of identical parallel machine scheduling with job splitting is proposed for the first time, where one or at most two tankers can work at the same flood location at the same time. This is performed in the second model. However, the first model considers dividing the dewatering processes into two phases, where the first one, which is more urgent, is to reduce the amount of floodwater. The second one is for dewatering the rest of the water. Then two genetic algorithms (GAs) were used to solve faster the two MIP models, which are NP-hard problems. At first, the MIP and GA models were applied to small-sized problems. Then GA was used for large practical data sets. Results showed that for small problems, MIP and GA gave optimal solutions in a reasonable number of iterations, while for larger problems, good solutions were obtained in a reasonable number of iterations.

This paper presents the scaling of floods (duration, peak, volume) with geomorphologic characteristics of the basin (i.e., drainage area, slope, elevation) and precipitation patterns (rainfall accumulation, variability). Long-term daily streamflow observations over the 20th and early 21st centuries from Hydro-Climatic Data Network streamgages across the conterminous United States are used to create a flood event database based on their flood stage information. Antecedent daily rainfall accumulation and variability corresponding to these floods are computed using Global Historical Climatology Network daily data set. Two Bayesian scaling models are developed, and the spatial organization of scaling exponents is investigated. The baseline model quantifies the scaling of floods to geomorphologic characteristics. The dynamic model quantifies the scaling of floods to antecedent precipitation distribution which is further conditioned on geomorphologic characteristics. Results show that small and low-elevation basins have a stronger response to antecedent rainfall distribution in amplifying flood peaks, while high-elevation steeper basins have a lower response for flood duration and volume. The dynamic models demonstrate that there are significant variations in the flood scaling rates, with the largest rates up to 40% and 4.5% for flood duration, 64% and 44% for peak, and 98% and 40% for volume found across the Northeast, Coastal Southeast, and Northwest with intensifying rainfall accumulation and variability, respectively. This study advances flood predictions by better informing the flood attributes in the context of dynamical land-atmosphere perturbations.

The quantitative identification of their influence on the reduction of urban flood susceptibility (UFS) is of great significance in providing scientific references for urban flood control. In this study, we constructed a conceptual method to investigate the spatial variation of UFS based on the machine learning models (i.e., Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), which has been tested in Wuhan City of China with good performances. After model evaluation, we have quantitatively studied the impact of two flood mitigation measures (pumping stations and LID practices) on the UFS. In particular, we evaluated the UFS mitigation efficiency of several designed scenarios using different combinations of pump discharges and LID area fractions by comparing them against default scenarios. We found a nonlinear negative response relation between the reduction of UFS with either the increase in pump discharge or LID area fractions. The proportion of the area of highest susceptibility (PAH) decreases as the pumping capacity increases, and when the pumping capacity is 2.5 times the default condition, the PAH reduces to 45% from 73.7% of no pump stations and reaches its minimum value. When the LID layout area is 100% of the whole region, the PAH can reduce to 51% from 67.7% of no LID. The findings can be beneficial for the design of optimal preventative strategy to sufficiently reduces UFS.

Hillslope Sediment Supply Limits Alluvial Valley Width	AGU ADVANCES			English	Article						valley width; river terraces	FLUVIAL TERRACE FORMATION; EROSION RATES; EVOLUTION; CLIMATE; RIVERS; UPLIFT; AGGRADATION; PLEISTOCENE; MOUNTAINS; TRANSPORT	River-valley morphology preserves information on tectonic and climatic conditions that shape landscapes. Observations suggest that river discharge and valley-wall lithology are the main controls on valley width. Yet, current models based on these observations fail to explain the full range of cross-sectional valley shapes in nature, suggesting hitherto unquantified controls on valley width. In particular, current models cannot explain the existence of paired terrace sequences that form under cyclic climate forcing. Paired river terraces are staircases of abandoned floodplains on both valley sides, and hence preserve past valley widths. Their formation requires alternating phases of predominantly river incision and predominantly lateral planation, plus progressive valley narrowing. While cyclic Quaternary climate changes can explain shifts between incision and lateral erosion, the driving mechanism of valley narrowing is unknown. Here, we extract valley geometries from climatically formed, alluvial river-terrace sequences and show that across our dataset, the total cumulative terrace height (here: total valley height) explains 90%-99% of the variance in valley width at the terrace sites. This finding suggests that valley height, or a parameter that scales linearly with valley height, controls valley width in addition to river discharge and lithology. To explain this valley-width-height relationship, we reformulate existing valley-width models and suggest that, when adjusting to new boundary conditions, alluvial valleys evolve to a width at which sediment removal from valley walls matches lateral sediment supply from hillslope erosion. Such a hillslope-channel coupling is not captured in current valley-evolution models. Our model can explain the existence of paired terrace sequences under cyclic climate forcing and relates valley width to measurable field parameters. Therefore, it facilitates the reconstruction of past climatic and tectonic conditions from valley topography.

However, on the global scale, there are large knowledge gaps in modern silicate weathering regimes and their possible shifts, due to the lack of spatial information on in situ weathering processes. Here, we present the first detailed compilation of the major element concentrations in bulk and fine fraction (<2 mu m) samples of surface soils from across China, which we use to investigate modern silicate weathering regimes across China and possible shifts between regimes induced by tectonic uplift and climate changes. The results show that changes in climatic factors, especially precipitation, exert a first-order control on spatial variations in silicate weathering intensity (expressed by the chemical index of alteration, CIA), with additional contributions from nonclimatic factors. Comparison of silicate weathering regimes with the CIA suggests that for bulk samples the supply-limited weathering regime prevails in areas with CIA > 80, and the kinetically limited regime prevails in areas with CIA < 80. A significant inference from the results is that tectonic uplift and global warming could cause shifts between supply-limited and kinetically limited weathering regimes in the active mountain belts and floodplains of southern China and in areas dominated by intermediate chemical weathering. However, no shifts would occur in some of the arid to extremely arid areas of northern China and in highland areas with extreme chemical weathering.

However, how hydrological isolation affects variations of DOM chemistry in large lake systems is still poorly understood. Here, optical properties and molecular compositions of DOM samples derived from a large river-connected lake (Poyang Lake, China) and its nearby seasonal sub-lakes (formed by hydrological isolation) were characterized using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The results revealed more abundance of organic matter in sub-lakes than that in the main lake according to high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and absorption coefficients (a254 and a280). Large proportions of CHOS formulas were identified by FT ICR MS in sub-lakes DOM, which were produced through Kraft reactions (sulfide/bisulfide + lignin CHO -> CHOS) in the interface of sediment/water, and greatly contributed to aliphatic compounds. In addition, obvious variations of compounds (such as polyphenols, highly unsaturated and aliphatic compounds) and lability of DOM were observed between sub-lakes and main lakes, which were mainly caused by the different degradation pathways of DOM (photodegradation in sub-lakes while biodegradation in the main lake). Our results demonstrated that hydro-logical isolation has significant impacts on DOM chemistry, and provides an improved understanding of the DOM bio-geochemistry process in Poyang Lake and supports the management of the large lake systems.

The post-fire hazard window can range from years to decades. In Northern California, where wildfire frequency is steadily increasing, the impact and soil-hydraulic recovery from wildfires is unknown. Following the October 2017 Nuns and Tubbs fires in the Northern Bay Area of California, we established 41 monitoring sites for repeat tension-disc infiltrometer measurements of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) over 3.5 years. Our site arrays, which encompass grasslands, chaparral, and oak and conifer forests across a range in lithology, show a marked decrease in K-fs following the wildfires and a swift partial recovery following the initial post-fire rainy season. Our time series reveals a complex path to soil-hydraulic recovery marked by distinct seasonal stages. Analysis of changing K-fs, sorptivity, and infiltration model residuals collectively suggests that these stages are related to transitions between soil-hydraulic processes like structural soil sealing from rainsplash, thermal cracking of bare soil, and vegetation regrowth. While soil infiltration rates were strongly impacted by the 2017 fires, dry ravel estimates are an order of magnitude less for similar slopes than the 2009 Station fire in the San Gabriel mountains of Southern California, suggesting that limited ravel flux may insufficiently load channels for debris flows that initiate from within-channel failure. Our analysis suggests that burned landscapes in the Northern Bay Area of California may experience rapid soil-hydraulic recovery and limited pathways toward post-fire debris flow initiation.

Although the body fossils have been extensively studied over the past years, the associated coprolites are still poorly known. Here new coprolites are comprehensively described from the Chenini and Oum Ed Dhiab members of this formation respectively and ascribed to supposed producers based on a multiproxy analysis. The phosphatic composition, bone inclusions, and internal and external morphologies suggest that these coprolites were produced by a wide range of carnivorous vertebrates. Spiral coprolites from the lower level are mostly amphipolar, suggesting that they were produced by bony fishes, whereas those collected from the upper level are dominated by heteropolar, spirally-coiled coprolites that may have been produced by elasmobranchs. The largest cylindrical coprolites with longitudinal striations, constriction marks, and concentric layers wrapped around a massive core are consistent with those produced by crocodylomorphs. Many specimens from the Chenini Member display different types of desiccation cracks suggesting that the feces were sub aerially exposed in a dry environment before burial, however the coprolites from the upper member are devoid of all signs of pre-fossilization abrasion and show smooth surfaces. The highest abundance of coprolites appears to be associated with the lower assemblage, which is congruent with the body fossil record. This study provides tangible evidence about a late Early Cretaceous climatic change in the northern margin of Gondwana and supports previous sedimentology-based assumptions about a dry-to wet climate transition before the Cenomanian flooding event.0 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Social Media Integration of Flood Data: A Vine Copula-Based Approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						climate change; dependence modelling; floods; natural hazards; social media sentiment analysis; time series modelling; vine copulas	CONSTRUCTIONS	Floods are the most common and among the most severe natural disasters in many countries around the world. As global warming continues to exacerbate sea level rise and extreme weather, governmental authorities and environmental agencies are facing the pressing need of timely and accurate evaluations and predictions of flood risks. Current flood forecasts are generally based on historical measurements of environmental variables at monitoring stations. In recent years, in addition to traditional data sources, large amounts of information related to floods have been made available via social media. Members of the public are constantly and promptly posting information and updates on local environmental phenomena on social media platforms. Despite the growing interest of scholars towards the usage of online data during natural disasters, the majority of studies focus exclusively on social media as a stand-alone data source, while its joint use with other type of information is still unexplored. In this paper we propose to fill this gap by integrating traditional historical information on floods with data extracted by Twitter and Google Trends. Our methodology is based on vine copulas, that allow us to capture the dependence structure among the marginals, which are modelled via appropriate time series methods, in a very flexible way. We apply our methodology to data related to three different coastal locations on the South coast of the United Kingdom (UK). The results show that our approach, based on the integration of social media data, outperforms traditional methods in terms of evaluation and prediction of flood events.

Based on the daily precipitation time series, the Lorenz curve, precipitation concentration index (PCI), precipitation concentration degree (PCD), and the precipitation concentration period (PCP) were used to evaluate the precipitation distribution characteristics. The PCI, PCD and PCP in five categories, defined by the fixed thresholds, were proposed to investigate the concentrations, and the average values indicated the higher concentrations in the higher intensities. The indices showed strong irregularity of daily and monthly precipitation distributions in this basin. The decrease in the PCD revealed an increase in the proportion of precipitation in the dry season. The rainy days of slight precipitation in the upper and lower basins with significant downward trends (-13.13 d/10 a, -7.78 d/10 a) led to longer dry spells and an increase in the risk of drought, even severe in the lower area. In the upper basin, the increase in rainfall erosivity was supported by the upward trend in the PCIw of heavy precipitation and the simple daily intensity index (SDII) of extreme precipitation. Moreover, the PCP of light precipitation, moderate precipitation, and heavy precipitation concentrated earlier at the end of July. The results of this study can provide beneficial reference information to water resource planning, reservoir operation, and agricultural production in the basin.

Reduction in Precipitation Seasonality in China from 1960 to 2018	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Precipitation; Atmosphere-land interaction; Surface observations	NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; DAILY EXTREME PRECIPITATION; ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; RAINFALL SEASONALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EL-NINO; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; WATER CYCLE; ARID REGION; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS	Changes in precipitation seasonality or the distribution of precipitation have important impacts on hydrological extremes (e.g., floods or droughts). Precipitation extremes have been widely reported to increase with global warming; however, the variability and mechanism of precipitation seasonality have not been well quantified in China. Here, we explore the multiscale variability in precipitation seasonality from 1960 to 2018 in China. A seasonality index of precipitation is defined to quantify the precipitation seasonality with a lower value indicating a more even distribution throughout a year. The seasonality index increases from southeastern to northwestern China, with a decrease in the annual mean precipitation, a later timing of the wet season, and a shorter wet season duration. The seasonality index decreases from 1960 to 2018 in China, accompanied by the increasing duration of wet season, especially in northern climate-sensitive basins, such as the Northwest River, Hai River, and Songliao River basins. In the Northwest River basin, for example, the observed significant decrease in the seasonality index (similar to 0.02 decade(-1)) from 1960 to 2018 is consistent with a significant decrease in the ratio of annual maximum 10-day precipitation to annual precipitation, which is confirmed by their significant positive correlation (R = 0.72;p = 0). El Nifio-Southem Oscillation (ENSO) dominates interannual fluctuations and spatial patterns of precipitation seasonality in China. In El Nino years, the precipitation seasonality index decreases across China except for the Yangtze River basin, with broad increases in annual precipitation.	[MAO, Y. U. N. A.; WU, G. U. O. C. A.

The existing interaction between the Mekong River (MR), Tonle Sap River (TSR), and Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) has been further complicated due to the reverse flow phenomenon (RF) beyond ongoing anthropogenic activities and climate change. While continuous observations, insufficient data, and event-driven measurement have remained a challenge for such a large basin, accurate prediction of the RF period and water level influenced would pave the way in providing effective remedies for side effects in this area for future scenarios. In this study, the RF periods were investigated employing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Ensemble Bagged Tree (EBT) classification algorithms that showed comparable results with observed periods. The predicted periods were then used to predict the daily water level at the confluence where the MR and TSR join using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) methods. Although both models yielded highly accurate water level predictions, a slightly better performance was attributed to the LSTM model. Regarding the TSR's role in the RF period, results highlighted its significant role in extending the RF period in some years, despite its much lower streamflow than the MR. The developed model could be used as a reliable machine learning (ML) framework where there is a need for highly accurate data regarding RF and water levels for TSL and its environs.

Studying compound events often requires a multidisciplinary approach combining domain knowledge of the underlying processes with, for example, statistical methods and climate model outputs. Recently, to aid the development of research on compound events, four compound event types were introduced, namely (a) preconditioned, (b) multivariate, (c) temporally compounding, and (d) spatially compounding events. However, guidelines on how to study these types of events are still lacking. Here, we consider four case studies, each associated with a specific event type and a research question, to illustrate how the key elements of compound events (e.g., analytical tools and relevant physical effects) can be identified. These case studies show that (a) impacts on crops from hot and dry summers can be exacerbated by preconditioning effects of dry and bright springs. (b) Assessing compound coastal flooding in Perth (Australia) requires considering the dynamics of a non-stationary multivariate process. For instance, future mean sea-level rise will lead to the emergence of concurrent coastal and fluvial extremes, enhancing compound flooding risk. (c) In Portugal, deep-landslides are often caused by temporal clusters of moderate precipitation events. Finally, (d) crop yield failures in France and Germany are strongly correlated, threatening European food security through spatially compounding effects. These analyses allow for identifying general recommendations for studying compound events. Overall, our insights can serve as a blueprint for compound event analysis across disciplines and sectors.

Hydro-meteorological variables often exhibit disturbances of non-stationary characteristics. In this paper, we take a typical ecological function reserve (Poyang Lake Basin) as an instance to study the trend and probability characters of extreme streamflow based on stationary and non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) models. Time and large-scale climate factors such as Southern Oscillation (SO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), NINO3 SST (NINO3) and NINO3.4 SST (NINO3.4) are incorporated as covariates to establish non-stationary model. The main results are as follows: (1) Downward trends prevail for maximum streamflow series, but upward trends dominate for minimum streamflow series. (2) The tested optimal models of some maximum streamflow series are non-stationary, while the optimal models of all minimum streamflow series are non-stationary. In the 1970s and before (1980s and thereafter), the return periods of optimal model are greater (less) than those of stationary model for most minimum series, and the risks of river flooding and drying up without calculating by optimal model are underestimated (overestimated). (3) The estimated quantiles tend to be larger during La Nina than during El Nino in this study area. Other climate indices also have obvious effects on the estimated quantiles. This study indicates that the influence of climate factors on the extreme streamflow should be paid more attention and non-stationary modelling will benefit ecological management under climate change.

There is a need to develop accurate models for flood susceptibility prediction and mapping, which can be helpful in developing more efficient flood management plans. In this study, the Partial Decision Tree (PART) classifier and the AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, and Random Subspace ensembles learning techniques were combined to develop novel GIS-based ensemble computational models (ABPART, BPART, DPART and RSSPART) for flood susceptibility mapping in the Quang Binh Province, Vietnam. In total, 351 flood locations were used in the model study. This data was divided into a 70:30 ratio for model training (70% congruent to 255 locations) and (30% congruent to 96 locations) for model validation. Ten flood influencing factors, namely elevation, slope, curvature, flow direction, flow accumulation, river density, distance from river, rainfall, land-use, and geology, were used for the development of models. The OneR feature selection method was used to select and prioritize important factors for the spatial modeling. The results revealed that land-use, geology, and slope are the most important conditioning factors in the occurrence of floods in the study area. Standard statistical methods, including the ROC curve (AUC), were used for the performance evaluation of models. Results indicated that the performance of all models was good (AUC > 0.9) and RSSPART (AUC = 0.959) outperformed the others. Thus, the RSSPART model can be used for accurately predicting and mapping flood susceptibility.

In hydrological assessments, daily timestep modelling is typically used because of the availability of daily data and many of the processes governing impacts occur at this timescale. However, daily models can suffer from poor performance in certain contexts (e.g. drier climates), and their computational requirements can make it difficult to efficiently explore many sources of uncertainty in some situations, such as understanding the impacts of climate change in larger water resource systems. Here, we test an alternate approach based on monthly modelling with a post-processing step involving monthly-to-daily disaggregation using historic flow patterns conditioned on soil moisture estimates. We apply our approach to 214 catchments across Australia representing a wide range of climate and hydrological conditions, and assess outcomes for multiple objectives spanning water supply, flood magnitude and freshwater ecological outcomes, and validate performance over an extreme multi-year drought with substantially different rainfall and streamflow characteristics. Our results show that for many metrics including sustained low flows, annual flow maxima, and high and low flow spells, the results based on monthly hydrologic modelling with daily disaggregation are generally better than those based on daily hydrological modelling. This was especially true for ecologically relevant flow metrics. In addition, the disaggregation approach fared better than the daily model when extrapolating to the multi-year dry period. Our approach also has the potential to greatly reduce the effort required to explore uncertainty in large river systems.

Spatial and temporal characteristics of regional temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and dryness/wetness variation were investigated for the period from 2015 to 2100 under SSPs-RCPs in Northwest China. Results show that annual mean temperature, precipitation and PET are projected to increase during 2015-2100, with increases higher in the long-term (2081-2100) than the near-term (2021-2040) and mid-term (2041-2060). Increase rate under SSP5-8.5 and SSP3-7.0 will significantly higher than other scenarios. Relative to the reference period (1995-2014), annual SPEI12 is projected to show a decreasing trend during 2015-2100. Trend will decrease highest under SSP5-8.5 scenario whereas the lowest under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios. The state of drought in Northwest China is near normal during the reference period, drought will significantly escalate and moderate and severe drought will dominate the most of Northwest China with the increase of radiative forcing under SSPs-RCPs during 2015-2100. SSP5-8.5 will have the largest drought area than other scenarios. Observation shows Northwest China characterized a warmer and humid trend during 1961-2014, while GCMs projected that Northwest China will experience significant dryness trend during 2015-2100 under SSPs-RCPs, and SSP3-7.0, SSP4-3.4, SSP4-6.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios will be much drier than SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios.

This research examines the relationships between existing vacant land and the urbanization process by analyzing the land cover change between 2011 and 2016 in and around current floodplains in the DFW metro area. The major focus lies in three questions: 1) are flood-prone areas in DFW more likely to experience new development? 2) does existing vacant land in flood-prone areas bring new development activities? and 3) is the urbanization process associated with neighborhood change? Three logistic regression models were constructed to examine if existing vacant land can predict new development activities - with subgroups of different neighborhood socioeconomic status and by the level of flood hazard exposure. The results suggest that, in the DFW area, floodable areas are experiencing more development, and existing vacancies are a trigger only when vacancies are not clustered and when flood exposure is low. A heterogeneous pattern across different neighborhood profiles was found as areas with high flood exposure are likely to experience more large-scale development activities only for the low-income groups. This study suggests city planners pay attention to citywide vacant properties as they could either predict or detour potential developments. At the same time, areas with a close proximity to floodplains require more attention for the neighborhood socioeconomic status than existing vacant land uses.

These variables continue to fluctuate, thereby producing even more extreme weather events across different parts of East African region. Using quantile linear regression (QLR) method, this study interrogated wet and dry conditions over a period of 34 years across East African region. The spatio-temporal quantile trends (time coefficient of precipitation) analysis is presented in 5 conditions (quantiles): extreme dry (1st), dry (10th), median (50th), wet (90th) and extreme wet (99th). For annual precipitation, the quantiles indicated a trend value of - 0.294, 0.205, - 0.425, - 0.069 and 0.145, respectively. This shows that the extreme dry (wet) values in annual mean precipitation over the region are decreasing (increasing) over time, while the reverse is the case for the long and short seasons. Differences in the regression coefficients of precipitation variables for the inter-quantile differences show that any increase or decrease in average precipitation changes the shape of the distribution of hydrological parameters, increasing or decreasing spread between the extreme quantiles. The precipitation deciles at different quantiles over 34 years reveal marked variations in the annual mean and the long and short rainy seasons. Finally, the results indicate significant variations in extreme wet and dry conditions across eight ecological zones in East Africa with variable slope along various quantiles. In conclusion, QLR method has shown the ability to provide superior detailed information on extreme wet and dry climatic conditions required for flood mitigation and water resources planning and management.

INVESTIGATION OF CURRENT RISK TYPES FACED BY THE GLOBAL FISHERIES: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS			English	Review						fisheries; risk factors; natural risk; ecological risk; market risk; technical risk; management risk	MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; EUTHYNNUS-AFFINIS; FISH; AQUACULTURE; CATCH; UNCERTAINTY; COMPLEXITY; DYNAMICS; SALMON	Although, the fisheries sector is the backbone of agriculture, however, published literature does not document current risk types faced by this sector. The primary objective of this first-time study is to identify various types of current risks faced by global fisheries in a comprehensive manner. It is envisaged that this study will not only help to understand and manage fisheries resources in a better way but it will also provide directions for further research. According to the findings of this study, global fisheries are exposed to five main types of risks, viz., natural, ecological, market, technical, and management. Typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, accelerated beach erosion, and oceanic climate changes such as high wave action, temperature fluctuation, and high salinity are the reported natural risk factors faced by this sector. On the other hand, overfishing, aquatic pollution, habitat degradation, abundance of competitive exotic species, genetic stock structure changes, fisheries resource enhancement, and land reclamation projects are the major identified ecological risks. The market risk faced by the global fisheries includes price fluctuation, high financial risk faced by fishermen, changes in the rights to use the resources, employment loss, asymmetric market information, lack of investment, and meager loan support. Whereas, technical risk is caused by the hull or engine-related activities, low degree of mechanization, automation, and industrialization. While, work-related fatalities, loss of fishing gears, fishing mortality, lack of legally harvest strategies, unreasonable production plan of aquaculture, an insufficient supply of fishery insurance, illegal fishing, and uncertainty associated with stock assessments together constitute management risk faced by global fisheries.

It documents new developments in related processes, namely, boundary layer/convection/clouds parameterizations and land surface parameterization in the Earth System Model of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL). Simulations forced by prescribed oceanic conditions are produced with different combinations of atmospheric and land surface parameterizations. They are used to explore the sensitivity to the atmospheric physics and/or soil physics of major biases in the near surface variables over continents, the energy and moisture coupling established at the soil/atmosphere interface in not too wet (energy limited) and not too dry (moisture limited) soil moisture regions also known as transition or "hot-spot" regions, the river runoff at the outlet of major rivers. The package implemented in the IPSL-Climate Model for the Phase 6 of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) allows us to reduce several biases in the surface albedo, the snow cover, and the continental surface air temperature in summer as well as in the temperature profile in the surface layer of the polar regions. The interactions between soil moisture and atmosphere in hotspot regions are in better agreement with the observations. Rainfall is also significantly improved in volume and seasonality in several major river basins leading to an overall improvement in river discharge. However, the lack of consideration of floodplains and human influences in the model, for example, dams and irrigation, impacts the realism of simulated discharge.

One of the crucial tasks to overcome the barriers is to understand their interrelationships. However, analysis of the interrelationships between the barriers to IFRM adaptation has not been carried out yet. This study attempts to analyze the interrelationships between the barriers to IFRM adaptation using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method. The barriers in Metro Manila, a megacity in a developing country, were identified first in this study. Then, the ISM method was slightly modified and applied to analyze the interrelationships of the identified barriers. As a result, we identified 12 barriers which are relatively numerous compared with the developed countries, and so we categorized them into the governance, social, and technological resources aspects. Through the application of the ISM method, the interrelationships of the barriers to IFRM adaptation were systematically analyzed for the first time while also showing their hierarchical diagram. The results of the ISM reveal that barriers in the governance aspect are the most influential in which the lack of a sole organizing body is the most influential barrier. The barriers in the technological resources aspect are the second most influential, while barriers in the social aspect are the least influential and most dependent barriers. The approach presented in this study can be useful for decision makers and practitioners in understanding the interrelationships between the barriers.

The Epidemiology of Extreme Weather Event Disasters (1969-2018)	PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE			English	Article						climate change; disasters; exposures; extreme weather events; hazards	RISK	Introduction: This manuscript summarizes the global incidence, exposures, mortality, and morbidity associated with extreme weather event (EWE) disasters over the past 50 years (1969-2018). Methods: A historical database (1969-2018) was created from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) to include all disasters caused by seven EWE hazards (ie, cyclones, droughts, floods, heatwaves, landslides, cold weather, and storms). The annual incidence of EWE hazards and rates of exposure, morbidity, and mortality were calculated. Regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculations were performed to evaluate the association between the exposure rate and the hazard incidence rate, as well as the association between morbidity and mortality incidence rates and rates of human exposure and annual EWE incidence. Results: From 1969-2018, 10,009 EWE disasters caused 2,037,415 deaths and 3,998,466 cases of disease. A reported 7,350,276,440 persons required immediate assistance. Floods and storms were the most common. Most (89%) of EWE-related disaster mortality was caused by storms, droughts, and floods. Nearly all (96%) of EWE-related disaster morbidity was caused by cold weather, floods, and storms. Regression analysis revealed strong evidence (R-2 = 0.88) that the annual incidence of EWE disasters is increasing world-wide, and ANOVA calculations identified an association between human exposure rates and hazard incidence (P value = .01). No significant trends were noted for rates of exposure, morbidity, or mortality. Conclusions: The annual incidence of EWEs appears to be increasing. The incidence of EWEs also appears to be associated with rates of human exposure. However, there is insufficient evidence of an associated increase in health risk or human exposures to EWEs over time.

In this paper, the dependency between magnitudes and directional occurrence dates of storm events was investigated with copula models. Taking account of extreme storms under various return periods, the concurrence risks as well as temporal representations of the recurrence risk were evaluated by the exceedance probability levels. A case study was demonstrated through the selected storms out of a 53-year long daily rainfall time series in the Shenzhen bay area by using the annual maximum precipitation and peak-over-threshold sampling method. Based on multiple univariate probability functions, a mixed distribution was proposed to determine the most suitable marginal distribution of storm magnitudes and directional dates at three spatially separated stations. The goodness-of-fit tests and ordinary least squares criterion of root-mean-square error were then employed to determine the copula model from the Archimedean and Plackett copulas. According to the coincidence exceedance probabilities of 200, 100, 50 and 20 years return periods, results showed an increase in the conjunctive risk of extreme rainfall events for recent 30 years with regards to pair and triple station, implying the significance to further strengthen the regional flooding control measures. Besides, temporal variations of exceedance probabilities at each station revealed an increasingly concentrated risk during wet period and a shift of the risk peak to earlier dates during 1 year, which would indicate the flooding precautions should be prepared in advance.

J	Rahman, MS; Di, LP				Rahman, Md Shahinoor; Di, Liping			A Systematic Review on Case Studies of Remote-Sensing-Based Flood Crop Loss Assessment	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Review						flood; crop; loss assessment; remote sensing; damage assessment	DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; VEGETATION INDEX; RIVER-BASIN; DISASTER LOSSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SAR DATA; RICE; IMPACT; MODIS; INUNDATION	This article reviews case studies which have used remote sensing data for different aspects of flood crop loss assessment. The review systematically finds a total of 62 empirical case studies from the past three decades. The number of case studies has recently been increased because of increased availability of remote sensing data. In the past, flood crop loss assessment was very generalized and time-intensive because of the dependency on the survey-based data collection. Remote sensing data availability makes rapid flood loss assessment possible. This study groups flood crop loss assessment approaches into three broad categories: flood-intensity-based approach, crop-condition-based approach, and a hybrid approach of the two. Flood crop damage assessment is more precise when both flood information and crop condition are incorporated in damage assessment models. This review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different loss assessment approaches. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat are the dominant sources of optical remote sensing data for flood crop loss assessment. Remote-sensing-based vegetation indices (VIs) have significantly been utilized for crop damage assessments in recent years. Many case studies also relied on microwave remote sensing data, because of the inability of optical remote sensing to see through clouds. Recent free-of-charge availability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 will advance flood crop damage assessment. Data for the validation of loss assessment models are scarce. Recent advancements of data archiving and distribution through web technologies will be helpful for loss assessment and validation.

In recent decades, the probability of these events occurring has increased, activating the interest of researchers in the study of new methods of risk analysis to prevent and mitigate possible damage to people, the environment, and processing facilities. On the other hand, the concept of multi-hazard is summarized in the combination of two or more threat factors manifested in isolated, simultaneous manner, or by chain reaction, to produce a trigger event of a disaster, where hazardous events can be one or more natural events. Considering that, it is essential to know the progress in risk analysis for Natech events, to identify the gaps for future research. Therefore, in this paper, a systematic review of the Natech events literature with single and multi-hazard approaches was developed. The review was conducted by searching the Science Direct, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for scientific documents. Subsequently, the words Natech and Multi-hazard were taken as keywords, and 208 results were obtained. Then, some management documents were consulted in international organizations to compare academic literature and industrial risk management. In conclusion, the risk analysis methods revised are specific to a particular hazard and apply mainly to earthquakes, floods, and lightning. Regarding a multi-hazard approach, the methods focus on risk mitigation in urban areas without taking into account Natech risk. In the case of industrial risk assessment, some methodologies were found that briefly consider Natech risk in risk assessment processes in industry.

In the study area, trend in rainfall has significant impact on fluctuations in river discharge, which ultimately led to floods and hydrological drought. In this study, rainfall has been used as a climatic parameter. For this study, average annual and mean monthly rainfall data for Dir, Timergara, Saidu, Chitral, Drosh, Malam Jabba and Kalam meteorological stations located in the study region were gathered from Regional Meteorological Center Peshawar. In the study area, the rainfall is mostly received during two prominent periods, i.e., summer rainfall from monsoon, whereas winter and spring rainfall from western depressions. In the study area, Malam Jabba has recorded the heavy mean annual rainfall (1647 mm) and is considered as the humid station followed by met station Dir with a 1362 mm mean annual rainfall. Similarly, Saidu met station received 1050 mm mean annual rainfall and Kalam 1038 mm, whereas Timergara, Drosh and Chitral recorded 796 mm, 568 mm and 458 mm, respectively. The temporal data regarding rainfall were calculated and simulated in Addinsoft Excel state 2014 by applying ARIMA statistical model for trend prediction, fluctuations and anomaly. The analysis indicates that in terms of rainfall, an increasing trend has been detected at Dir, Chitral, Saidu and Kalam meteorological stations, whereas a declining trend has been recorded at Timergara, Drosh and Malam Jabba meteorological stations. In terms of rainfall anomaly, the met station Dir has indicated comparatively high positive anomaly. Contrary to this, the met stations of Saidu and Drosh have experienced negative rainfall anomaly.

These changes have not been fully evaluated yet in observations or climate model simulations although they are very useful to understand variations of extreme precipitation. We used daily precipitation data from 669 meteorological stations during the past five decades across China and projections of 19 general circulation models from CMIP5 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios to investigate variations of EPIV and EPIP. We found the national average annual EPIV increased across China during the last five decades, while annual EPIP significantly decreased. The decreases mainly occurred in southwest China, east China, and southeast China. At national and regional scales, the average annual EPIV and EPIP showed greater decreases under the RCP8.5 scenario than those under the RCP4.5 scenario from 2006 to 2100. Annual EPIP showed a stronger correlation with extreme precipitation intensity than EPIV. The national average annual EPIP had a significant positive correlation with the Western Pacific Subtropical High Area Index.

Microbiological Assessment of Tap Water Following the 2016 Louisiana Flooding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						floodwater; fecal contamination; E. coli; fecal indicator bacteria	DRINKING-WATER; CONVENTIONAL CULTURE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CONTAMINATION; EXPOSURE; QUALITY; QPCR; ENUMERATION; COLIFORMS; PATHOGENS	Floods are a prominent risk factor in the world of public health, as there is a risk of dispersal of harmful biological and chemical contaminants in floodwater. As climate change increases, the occurrence of natural disasters and risk of adverse health outcomes due to flash flooding also increases. Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Enterococci, are often encountered in contaminated floodwater and can cause gastrointestinal illnesses as well as a variety of infections. In August 2016, East Baton Rouge and surrounding parishes in Louisiana suffered heavy floods due to intense rainfall. No study of water quality during flooding has been conducted previously in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Twenty-three pre-flush and post-flush water samples were collected immediately from accessible homes that had been affected by the floods in order to quantify concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. These samples were analyzed for the presence of E. coli and Enterococci through both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the IDEXX enzyme substrate method. The qPCR results indicated that 30% of the samples contained Enterococci and 61% of the samples contained E. coli, with the highest concentrations found in the pre-flush outdoor hose and the pre-flush kitchen tap. The IDEXX method yielded total coliforms in 65% of the samples, E. coli in 4%, and Enterococci in 35%, with the highest concentrations in the pre-flush outdoor faucet and the pre-flush post-filtration kitchen tap. Physical parameters including temperature, barometer pressure, dissolved oxygen, oxidation reduction potential, pH, conductivity, and salinity of these samples were also recorded. Of these parameters, conductivity and salinity were significant, suggesting they may positively influence E. coli and Enterococci growth.

A framework for understanding water-related multi-hazards in a sustainable development context	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Multi-hazards; disaster risk reduction; sustainable development; bibliometric analysis	RISK-ASSESSMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; NATURAL HAZARDS; TEMPORAL ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; NEPAL; LANDSLIDES; CHALLENGES; IMPACT	Hazards often do not occur in isolation and, for this reason, a multi-hazard approach is vital in realising their impact and providing solutions for disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. We present a novel framework that emerges from a bibliometric analysis of the multi-hazard literature and a critical appraisal of the existing approaches. It was found that multi-hazard research has expanded greatly over the last 20 years, furthering our understanding of the subject with important applications in risk assessment and management. These studies have contextualised multi-hazards, developed models and frameworks to analyse them, provided case studies to test multi-hazard-based approaches and produced reviews. It was found that landslides and floods are the most frequently co-occurring hazards within the bibliographic dataset, yet understanding of their interactions, hydrometeorological drivers and landscape controls remains poorly conceptualised. Therefore, we propose a new framework for investigating water-related multi-hazards that leverages and synthesises existing methods to address the challenges identified to date. We also find a geographical bias, with less multi-hazard research in lower- and middle-income countries and remote environments due to data scarcity and limited accessibility. Our framework therefore includes the ability to address geographically specific key considerations including available and accessible data, community variability and cross-sectoral collaborations. In doing so it offers guidance on structuring future analyses to improve our understanding of multi-hazards, reduce disaster risk, increase community resilience and make progress towards sustainable development.

This paper explores the decision-making process of rural households in adapting to flash floods and landslides (FF&LS) by conducting a household survey on 405 purposively selected households in Yen Bai province, one of the poorest mountainous regions in Vietnam. Based on the multi-portfolio framework, the study assumes that farmers have multiple choice of adaptation strategies simultaneously and these adaptation measures are correlative. Multivariate Probit models were used to figure out the household decision making process in adapting to FF&LS. Survey results showed that changing cropping patterns, crop variegation, diversifying types of crop varieties, as well as managing and implementing crop protection (soil and plant) are the primary adaptation measures applied by local farmers. Furthermore, lack of money, inadequate support from local government, shortage of machinery and technical equipment, as well as insufficient knowledge about FF&LS were listed as major constraints in the study area. The MVP analysis indicated that all farmers' perception, socio-economic, farming features, and institutional conditions strongly influence the farmers' adaptation decisions regarding FF&LS. Future policies may therefore need to consider these major contributing factors with appropriate interventions to facilitate suitable adaptations for local farmers.

Streets, storm surge, and the frailty of urban transport systems: A grid-based approach for identifying informal street network connections to facilitate mobility	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Network analysis; Transport; Access; Flooding; Vulnerability; Emergency response	SEA-LEVEL RISE; ROAD NETWORK; HIGHWAY NETWORK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; INFRASTRUCTURE; PATTERNS; LINKS; ACCESSIBILITY; ORGANIZATION	A variety of real-world infrastructure systems, including power grids, telecommunications, roads and social networks can be conceptualized and modeled using basic concepts from graph theory and network science. The abstraction of real-world systems into an edge-node topology enables analysts to quantify and characterize a range of network properties, including structure, connectivity, and modularity, as well as the attributes of individual nodes and edges such as degree, criticality, and betweenness. One major problem with the abstraction process associated with traditional network analysis is that edges and nodes are stripped of important proximal, contextual information that is critical for understanding how network elements operate in situ. For example, the geographic context of an elevated causeway is significantly different than a landlocked residential street, yet they are both simply represented as edges in traditional network modeling. The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications associated with network abstractions, including the loss of geographic fidelity, and why it matters for vulnerability analysis and emergency response during extreme events. Specifically, this paper introduces an alternative network conceptualization that preserves important on-network information, but also provides in situ context for local network elements, helping to deepen our understanding of local operating conditions. A case study for hurricane storm surge flooding in Volusia County, Florida is utilized to highlight how the developed approach better captures the realities of how evacuees and emergency response teams can leverage information for both on- and off-network space during a major disaster.

This study uses a hydrodynamic model and geostatistical method to explore the variations of water storage and its relationship with the surface hydrological connectivity, exemplified by the large Poyang Lake-floodplain system (in China). The simulations show that the floodplain storage exhibits largely similar behavior to that of the total lake water storage, but the water storage in the main lake is distinctly higher than the floodplains. The lake storage is estimated to be from 20 x 10(8) to 163 x 10(8) m(3) and differs considerably between seasons, and the contribution of the floodplain to the total lake storage varies from 18 to 34%. Geostatistical analysis reveals that the degree of surface hydrological connectivity can be classified as high connectivity in summer, low connectivity in winter, and intermediate connectivity during other seasons. Higher variability of water storage and lower frequency of hydrological connectivity are found in the seasonal floodplains, whereas the lower variability and higher frequency are observed in the main lake, indicating that water storage is inextricably linked to the dynamic behaviors of surface hydrological connectivity. Additionally, the estimated water storage significantly increases from the low and intermediate conditions to the high connectivity condition, mainly due to the key process of the west-east connectivity in controlling lake-floodplain interactions. This study improves understanding of Poyang Lake floodplain behavior and other similar floodplain systems by providing knowledge of water balance, water allocation and water management. [GRAPHICS] .

Statistical classification of streamflow based on flow variability in west flowing rivers of Kerala, India	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; HOMOGENEITY TEST; TREND ANALYSIS; REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; TEMPERATURE DATA; RAINFALL TRENDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNIT-ROOT; PRECIPITATION; EXTREMES	Measured streamflow and flood series of 43 gauging stations from 25 west flowing rivers in Kerala, India, were analysed for their descriptive characteristics to study their spatial and temporal variation. The spatial and temporal variations in streamflow are influenced by many factors including climatic and basin characteristics. Streamflow data from each station (length varies from 14 to 43years) is analysed for their internal characteristics such as trend, stationarity, homogeneity, noise and periodicity to incorporate it in hydrological models, so that their predictions would be more accurate. The internal characteristics were studied along with the statistical analysis. For analysing each internal characteristic, more than one method of analysis has been used to have reliable result. The trend characteristic was analysed using Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen's slope test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient methods. Stationarity characteristics have been tested using augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), Phillips-Perron test and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. For identifying homogeneous nature, Pettitt test, standard normal homogeneity (SNH) test, Buishand test and von Neumann tests were used. Noise in the streamflow was verified using Box-Peirce, Ljung-Box and McLeod-Li tests. From the study, it is found that the daily series is non-homogeneous, stationary data with white noise, whereas flood series shows mixed characteristics. Based on the variations in the time series, the daily streamflow and flood series are classified into different categories such as high, average, moderate, minor and no variation stations. In most of the river basins, daily flow shows average variation. Flood series shows average variation in 44% of stations and moderate variation in 28% of stations.	[Drissia, T.

Communal farmers experience problems of getting reliable weather information. Datasets used to describe climate change and variability rely on spatially interpolated gridded data from a few weather stations. The ability of gridded climate data to describe climate variability at the local level has been widely questioned. Communal farmers have developed indigenous strategies to cope with these extremes in order to sustain agricultural production. The objective of this study was to document indigenous strategies that smallholder farmers in Bergville and Msinga, in KwaZulu Natal Province, use to predict weather, conserve soil and water, and manage climate extremes events. Data were gathered through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and questionnaire. Results showed that more farmers in Msinga than Bergville observed reduced rainfalls and increased temperatures as an indicator of climate variability (p<.05). Bergville and Msinga communal farmers use indigenous indicators such as wind and cloud patterns, animal and bird behaviour, moon shape, and position of the sun to predict weather. Communal farmers using manure were 0.17 times more likely to conserve soil and water when compared with those using artificial fertilizer (p<.05). Thus, indigenous knowledge system (IKS) can be used to conserve soil and water and manage climate extremes and variability. Communal farmers also resist adopting unfamiliar strategies that are forced on them without proper engagement. Communal farmers have managed to survive extreme weather events using IKS.

Here, we present a new multi-proxy record including pollen, plant macrofossils, charcoal, loss on ignition and radiocarbon dating from the Mochulya peatland supplemented by 14 radiocarbon dates of charcoal fragments from soil pits in the study area. The results show that Mochulya peatland was a fen throughout the most of the time it existed. During the last 4200 cal yr BP the study area was occupied by broadleaved forests of Quercus, Ulmus, and Tilia. Picea became relatively abundant after 2300 cal yr BP. Despite the long-term human impact, vegetation fragments of these forests have persisted in the area until the present. Three main periods of deforestation and frequent fires were identified: 3700-3200 cal yr BP, 2000-1600 cal yr BP (the Early Iron Age) and 1000-400 cal yr BP (the Medieval Period). Whereas human-induced vegetation changes were apparent during the last two periods, vegetation dynamics during 3700-3200 cal yr BP were likely caused, at least in part, by climatic factors.

Despite several GLOF studies, little attention has been given to the combined surge that can result from a pair of upstream-downstream glacial lakes. We chose Upper and Lower Barun glacial lakes as a pilot study due to the region's increasing population and hydropower investments and the possible outbursts of upper-lower glacial lakes. This study mainly considered four scenarios (100 and 50% breach combination of upper-lower lakes), using a two-dimensional dam break model and inundation propagation. Based on our observations, the glaciers in the study area shrank by 33 km2, and the two glacial lakes expanded by 2.06 km2 between 1976 and 2020. The modeling result suggests that the single flood triggered by Upper Barun cannot travel beyond 50 km; however, the combined flow from the lakes could reach over 85 km. Our results illustrate that at least 60 buildings, motorable bridges, and infrastructures of Arun hydropower along the river course have high damage potential. The study insights can be helpful for effectively planning and formulating various disaster risk reduction initiatives to mitigate the likely effects of glacial lake(s) outbursts.

For this purpose, it must be able to adequately express the characteristics of the physical system. Similar to other water resources management models, analytical-probabilistic models may be developed with different levels of complexity according to different types of rainfall-runoff developments. In this research, a log-normal probabilistic model was used to estimate the return period of rainfall and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) software was used to convert rainfall values into discharge and runoff height in agricultural lands. The slope and the level of plant shade cover were considered the two basic factors in the estimation of the subsurface flow used in agriculture. Slopes of less than 0.015 and land cover level of more than 70% of extreme points were obtained to ensure subsurface water sources and prevent erosion.HIGHLIGHTS center dot The use of probabilistic models in estimating runoff and precipitation is one of the most reliable flood management methods.center dot Using the probabilistic dynamic model to evaluate the impact of runoff on land use is one of the goals of this research.center dot Multivariate models have a positive effect on the estimation of flow volume and velocity in dry areas.

For this, daily rainfall data acquired from Water Resources Department of Rajasthan, India have been utilised. The variations have been identified in relation to number (dry/wet days and spells), mean and maximum length of dry/wet spells. For identifying trends, Mann-Kendall (MK), innovative trend analysis (ITA) and Sen's slope estimator tests have been executed, whereas change points have been detected with the help of Pettit, Buishand range, standard normal homogeneity and Neumann ratio tests. In Banas River basin, dry days have been found much higher (330 days) as compared to wet (35 days), while the number of dry/wet spells has been found almost identical (18). A decreasing trend in dry days has been detected, whereas wet days have increased. In addition, change point detection tests have detected 1993 as the year of noteworthy change in dry/wet days and spells, whereas most of the stations witnessed such change in 1995 and 2009. These results will be valuable for water resource and risk reduction managers in managing the risks of drought and flood over the Banas River basin.

Hydraulic structures, e.g., sluicegates and pumping stations, can directly influence flooding processes and should be represented in flood modeling and risk assessment. This study aims to present a robust numerical model by incorporating a hydraulic structure simulation module to accurately predict the highly transient flood hydrodynamics interrupted by the operation of hydraulic structures to support object-level risk assessment. Source-term and flux-term coupling approaches are applied and implemented to represent different types of hydraulic structures in the model. For hydraulic structures such as a sluicegate, the flux-term coupling approach may lead to more accurate results, as indicated by the calculated values of NSE and RMSE for different test cases. The model is further applied to predict different design flood scenarios with rainfall inputs created using Intensity-Duration-Frequency relationships, Chicago Design Storm, and surveyed data. The simulation results are combined with established vehicle instability formulas and depth-damage curves to assess the flood impact on individual objects in an urbanized case study area in Zhejiang Province, China.

Thus, the combined effect of variations in soil properties and current hydraulics interacts with the exposure of structures exposed and their degree of physical vulnerability. This study aims to evaluate the effect of land-use evolution from 1976 to 2017 on the physical vulnerability of structures exposed to floods in the Combeima cathment, Colombia, proposing two novel approaches: (i) based on soil infiltration capacity variation (CN) in the basin and changes in stream flow velocity (v), (ii) through soil water storage variation in the root zone (Hu). Hydrological and hydraulic modeling and the implementation of four physical vulnerability assessment methods were performed using GIS analysis. Findings indicate that simplifying physical vulnerability estimations through CN, Hu, and v variations in catchments and at cross-section resolutions is possible, allowing a detailed analysis of the land-use change effect on the vulnerability of structures. The scaling behavior of the physical vulnerability of structures was identified when Hu is defined as a scale variable and, similarly, concerning flow velocity in the stream. Therefore, applying the power law could be useful in planning processes with limited information.

Nevertheless, the empirical knowledge of the biophysical capacity of cities to absorb, store or retain and release water after rainfall events is limited, partly due to the gaps that modeling has in terms of representing the complexity of urban systems. This limit, in turn, affects the decision-making process related to the system's adaptation. This work aims to integrate two types of alternative spatial ecosystem modeling and see how results can be combined, evaluated and used in view of a more holistic comprehension of flooding phenomena while reaching a deeper understanding of the vulnerability to multiple types of rain events: flash floods versus annual precipitation. The results of the two modeling sessions will be analyzed and compared. They will be further used to gather a greater understanding of the biophysical complexity of Izmir's Metropolitan City in Turkey: one of the most dynamic but climatically threatened urban areas in the Mediterranean basin. The findings confirm the extent to which empirical knowledge of the urban system is partial and uncertain, thus requiring continuous progress through ecosystem modeling to support an evolutive interpretation of biophysical performances based on trial and error.

Flood hazards in Vietnam are difficult to combat, as Vietnam is densely populated with rivers and canals. While there are attempts to lessen the damage through hazard mitigation policies, such as early evacuation warnings, these attempts are made heavily reliant on short-term traditional statistical models and physical hydrology modeling, which provide suboptimal results. The current situation is caused by the fragmented approach from the Vietnamese government and exacerbates a need for more centralized and robust flood predictive systems. Local governments need to employ their own prediction models which often lack the capacity to draw key insights from limited flood occurrences. Given the robustness of machine learning, especially in low data settings, in this study, we attempt to introduce an artificial neural network model with the aim to create long-term forecast and compare it with other machine learning approaches. We trained the models using different variables evaluated under three characteristics: climatic, hydrological, and socio-economic. We found that our artificial neural network model performed substantially better both in performance metrics (91% accuracy) and relative to other models and can predict well flood hazards in the long term.

This reflective article reviews perspectives on rivers in Aotearoa New Zealand as wild or tamed entities. A historical overview of the socio-cultural and institutional relationships with rivers examines the meanings of rivers in Aotearoa New Zealand through multiple lenses. This includes indigenous Maori knowledge, command-and-control mentalities of a settler society that assert human authority over rivers, the emergence of the environmental movement and associated legislation with a sustainability focus (the Resource Management Act), and recent movement towards co-governance arrangements that incorporate the original intent of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (1840). It is contended that management practices have disconnected society from rivers, and vice versa, creating a sense of environmental loss (solastalgia), especially for Maori. Using rivers in the Greater Wellington Region as examples, prospects to accommodate wild river behaviour in Aotearoa New Zealand are explored. Recognising that re-wilding is no longer a feasible option in most instances, further attempts to tame rivers are also considered to be unrealistic, especially in light of climate change and accentuated flood risk. Reconnecting with indigenous knowledge offers prospects to re-imagine wild rivers in Aotearoa, living generatively with rivers as dynamic and emergent entities.

The lack of knowledge on how crops respond and adapt to flooding stress imposes a major barrier to enhancing their productivity. Hence, understanding the flooding-responsive mechanisms of crops is indispensable for developing new flooding-tolerant varieties. Here, we examined the banana (Musa acuminata cv. Berangan) responses to soil waterlogging for 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 24 days. After waterlogging stress, banana root samples were analyzed for their molecular and biochemical changes. We found that waterlogging treatment induced the formation of adventitious roots and aerenchyma with conspicuous gas spaces. In addition, the antioxidant activities, hydrogen peroxide, and malondialdehyde contents of the waterlogged bananas increased in response to waterlogging stress. To assess the initial response of bananas toward waterlogging stress, we analyzed the transcriptome changes of banana roots. A total of 3508 unigenes were differentially expressed under 1-day waterlogging conditions. These unigenes comprise abiotic stress-related transcription factors, such as ethylene response factors, basic helix-loop-helix, myeloblastosis, plant signal transduction, and carbohydrate metabolisms. The findings of the study provide insight into the complex molecular events of bananas in response to waterlogging stress, which could later help develop waterlogging resilient crops for the future climate.

Longest sediment flows yet measured show how major rivers connect efficiently to deep sea	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TURBIDITY CURRENTS; ORGANIC-CARBON; EARTHQUAKE; EVENTS; DEPOSITION; MORPHOLOGY; MULTIBEAM; GEOLOGY; CANYON; SLOPE	This paper analyses the longest sediment flows measured in action on Earth. These seabed flows were caused by floods and spring tides, and flushed prodigious sediment and carbon volumes into the deep sea, as they accelerated for a thousand kilometres. Here we show how major rivers can efficiently connect to the deep-sea, by analysing the longest runout sediment flows (of any type) yet measured in action on Earth. These seafloor turbidity currents originated from the Congo River-mouth, with one flow travelling >1,130 km whilst accelerating from 5.2 to 8.0 m/s. In one year, these turbidity currents eroded 1,338-2,675 [>535-1,070] Mt of sediment from one submarine canyon, equivalent to 19-37 [>7-15] % of annual suspended sediment flux from present-day rivers. It was known earthquakes trigger canyon-flushing flows. We show river-floods also generate canyon-flushing flows, primed by rapid sediment-accumulation at the river-mouth, and sometimes triggered by spring tides weeks to months post-flood. It is demonstrated that strongly erosional turbidity currents self-accelerate, thereby travelling much further, validating a long-proposed theory. These observations explain highly-efficient organic carbon transfer, and have important implications for hazards to seabed cables, or deep-sea impacts of terrestrial climate change.

Flood Exposure and Social Vulnerability Analysis in Rural Areas of Developing Countries: An Empirical Study of Charsadda District, Pakistan	WATER			English	Article						flood hazard; exposure; social vulnerability; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan	URBAN VULNERABILITY; KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA; NATURAL HAZARDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; FRAMEWORK; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; LEVEL	In recent years, social vulnerability has gained much importance in academic studies. However, social indices are rarely combined and validated with exposure and resilience components. This study provides an integrated analysis of the flood exposure and social vulnerability of rural households in a case area of Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. A conceptual framework was designed (based on the MOVE framework) as a guideline and key indicators were identified. For the exposure component, parameters such as elevation, flooded locations, and distance from the river were endorsed to understand flood mechanisms. For populating socioeconomic variables, questionnaire-based interviews were conducted with 210 households. The results were presented through ArcGIS-generated maps. The most significant indicators interplaying with high vulnerability were exposure-related indicators. The findings showed that the southern areas, including Agra, Daulat Pura, and Hisar Yasinzai were highly vulnerable due to having the highest number of flood locations, lowest elevations, and shortest distances from rivers, as well as larger household sizes, more elderly, children and women, illiteracy rates, and weak financial capacity. Understanding such dominant indicators and areas where high social vulnerability and high exposure converge can inform the authorities in mitigating both social and physical flood vulnerability.

This area presents the beginning of land architecture in the region (ca. 4800-5000 years BP), associated with more arid climate. This construction tradition continues and intensifies, mainly from ca 3000 years BP, from the establishment of warmer and damper conditions. New sources of information and geospatial technologies have made it possible to locate mound sites with greater precision, as well as to analyze settlement patterns. Indigenous communities occupied areas of hills, plains and wetlands, showing differences but also regularities in spatial organization in each area. In the whole area, earthen mound complexes form groups of different orders, from regional to domestic units, configured by mounds, negative structures and limited spaces. The location of the mounds is primarily in dry areas, known locally as islands, which are prominent in the landscape during floods in this wetland-dominated environment. Through this analysis of the landscape, this work delves into the underlying logic of the social construction of the territory. The results achieved in this paper are consistent with previous research suggesting planned occupation associated with villages integrated within broader regional systems.

Water management requires a comprehensive, adaptive approach that also considers the dynamics of changes in the water management system. This is particularly important in areas where different groups of stakeholders intertwine, whose needs often contradict, which hampers effective water management, particularly in places of high natural value. This research aimed to analyze selected issues in water management in the Bialka River Basin in Southern Poland. The analysis was based on a review of scientific publications, internet sources, and a survey on water management in the basin. Our research shows that the dominant issues in the study area are the flood risk and water pollution related to, among other factors, the intensive development of tourism. Moreover, the effective management of water resources is hampered by poor communication between the administration and stakeholders, which results in a low level of knowledge, negative attitudes towards nature protection, and the emergence of conflicts. The main conclusion of this paper indicates that, despite the existing social potential for implementing comprehensive water management methods, the lack of an appropriate legal framework prevents the implementation of concepts such as Adaptive Water Management.

However, extrapolation can be inappropriate due to regional variation of habitat selection. Accounting for the ecological mechanisms causing such variation is necessary to resolve this problem. We focused on grey-faced buzzards in agricultural landscapes of Japan, which show geographically different habitat selection. To determine whether this variation is caused by the difference in climatic conditions at geographical scales or the difference in agricultural practices at smaller regional scales, we surveyed distributions of buzzards and their major prey (frogs/orthopterans) in regions differing in rice-transplanting schedules within the same climatic zone. We found that buzzards preferred paddy-forest landscapes in the early transplanting regions, but grassland-forest landscapes in the late transplanting regions. Frogs were more abundant in the early transplanting regions due to flooded paddies, while the abundance of orthopterans did not differ. The regional variation in habitat selection of buzzards may be due to different prey availabilities caused by different agricultural schedules. We propose that habitat suitability assessments of organisms inhabiting agricultural landscapes should consider differences in production systems at regional scales and such regional partitioning is effective for accurate assessments.

We conducted a meta-analytical review to quantify this effect on different spheres of child development: birth outcomes, cognitive, motor, physical, socio-emotional, and behavioral development. We systematically searched the literature for articles on this topic (2756 articles retrieved and 37 articles included in the systematic review), extracted the relevant data to calculate the effect sizes, and then performed a meta-analysis for each category of outcomes (30 articles included across the meta-analyses) and meta-regressions to determine the effect of some factors of interest on the association between PNMS and child development: type of PNMS (objective, psychological, cognitive, diet), type of natural disaster (ice storm, flood/cyclone), type of report (maternal, third-party observer, medical), timing of exposure (preconception exposure included or not) and child age at assessment (under 10 or 10 years and older). We found that PNMS significantly influences all spheres of child development. Higher PNMS levels were associated with longer gestational age, larger newborns, and higher BMI and adiposity levels, as well as worse cognitive, motor, socio-emotional, and behavioral outcomes.

Effective disaster management to cope with future climate change, especially extreme precipitation, requires a robust framework to estimate such damage. For this study, we develop a model based on a convolutional neural network to estimate the area (in acres) of cropland damaged by flooding at the county level. Then we demonstrate the model's performance for the period 2008-2019 over corn and soybean fields in the midwestern United States, which suffer frequent damage from recurrent flooding. We fed the network with remote sensing images and weather fields and divide the growing season into two windows, the early season (May-June) and the late season (July-November) for better performance. The results show mean relative error within +/- 25% and relative root mean square error within 35%-75% in majority of the counties for most years. Finally, we show that the model forced with meteorological variables alone can provide acceptable accuracy, which indicates it can be applied to forecasting crop damage area in the upcoming season or the studying of future climate impact on crop productivity. In principle, the model can also be applied to food security assessment at the global scale using available records.

Misfit rivers under ENSO regimes: The deactivation of the Colorado River system of Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Misfit rivers; Paleohydrology; ENSO events; Colorado river; Argentina		The Colorado River has significantly diminished its drainage area and annual discharge. Today it flows across several provinces of Argentina (Neuquen, Mendoza, La Pampa, Rio Negro and Buenos Aires) although during the Upper Pleistocene this watershed area was more extended. Its discharge also diminished significantly during documented times although floods occurred episodically during anomalous ENSO years. The delta plain is composed of several lobes of different ages. Four distributary arms were operating during the Mid-Holocene highstand. At the northernmost distributary arm, Tagelus plebeius remains of 350 +/- 50 C-14 years BP were collected living in position on the supratidal flat. Close to this modern channel several foredune ridges were recognised. A blocking of the river occurred in 1906, and originated a conic lobe located 36 km from the present shoreline. Due to a flood caused by a sudden scabland of the Cari Lauquen Lake in 1914, the blockage opened. Another blockage was achieved between 1924 and 1925, but another flood in 1931 originated a new arm: the Colorado Nuevo. The ENSO-triggered flood of 1983 signified the last connection of the Desaguadero-Curaco? River system. Man-made alterations are responsible for the increase in salinity along the lower floodplain and increasing the risk of onion crops. These particular processes of desertification with floods should be monitored in relation to climate-change previsions.

Many studies have analyzed the impacts of rainfall or reservoir separately on the downstream sediment load; however, few researches investigated the coupled effect of rainfall and reservoir on sediment load change. In this study, a rainfall-augmented sediment trapping index (RSTI) that combines the impacts of effective rainfall and reservoir sediment trapping capacity was developed to attribute the sediment load change in the Wujiang River Basin (WRB) during the period of 1952-2017. Eight linear or nonlinear regression models were set up to investigate how to best utilize the proposed RSTI to reveal the coupled effect of rainfall and reservoir on the downstream sediment load of WRB. It is found that observed sediment load has a large decrease after 1984 when the Wujiangdu Reservoir was put into full operation while rainfall had only a slight change in the same period. The nonlinear regression model with RSTI as an explanatory variable (NSE = 0.837) has the best performance in simulating the observed sediment load series. These results might be helpful for the downstream sediment management under a changing environment.

Environmental health risk relationships, responsibility, and sources of information among Vietnamese Americans in coastal Mississippi	HEALTH RISK & SOCIETY			English	Article						Environmental health; risk perception; Vietnamese American; relational risk; Mississippi; community-based participatory research	PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; HURRICANE-KATRINA; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; RESILIENCE; PERSPECTIVES; ADAPTATION; DISASTER; POVERTY	Coastal communities along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been profoundly shaped by environmental health (EH) threats, reflecting the region's history of natural and technological disasters, as well as ongoing issues of environmental degradation and pollution. The Vietnamese American community in the state of Mississippi is vulnerable to EH threats, but there is limited research on their risk perceptions. Understanding perceptions of risk and responsibility is important to manage EH risks and promote community resilience. This community-based participatory research study characterises Vietnamese American perceptions of EH risks, sources of information, and responsibility in coastal Mississippi. Five focus groups were conducted in 2016 and 2017 in Biloxi, Mississippi with Vietnamese Americans working in the seafood industry (n = 24) and mothers of children under the age of 18 (n = 25). Findings related to participants' concerns with air quality, drinking water quality, and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill are interpreted using Boholm's relational theory of risk. Unreliable access to healthcare and limited English proficiency constrain participants from acting on their environmental health risk relationships. A community-based organisation in Biloxi that works with Vietnamese Americans plays an important role in addressing risk in this population.

Objective: Add new records of previously described species and to contribute to the knowledge of the planktonic communities present in tropical mountain and lowland lakes of the northeast Colombian Andes. Methods: Planktonic samples were collected and physicochemical variables measured in nine tropical lakes. Organisms were identified and a bibliographic search was carried out in databases and research articles to the identification of the new records to Colombia. Results: We present the data corresponding to six physicochemical variables measured in tropical lakes of this region and expand the existing information on organisms present in tropical lakes with a list of 391 taxa (299 phytoplankton and 92 zooplankton). The proportion of planktonic species unique to tropical lakes and the low similarity between lake types found with a Jaccard analysis indicated high heterogeneity of ecological conditions in the studied lakes. Conclusions: The 391 taxa found and 15 new records contribute to the list of planktonic organisms present in tropical lakes located in high and low areas of the Colombian northeast Andes.

When LW accumulates and forms logjams, large volumes of sediment can be deposited, resulting in increased backwater. The logjams can then suddenly collapse, with the deposited sediment and accumulated water increasing the magnitude of debris-flow peak discharge. To better understand the characteristics of debris flow discharge caused by LW accumulation and collapsed logjams, as well as the associated magnitude amplification effects, a series of experiments was carried out in a laboratory experimental channel. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the process of LW accumulation and collapse and to determine the magnitude amplification ratio of the debris flow peak discharge with LW. The results revealed three types of debris flow movement with LW: flow with no clogging or breakage, flow with clogging but without breakage, and flow with both clogging and breakage. The results indicated a significant effect on the magnitude amplification ratio caused by LW clogging and breakage. The maximum magnitude amplification ratio was 1.60 in the experiments, with a relative LW length and volume of 0.875 and 0.75, respectively, during the clogging and breakage process.

The accurate prediction of full-scale seepage flow rate in field conditions is critical for mine site management, flood control, and contaminant treatment strategies. In this study, a machine learning methodology based on artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to correlate measured seepage flow rate with the weather monitoring data collected from the field of Equity Silver mine. Comparing with traditional numerical and water balance approaches, the ANN approach generally requires much fewer investigations on hydrogeological mechanisms or definitions of parameters and equations. The measured seepage flow rates from the Bessemer Dump and the weather monitoring data during 1998-2017 are used for training the proposed ANN. The calculated results from the trained ANN show good agreement with the measurements. In addition, the proposed ANN approach is further refined by including time tags of the monitoring data in the input layer, which enable the ANN to investigate the effects of long-term weather trends, climate change, and dynamics inside waste rock piles on seepage flow. The prediction results for the following year (2017-2018) from the refined ANN and the original ANN are compared, which shows the improvement of the refined ANN approach.

The application of frameworks for measuring social vulnerability and resilience to geophysical hazards within developing countries: A systematic review and narrative synthesis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Social vulnerability; Resilience; Measurement; Systematic literature review	YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA; NATURAL HAZARDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT; INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES; URBAN VULNERABILITY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; FLOOD HAZARDS; RISK	Quantifying and mapping resilience and social vulnerability is a widely used technique to support risk management, with recent years seeing a proliferation of applications across the Global South. To synthesise this emerging literature, we conducted a systematic review of applications of social vulnerability and resilience frameworks in Lower and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) using the PRISMA methodology. 2152 papers were extracted from 15 databases and then screened according to our pre-defined criteria, leaving 68 studies for full text analysis. Our analysis revealed that: (1) Most studies consider vulnerability or resilience to be generic properties of social systems; (2) Few papers measured vulnerability or resilience in a way that tests whether they are relatively stable or dynamic features of social systems; (3) Many applications rely on stock applications of existing frameworks, with little adaptation to specific cultural, societal or economic contexts; (4) There is a lack of systematic validation; (5) More hypothesis driven studies (as opposed to descriptive mapping exercises) are required in order to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms through which vulnerability and resilience shape the capacity to prepare for, respond and recover from disasters.

High flow variability and storm events shape the ecology of the Mbhashe Estuary, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; macroinvertebrates; mangroves; fish; floods; phytoplankton; storm surges	FRESH-WATER FLOW; TRANSKEI ESTUARIES; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; EASTERN CAPE; RIVER; ABUNDANCE; IMPACT; COMMUNITY; SCALE; ZOOPLANKTON	The possible impacts of extreme events on the ecology of selected aquatic biota within the Mbhashe Estuary were investigated during a four year (2010-2013) spring sampling programme. During periods of low to average flow conditions the estuary is shallow, turbid and characterised by the presence of fluid mud and the build-up of mud and clay deposits. During these conditions, extremely high biomasses of intertidal microalgae and zooplankton are present. Fish and macroinvertebrate abundance and diversity are also highest during low-flow conditions. Flood events can reset, or partially disrupt, the sediment erosion/depositional cycle and decrease the biomass and diversity of plankton, fish and macroinvertebrate species. The Mbhashe Estuary's unique fluid mud habitat is therefore subjected to regular resetting, which potentially contributes to the fluid nature of the muds. A storm surge in 2011 resulted in the temporary dieback of an area of mangroves, as a result of the deposition of marine sediment. Although extreme events seem to play an important role in the deposition and erosion cycle of the estuary, an increased frequency of both types of extreme events may ultimately result in estuarine habitat loss, which will adversely affect the biota of the estuary.

How to improve attribution of changes in drought and flood impacts (Reprinted from Hydrological Sciences Journal, 2019)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Reprint						hydrological extremes; damage; dynamic risk; vulnerability; trend attribution; paired catchments; consecutive hydro-hazards	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX; DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATURAL HAZARDS; RIVER-FLOODS; ECONOMIC-IMPACTS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; DISASTER LOSSES; FOOD SECURITY; UNITED-STATES	For the development of sustainable, efficient risk management strategies for the hydrological extremes of droughts and floods, it is essential to understand the temporal changes of impacts, and their respective causes and interactions. In particular, little is known about changes in vulnerability and their influence on drought and flood impacts. We present a fictitious dialogue between two experts, one in droughts and the other in floods, showing that the main obstacles to scientific advancement in this area are both a lack of data and a lack of commonly accepted approaches. The drought and flood experts "discuss" available data and methods and we suggest a complementary approach. This approach consists of collecting a large number of single or multiple paired-event case studies from catchments around the world, undertaking detailed analyses of changes in impacts and drivers, and carrying out a comparative analysis. The advantages of this approach are that it allows detailed context- and location-specific assessments based on the paired-event analyses, and reveals general, transferable conclusions based on the comparative analysis of various case studies. Additionally, it is quite flexible in terms of data and can accommodate differences between floods and droughts.

Transition Period Between Vegetation Growth and Senescence Controlling Interannual Variability of C Fluxes in a Mediterranean Reed Wetland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS WETLAND; ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE; METHANE EMISSION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CO2 EXCHANGE; WATER-VAPOR; RESPIRATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; FLUXNET	Wetlands are crucial ecosystems modulating climate change due to their great potential to capture carbon dioxide (CO2), emit methane (CH4), and regulate local climate through evapotranspiration (ET). Common reed wetlands are particularly interesting given their high productivity, abundance, and highly efficient internal gas-transport mechanism. However, little is known about the interannual behavior and dominant controlling factors of Mediterranean reed wetlands, characterized by seasonal flooding and remarkable weather variability. After six years of ecosystem carbon and ET flux measurements by eddy covariance (three years for CH4 fluxes), this study shows the functional vulnerability of such wetlands to climate variability, switching between carbon (CO2 + CH4) sink (660 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1), in 2014) and source (360 g CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1), in 2016) in short periods of time. According to our analyses, the great interannual variability appeared to mainly depend on the behavior of reed growth dynamics during the transition to senescence period, what is confirmed through the enhanced vegetation index as a proxy of photosynthetic activity. Additionally, a similar behavior of seasonal and daily patterns of carbon fluxes and ET was found compared with other wetlands under different climates.

This paper quantified the flood frequency modifications caused by multi-reservoir regulation with recorded data and a numerical model composed of peaks-over-threshold (POT) samples and time-trend models. The whole research was carried out in Dongjiang River Basin, Southern China. Results showed that (1) Sampling with the POT method could eliminate fake changes in change detection and prevent the underestimation of the design floods with an exceeding probability over 90% and the overestimation of the design floods with an exceeding probability less than 80%; (2) Multi-reservoir regulation severely reduced design flood when the exceeding probability was greater than 1% and smaller than 95%. The 10-year floods were mitigated the most. However, when the exceeding probability was over 95%, the impact was insignificant; (3) Flood mitigation was positively correlated to the number of reservoirs, but negatively correlated to the distance between the affecting reservoir and the affected station. However, when multiple reservoirs took effect on the design flood in one station, the closest reservoir did not necessarily take the most effect. The results of this research will amplify the theoretical basis for flood protection and the planning of regulation.

J	Kolstad, I; Karim, A; Lujala, P; Wiig, A				Kolstad, Ivar; Karim, Azreen; Lujala, Paeivi; Wiig, Arne			Expert adoption of composite indices: a randomized experiment on migrant resettlement decisions in Bangladesh	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Migration; Climate change; Resettlement index; Decision making; Bangladesh; Discrete choice experiment	DESIGN	In settings where complex social decisions are made, information is often aggregated into indices to facilitate decision making. The value added of such composite indices depends, inter alia, on the extent to which decision makers trust and make use of them. This paper presents a randomized experiment on the use of an index designed to inform migrant resettlement decisions, using 410 graduate students in Bangladesh as respondents. Respondents were randomly assigned to control and treatment conditions. In the control group, respondents faced a discrete choice experiment where they were asked to allocate 1000 migrants between two locations described by five attributes (availability of cropland, distance to hospital, distance to school, poverty incidence, frequency of floods, droughts and cyclones). In the treatment group, respondents also had access to the migrant resettlement index for the two locations. Results show that the resettlement index is used by the respondents, and mechanism analyses suggest this is due to perceptions of improved benefits to costs from using the index to make decisions. Results from the control group also suggest that past adverse environmental events are particularly important for resettlement decisions, but less so for respondents who grew up in areas where such events were frequent.

This study investigated the causes and the effects of flooding on road transportation in Rwanda, Kigali city and contributed to the mitigation measures. The data were collected by administering 150 questionnaires on the respondents within the study area and by physical survey. The hypotheses were formulated and tested using the statistical method of student???s t-test and the data displayed a significant difference (P<0.05). The results of this study revealed that heavy rains, poor drainage systems, illegal disposal of waste in drains, and poor construction and maintenance of roads are the main causes of road flooding in the city of Kigali. The effects of floods on road transportation include traffic jam and increased travel time, damage to road structures, blockage of drains and traffic accidents in the study area. The study recommends green storm water infrastructure practices, good road construction works, controlled dumping sites, the construction and maintenance of drainage systems and an immediate government response to the threat of flooding to address the challenges of flooding on road transportation in the city of Kigali.

Stormwater Detention Ponds in Urban Catchments-Analysis and Validation of Performance of Ponds in the Ouseburn Catchment, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK	WATER			English	Article						stormwater detention ponds; flooding; urban catchments; stormwater drainage; separated sewer systems; urban development	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; IMPACTS; BASINS; FLOW; URBANIZATION; HYDROLOGY; DESIGN	The impact of stormwater drainage and detention ponds on flooding is assessed using statistical analysis and physically based computer simulation of a 45-year case study for a peri-urban catchment. In 1978, the 54 km(2) Ouseburn catchment in Newcastle upon Tyne was impacted by the connection of a new 2.1 km(2) residential development, directly to the Ouseburn River, via a stormwater drain, which reduced the time to peak and increased flood risk. Further residential developments of 1.6 km(2) have been built since 2004, again with separated sewer systems, but this time linked to stormwater detention ponds before draining into the Ouseburn River. Detailed analysis of the data, confirmed with computer simulation, shows that in contrast with the 1978 intervention, these new developments had only a minimal effect on the flows in the Ouseburn River, in fact achieving a small reduction in peak flows for large events. This study assesses the post-construction efficiency of such systems, and we show that the stormwater detention ponds are working as designed.

These phenomena threaten farmers in coastal regions of Myanmar. Self-insurance through means such as crop diversification is insufficient for sustainable farm management. Weather index insurance (WII) is receiving much attention because of its low management costs. An optimum WII contract for flood damage using rainfall as the index has been proposed for rice farmers in coastal regions. According to the model, an insurance payment demand function is derived by solving the expected utility maximization problem. The utility function of the contract is specified as constant relative risk aversion type. The production function is specified as Cobb-Douglas type. By substituting real average data of rice production of farmers into this function, the optimum insurance payment and premium are obtained. Changes in insurance compensation by payments according to an increase in the price of rice, rainfall, and degree of risk aversion are investigated. Results suggest that if an average farmer pays around 41.5 US dollars per year, then farm management will be optimally stabilized under the flood risk.

At the same time, these communities are experiencing an ageing population. As climate change contributes to rising sea levels and an increase in the intensity and frequency of climate-related disasters, older populations living in rural coastal communities face heightened risks. This is a qualitative case study examining the ageing in place (AIP) experiences of older people living in a disaster-prone rural coastal community in Hong Kong-Tai O Village. Findings highlight that: (i) a critical dimension of AIP is their ability to sustain and continue their work, which played a multidimensional role, (ii) local community-based organizations play an instrumental role in providing social support in a disaster context, (iii) more support and resources for mitigation activities are needed, and (iv) while supports exist for AIP and in a disaster situation, the older residents may not utilize such supports. In addition to informing age-friendly DRR programmes and research, these findings inform AIP practices, policies, and research relevant to rural coastal communities.

Research about protection/monitoring of cultural heritage is crucial to preserve our cultural properties and (with them also) our history and identity. This paper is focused on the use of the open-source Google Earth Engine tool herein used to analyze flood and fire events which affected the area of Metaponto (southern Italy), near the homonymous Greek-Roman archaeological site. The use of the Google Earth Engine has allowed the supervised and unsupervised classification of areas affected by flooding (2013-2020) and fire (2017) in the past years, obtaining remarkable results and useful information for setting up strategies to mitigate damage and support the preservation of areas and landscape rich in cultural and natural heritage.

The expected rise in flood frequency and magnitude due to climate change and rapid urbanization will result in more frequent and severe impacts to the systems, prompting the need to strengthen resilience to potential impacts and minimize recovery times. This study adopted a five-stage process-literature review, preassessment, pretesting, a three-round Delphi survey, and tool evaluation-to develop a qualitative technical resilience assessment tool (QTRAT). Thematic analysis and standard descriptive statistical analysis were applied during the study. A qualitative tool with 4 principles and 10 indicators is proposed with a final semiquantitative technical index (FSTRI), where system maintenance, future expansion capability, renewal plans, and spare parts and equipment availability are the leading indicators. Evaluation results suggest that Tanzania urban WSSs have moderate resilience and are in particular need of improved design guidelines encompassing resilience aspects. The tool developed in this study contributes to informed decision-making about priority planning and budgeting of water organizations to improve the urban WSSs' technical resilience.

Reliable topography and bathymetry information are fundamental parameters for modelling the morpho-hydrodynamics of coastal areas, for flood forecasting, and for coastal management. Traditional methods such as ground, ship-borne, and airborne surveys suffer from limited spatial coverage and temporal sampling due to logistical constraints and high costs which limit their ability to provide the needed information. The recent advancements of spaceborne remote sensing techniques, along with their ability to acquire data over large spatial areas and to provide high frequency temporal monitoring, has made them very attractive for topography and bathymetry mapping. In this review, we present an overview of the current state of spaceborne-based remote sensing techniques used to estimate the topography and bathymetry of beaches, intertidal, and nearshore areas.

Modeling Connectivity of Non-floodplain Wetlands: Insights, Approaches, and Recommendations	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						wetlands; hydrologic connectivity; process-based models	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; PRAIRIE POTHOLE REGION; SURFACE-WATER CONNECTIVITY; HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY; STREAM CONNECTIVITY; DOWNSTREAM WATERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE; QUALITY; IMPACT	Representing hydrologic connectivity of non-floodplain wetlands (NFWs) to downstream waters in process-based models is an emerging challenge relevant to many research, regulatory, and management activities. We review four case studies that utilize process-based models developed to simulate NFW hydrology. Models range from a simple, lumped parameter model to a highly complex, fully distributed model. Across case studies, we highlight appropriate application of each model, emphasizing spatial scale, computational demands, process representation, and model limitations. We end with a synthesis of recommended "best modeling practices" to guide model application. These recommendations include: (1) clearly articulate modeling objectives, and revisit and adjust those objectives regularly; (2) develop a conceptualization of NFW connectivity using qualitative observations, empirical data, and process-based modeling; (3) select a model to represent NFW connectivity by balancing both modeling objectives and available resources; (4) use innovative techniques and data sources to validate and calibrate NFW connectivity simulations; and (5) clearly articulate the limits of the resulting NFW connectivity representation. Our review and synthesis of these case studies highlights modeling approaches that incorporate NFW connectivity, demonstrates tradeoffs in model selection, and ultimately provides actionable guidance for future model application and development.

The flood of September 1st, 2009, in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso)	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; URBAN-POOR; CAPACITY; LAGOS	In light of the expected growing natural hazards and the continued growth of urban populations, there is concern that the vulnerability of a significant portion of the urban African population will increase. The objective of the paper is to analyze factors associated with the status of "disaster victim" in Ouagadougou, the capital-city of Burkina Faso. On September 1st, 2009, this city experienced torrential rainfall leading to water runoffs and floods. Over 180,000 people were severely affected, about 41 people died and 33,172 houses completely destroyed. The data availability from the Ouagadougou Health and Demographic Surveillance System, especially characteristics of population dwellings before the flood, grant the opportunity to address the impact of this event among the different social groups. Modeling data with logistic regressions, the results reinforce the idea that the main cause of disaster is not hazards. Indeed, natural disaster amplify urban inequities given the role playing by variables related to extreme poverty (no sanitation, no electricity) as determinant factors. Discussion highlights how some households inhabitants make the reasoned choice of gradually reoccupying their plots, although aware of risks. In Sub-Saharan Africa, early warning system for floods should be seen as essential in urban settings.

While regional climate adaptation investments can provide substantive flood protection, existing plans often neglect uncertainty in future climate conditions and adaptation performance, consequently neglecting the option value of flexibly implementing proposed projects. Addressing this gap, we develop and employ a generalizable real options analysis (ROA) valuation framework that considers how uncertainty in adaptation project costs, SLR, flood severity, and flood losses inform the full range of adaptation performance outcomes. We further propose and apply a novel, computationally efficient flood loss sampling algorithm to estimate the consequences of randomly arriving coastal flood events. We apply this ROA framework to assess the option value of flexibly timing adaptation investments over time, investigating an adaptation pathway proposed by the City of Boston from the perspective of the regional transit system manager. Our results suggest that flexible implementation can provide significant option value in the near- to mid-term (>30 years), with the highest option values under low-probability, high-consequence scenarios. Our results also suggest adaptation pathway performance in the latter half of the 21st century is most sensitive to uncertainty in SLR, flood loss estimates, and flood frequency, underscoring the importance of uncertainty quantification in the long-term valuation of adaptation investments.

A panel survey was conducted among residents of flood-and landslide-prone areas in Ehime Prefecture before and after heavy rainfall. A pre-survey explored a wide range of variables related to participants' everyday awareness of disaster preparedness prior to heavy rains, followed by a post-survey that examined their actual evacuation behavior when evacuation warnings were issued during subsequent heavy rains. By analyzing the survey data, we identified prior variables related to disaster preparedness that were associated with evacuation choice. The participants had a high level of disaster preparedness, including evacua-tion intentions, but many of them did not actually evacuate even when evacuation warnings were issued due to heavy rains. Furthermore, only prior contemplation of evacuation criteria (associ-ated with the commitment to evacuate) was directly related to evacuation behavior. Finally, me-diation analysis indicated that prior contemplation mediated the relationship between evacua-tion intentions and actual evacuation. The implications of these findings for education and com-munications to reduce disaster risk are discussed.

Technical Reports: Methods-The Application of Temperature and Light Intensity as Intermittency Sensors in a Temporary Pond	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						temporary pond; diel temperature range; hydrological state; data logger; phase	FLOW INTERMITTENCY; HYDROPERIOD; STREAMFLOW; DURATION; BENEATH; RIVERS	As climate change progresses, hydrological regimes of temporary and perennial water bodies are projected to change, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Researchers have successfully employed the use of satellite imagery, camera traps and site visits to map these changes in hydrological regimes. Data loggers of conductivity have also been used in mapping hydrological regimes, but the use of data loggers of temperature and light intensity is uncommon. Using validated data of 213 days of the aquatic and terrestrial phases of a temporary pond, we show that metrics of temperature and light intensity can be used to discern hydrological state. The aquatic phase had lower measures of both parameters when compared to the terrestrial phase. This was attributed to the high specific heat of the aquatic environment and the absorption and redirection of light in water. The most powerful metrics in discerning hydrological state were diel temperature range, diel maximum temperature and light intensity standard deviation. Greater distinctive power was obtained through the use of multiple metrics of the parameters. In addition, key events such as flooding and drying were identifiable within metrics of both parameters. High-resolution temperature and light intensity data are able to aid in understanding the dynamics of hydrological state and can be used to monitor ecosystem functions amid changes in temporary and perennial water bodies.

To rectify this imbalance, adaptation plans can explicitly include projects that not only lower the threat for these populations but also may provide co-benefits that improve the quality of their lives. One method to evaluate these co-benefits or any additional costs to these populations in the analysis of adaptation options is to monetize them. Monetization will convert these generally non-market impacts into monetary units and allow them to compared with each other as well as other market impacts in benefit-cost analyses. The monetized values can also be weighted by the utility of these benefits and costs to the different socio-economic groups in a population. Using illustrative case studies in two areas of Boston USA with different socio-economic conditions but similar population sizes and flood threats, this evaluation approach is tested when using nature-based solutions (NBS) to lower flood threats. The non-market benefits and costs included are improved air quality, availability of public transportation, recreational space, rent escalation due to gentrification, and prevented loss of wages due to reduction in mental stress. Utility is an inverse function of annual income. The case studies illustrate that by quantifying the non-market impacts the value of including adaptation actions that promote climate justice co-benefits can be shown.

Such events have been particularly recurrent on the Spanish Mediterranean coast in recent years. This study's first objective is to update the trends in the magnitude and seasonality of precipitation in Spain from 1951 to 2019 at different time scales. Secondly, we analyse how extreme precipitation events recorded in recent years can modify water infrastruc-ture design flows. A QGIS plugin was programmed using Python to calculate the design flows in accordance with the methodologies legally established in Spain.New hydrological insights for the region: The results confirm the decreasing trend in annual pre-cipitation in most of the Spanish territory. This decrease was particularly significant during March and June. Moreover, the average increases of around 30-40 % in design flows, which reached double the values obtained in the reference period of 1951-1990 in some basins, confirm the relevance of incorporating high-intensity storm events recorded in recent years into flow calcu-lations in Peninsular Spain. Design flows obtained without using the most recent rainfall data can be underestimated, with profound risk implications. Therefore, there is a sufficient technical basis to draw attention to this problem and recommend its formal consideration by competent authorities.

Natural water retention measures are particularly helpful to manage runoff water, providing also additional co-benefits to the local population. However, the very limited knowledge of their benefits among citizens hinders their implementation, especially across southern European countries. Therefore, information and dissemination activities aimed at showing the benefits of these measures are particularly important to stimulate implementation by private citizens, although only a few studies have previously investigated their role. This paper considers some demonstrations of natural water retention measures-and the related information and dissemination activities to the local population-in northeastern Italy, explicitly including them as a driver in the Protection Motivation Theory framework. Through a direct survey of 219 households, it aims to quantitatively assess the impact on citizens' willingness to implement natural water retention measures of the different levels of access to information provision, namely, the role played by active access through participation in the activities; passive access to available information; and no access. The results show that citizens' willingness to implement the interventions on their properties is positively affected by their active access to information, thus highlighting the importance of high-quality information provision by public and private actors.

Fires can benefit biodiversity, as post-burn early successional stages provide diverse habitats and niches for many species. How fire disturbance affects niche use and niche overlap of species is poorly understood so far. We studied the effect of anthropogenic fire on breeding habitat use, niche breadth and niche overlap of five sympatric bunting species breeding in wetlands of the Amur River floodplain (Russian Far East). Fire frequency, measured as the time an area burnt in the period 2000 to 2017, was mapped from Landsat imagery and related to the presence or absence of the species. Niche breadth and niche overlap were calculated separately for occurrences in burned (within the study year) and unburned patches. Fire frequency characterized differences in niche use among the species, but the probability of presence was not affected by recent fire in four of five species. Niche breadth was significantly lower in recently burned patches, but we found no increase in niche overlap between species after fire. Instead, the studied species seemed to occupy similar patches before and after fire, possibly because of a high site fidelity. Our results clearly show that fire frequency is a major determinant for the niche separation in the five studied species, while recent fire does not affect niche overlap.

Anticipating and Adapting to the Future Impacts of Climate Change on the Health, Security and Welfare of Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) Communities in Southeastern USA	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Review						sea level rise; land loss; low elevation coastal zones; social sciences; human health; adaptive management; cyber network; coastal resilience; computer modeling	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; INFRASTRUCTURE; DIVERGENCE; INDICATORS; INUNDATION; DECISIONS; RESIDENTS	Low elevation coastal zones (LECZ) are extensive throughout the southeastern United States. LECZ communities are threatened by inundation from sea level rise, storm surge, wetland degradation, land subsidence, and hydrological flooding. Communication among scientists, stakeholders, policy makers and minority and poor residents must improve. We must predict processes spanning the ecological, physical, social, and health sciences. Communities need to address linkages of (1) human and socioeconomic vulnerabilities; (2) public health and safety; (3) economic concerns; (4) land loss; (5) wetland threats; and (6) coastal inundation. Essential capabilities must include a network to assemble and distribute data and model code to assess risk and its causes, support adaptive management, and improve the resiliency of communities. Better communication of information and understanding among residents and officials is essential. Here we review recent background literature on these matters and offer recommendations for integrating natural and social sciences. We advocate for a cyber-network of scientists, modelers, engineers, educators, and stakeholders from academia, federal state and local agencies, non-governmental organizations, residents, and the private sector. Our vision is to enhance future resilience of LECZ communities by offering approaches to mitigate hazards to human health, safety and welfare and reduce impacts to coastal residents and industries.

In 2010-2013, more than 73 thousand hectares of fire-prone peatlands were rewetted in the Moscow Region (the hitherto largest rewetting program in the Northern Hemisphere). As the Russian Federation has no national accounting of rewetted areas yet, this paper presents an approach to detect them based on multispectral satellite data verified by ground truthing. We propose that effectively rewetted areas should minimally include areas with wet grasslands and those covered with water (cf. the IPCC categories "rewetted organic soils" and "flooded lands"). In 2020, these lands amounted in Moscow Region to more than 5.3 and 3.6 thousand hectares, respectively. Assuming that most rewetted areas were former peat extraction sites and using IPCC default GHG emission factors, an overall GHG emission reduction of over 36,000 tCO(2)-eq year(-1) was calculated. We furthermore considered the uncertainty of calculations. With the example of a 1535 ha large rewetted peatland, we illustrate the estimation of GHG emission reductions for the period up to 2050. The approach presented can be used to estimate GHG emission reductions by peatland rewetting on the national, regional, and object level.

They are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity if global warming continues unabated. Here we present a case study of the first direct observations of the impact of AR rain-on-snow (RoS) events on the marginal snowpack of the Australian Alps. Reanalysis data show ARs embedded within strong northwesterly airflow extended over 4000 km from the eastern Indian Ocean to southeast Australia, where orographic processes enhanced RoS. We quantify for the first-time radiation and turbulent energy flux exchanges using eddy covariance and the contribution of rain heat flux to the snowpack during the AR RoS events. The hydrological response of an above snow line catchment that includes Australia's highest peak during the events was rapid, with discharge increasing by nearly two orders of magnitude above historical mean winter discharge. This reflects the isothermal properties of the marginal Australian snowpack, where small increases in energy from RoS can trigger rapid snowmelt leading to flash flooding. Discharge decreased quickly following the passage of the ARs and onset of cold air advection. Based on climate projections of approximate to+12.5 degrees C warming in the Australian Alps by midcentury combined with an already historically, close-to-ripe snowpack, we postulate that ARinduced RoS events will accelerate the loss of snow cover.

These lakes may pose threats of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in high mountain areas, particularly if new lakes form in geomorphological setups prone to triggering events such as landslides or moraine collapses. We present the first complete inventory for future glacial lakes in High Mountain Asia by computing the subglacial bedrock for similar to 100 000 glaciers and estimating overdeepening area, volume and impact hazard for the larger potential lakes. We detect 25 285 overdeepenings larger than 10(4) m(2) with a volume of 99.1 +/- 28.6 km(3) covering an area of 2683 +/- 773.8 km(2). For the 2700 overdeepenings larger than 10(5) m(2), we assess the lake predisposition for mass-movement impacts that could trigger a GLOF by estimating the hazard of material detaching from surrounding slopes. Our findings indicate a shift in lake area, volume and GLOF hazard from the southwestern Himalayan region toward the Karakoram. The results of this study can be used for anticipating emerging threats and potentials connected to glacial lakes and as a basis for further studies at suspected GLOF hazard hotspots.

J	Thomaz, SM				Thomaz, Sidinei Magela			Propagule pressure and environmental filters related to non-native species success in river-floodplain ecosystems	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Review						Alien species; Exotic species; Invasive species; Non-native species; Disturbance regime; Biotic resistance hypothesis; Biotic acceptance hypothesis; Flood pulse	CARP CYPRINUS-CARPIO; EXOTIC DIOSCOREA-OPPOSITIFOLIA; ROTAN PERCCOTTUS-GLENII; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; PARANA RIVER; COMMON CARP; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIMNOPERNA-FORTUNEI; FLOW REGIMES; HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS	The flood pulse is the main driving force influencing river floodplain ecosystems. The dominant role of the flood pulse on the success of non-native species (NNSs) is what differentiates floodplains from other ecosystems, in terms of invasion. In this review, I discuss some patterns related to the performance of NNSs in response to the flood pulse. First, floods connect floodplain habitats and spread propagules of NNSs, causing 'propagule pulses' in these ecosystems. After the establishment of NNSs, floodplains may function as steppingstones for future invasions, because propagule pulses enhance invasions in nearby landscapes. Second, the flood pulse changes environmental filters, with consequences for invasion success and for the coexistence of native and NNSs. Flooding represents a disturbance that enhances the success of some NNSs by reducing biotic resistance and changing resource availability, but diminishes the success of others. Drought enhances the invasion success mainly of NNSs that colonize the aquatic-terrestrial transition zone. Third, impacts caused by river regulation and global changes alter the flood pulse, which in turn affects invasion success. There is a great degree of idiosyncrasy in these patterns, but they pose a broad perspective that helps to understand and manage NNSs in floodplains.

Typically, increased floods have been attributed to climate change with limited evidence. Although this may be true in some cases, it minimizes the role of landscape change as a result of urban growth. Given the complexity of cities, this study characterizes urban morphology types and incorporate them with physiographic data to estimate the peak surface runoff in the Oforikrom Municipality of Ghana. The urban morphology was categorized into high, moderate and low dense human settlements, and further characterized based on the horizontal spacing between buildings, and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains. The results identify vulnerable areas with information on surface runoff - thus facilitating the spatial targeting of intervention efforts. We found that room for flood waters is inadequate in terms of the capacity of storm water drains, and the land area left after human development. For storm water drains, the size is inadequate, their sanitary condition needs improvement, and their number need increasing based on catchment area. Informal and unstructured human settlements reduce the available room and artificially extend the flow path of runoff, which promotes flow accumulation thereby increasing the volume and destructive impact of flood waters. The study recommends intervention efforts to spatially target the creation of adequate room for flood waters to flow.

J	Kim, Y; Seo, JI				Kim, Yongku; Seo, Jung In			Objective Bayesian Prediction of Future Record Statistics Based on the Exponentiated Gumbel Distribution: Comparison with Time-Series Prediction	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						exponentiated gumbel distribution; objective Bayesian analysis; record value; time series		The interest in the study of record statistics has been increasing in recent years in the context of predicting stock markets and addressing global warming and climate change problems such as cyclones and floods. However, because record values are mostly rare observed, its probability distribution may be skewed or asymmetric. In this case, the Bayesian approach with a reasonable choice of the prior distribution can be a good alternative. This paper presents an objective Bayesian method for predicting future record values when observed record values have a two-parameter exponentiated Gumbel distribution with the scale and shape parameters. For objective Bayesian analysis, objective priors such as the Jeffreys and reference priors are first derived from the Fisher information matrix for the scale and shape parameters, and an analysis of the resulting posterior distribution is then performed to examine its properness and validity. In addition, under the derived objective prior distributions, a simple algorithm using a pivotal quantity is proposed to predict future record values. To validate the proposed approach, it was applied to a real dataset. For a closer examination and demonstration of the superiority of the proposed predictive method, it was compared to time-series models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average and dynamic linear model in an analysis of real data that can be observed from an infinite time series comprising independent sample values.

The limits of a disaster imagination: a study of two communities hit by Haiyan	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						Disaster imagination; Haiyan; understanding of risk; risk communication; science communication	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; RESPONSES; FLOODS; MODEL	In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (Local Name: Yolanda) caused major damage and loss of life in the Philippines. Of special concern here is Palo, Leyte, which suffered the impact of storm surges. Previous studies blame media for not highlighting the impact of storm surges, people for ignoring the warnings given, and both people and government for not remembering and learning from previous storms. These notions assume that disaster knowledge, imagination, and memory are interlinked, and that government and people understand disaster risk in the same way. This study uses Encoding-Decoding Theory to challenge the assumption of uniform risk perception. The researcher investigated how warning information traveled from Palo's local government to its citizens, how the information was understood, and what this understanding indicates about risk perceptions of the same phenomenon. The researcher conducted interviews and focus group discussions in two locations: one closer to the city center (Poblacion) and another closer to the sea (Coastal). Following systematic qualitative analysis of the data, the researcher found that local governments expected people to act intuitively on descriptive information. However, citizens assessed warnings against their immediate surroundings or an exact memory. Some were even resentful of their government, which changed how they regarded later storm warnings. These findings have implications for risk communication, which requires an understanding of risk subcultures and how they can vary even within the same municipality.

Geographic and Social Predictors of Flood Risk Awareness	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Awareness; disaster; flood; hazard; physical vulnerability; risk; visibility	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERCEPTION; DISASTER; HAZARDS; VULNERABILITY; PREPAREDNESS; RESILIENCE; EVACUATION; EXPOSURE; IMPACT	The persistent gap in flood risk awareness in Canada, and elsewhere in North America, is a continual source of worry for researchers and emergency managers; many people living in at-risk places are simply unaware of risks and of their proximity to hazards. This study seeks to understand which residents were aware of flood risk, using unique representative survey data of Calgary residents living in the city's flood-prone neighborhoods collected after the devastating and costly 2013 Southern Alberta Flood. The article uses logistic regression models to analyze which residents were aware of risk to their homes. Findings indicate that, in addition to various demographic predictors, many of the geographic predictors (including the elevation of one's home relative to the river) are significant predictors of awareness. Having a direct sight line to one of Calgary's two rivers is also a significant predictor in some of the models, suggesting that the visibility of hazards matters for flood risk perception, although this effect fades when many of the geographic predictors are added. Finally, the models indicate that several variables related to local, neighborhood-based social networks are significant as well. These findings reveal that both physical surroundings and social context are important for understanding risk awareness. The article concludes by discussing the relevance for social science research on disasters and hazards, as well as for planners and emergency managers.

The August 2016 flood disaster was caused by multiple typhoons that occurred in the span of two weeks and dealt catastrophic damage to agricultural land. This disaster was the focus of our flood model simulations. For the hydrological model input, the rainfall data with 0.04 degrees grid space and an hourly interval were provided by a regional climate model (RCM) during the period of multiple typhoon occurrences. The high-resolution data can take account of the geographic effects, hardly reproduced by ordinary RCMs. The rainfall data drove a conceptual, distributed rainfall-runoff model, embedded in the integrated flood analysis system. The rainfall-runoff model provided discharges along rivers over the TR watershed. The RCM also provided future rainfall data with pseudo-global warming climate, assuming that the August 2016 disaster could reoccur again in the late 21st century. The future rainfall data were used to conduct a future flood simulation. With bias corrections, current and future flood simulations showed the potential inundated areas along riverbanks based on flood risk levels. The crop field-based agricultural losses in both simulations were estimated. The future cost may be two to three times higher as indicated by slightly higher simulated future discharge peaks in tributaries.

Modeling future storm surge inundation enhanced by sea-level rise uses numerous data sources with inherent uncertainties. There is uncertainty in (1) hydrodynamic storm surge models, (2) future sea-level rise projections, and (3) topographic digital elevation models representing the height of the coastal land surface. This study implemented a Monte Carlo approach to incorporate the uncertainties of these data sources and model the future 1% flood zone extent in the Tottenville neighborhood of New York City (NYC) in a probabilistic, geographical information science (GIS) framework. Generated spatiotemporal statistical products indicate a range of possible future flood zone extents that results from the uncertainties of the data sources and from the terrain itself. Small changes in the modeled land and water heights within the estimated uncertainties of the data sources results in larger uncertainty in the future flood zone extent in low-lying areas with smaller terrain slope. An interactive web map, UncertainSeas.com, visualizes these statistical products and can inform coastal management policies to reduce the vulnerability of Tottenville, NYC to future coastal inundation.

The sequence was radiocarbon dated and covers an age of approximately 4060 years. The results of geochemical data, statistical studies, along with the investigation, analysis and explanation of historical sources indicate the presence of warm and dry climate conditions between ca 2100 BC and 800 CE. These were contemporaneous with the occurrence of periods of drought and famine during the Achaemenid and Sassanid empires, and might have been was one of the causes of their 'collapse. The existence of humid climate conditions between 800 and 1450 AD was contemporaneous with the period of Medieval Climate Anomaly and the historically documented prosperity of farms and agriculture during the Seljuk dynasties, the Samanids, and the rise of rainfall and river floods during the period of the Abbasid caliphate. The presence of cold and humid climate conditions between ca 1600 and 1750 AD was consistent with the so-called Little Ice Age and the Maunder Minimum. After this period, the climate of this area changed to warm and dry which was contemporaneous with the occurrence of famine and subsequent droughts of the late Safavid and Qajar dynasties in Iran.

Societies are currently under increasing threat from such floods, predominantly from increasing exposure of people and assets in flood-prone areas, but also as a result of changes in flood magnitude, frequency, and timing. Accurate flood hazard and risk assessment are therefore crucial for the sustainable development of societies worldwide. With a paucity of hydrological measurements, evidence from the field offers the only insight into truly extreme events and their variability in space and time. Historical, botanical, and geological archives have increasingly been recognized as valuable sources of extreme flood event information. These different archives are here reviewed with a particular focus on the recording mechanisms of flood information, the historical development of the methodological approaches and the type of information that those archives can provide. These studies provide a wealthy dataset of hundreds of historical and palaeoflood series, whose analysis reveals a noticeable dominance of records in Europe. After describing the diversity of flood information provided by this dataset, we identify how these records have improved and could further improve flood hazard assessments and, thereby, flood management and mitigation plans.

Because of the more limited attention received in the literature when compared to the trend detection on block maxima variables, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of different approaches: Spearman's rho, Mann-Kendall, ordinary least squares (OLS), Sen's slope estimator (SEN), and the nonstationary generalized Pareto distribution fit to identify the presence of trends in PDS records characterized by different sample sizes (n), shape parameter (xi) and degrees of nonstationarity. The results point to a power gain for all tests by increasing n and the degree of nonstationarity and by reducing xi. The use of a nonparametric test is recommended in samples with a high positive skew. Furthermore, the use of sampling rates greater than one to increase the PDS sample size is encouraged, especially when dealing with small records. The use of SEN to estimate the magnitude of a trend is preferable over OLS due to its slightly smaller probability of occurrence of type S error when xi is positive.

Recent scholarly work has focussed on climate communication and the role of arts and humanities-led storytelling in engaging people in climate narratives. Far less has been said about mobilising arts and creativity to build anticipatory climate action. Nor have archival material and pre-twentieth century histories of living with water and flood been widely utilised in this endeavour. This paper reflects on our experiences delivering the UKRI-funded Risky Cities programme and specifically, of developing and utilising a learning histories approach that folds together past, present and future in productive ways so as to learn from the past and the present and rethink the future. Risky Cities uses this approach to develop engagement tools at different scales, evaluating their impact throughout using participant interviews, reflective focus groups, and surveys. Analysing this data, we consistently find that using learning histories as the foundation of arts-led and creative community engagement makes big narratives about global climate change locally meaningful. Crucially, this drives cognitive shifts, behavioural change and anticipatory action for both participants and audiences. Thus, our learning histories approach is an important participatory tool for building climate action, empowerment and resilience.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For that purpose, the MEDALUS model was applied at 2 levels of detail. Level I (municipality level) implied the use of available large-scale databases and level II (watershed) contains more detailed information about vegetation used in the calculation of the VQI and MQI factors (Fig. S6). The comparison was made using data based on CORINE Land Cover (2012) and forest inventory data, complemented with object-based classification. Results showed that data based on forest inventory data with the application of Ellenberg's indices and object-based classification have one class more, critical (C1 and C2) and that the percentage distribution of classes is different in both quantitative (area size of class sensitivity) and qualitative (aggregation and dispersion of sensitivity classes). The use of data from Forest Management Plans and the application of Ellenberg's indices affect the quality of the results and find its application in the model, especially if these results are used for monitoring and land area management on fine scales. Remote sensed data images (Sentinel-2B) were introduced into the methodology as a very important environmental monitoring tool and model results validation.

A flash flood detected area using classification-based image processing for sentinel-2 satellites data: A case study of Zafaraana Road at Red Sea	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES			English	Article						Flood detection; Image processing; NDWI; IDF; Crisis management		Natural crises manifested in floods and droughts are counted as the most severe impacts of climate change on the world. In this regard, flash floods are the most common cause of economic and human losses worldwide. However, the present study focuses on the flash flood-affected area between Zafaarana and Ras Ghareb coastal roads. Sentinel-2 satellite images of recent years before and after the flash flood have been utilized to detect flooded areas and investigate their environmental conditions.Initially, the captured images were pre-processed to compare the environmental conditions before and after flooding. Consequently, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was utilized to classify water bodies in different bands. Finally, an image difference feature (IDF) model with computation of per-pixel features, merging image disparities, and calculation of the characteristic value phases was constructed to extract various image differences after photo processing, that's to identify flooded pixels in the images and assess their performance in the proposed model. The proposed IDF model was compared by rating each model on the same test set, while changing the training set. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm shows an accuracy of 98.9%, which is a better flood image processing technique than other methods. The insights from this research will help decision makers in structuring their rescue strategies and evacuation maps during and before the environmental crisis.

Nutrition policy critical to optimize response to climate, public health crises	FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION			English	Article						plant-based diet; health care capacity; chronic disease; nutrition policy; climate change; disasters and emergencies; public health; dietary change	FOOD INSECURITY; DIETETICS; POSITION; ACADEMY	The effects of unanticipated crises on health care and first-responder systems are reflected in climate-fueled environmental emergencies, to which human resilience is diminished by our chronic disease epidemic. For example, people who depend on specialized medications, like refrigerated insulin for diabetes, will likely face additional challenges in receiving treatment and care during extreme heat, floods, disasters, and other adverse events. These circumstances may be compounded by staff and equipment shortages, lack of access to fresh food, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure in the wake of a disaster. Simply put, our health care and first-response systems struggle to meet the demands of chronic disease without such crises and may be fundamentally unable to adequately function with such crises present. However, nutrition's primacy in preventing and controlling chronic disease directly enhances individual and public resilience in the face of existential threats. Highlighting the shared diet-related etiology clearly demonstrates the need for a national policy response to reduce the disease burden and potentiate mitigation of the sequelae of climate risks and capacity limits in our food and health care systems. Accordingly, this article proposes four criteria for nutrition policy in the Anthropocene: objective government nutrition recommendations, healthy dietary patterns, adequate nutrition security, and effective nutrition education. Application of such criteria shows strong potential to improve our resiliency despite the climate and public health crises.

Among the flood mitigation measures, flood early warning systems (FEWS) have been popular due to their low cost and easy installation, and have been found to be highly effective. A FEWS provides warning and alarm signals according to the water level of a river. Water-level measurements are often made at bridges because of easy access to the middle of a river and concrete ground. However, a measurement site is often not related to the earliest flooded site. A thorough investigation and ground surveying are therefore required to select the site. Therefore, the current study tried to resolve this problem with a newly developed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) photogrammetry technique and proposed a novel UAV-based approach to establish the water-level standards for the FEWS. The digital surface model (DSM) obtained from UAV photogrammetry provides useful three-dimensional (3D) information and allows one to determine the earliest embankment site. The approach was applied to the Migok-cheon Stream, South Korea. Results showed that the proposed approach can be a useful alternative for establishing a water-level standard for the FEWS. The proposed alternative can be further developed with advancing UAV and 3D photogrammetry technologies.

J	Regueira, AD; Wanderley, HS				Regueira, Amanda de O.; Wanderley, Henderson Silva			Changes in rainfall rates and increased number of extreme rainfall events in Rio de Janeiro city	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Daily rainfall rate; Trend; Extreme rainfall indices; Hillside landslide	TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; DAILY PRECIPITATION; SAO-PAULO; VARIABILITY; TRENDS; VULNERABILITY; INDEXES; STATE	Increased temperature rates have the potential to change the rainfall regime in a given region, as well as to intensify its extreme events, which may lead to significant and negative socioeconomic and environmental impacts on urban populations. However, knowledge about the extent of changes in rainfall rates in Rio de Janeiro City (RJC) remains incipient; thus, it is necessary applying indices climate change to help better understanding this phenomenon. The aim of the current study is to investigate changes in rainfall distribution and increase in the number of extreme rainfall events in RJC. Daily rainfall data deriving from fifteen weather stations distributed in RJC were analyzed in the RclimDex software and Mann-Kendall test. The analysis has shown increased rainfall rates from the beginning of the series to approximately the first ten years of study. Total rainfall rate has decreased after this period. Rainfall intensity in almost all seasons has decreased after 2005; this outcome has indicated reduced annual rainfall rate and number of wet days. However, there was prevalence of positive trends in daily rainfall rates (Rx1day) and in total rainfall of five consecutive days (Rx5day). The increased number of extreme rainfall events in RJC can cause sudden inundations, floods, runoffs and river overflows with potential to cause landslides and human death due to irregular occupation of hills and slopes.

The in situ observations were conducted at the Vranovice site (48 degrees 48 ' N, 16 degrees 46 ' E, 170 m above mean sea level) representing the Placek' forest National Reserve. The observed plants and bird species showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) shifts in phenological terms to an earlier date of the year, but the rate of the shift among the observed species differed. The most progressive shifts were detected for the herbs (14 days), followed by the shrubs (13 days), trees (9 days), and finally by the bird species (8 days). All the phenophases were significantly correlated with the daily maximum temperature (r = 0.72-0.91). The results also showed a decline in the correlation for species among the phenophases of the herbs and trees. The phenophases that were highly correlated in the past were less correlated and had higher variability in the last decades. We conclude that the phenological response of the ecosystem to warming in the spring resulted in higher variability and a lower correlation among the observed phenophases mainly caused by the most expressive phenological shifts of the early herbs.

We explore future WEF security risks under the combined impacts of climate change and ambitious development pathways for water use expansion. We drive a bespoke water resources model developed with stakeholder inputs, with 29 bias-corrected climate model projections, alongside stakeholder elicited development pathways, and examine impacts on stakeholder-elicited WEF sector performance metrics. Using scenario analysis, we stress-test the system, explore uncertainties, assess trade-offs between satisfying WEF metrics, and explore whether planned regulation of outflows could help satisfy metrics. While uncertainty from potential future rainfall change generates a wide range of outcomes (including no lake outflow and higher frequency of major downstream floods), we find that potential irrigation expansion in the Lake Malawi catchments could enhance the risk of very low lake levels and risk to Shire River hydropower and irrigation infrastructure performance. Improved regulation of lake outflows through the upgraded barrage does offer some risk mitigation, but trade-offs emerge between lake level management and downstream WEF sector requirements. These results highlight the need to balance Malawi's socio-economic development ambitions across sectors and within a lake-river system, alongside enhanced climate resilience.

Rapid glacial melt has resulted in the formation of glacial lakes and associated hazards. This research aimed to (1) identify flood-prone houses, (2) determine pedestrian emergency evacuation routes, and (3) analyze their relationships to socioeconomic status in the Seti River Basin. Detailed hazard maps were created using field survey results from unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry and the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System. Questionnaire, focus-group, and key-informant surveys helped identify the socioeconomic situation. Inundation maps revealed that most residents are exposed to future flooding hazards without proper evacuation routes. Highly impoverished and immigrant households were at the highest risk in terms of income inequality and migration rate (p < 0.001) and were located on the riverside. The locations of 455 laborers' houses were significantly correlated with inundation hazards (p < 0.001). Governmental and associated agencies must develop adequate plans to relocate low-income households. Group discussions revealed the need for stronger adaptive capacity-building strategies for future risk management. Pokhara requires better systematic and scientific land-use planning strategies to address this issue efficiently. A similar approach that combines flood modeling, proper evacuation route access, and socioeconomic survey is suggested for this river basin.

As part of flood hazard mitigation, this study aimed to simulate the urban flood scenarios in Malaysia's urbanized catchments. The flood simulation was performed using the Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) modeling of the Damansara catchment as a case study. An integrated hydrologic-hydraulic model was developed for the 1-D river flow modeling and 1-D-2-D drainage overflow modeling. The reliability of the 1-D river flow model was confirmed through the calibration and validation, in which the water level in TTDI Jaya was satisfactorily predicted, supported by the coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), and relative error (RE). The performance of the 1-D-2-D model was further demonstrated based on the flood depth, extent, and risk caused by the drainage overflow. Two scenarios were tested, and the comparison results showed that the current drainage effectively reduced the drainage overflow due to the increased size of drains compared to the historic drainage in 2015. The procedure and findings of this study could serve as references for the application in flood mitigation planning worldwide, especially for developing countries.

There is a lack of knowledge, however, about how stakeholders make decisions at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) time scales (i.e., 2 weeks to 3 months). To understand how decisions are made and S2S predictions are or can be used, the project team for "Prediction of Rainfall Extremes at Subseasonal to Seasonal Periods" (PRES(2)iP) conducted a 2-day workshop in Norman, Oklahoma, during July 2018. The workshop engaged 21 professionals from environmental management and public safety communities across the contiguous United States in activities to understand their needs for S2S predictions of potential extended heavy precipitation events. Discussions and role-playing activities aimed to identify how workshop participants manage uncertainty and define extreme precipitation, the time scales over which they make key decisions, and the types of products they use currently. This collaboration with stakeholders has been an integral part of PRES(2)iP research and has aimed to foster actionable science. The PRES(2)iP team is using the information produced from this workshop to inform the development of predictive models for extended heavy precipitation events and to collaboratively design new forecast products with our stakeholders, empowering them to make more-informed decisions about potential extreme precipitation events.

Using the Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran model, we evaluated the synergistic effects of droughts and rainfall events on hydrology and water quality in an upstream catchment of the Miyun Reservoir based on the outputs of five GCMs. It showed substantial increases in air temperature, precipitation intensity, frequency of heavy rains and rainstorms, and drought duration, as well as sediment and nutrient loads in the RCP 8.5 scenario. Sustained droughts followed by intense precipitation could cause complex interactions and mobilize accumulated sediment, nutrients and other pollutants into surface water that pose substantial risks to the drinking water security, with the comprehensive effects of soil water content, antecedent drought duration, precipitation amount and intensity, and other climate characteristics, although the effects varied greatly under different rainfall patterns. The Methods and findings of this study evidence the synergistic impacts of droughts and heavy rainfall on watershed system and the significant effects of initial soil moisture conditions on water quantity and quality, and help to guide a robust adaptive management system for future drinking water supply.

Future climate change will lead to intense, prolonged, and frequent floods in Bangladesh. An integrated flood risk assessment that transforms risks from transboundary river basins to the local administrative level is necessary. A 1D-2D hydrodynamic model is developed for flood vulnerable Arial Khan River feed by basin-scale hydrologic model for low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) climate scenarios. An increasing trend in flood depth, duration, and the area is observed from the early (2020s) to the end (2080s) of the century for both scenarios. The difference between both RCPs is minimal from the 2020s to 2050s but becomes very pronounced in the 2080s. The depth-duration area with equal weightage provides better hazard results for the area. Flood risk is assessed using the IPCC AR5 framework incorporating vulnerability and exposure. Some medium-hazard zones fall into high-risk zones due to high exposure and vulnerability to flooding. The areas along the left reach are found more hazard-prone, while the areas on the right side are more risk-prone in the 2080s of RCP8.5. The hazard/risk maps will help policymakers identify priority areas for planning a sustainable flood management strategy.	[Roy, Binata; Islam, A. K. M.

Limnological perspectives on conservation of floodplain lakes in the Amazon basin	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						climate change; ecosystem approach; floodplain; impoundment; lake; mining; water quality	AUTOTROPHIC CARBON-SOURCES; RAIN-FOREST CATCHMENT; MAJOR IONIC SOLUTES; NEGRO RIVER-BASIN; WATER-BALANCE; FISH-PASSAGE; DYNAMICS; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; EMISSIONS	Limnological aspects of Amazon floodplain lakes are examined in the context of aquatic conservation. A prerequisite to detecting and evaluating changes that could threaten the ecological health and organisms in floodplain lakes is understanding variation under present conditions. Based on one of the few studies with regular measurements over 2 years, chlorophyll, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, transparency, and total suspended solids in Lake Janauaca indicate that the lake is naturally quite variable with a mesotrophic to eutrophic status. Direct threats to ecological health of floodplain lakes include mining operations that can increase turbidity and trace metals and reduce nutritional quality of sediments. Mercury contamination and methylation leads to bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. Deforestation in uplands increases nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to floodplain lakes and can alter trophic status. Deforestation in floodable forests alters the habitat and food of the fish that inhabit these forests. Cumulative limnological responses as catchments are altered by urban, agricultural, and industrial developments, and as inundation is altered by changes in climate and construction of dams, have major implications for the ecology of floodplain lakes. To improve understanding and management of threats to the conservation of aquatic Amazon biota and ecosystems requires considerably expanded and coordinated research and community-based management that includes the spectrum of floodplain lakes throughout the basin.

Therefore, this study focuses on the integration of geospatial techniques and remote sensing data to identify watershed terrain characteristics and evaluate the influence of these characteristics on flood susceptibility in South Australia. Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and geologic and topographic maps and a geographic information system (GIS) were used to delineate drainage basins, measure morphometric parameters and link different parameters to evaluate the degree of flood vulnerability. Depending on their relations to the flood hazards, the morphometric parameters were categorized into two groups; then, a rank score was assigned to each group. Finally, the flood susceptibility of the basins was visualized, and the basins were classified into low, intermediate and high flood hazard areas. The results show that approximately 45.7, 44.7 and 9.7% of the study area is at risk of high, medium and low degrees of flooding, respectively. The results were validated through secondary data relating to historic floods. The causes of flooding were analysed using rainfall and road density data, while the consequences of flooding were verified by the population distribution across the study area. The findings of this study can be used to support decision-makers in planning and investing in mitigation measures, especially in highly susceptible areas of South Australian basins.

J	Singh, H; Pirani, FJ; Najafi, MR				Singh, Harsimrenjit; Pirani, Farshad Jalili; Najafi, Mohammad Reza			Characterizing the temperature and precipitation covariability over Canada	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; MODEL SELECTION; COPULA; INFERENCE; DROUGHT; TRENDS; TESTS	Changes in the regional characteristics of temperature and precipitation can intensify the occurrence and severity of extreme events such as rain-on-snow-induced flooding, droughts and wildfires. Analyzing these climate variables in isolation without considering their interdependencies might result in severe underestimation of their combined effects. In addition, the assumption of linearity between temperature and precipitation does not represent the real physical processes that govern these climate variables. In this study, copula functions are used to describe the joint behaviour of temperature and precipitation across 15 ecozones of Canada at multiple temporal scales. The Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation is investigated using daily records to quantify changes in extreme precipitation with temperature increases. In addition, using historical records, dating back to 1910s, temporal changes in the dependence structure across southern Canada are analyzed using a non-stationary framework. Results show clear signs of accelerated warming and wetting over northern Canada while strong evidence of hot and dry conditions is found in the Prairie provinces. Analyses over seasonal and monthly scales indicate increases in warm-wet and hot-dry conditions in winter and summer, respectively. Non-stationary analyses reveal shifts towards warm and wet climate conditions for the majority of southern Canada. Considerable deviations from the theoretical CC scaling rate of 6.8% is observed for extreme precipitation over parts of Canada with super-CC scaling rates observed in northern Canada and sub-CC scaling rates in the majority of southern Canada.

We evaluated the performance of five state-of-the-art global hydrological and land surface models in the context of modelling extreme conditions (drought and flood). Uncertainty was apportioned between the model used (model skill) and also the satellite-based precipitation products used to drive the simulations (forcing data variability) for extreme values of precipitation, surface runoff and evaporation. We found in general that model simulations acted to augment uncertainty rather than reduce it. In percentage terms, the increase in uncertainty was most often less than the magnitude of the input data uncertainty, but of comparable magnitude in many environments. Uncertainty in predictions of evapo-transpiration lows (drought) in dry environments was especially high, indicating that these circumstances are a weak point in current modelling system approaches. We also found that high data and model uncertainty points for both ET lows and runoff lows were disproportionately concentrated in the equatorial and southern tropics. Our results are important for highlighting the relative robustness of satellite products in the context of land surface simulations of extreme events and identifying areas where improvements may be made in the consistency of simulation models.

In this study, we measured CH4 emissions from two vegetation meadows in the littoral zone of Poyang Lake, China, from October 2014 to May 2015. CH4 emissions in the meadow dominated by Carex cinerascens were 11.27 +/- 11.29 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which were significantly higher than emissions in the meadow dominated by Artemisia selengensis (2.99 +/- 1.67 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Between-species differences in CH4 emission were caused by differences in belowground biomass. The results also showed distinct seasonal variation in CH4 emissions in this area; fluxes reached a maximum at the peak of the growing season and reached a minimum after the summer flood, when plants began to germinate. There were two peak values in the Carex meadow, and belowground biomass controlled the seasonality of CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that plant biomass may be a key factor controlling CH4 emissions in the littoral zone of Poyang Lake, highlighting that CH4 fluxes vary with vegetation type in littoral wetlands and demonstrating that spatial variation in CH4 emissions must be considered when estimating regional CH4 emissions in Poyang Lake. Considering climate change and the operations of a proposed hydraulic engineering project, changes to the hydrologic regime in this region may significantly affect CH4 emissions.

The webGIS was developed within the framework of the SAVEMEDCOASTS and SAVEMEDCOASTS-2 projects, funded by the European Union, which respond to the need to protect people and assets from natural disasters along the Mediterranean coasts that are vulnerable to the combined effects of Sea Level Rise (SLR) and Vertical Land Movements (VLM). The geospatial data include available or new high-resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTM), bathymetric data, rates of VLM, and multi-temporal coastal flooding scenarios for 2030, 2050, and 2100 with respect to 2021, as a consequence of RSLR. The scenarios are derived from the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and encompass different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) for climate projections. The webGIS reports RSLR scenarios that incorporate the temporary contribution of both the highest astronomical tides (HAT) and storm surges (SS), which intensify risks to the coastal infrastructure, local community, and environment.

Australia's National Vegetation Information System (NVIS) under the Depart-ment of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) is the only nationally consistent vegetation database and hierarchical typology of vegetation types in different locations. Currently, this database employs manual approaches for integrating disparate state and territory datasets which is labour intensive and can be prone to human errors. To cope with the ever-increasing need for up to date vegetation data derived from heterogeneous data sources, a Semi-Automated Hybrid Matcher (SAHM) is proposed in this paper. SAHM utilises both schema level and instance level matching following a two-tier matching framework. A key novel technique in SAHM called Multivariate Statistical Matching is proposed for automated schema scoring which takes advantage of domain knowledge and correlations between attributes to enhance the matching. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the performance of the individual as well as combined components of SAHM have been evaluated. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework which outperforms existing state of the art methods like Cupid, Coma, Similarity Flooding, Jaccard Leven Matcher, Distribution Based Matcher, and EmbDI. In particular, SAHM achieves between 88% and 100% accuracy with significantly better F1 scores in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. SAHM is also shown to be several orders of magnitude more efficient than existing techniques.

In this paper, three well-dated wetland sedimentary cores with high-resolution grain-size re-cords were employed to reconstruct the historical flooding regime along the Ussuri River during the past 7000 years. The results show that five flooding-prone intervals marked by increased mean rates of sand-fraction accu-mulation occurred at 6.4-5.9 ka BP, 5.5-5.1 ka BP, 4.6-3.1 ka BP, 2.3-1.8 ka BP, and 0.5-0 ka BP, respectively. These intervals are generally consistent with the higher mean annual precipitation controlled by the strengthened East Asian summer monsoon which has been widely documented in geological records across the monsoonal regions of East Asia. Considering the prevalent monsoonal climate along the modern Ussuri River, we suggest that the regional flooding evolution during the Holocene Epoch should be generally controlled by the East Asian summer monsoon circulation which was initially linked to the ENSO activities in the tropical Pacific Ocean. While for the last interval spanning 0.5-0 ka BP, human influence, compared with the long-serving climatic controls, has played a more critical role in driving the regional flooding regime.

Despite the evidence that antecedent soil moisture conditions play a significant role in regulating the runoff response during extreme storm events, fewer works have tried to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of such coupled interactions. In the present work, we aim to improve our understanding of the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture (SM) - precipitation (P) dependence over Europe. Using an event-based, non-parametric Event Coincidence Analysis (ECA) approach, we first quantified the probability of SM preceding P by the precursor coincidence rate. We also examined the statistical precursor relationship between SM-P joint episodes and reported annual flood events using the conditional precursor coincidence rate. The results show that seasonality is a major driving force in the spatiotemporal dynamics of SM-P coupling over Europe. The conditional precursor coincidence rates are in line with previous flood hazard studies over Europe and show the importance of considering such diverse interdependencies in flood risk mitigation. Our work has implications for understanding the occurrence of preconditioned compound events worldwide and provides a vital starting point for characterising the major processes that need to be accounted for in comprehensive state of the art flood risk assessment studies.

J	Wu, SN; Lei, Y				Wu, Shengnan; Lei, Yu			Multiscale Flood Disaster Risk Assessment in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin: A Focus on Watershed and Community Levels	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						disaster risk reduction; flood disaster risk assessment; multiscale assessment; Lancang-Mekong River	VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; CAPACITY; DELTA	Floods are one of the most frequent and costly natural hazards worldwide, causing significant damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods. The Lancang-Mekong River is a major river in Southeast Asia, but the basin is prone to flood disasters that may be exacerbated by climate change. Therefore, to better understand disaster risk and tailor disaster risk reduction measures, this study conducted multiscale flood disaster risk assessments at the watershed and community levels using indicator-based and hydrodynamic model-based methods. Both methods adopted open data with the supplement of local survey data. The results of the study showed that the flood risk is generally higher in the lower reach of the river due to high levels of both hazard and vulnerability. However, the community-scale risk assessment revealed that high flood-risk communities exist in low-risk zones, and vice versa, when the flood risk was assessed at the watershed scale. Such phenomena can lead to inadequate community preparedness for flooding or unnecessary allocation of resources for flood mitigation measures. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of disaster risk reduction strategies, policies, and plans based on an understanding of the risks. Furthermore, they offer a basis for prioritizing and targeting resources, particularly in areas with high population density or vulnerable communities.

A Citizen Science Approach to the Characterisation and Modelling of Urban Pluvial Flooding	WATER ALTERNATIVES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON WATER POLITICS AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Urban pluvial flooding; citizen science; flood modelling; participatory mapping; catchment characterisation; Tennessee; USA	DATA QUALITY; RESILIENCE; INUNDATION; EVENTS; MEMORY; TOOL	Urban pluvial flooding (UPF), a growing challenge across cities worldwide that is expected to worsen due to climate change and urbanisation, requires comprehensive response strategies. However, the characterisation and simulation of UPF is more complex than traditional catchment hydrological modelling because UPF is driven by a complex set of interconnected factors and modelling constraints. Different integrated approaches have attempted to address UPF by coupling humans and environmental systems and reflecting on the possible outcomes from the interactions among varied disciplines. Nonetheless, it is argued that current integrated approaches are insufficient. To further improve the characterisation and modelling of UPF, this study advances a citizen science approach that integrates local knowledge with the understanding and interpretation of UPF. The proposed framework provides an avenue to couple quantitative and qualitative community-based observations with traditional sources of hydro-information. This approach allows researchers and practitioners to fill spatial and temporal data gaps in urban catchments and hydrologic/hydrodynamic models, thus yielding a more accurate characterisation of local catchment response and improving rainfall-runoff modelling of UPF. The results of applying this framework indicate how community-based practices provide a bi-directional learning context between experts and residents, which can contribute to resilience building by providing UPF knowledge necessary for risk reduction and response to extreme flooding events.

Climate warming will enhance the frequency, magnitude, and widespread nature of these events. Past studies indicate rainfall, not snowmelt, typically drives much of the runoff response during ROS. However, there is substantial event-to-event variability-resulting from shifting atmospheric drivers and nuanced physical mechanisms governing water flow through a snowpack. Historically, turbulent fluxes were assumed to dominate the energy balance for snowmelt during ROS. Recent research nonetheless suggests that other components of the energy balance might be larger drivers depending on: 1) the time of year; 2) the elevation; and 3) the aspect of the slope. This mini review summarizes the literature on the physical processes governing ROS and proposes that moving forward we utilize the terms "active" and "passive" to describe a snowpack's contribution (via snowmelt) to terrestrial water input (TWI) during ROS. Active snowpacks readily contribute meltwater to TWI via the energy balance, bolstering rainfall-runoff totals. Passive snowpacks do not melt, but simply convey rainwater through the snow matrix. In both snowpack cases, preferential flow paths enhance transmissivity. This proposed classification scheme will help researchers and water managers better communicate and interpret past findings, and aid in forecasting discussions of future events.				wbrandt@ucsd.edu		Haleakala, Kayden/0000-0003-0551-4396					102	6	7	8	21	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		2296-6463		FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ	Front.

China is one of the countries deeply affected by these casualties. If the statistical characteristics and laws of extreme precipitation could be clearly grasped, then the negative impacts triggered by it may be minimized. China is a vast country and diverse in climate and terrain, hence different regions may be suitable for different analyses and research methods. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the research progress, methods and current status of extreme precipitation across the country. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of techniques and methods used in extreme precipitation research and engineering practice and their applications. The literature is reviewed focusing on seven aspects: (1) annual maxima method (AM), (2) peaks over threshold method (POT), (3) probable maximum precipitation (PMP), (4) non-stationary analysis of precipitation extremes, (5) intensity-duration-frequency curves (IDF), (6) uncertainty in extreme precipitation frequency analysis, and (7) spatial variability of extreme precipitation. Research on extreme precipitation in China is generally based or centered on the above seven aspects. The current study aims to provide ideas for further research on extreme precipitation frequency analysis and its response to climate change and human activities.

However, it has a drawback with its application in marine/flood environments due to a lack of water resistance and frail mechanical stability. Floods have been considered one of the most periodic hazards that could hit urban areas, due to climate change. The present paper aims to address this gap and to investigate the mechanical properties (tensile, compressive, and flexural strength) and water absorption capacity of hybrid GFRP composite comprising woven E-glass fabric and epoxy resin, various reinforcing materials (kenaf and coconut fibres), and various filler materials (fly ash, nano-silica, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The composites with 30 wt.% GFRP, 50 wt.% resin, 15 wt.% fly ash, 5 wt.% CaCO3, 10 wt.% GFRP, 60 wt.% resin, and 30 wt.% fly ash showed the lowest water absorption property of 0.45%. The results revealed that the GFRP composite reinforced kenaf fibres with nano-silica, fly ash, and CaCO3 improved the water absorption resistance. At the same time, GFRP reinforced the coconut fibres with fly ash, and kenaf fibres with CaCO3 showed no favourable impact on water absorption. The identification of a hybrid GFRP composite with various reinforcing materials and fillers would assist future developments with a more compatible, enhanced, and reliable water-resistant composite, specifically for structural applications in flood-prone areas.

Detecting their changes under global warming helps to understand better the rainfall variability and the flooding formation. Using the Guangdong Province, China, as a study case, five criteria were used to determine the independent precipitation events for hourly precipitation data from 1967 to 2012. The RP and PC of the events were identified, and then, their spatiotemporal variability was investigated further. The results show that (a) the occurrence frequency during 46 years, average rainfall amount and duration of independent rainfall in the coastal areas were higher than in other regions. (b) The dominant RPs in Guangdong are unimodal (more than 70%), especially the pattern with early peak (mode I; 39.5%); however, the number of stations with mode I as dominant RP decreased over time, while those with mode III (the pattern with late peak) increased. (c) Precipitation concentration index can be used for measuring the concentration of independent rainfall events, and its fixed minimum inter-event time has significant impacts on RP and PC. The PC of the events with early peak is higher, and the concentration in the west is generally higher than those in the east under different RPs.

A statistical-dynamical framework is developed to assess the compounding impact of PREs (as preconditioned events) versus riverine floods during both retrospective and projected climate. Based on models' fidelity to capture historical climatology, we select four out of nine Global Climate Models (GCMs) during historical (1980-2005), and the three projected time windows, that is, near future (2010-2039), mid-century (2040-2069), and the far future (2070-2099) planning horizons with RCP8.5 emission scenario. We assess changes in compound flood hazards in historical versus projected periods using a newly proposed Bivariate Hazard Ratio (BHR) index, which represents the ratio between bivariate return periods during the projected versus the historical time windows. Assessing bivariate return periods (characterized by 'AND' operator) of rainfall-driven compound floods shows decreased flood hazard in the mid-century and far-future planning horizons. Accounting ranges of uncertainty from climate model simulations and the propagation of uncertainty across the numerical model chain, overall we show considering PRE as the covariate, floods in larger catchments show an increase in compound flood hazard in the projected period.

Enriching the concept of solution space for climate adaptation by unfolding legal and governance dimensions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Solution space; Climate adaptation; Governance; Climate adaptation law; Interdisciplinarity	FLOOD RISK GOVERNANCE; DECISION-MAKING; LEGITIMACY; WATER; POLICY; STRATEGIES; CHALLENGES; MITIGATION; PRINCIPLES; FRAMEWORK	Conspicuous interdisciplinary effort has been spent on addressing the consequences of climate change in a forward-looking way. The concept of solution space is a recent contribution to help decision-makers identify feasible and effective adaptation solutions and to provide guidance on when they should be implemented and by whom. Although the current conceptualization of solution space already considers multiple disciplines, it remains dominated by biophysical ones and has not yet fully integrated legal and governance dimensions. This article first reflects on the current solution space framework through the lenses of law and governance and then proposes approaches to enrich legal and governance dimensions in the solution space concept. We argue that the legal and governance dimensions of the current concept of solution space can be improved by taking into account four aspects: 1) understanding the institutional and legal systems in a context-specific way; 2) embracing the dynamics and reflexivity of law and governance in the episteme of path dependency; 3) applying more diverse analytical methods (qualitative, qualitative/ quantitative, value-oriented) and/or assessments on a case-by-case basis; and 4) adding a normative perspective that includes the principles of legitimacy, transparency, accountability, equity, and distributive justice to measure the appropriateness of a certain adaptation strategy. The article concludes with suggestions for future research on how to implement the enriched solution space concept.	[Du, Haomiao; Gilissen, Herman Kasper; van Rijswick, Helena F. M.

Nowadays climate changes are severe and factors as water and light are involved with plant development and growth. We hypothesized that shading may contribute to adjusting the characteristics of photosynthetic metabolism of Campomanesia xanthocarpa seedlings under flooding. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the flooding times and shading levels for gas exchanges and the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) in C. xanthocarpa seedlings. Seedlings were grown under two water regimes (control and flooding), three levels of shading (0, 30, and 70%) and 4 evaluation periods (0, 15, 30, and 45 days). We verified damages to the photosynthetic apparatus and reductions in the efficiency of the photochemical process under flooding and at a high level of shading (70%) in a short period (15 days). However, seedlings showed favourable responses to the adjustment over the 45 days of exposure to those conditions. According to the multivariate analysis, it was possible to identify the relation between photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance as the main factor of metabolic adjustments in the tolerance of C. xanthocarpa to flooding and high shading intensity. C. xanthocarpa was more sensitive to short periods of flooding conditions and full sun and high level of shading (70%), however, it presented better adjustment responses to flooding periods when associated with 30% shade.

Robust Yellow River Delta Flood Management under Uncertainty	WATER			English	Article						flood control; deep uncertainty; adaptability	WATER-RESOURCES; DECISION-MAKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FUTURE; RISK; ADAPTATION; RESPONSES; PATHWAYS; POLICIES; SYSTEMS	A number of principles for evaluating water resources decisions under deep long-run uncertainty have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the usefulness of three widely recommended principles in the context of delta water and sedimentation management: scenario-based uncertainty definition, robustness rather than optimality as a performance measure, and modeling of adaptability, which is the flexibility to change system design or operations as conditions change in the future. This evaluation takes place in the context of an important real-world problem: flood control in the Yellow River Delta. The results give insight both on the physical function of the river system and on the effect of various approaches to modeling risk attitudes and adaptation on the long-term performance of the system. We find that the optimal decisions found under different scenarios differ significantly, while those resulting from using minimal expected cost and minmax regret metrics are similar. The results also show that adaptive multi-stage optimization has a lower expected cost than a static approach in which decisions over the entire time horizon are specified; more surprisingly, recognizing the ability to adapt means that larger, rather than smaller, first-stage investments become optimal. When faced with deep uncertainty in water resources planning, this case study demonstrates that considering scenarios, robustness, and adaptability can significantly improve decisions.

These natural hazards can cause huge economic losses and threaten the personal safety of citizens. The public's willingness to engage with disaster relief efforts and the degree of participation is critical to reduce the impact of such disasters. This study conducted a survey with 62,903 respondents from China. The study utilized statistical analysis and correlation analysis in order to understand the differences and similarities of the public's willingness to take part in disaster relief across gender and age. The study found that: (1) the public's awareness of insurance and willingness to make donations during climate disasters is low, and that more than half of the public are only willing to insure for very less money; (2) although the public has very high enthusiasm to participate in disaster relief, they are less willing to learn the basic skills of reducing disasters and for participating in training for disaster reduction as volunteers. This was especially the case for elderly citizens and females; (3) the willingness of the public to prevent and reduce disasters is high, and this was the case across various gender and age groups. Finally, the study puts forward several measures to improve the uptake of disaster relief and disaster prevention among citizens.

Safety measures have been recently adopted in the threatened territories by constructing retaining dams and embankments in key positions. More disastrous events could be generated by the difficulty of maintaining these works in efficiency and for the changed risk conditions originating from their presence and the effects of their functioning. LLUNPIY/3r, a version of the cellular-automaton model LLUNPIY for lahar simulations, is presented. The growing frequency of lahars in the valley of Tungurahua volcano (Ecuador), probably due to the effects of the climatic change, has recently produced smaller and less dangerous events, sometimes favored by the collapse of ponds generated by small landslides. An investigation is performed here in order to reproduce such situations in a controlled way by the use of LLUNPIY/3r simulations. Using precise field data, points are individuated where dams by backfill, which are easy to collapse, can produce the formation of ponds; LLUNPIY/3r simulations permit projecting the triggering of small lahars by minor rainfall events or projecting, in the case of more rainfall, the anticipation of lahar detachment, avoiding simultaneous and dangerous confluence with other lahars.

The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with six treatments, as follows: common and protected urea; topdressing application of N doses (30, 70, and 150 kg ha(-1)): and one control treatment, without N fertilization. Emissions of N2O-N, global warming potential (pGWP), emission factors (EF) for mineral fertilizers, grain yield, emission intensity, nitrate, ammonium, pH, and potential redox were quantified. Gas sampling was carried out in two crop seasons of rice cultivation and in one off-season. During the flooded period of the two crop seasons, N2O fluxes did not exceed 862.41 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O-N; in the off-season, the fluxes varied from -52.95 to 274.34 mu g m(-2) h(-1) N2O-N. Consistent emission peaks were observed in soil draining before harvest, when the highest rate of both N sources was used, and also in the control treatment in the off-season. Protected urea does not reduce N2O emissions or EF. Nitrogen increases the grain yield. Protected urea does not have any effect on the pGWP. The concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in the soil are not related to N2O fluxes.

Characterizing Flood Impact on Swiss Floodplains Using Interannual Time Series of Satellite Imagery	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Alps; floods; landsat; normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dynamics; unmixing	SPECTRAL MIXTURE ANALYSIS; LEAF-AREA INDEX; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; ENDMEMBER VARIABILITY; ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES; AMAZON FLOODPLAIN; WETLAND CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; RIVER	Pressure on the biodiversity of ecosystems along many rivers is growing continuously due to the increasing number of hydropower facilities regulating downstream flow and sediment regimes. Despite a thorough understanding of the short-term processes and interactions at this hydro-biosphere interface, long-term analyses of the impacts on floodplain dynamics are lacking. We used interannual Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 time series to analyze the effects of hydrological events on floodplain vegetation in four mountainous floodplains in the Swiss Alps. Using a spectral mixture analysis approach, we demonstrate that the floodplain vegetation dynamics of mountainous rivers can be recovered at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Our results suggest that interactions between floods and floodplain vegetation are complex and not exclusively related to flood magnitude. Of the four reaches analyzed, only data gathered along the submountainous reach with a quasi-natural flow regime show a clear link between remotely sensed vegetation indices and floods. In addition, our 29-year time series shows a continuous upward trend in vegetation indices along the floodplains, strongest in the reaches affected by hydropower facilities. The approach presented in this study can be easily replicated in other mountain ranges by providing available flow data to verify the impact of hydropower on floodplain vegetation dynamics.

Rainfall is a key component of the water cycle and its variability can profoundly influence agriculture, ecosystems and water resource management. In this paper, an innovative trend analysis (ITA) method with a significant test is used for rainfall trend detection at 14 stations in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during 1961-2016. The trends are separately evaluated for low (< 10th percentile), medium (10th-90th percentile) and high (> 90th percentile) rainfall at the annual and seasonal scales. The slope and significance of the rainfall trends derived from the ITA method are compared with those from the classical trend analysis methods Theil-Sen approach and Mann-Kendall test, respectively. The ITA shows significant increasing trends at the 99% confidence level in annual rainfall at all stations. While the same significant increasing trends are identified for summer and winter, decreasing trends dominate in spring and autumn. Contrasting trends are found for extreme rainfall with strong increasing trends in high rainfall in summer and winter and decreasing trends in low rainfall in spring and autumn. The results of the ITA confirmed by the classical trend analysis methods call for more attention to the risk management of flood in extreme seasons and drought in transitional seasons across the YRD region.

Detection of spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall trends, using non-parametric statistical techniques, in Karnataka state, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Non-parametric test; Rainfall; Climate change; LOWESS curve; Karnataka state	PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; CLASSIFICATION; METHODOLOGY	The unpredictability of the climate has drawn a lot of interest worldwide, especially that of the annual mean temperatures and rainfall. In this study, non-parametric tests such as the LOWESS curve method, Mann-Kendall (MK), SNHT test, Pettitt's test (PT), and Buishand range test (BRT) were used to evaluate long-term (2000-2020) rainfall data series to examine rainfall variability. The Dakshina Kannada district has the highest average rainfall is 3495.6 mm with a magnitude change% of about 26.2, while the Koppala district has the lowest average rainfall roughly about 530.4 mm, with a magnitude change % of about 11.49 mm in a year. The statistics from the fitted prediction line were utilized to determine the maximum coefficient determination (R-2 = 0.8808) in the Uttara Kannada region. Because of the commencement of the present rising era, 2015 is the shift year in rainfall with the highest potential of being a change point in the state's Western Ghats region. It was also revealed that the majority of the districts exhibit positive trends before the change point and vice versa. The current research can be used to plan for and minimize the agricultural and water resource challenges in the state of Karnataka. To link observable patterns to climate variability, the next inquiry must identify the source of these changes. Overall, the study's findings will help organize and improve drought, flood, and water resource management techniques in the state.	[Harishnaika, N.; Shilpa, N.; Ahmed, S.

A new 500-year reconstruction of Truckee River streamflow	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA			English	Article						Dendrochronology; Reconstruction; Streamflow; Paleoclimatology; Tree rings	CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-AMERICA; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; SACRAMENTO; PATTERNS	The Truckee River Basin, located on the Nevada-California border, is an area of extreme hydrologic variability, being subject to both prolonged multi-decadal droughts and devastating floods; however, due to the brief instrumental record, understanding of the full range of this variability is limited. To assist local water managers assess the post-2000 drought in the context of historic droughts, this study revisits the first tree-ring reconstruction of Truckee River runoff: Hardman and Reil (1936). Incorporating their original 1930s tree cores as well as newly sampled material, three new site chronologies were developed and combined with other regional chronologies to produce a 1491-2003 reconstruction of Truckee River streamflow, an over 400-year extension of the instrumental record and 230 years longer than the previous reconstruction, providing new insights into the basin's natural variability. In addition to evidence of extended droughts and extreme high streamflow years, this reconstruction shows a marked hydroclimatic shift centered around the 1850s. Prior to then, the Truckee River experienced decadal to multi-decadal periods of higher than average streamflow; subsequently, these periods have been decreasing in length with only two instances above three consecutive years of high streamflow since 1900. Whether this represents fundamental shift to a new hydroclimatic regime remains unclear. However, as global temperatures continue to rise, fewer long-term high streamflow episodes may have lasting impacts on water availability in the basin, raising the question further of whether the post-2000 drought is a new megadrought or a sign of aridification.

Conversely, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has been advocated as a sustainable approach because it is cost-effective, efficient and provides co -benefits (e.g., ecosystem services). However, there is limited awareness and understanding among both disaster risk reduction professionals and ecologists about the linkages of ecosystem restoration to disaster risk reduction. Here, we assessed people's perceptions towards the avail-ability of ecosystem services in the highly degraded and fragile landscape to floods and soil ero-sion in Central Nepal. We then assessed vulnerabilities at household level in both pre-and post -restoration periods, using indicators such as distance to the river, land cover composition (ratio of forest to non-forest), occupation, availability of ecosystem services, and effectiveness of the restoration projects in the vicinity. Our results show that vulnerability as a function of adaptive capacity and sensitivity decreased even though there were no significant improvements in some of the provisions of ecosystem services we assessed. Since our results showed restoration projects were not integrated following the principles of EbA criteria, careful integration during project de-sign and implementation would strengthen community resilience in future. Our work provides new insight into the restoration response to disasters and provides a basis for future research and policy development.

Problem frames shape an individual's preferences for particular management strategies and their future behaviors. While flooding is a complex, multifaceted prob-lem, with multiple causes and multiple impacts, a decision-maker is most likely to manage only those dimensions of flooding about which they are aware or concerned. To evaluate flood decision-makers' primary concerns related to flood exposure, vulnerability, and management in the LA Metro, we draw on focus groups with flood control districts, city planners, nonprofit organizations, and other flood-related decision-makers. We identify numerous concerns, including concerns about specific types of floods (e.g., fluvial vs pluvial) and impacts to diverse infrastructure and communities. Our analyses demonstrate that flood concerns aggregate into three problem frames: one concerned with large fluvial floods exacerbated by climate change and their housing, economic, and infrastructure impacts; one concerned with pluvial nuisance flooding, pollu-tion, and historic underinvestment in communities; and one concerned with coastal and fluvial flooding's ecosystem impacts. While each individual typically articulated concerns that overlapped with only one problem frame, each prob-lem frame was discussed by numerous organization types, suggesting low barriers to cross-organizational coordination in flood planning and response. This paper also advances our understanding of flood risk perception in a region that does not face frequent large floods.

In this study, the temporal variations of frequency distributions of the annual maximum flood were investigated by continuous hydrological simulation considering nonstationarity for Weihe River Basin (WRB) in northwestern China. To this end, two nonstationary versions of the GR4J model were introduced, where the production storage capacity parameter was regarded as a function of time and watershed conditions (e.g., reservoir storage and soil-water conservation land area), respectively. Then the models were used to generate long-term runoff series to derive flood frequency distributions, with synthetic rainfall series generated by a stochastic rainfall model as input. The results show a better performance of the nonstationary GR4J model in runoff simulation than the stationary version, especially for the annual maximum flow series, with the corresponding NSE metric increasing from 0.721 to 0.808. The application of the nonstationary flood frequency analysis indicates the presence of significant nonstationarity in the flood quantiles and magnitudes, where the flood quantiles for an annual exceedance probability of 0.01 range from 4187 m(3)/s to 8335 m(3)/s for the past decades. This study can serve as a reference for flood risk management in WRB and possibly for other basins undergoing drastic changes caused by intense human activities.

They can arise from misaligned stakeholder objectives and a cognitive effort to avoid decision-making under uncertainty. Participatory action research techniques can be useful for overcoming stalemates but have not been examined in the context of disaster risk manage-ment. To fill this gap, we explored how participatory techniques could overcome one disaster risk financing related stalemate: the case of landslide insurance in a highly landslide-prone location, Sitka, Alaska. Landslide insurance in Sitka is a classic stalemate, as diverse stakeholders see the value of offering a landslide insurance policy, but their respective concerns and information gaps stymie their ability to feel confident in decision-making making landslide insurance generally unavailable. Utilizing a series of inclusive interviews and workshops as our participatory tech-niques, respondents describe how the workshop engendered confidence in the prospect of land-slide insurance, specifically by brokering new relationships and serving as a catalyst for new public-private partnerships while effectively reframing the landslide risk financing conundrum. However, they also note that a new market for landslide insurance requires sufficient state or Federal funding support, improved probabilistic landslide models, and sustained consumer de-mand. This suggests that participatory techniques can play an enabling role in overcoming stalemates, but only if certain conditions are in place. These findings may have relevance to policymakers facing stalemate-related obstacles in disaster risk management.

This area is one of the northernmost enclaves of taiga vegetation in Western Siberia. An analysis of Terra-MODIS satellite images from 2000 to 2020 shows that the value of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImean), which reflects the average amount of photosynthetically active phytomass for the summer period, most strongly depends on air temperature (correlation coefficient R = 0.69). However, despite the steady trend towards an increase in the avarage annual summer temperatures, no statistically significant trend in the vegetation index is found, which is due to the inertness of the shrub-moss-lichen ground cover. An analysis of the relationship between the maximum normalized difference vegetation index NDVImax and the absolute tree ring width (TRW) in Larix sibirica Ledeb. shows a strong correlation (R = 0.72) in the marginal, near-watershed area, where a young forest stand with the highest crown density and abundant undergrowth is located. In the valley areas, conversely, forest-stand digression associated with the deterioration of natural conditions is seen (changes in drainage, soil characteristics, and permafrost-geochemical conditions). With continued warming, the spread of the larch forest from the river floodplain to the watershed can be expected, which confirms the current shift of the forest vegetation boundary to the north.

The topography for the numerical simulation was determined from an old pictorial map in the 18th century and various maps after the 19th century, and the return period of the flood hydrograph was determined to be 10 years judging from the level of civil engineering of those days. The numerical results suggested the followings: The levees at the first stage were made to block the dominant divergent streams to gather the river flows together efficiently; by the completed open-levee system, excess river flow over the main channel capacity was discharged through upstream levee openings to old stream courses which were used as temporary floodways, and after the flood peak, a part of the flooded water returned to the main channel through the downstream levee openings. It is considered that the ideas of civil engineers of those days to control the floods exceeding river channel capacity, embodied in their levee arrangement, will give us hints on how to control the extraordinary floods that we should face in the near future when the scale of storms will increase due to the global climate change.

River blockages often occur in deep-cut river valleys, forming large-scale dammed lakes. In this study, a similar to 26.5 m thick lacustrine sedimentary profile that underlying the modern riverbed of the Yalong River is reported. Here, C-14 dating results show that lacustrine deposition began at similar to 25 ka and continued till similar to 10 ka, mainly during the Last Glacial Maximum. Paleoclimatic indicators, such as particle size, magnetic susceptibility, and spore-pollen combination, were used to reconstruct the evolution process of the paleoenvironment in the study area, revealing that a paleo-flood event occurred at similar to 19 ka.The Tongzilin dammed lake contains an excellent record of the geomorphic evolution of the lower reaches of the Yalong River during the Last Glacial Maximum. Before 25 ka, the Yalong River experienced strong downcutting to form a deep valley, which created the space conditions for the formation of the dammed lake: from 25 to 10 ka, the dammed lake remained relatively stable, with dominating accumulation; and after 10 ka, the dammed lake broke and the river continued to downcut.

However, current models focus on continuously flowing rivers and few explicitly address characteristics such as flow cessation and drying. The applicability of existing conceptual models to nonperennial rivers that cease to flow (intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams, IRES) has not been evaluated. We reviewed 18 models, finding that they collectively describe main drivers of biogeochemical and ecological patterns and processes longitudinally (upstream-downstream), laterally (channel-riparian-floodplain), vertically (surface water-groundwater), and temporally across local and landscape scales. However, perennial rivers are longitudinally continuous while IRES are longitudinally discontinuous. Whereas perennial rivers have bidirectional lateral connections between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, in IRES, this connection is unidirectional for much of the time, from terrestrial-to-aquatic only. Vertical connectivity between surface and subsurface water occurs bidirectionally and is temporally consistent in perennial rivers. However, in IRES, this exchange is temporally variable, and can become unidirectional during drying or rewetting phases. Finally, drying adds another dimension of flow variation to be considered across temporal and spatial scales in IRES, much as flooding is considered as a temporally and spatially dynamic process in perennial rivers. Here, we focus on ways in which existing models could be modified to accommodate drying as a fundamental process that can alter these patterns and processes across spatial and temporal dimensions in streams. This perspective is needed to support river science and management in our era of rapid global change, including increasing duration, frequency, and occurrence of drying.

In the course of social and economic development, unrestricted construction in urbanisation process has derived cities of the ability of natural adjustment and self-curing. In line with modern day city development logic, sustainable development which features in co-existence is a common philosophy among most countries. Great cities of the world, mostly, are gifted with one beautiful river. Hence, it is upon us to maintain the function and guarantee the capacity for flood-prevention and flood relief to the most, influencing safety of river to the least, reaching the goal of building sustainable city with friendly river ecology within which multiple water areas are found. This research has approached the general public of Fujian Province by the means of questionnaire. A total of 500 questionnaires were sent out, and 376 effective ones were collected at a 75% return rate. The result has revealed: (1) The most valued aspect in tier-2 evaluation is water security resilience, next to it, respectively, it is clean recycled water, and friendly waterfront space; (2) In the evaluation of 10 indicators, the most valued 5 indicators are: flood-prevention design principle, sewage treatment, landscape design philosophy, low-impact method, sewage intercepting. In accordance with the result, advices were made in the hope of assisting our country in building cities that are comfortable, secure, sustainable, water affinity, and ecological.

This study therefore examined the influence of urbanization on nonstationarity of annual and seasonal precipitation extremes in China, using daily precipitation data from 1857 stations for 1961-2014, and NCAR/NCEP and ERA Interim reanalysis datasets. Results of trend, change point, and bootstrap analyses revealed that urban signatures on long-term changes (i.e. trends and magnitudes) of precipitation extremes were not prominently visible at the national scale. However, a nonstationary frequency analysis of precipitation extremes by a Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) framework with a cluster of 66 models showed that urbanization caused nonstationarity in precipitation extremes at local and regional scales, such as North China. Further, significant nonstationarity tended to occur more in urbanizing areas than in rural and urbanized areas, suggesting that land use/land cover (LULC) transition (i.e. rural areas turning into urban areas) played an important role in introducing nonstationarity. Furthermore, analysis of large-scale circulation patterns, using k-mean clustering, showed that urban signatures on extremes were not prominent at the national scale but at the regional scale. Further studies are needed to enumerate physical mechanisms causing the impact of local environmental changes on precipitation extremes at different geographical locations over China.

In this study, we choose to investigate the viability of Sponge City concepts for flood mitigation based on low impact development (LID) strategies in a 26.66 km(2) area situated in Guinea's capital city of Conakry. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) was used to simulate the impact of LID measures on the lowering of runoff peaks and node flooding. Simulation results before and after LID facilities are compared in order to understand how LID measures improve flood mitigation. The study showed that LID techniques effectively reduce runoff, which helps mitigate the effects of flooding. The study demonstrated that all LID, whether used singly or in combination, can lower runoff and flooding. However, when it comes to reducing runoff and flooding, LID-combinations perform better than individual LID implementations. For each of the five return periods, the LID-combination reduced runoff by 67.83, 65.02, 50.44, 40.18, and 35.88%, and reduced flooding by 85.32, 72.65, 54.05, 46.17, and 42.80%, respectively. Additionally, the reduction rate of overflow junctions is 100, 100, 80, 67, and 70%, respectively.

Come hybrid or high water: Making the case for a Green-Gray approach toward resilient urban stormwater management	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Editorial Material						green infrastructure; flooding; resilience; sustainable development; urban drainage; land change; climate	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL INTERCEPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE; STREET TREES; INFRASTRUCTURE; URBANIZATION; CAPACITY; VULNERABILITY; UNCERTAINTY	120 years or more of unsustainable urban development has damaged the natural environment and disrupted essential ways to stabilize water body overflow and even mitigate pluvial flooding. In light of catastrophic flooding that has occurred globally, a renewed commitment to transforming built surfaces and incorporating more green infrastructures (GIs) has emerged. In fact, one could argue that an overcommitment to GI is being touted in the literature, but largely disconnected from more real-world possibilities, considering all things. In this commentary, we make the case that as cities transition from development patterns of the past and even considering climate-induced storm characteristics of the future, a hybridized solution (e.g., Green-Gray) should be considered. Smaller approaches to urban greening have been implemented in areas that need larger-scale restorations, thus proving to be insufficient. Likewise, the uncertainty surrounding rainfall and storm events has forced us to be more strategically balanced in our efforts to achieve resilience in our stormwater infrastructure. Hybridized solutions that include a diverse set of systems, anchored in local conditions, position us best for effective urban stormwater management. In the absence of such solutions, runoff volumes will continue to rise, flooding will prevail, and disenfranchised communities will remain disproportionately impacted by these impacts of urbanization.

For flood hazard analysis, high-quality data and a reasonable weight assignment of the relevant factors are critical. This study conducts four rainfall fusion methods, to fuse the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 and the observations in Dazhou City, China. Then, the random forest was applied to obtain the weights of various factors to facilitate a comprehensive flood hazard analysis under four rainfall durations. The results show that (1) the linear regression performs best out of the four fusion methods, with a correlation coefficient of 0.56; (2) the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the most impact factor with a weight of more than 0.2; and (3) the proposed flood analysis system performs well, as 70% of historical flood points are distributed in high and sub-high hazard areas and more than 93% of historical flood points are distributed in medium hazard areas. This study identified the flood hazard grade and distribution in Dazhou City, which could provide a valuable methodology to contribute to flood hazard analysis and disaster management with satellite rainfall. Furthermore, the results of this paper are profound for future work on the high-resolution flood risk assessment and management in Dazhou City.

N2O emissions from paddy fields in South Korea are of high importance for their cumulative effect on climate. The objective of this study was to estimate the N2O emissions and biogeochemical factors involved in N2O emissions such as ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) using the DNDC model in the rice-growing regions of South Korea. N2O emission was observed at every application of fertilizer and during end-season drainage at different rice-growing regions in South Korea. Maximum NH4+ and NO3- were observed at 0-10 cm depth of soil. NH4+ increased at each fertilizer application and no change in NO3- was observed during flooding. NH4+ decreased and NO3- increased simultaneously at end-season drainage. Minimum and maximum cumulative N2O emissions were observed at Chungcheongbuk-do and Jeju-do regions of South Korea, respectively. The simulated average cumulative N2O emission in rice paddies of South Korea was 1.37 kg N2O-N ha(-1) season(-1). This study will help in calculating the total nitrogen emissions from agriculture land of South Korea and the World.

J	Brockhoff, RC; Biesbroek, R; Van der Bolt, B				Brockhoff, Romy Carmen; Biesbroek, Robbert; Van der Bolt, Bregje			Drought Governance in Transition: a Case Study of the Meuse River Basin in the Netherlands	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Drought governance; Transition management; Mechanisms; Meuse river basin	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; CAUSAL MECHANISMS; ADAPTATION	The Netherlands is internationally renowned for its flood risk management, but three consecutive dry years between 2018-2020 fuelled the debate on how to deal with future drought risk. Drought governance in the Netherlands is still in its infancy. The increased sense of urgency has led many scholars and policy makers to call for transitions towards a more anticipatory drought governance which enables transformative actions in an adequate and timely manner. Whilst transitions have been studied before, few have looked at governance systems, and even fewer on the processes that can steer the direction and speed of governance transitions in the future. This paper adopts a novel perspective by combining theories on mechanisms and transitions to analyse future governance transitions. The aim of this study is to identify the key mechanisms that have potential to steer and/or accelerate transitions in Dutch drought governance. This study focusses on the upper part of the Dutch Meuse River basin. Using a document analysis, expert interviews, and focus group discussions, the findings show that five underlying micro-level mechanisms are critical to steer and accelerate transitions. These include social learning, shared problem perception, administrative courage and leadership, persistency, and institutionalisation. The novel transition-mechanistic conceptual approach adopted in this study offers a starting point for other studies that wish to obtain a better understanding of underlying processes in a transition.

The bivariate risk analysis framework was prepared from the joint return periods of the peak flow (m(3)/s) and 3-day annual maximum flow (m(3)/s) flood pair. A total of 137 samples of flood pairs from 1883 to 2019 were adopted for risk analysis. The multivariate return periods were characterized depending on the quantification of the bivariate flood frequency analysis of the pair through copulas methods. The unknown parameter of each copula was estimated using the method-of-moment (MOM) estimator based on Kendall's tau inversion, in which the Clayton copula performed best to model the dependence of the two flood variables. Then, the bivariate hydrologic risk was characterized based on the joint return period in AND, established from the Clayton copula method. The results reveal that the flood pair would keep a constant hydrologic risk value for some time then moderately decrease as the 3-day AMAX flow increases from 700 m(3)/s. This hydrologic risk indicator was analyzed under four service time scenarios and three peak flows whose return periods were positioned at 50, 100, and 150 years. The outcomes from the bivariate risk analysis of the flood pairs can be used as decision support during the design of flood defenses and hydraulic facilities.

The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) performs very well in urban rain-runoff simulations and is widely used to build flood models in specific areas. Because of the complicated and tedious processing work for urban flood modeling and simulation, multifield participants' cooperation is becoming a trend. To promote the research and application of flood modeling and simulation, some resource sharing-oriented systems and platforms have been proposed with the advantages of network technology. However, they still require a participatory environment that can help modeling participants overcome the difficulties of distributed cooperation in the process of SWMM-based flood modeling and simulation. Therefore, we designed and implemented an online participatory system to coordinate the effective collaboration of modeling participants in this process. By referring to the scenarios and specific participatory demands in the modeling process, the system provides a guiding framework that consists of multiple participatory activities and prepares a series of online auxiliary tools designed for these activities. Using the main urban area of Lishui City as the study area, it was confirmed that the process of SWMM-based flood modeling and simulation can be demonstrated collaboratively on the online participatory system developed in this study.

This dramatic climate change caused a significant global turnover in both marine and terrestrial biotas. The biotic response to this event at low latitudes remains mostly unexplored. Here, we studied a recently discovered Eocene fossil macro-and palynoflora from Esmeraldas Formation (Colombia). The Esmeraldas Flora consists of more than seven hundred macrofossil specimens found in two localities, including 45 morphotypes of leaves, seeds, cuticles, fruits, and flowers and > 5000 palynomorphs, that include 210 morphospecies. The Esmeraldas Formation is dominated by meandering river floodplain deposition, and was dated, using palynology and isotopic stratigraphy, as middle to late Eocene (-47.3 to-33.9 Ma). Quantitative paleoclimatic calculations based on leaf physiognomy and coexistence an-alyses indicate a warm temperature and a seasonal precipitation within the range of modern tropical dry forests. Furthermore, the floristic composition that includes the presence of macrofossils of the Pterocarpus clade (Fabaceae), and pollen records of the subfamily Bombacoideae (Malvaceae), and Euphorbiaceae, could be indicative of a tropical dry forest. The overall paleobotanical record suggests that the Esmeraldas flora represents one of the earliest records of a tropical dry forest from low latitudes.

Palaeoflood discharge estimation using dendrogeomorphic methods, rainfall-runoff and hydraulic modelling-a case study from southern Crete	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Dendrogeomorphology; Palaeostage indicators; Hydrologic modelling; Channel roughness	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOUNTAIN CATCHMENT; FLOOD DISCHARGE; RECONSTRUCTION; IMPACT; ISLAND; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; PARAMETERS; MAGNITUDE	This study represents the first palaeoflood discharge estimation using dendrogeomorphic evidence from two ungauged catchments in southern Crete. Dendrogeomorphological methods, rainfall-runoff and hydraulic modelling were applied to estimate the palaeoflood discharge of the 2000 flood event. We developed two scenarios (Q(Hydraulic), Q(RR)) of peak discharges in the short reaches of the Ilingas and Sfakia catchments. Scenario Q(RR)was based on the results of the uncalibrated rainfall-runoff model HEC-HMS. The calculated discharges were equal to 35.9 m(3)s(-1)in the Ilingas reach and 7.6 m(3)s(-1)in the Sfakia reach. The second scenario, Q(Hydraulic)was based on the output of the two-dimensional hydraulic model IBER, which was calibrated using six palaeostage indicators obtained during a field survey. The reconstructed discharge for the Q(Hydraulic)scenario was equal to 26.3 m(3)s(-1)in Ilingas and 11.2 m(3)s(-1)in Sfakia. Deviation (26.7% in Ilingas and 32.1% in Sfakia) between the scenarios were attributed mainly to the uncertainties of in flood reconstruction using the palaeostage indicators and uncalibrated rainfall-runoff model. We further investigated uncertainty in Manning's roughness coefficient, which caused deviations in peak discharges with the range of these deviations defined within +/- 40% in the Ilingas reach and +/- 36% in the Sfakia reach.

WhileR. japonicaand other knotweeds.l.can reproduce sexually, their dispersal to and spread within new regions is often accomplished through vegetative reproduction from rhizome and stem fragments. Once established, knotweeds.l.can displace riparian plants, meaning that soil stability once provided by displaced roots is lost, carrying significant knock-on implications for watershed management. We propose that knotweeds.l.rhizomes both displace roots and the structure they provide to soil, and also amplify bank-erosion forces, especially during floods. Further, erosive forces create propagules, with larger flow events creating larger numbers of propagules and providing the vector for short- and long-distance downstream spread within the watershed. Induced erosion is therefore the main driver of knotweeds.l.invasions along waterways. As some hydrological regimes shift towards more frequent and severe storm events in response to climate change, positive feedback loops may develop in these regions between existing knotweeds.l.populations, sudden riverbank failure, and increased flood-related damage, with presumably significant impacts on riparian infrastructure. While the continued spread of this invasive could have significant riparian flood resiliency consequences if left unchecked, mindful action to control these plants is likely to be beneficial financially, socially, and ecologically within any invaded watershed.

The interactions between vertical components of sea-level changes and horizontal components of the sedimentary budget, in combination with anthropogenic impact, have resulted in different erosion and accretion phases in the past years. Local isostatic, eustatic, and vertical tectonic movements, together with sedimentary budget changes, must be considered in order to predict the shoreline evolution and future marine submersion. In this study, all morpho-topographic data available for the Gulf of Taranto, in combination with Vertical Land Movements and sea-level rise trends, were considered by assessing the local evolution of the coastal trend as well as the future marine submersion. Based on the predicted spatial and temporal coastal changes, a new predictive model of submersion was developed to support coastal management in sea-level rise conditions over the next decades. After that, a multi-temporal mathematical model of coastal submersion was implemented in a Matlab environment. Finally, the effects of the relative sea-level rise on the coastal surface prone to submersion, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports (AR) 5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, were evaluated up to 2100.

Transportation network interactions in cases of inundation can lead to severe disruptions that cause capacity and accessibility reduction and thus considerable delays, especially due to congestion feedback, because congestion occurring due to an inundated link or a link that becomes isolated through inundation of one of its nodes can lead to delays in other parts of the network, due to queue spillback or traffic rerouting. This paper describes a decision tool to support infrastructure protection planning against sea level rise. A simulation-based optimization model is designed to minimize delays occurring in a transportation system under inundation. The model considers budget constraints, hydrodynamic interactions within the shoreline, as well as traffic assignment in the network. The case study focuses on San Francisco Bay area, for a 0.5 m sea level rise that is expected in 2054 and may increase highway users' travel time by 37%. The results show that the optimal strategies vary according to the available budget, and that there exist relatively critical shorelines to protect in order to reduce the traffic disruptions. We anticipate our research to provide a general framework for transportation infrastructure protection planning against sea level rises.

In recent years, the eutrophication in such areas caused by anthropogenic inputs of sewage has been revealed, highlighting the need to understand its influence on organic matter. In this study, delta C-13 and delta N-15 were used to reveal the effects of sewage on organic matters in the Zhangjiang mangrove-estuary ecosystem. Our results indicate that sewage contributed the most of the total particulate organic matter (41%) in the Zhangjiang estuary, while mangrove plants contributed most of the soil organic matter (45%) in the neighboring Yunxiao mangrove. Phytoplankton was another important source of organic matter, accounting for about 21.8% and 49.8% of the particulate and soil organic matter, respectively. Sewage was also a major source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, providing 28.9%, 12.2%, and 100% of the total NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+ in the Zhangjiang estuary, respectively. This may be the major reason for the productive phytoplankton here, which contributed 21.8% and 49.8% of the total particulate and soil organic matter in the study area. Our results reveal the direct contribution and the potential effects of sewage on the contents and bioavailability of organic matter in mangrove-estuary ecosystems, providing new insights into understanding the response of coastal areas to the influence of human activities.

The literature is abreast with numerous reports on the application of various metallic, non-metallic, and other nanoparticles (NPs) that have been administered to various crop species over the last decade with fruitful results. The application of NPs has recently been considered as a viable option to alleviate the adverse effects of abiotic stresses on agricultural production. Typically, abiotic stress conditions include salinity, radiation, floods, heat, heavy metals, and drought. By influencing the physiological state of plants at different levels of their organization, NPs' application has shown promising results in mitigating the negative effects of abiotic stresses. In contrast, many reports emphasize upon the toxic effects of NPs on plants, especially at higher concentrations. Therefore, adequate research is required to understand the effects of different concentrations of NPs before nanotechnology can be successfully used in commercial agricultural systems. Simultaneously, it is equally important to promulgate the statutory regulations associated with the judicial and safe use, disposal, and toxicity studies of NPs as well as approval and release of the nano-products. In the present review, we have dwelled upon the forementioned aspects related to NPs application besides summarizing an updated account of the status of NPs-mediated mitigation of major abiotic stresses in crops.

The Ganges is a transboundary river, and it takes the Padma after meeting Jamuna near Aricha. The Padma River's morphology and hydraulic parameters are so dynamic that it erodes a large portion of land every year. However, the situation of erosion has been very threatening since 2014 which is almost the same period when the construction of the Padma Bridge started. Our Study on the erosion-accretion rate and bar dynamics of the selected reach of Padma River shows that the downstream right bank of this river lost around 134.85 sq. km of land between 2003 and 2021. The total bar area has also increased to 76.8%. Land use land classification (LULC) analysis was done for the years 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021 to predict how the river might act in the future. For this prediction, artificial neural network (ANN) system has been used, and the predicted land use map was generated for 2027. The current kappa validation was 0.869, and the accuracy of the prediction was 87.05%. This study aims at analyzing the current morphological condition and its connection to the construction of the Padma Bridge and also predicts how the lower Padma River might act in near future. According to the study findings, in absence of prompt and appropriate measures, this country is highly susceptible to experiencing catastrophic consequences.

Sediment samples of a 2.6 m trench from Barhatubi area located in the lower flood plain of Mahanadi River delta were studied for sedimentological and pollen analysis. Mangrove succession can be divided into three zones: (1) Freshwater marsh (similar to 1980-1420 cal yr BP); (2) Tidal flat (similar to 1420-770 cal yr BP) and (3) Landward mangrove margin (similar to 770 cal yr BP-Present). A transgressive shift from floodplain freshwater marsh to a tidal flat is recorded between similar to 1980-1420 cal yr BP which is evidenced by upland tree taxa, Poaceae, pteridophyte and fungal spores along with low percentage of mangroves such as Avicennia, Sonneratia and Rhizophora representing the landward edge of the tidal region. Dominance of Sonneratia and a decline in terrestrial taxa reflects a rise in the relative sea level around similar to 1420 cal yr BP with less freshwater input from land suggesting a weakened monsoon condition. After similar to 770 cal yr BP, an overall regressive phase with small cycles of relative sea level rise/fall has been observed due to the dominance of salt tolerant Avicennia along with Rhizophora, Excoecaria agallocha and Aegialitis rotundifolia alternating with Sonneratia and other marine palynomorphs.

However, in countries where many dams have already been constructed, many problems have been observed, such as river environment degradation, aging of the embankments, and inadequate dam performance. As the social and natural environment surrounding dams is becoming more complex and diverse, it is necessary to understand the current overall status of dams and the history of their construction such that we may consider how social capital and dams are related to human society and the natural environment. In this study, the relationship of basic information of dams and the social background in which the dams exist was examined for Japan, where dam construction began in earnest in the late 1800s and became a driving force for economic development. The situations surrounding dams are drastically changing, as maintenance and management costs increase due to the aging of dams and water demand varies due to changes in the industrial structure of a region. Simultaneously, there are instances where dams are expected to reduce damage, such as in the presence of more severe and frequent droughts and floods caused by climate change. It is therefore necessary to remove or restructure dams while considering numerous complex and diverse factors, such as the local social conditions, potential future changes, and environmental impact of rivers.

Affected surfaces occupy > 85% of the rural regions of the Upper Guadalquivir Basin. Dangerous geomorphic processes record the increase of runoff, soil loss and streamflow through time. We report on ripple/dune growth over a plane bed on overland flows, deep incision of ephemeral gullies in olive groves and rock-bed erosion in streams, showing an extraordinary sediment transport capacity of sub-daily pluvial floods. We develop a novel method to design optimal solutions for natural flood management and erosion risk mitigation. We adopt physical-based equations and build a whole-system model that accurately reproduces the named processes. The approach yields the optimal targeted locations of nature-based solutions (NbSs) for active flow-control by choosing the physical-model parameters that minimise the peak discharge and the erosion-prone area, maximising the soil infiltration capacity. The sub-metric spatial resolution used to resolve microtopographic features of terrains/NbS yields a computational mesh with millions of cells, requiring a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to run massive numerical simulations. Our study could contribute to developing principles and standards for agricultural-management initiatives using NbSs in Mediterranean olive and vineyard orchards.

As Canada gets warmer, the credibility of using historical IDF curves for flood risk analysis and design of various urban infrastructure becomes questionable. This study aims at updating and intercomparing the IDF curves in 30 Canadian cities using the simulations of Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2-4.5 and 5-8.5 and their predecessor CMIP5 under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Quantile-Quantile Downscaling is utilized to estimate extreme rainfall values at fine spatiotemporal scales. Overall, more frequent storms with an average increase of around 30%-40% in their intensity are projected in most cities based on both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models during 2071-2100. For instance, the fast-growing cities of Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal could expect around 4-11 times more frequent 5-min storms with a 100-year return period during 2071-2100. Moreover, although IDF curves based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 individual models diverge, the expected IDF curves based on their multi-model ensemble mean are somewhat similar if models with a high climate sensitivity based on CMIP6 are excluded from the analysis. This study underlines the need to update IDF curves in Canadian cities.

What are the protective factors and stressors for the mental health of the young population after extreme weather events in Germany? Methods: Nine semi-structured interviews with representatives of occupational groups providing care to children, adolescents, and political stakeholders were conducted in Simbach am Inn, a German town affected by flooding in 2016. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. Results: The interviews show that the parents' dealing with what they had experienced and the concern for their relatives were the most influential stressors for children and adolescents. As protective factors, they felt that conversations with familiar people and restoring a certain "normality" were particularly important. The interviewees described both, the time of the flooding, and the time after the initial state of shock had subsided, as particularly stressful. Consequently, the experts reported on children and adolescents acutely complaining of fear, helplessness, and extreme tension. Nevertheless, the demand for psychological care increased only slightly after the flooding in Simbach am Inn. Conclusion: The social environment of children and adolescents is essential for their psychological well-being after an extreme weather event. Research, especially on children and adolescents who have already been affected, must increase in order to be able to describe influencing factors even more precisely, to protect individuals from adverse mental health effects, and to identify healthcare requirements.

In order to cope with these challenges, new remote sensing monitoring solutions are required that are based on knowledge extraction and state of the art machine learning solutions that provide insights into the related physical mechanisms and allow the creation of innovative Decision Support Tools for managing authorities. In this paper, a novel user-friendly monitoring system is presented, based on state-of-the-art remote sensing and machine learning approaches. It uses processes for collecting and analysing data from various heterogeneous sources (satellite, in-situ, and other auxiliary data) for monitoring land cover and land use changes, coastline changes soil erosion, land deformations, and sea/ground water level. A rule-based Decision Support System (DSS) will be developed to evaluate changes over time and create alerts when needed. Finally, a WebGIS interface allows end-users to access and visualize information from the system. Experimental results deriving from various datasets are provided to assess the performance of the proposed system, which is implemented within the EPIPELAGIC bilateral Greece-China project. The system is currently being installed in the Greek case study area, namely Thermaikos Gulf in Thessaloniki, Greece.

Here, the authors find that persistent two-way teleconnections between the North Pacific Oscillation and the tropical Pacific constitute a key source of multi-year El Nino. Multi-year El Nino events induce severe and persistent floods and droughts worldwide, with significant socioeconomic impacts, but the causes of their long-lasting behaviors are still not fully understood. Here we present a two-way feedback mechanism between the tropics and extratropics to argue that extratropical atmospheric variability associated with the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is a key source of multi-year El Nino events. The NPO during boreal winter can trigger a Central Pacific El Nino during the subsequent winter, which excites atmospheric teleconnections to the extratropics that re-energize the NPO variability, then re-triggers another El Nino event in the following winter, finally resulting in persistent El Nino-like states. Model experiments, with the NPO forcing assimilated to constrain atmospheric circulation, reproduce the observed connection between NPO forcing and the occurrence of multi-year El Nino events. Future projections of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 models demonstrate that with enhanced NPO variability under future anthropogenic forcing, more frequent multi-year El Nino events should be expected. We conclude that properly accounting for the effects of the NPO on the evolution of El Nino events may improve multi-year El Nino prediction and projection.

Co-Optimization of Reservoir and Power Systems (COREGS) for seasonal planning and operation	ENERGY REPORTS			English	Article						Multireservoir optimization; Energy system optimization; Hydropower; Seasonal planning	STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD RISK; ENERGY; CASCADE; MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; GENERATION; IMPACTS; STORAGE	Climate variability accounts for distinct seasonal differences in electricity demand and streamflow potential, which power systems rely on to assess available hydropower and to cool thermal power plants. Understanding the interactions between reservoir and power networks under varying climate conditions requires an integrated analysis of both systems. In this study, we develop Co-Optimization of Reservoir and Electricity Generation Systems (COREGS), a generalized, open-source, modeling framework that optimizes both systems with respect to reducing power generation costs using a multireservoir model (GRAPS) and an electricity system model (TEMOA). Three optimization schemes of varying degrees of model integration are applied to Tennessee Valley Authority's reservoir and electricity systems for the summer and winters from 2003 to 2015. We find that co-optimization of the systems results in more efficient water allocation decisions than separate optimization. Cooptimization solutions reduce reservoir spill and allocate water for hydropower only when and where it is beneficial to the power system as compared to stand-alone water system optimization. As the penetration of solar and wind power continues to increase, power systems will be more reliant on flexible reliable generating services such as reservoir systems and co-optimization of both systems will become more essential for efficient seasonal planning and operation.

Regional extreme precipitation index: Evaluations and projections from the multi-model ensemble CMIP5 over Thailand	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES			English	Article						Extreme precipitation indices; ETCCDI; SWMR; NEMR; Multi-ensemble CMIP5	CLIMATE MODELS; TRENDS; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL	Various climate extreme events in Thailand such as more recurrent and more intense floods, droughts, tropical storms, and extreme rainfall events pose increasing threats to the environment, water resources, and agricultural production. To assess the occurrence and impacts of extreme climate events, we have overviewed and investigated the changes of indices characterizing extreme precipitation provided by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) across the country. Ten precipitation extreme indices (PRCPTOT, SDII, R10mm, R20mm, R95p, R99p, Rx1day, Rx5day, CDD, and CWD), including the strength of Asian monsoon (SWMR and NEMR) were calculated from the station data, then comparisons and projections were made with CMIP5 models. The SWMR displays high values (South and East) and low values (North, Northeast, and Central), implying high potential flood and drought hazard areas similar to the distributions of precipitation intensity extreme indices (PRCPTOT, SDII, R95p, R99p, Rx1day, and Rx5day). Most GCMs display similar spatial distribution pattern of high intensity of extreme precipitation indices to observations while there are much greater variety of results between the models and observations for the frequency indices. The multi-model ensemble (MME) projects increase in most precipitation extreme indices, indicating stronger precipitation events (by R95p and R99p) across the country notably in the west, Central, and South. Though, the MME delivers better results, some individual GCMs display high uncertainties among different RCP scenarios. Therefore, selection of suitable GCMs along with bias-correction method for regional impact study under extreme climate have to be done carefully.

The systems, product of local traditional knowledge, are mainly devoted to coffee production but, thanks to the interaction with other species, farmers provide different food products both for self-consumption and to be sold. Furthermore, the adoption of shade trees in order to reach a better quality of the coffee cultivated creates particular microclimate conditions favorable for microorganisms, fauna species and also for spontaneous flora species. According to this it is clear the relationships between traditional knowledge and biodiversity preservation which is fundamental also for improving the surrounding environment, avoiding floods or hydrogeological instability damages, concurring to climate change mitigation and carbon storage. Traditional agroforestry systems are one of the best example of coexistence and coevolution between man and nature, being an historical system adopted by local communities to satisfy their needs in total respect of the surrounding environment. Considering this, the promotion and maintenance of this kind of systems and knowledge related might constitute a valid example to actively preserve biodiversity while respecting human needs for food and livelihood security. These systems are also of particular importance considering the importance of coffee as a beverage served in many countries of the world, but often produced in intensive plantations. This paper shows the high sustainability of coffee production under the shade of trees and support a new concept of food quality contributing to preserve local cultures and environments.

Rainfall events are dependent on geographic location, geomorphology, coastal area closeness and general circulation air movements. Accordingly, there are increases and decreases at different meteorology station time-series records leading to extreme events such as droughts and floods. This paper suggests a methodology in terms of envelope curves for monthly extreme rainfall event occurrences at a set of risk levels or return periods that may trigger the extreme occurrences at meteorology station catchments. Generally, in many regions, individual storm rainfall records are not available for intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curve construction. The main purpose of this paper is, in the absence of individual storm rainfall records, to suggest monthly envelope curves, which provide a relationship between return period and monthly extreme rainfall values. The first step is to identify each monthly extreme rainfall records probability distribution function (PDF) for risk level and return period calculations. Subsequently, the return period rainfall amount relationships are presented on double-logarithmic graphs with the best power model as a set of envelope curves. The applications of these methodologies are implemented for three Hodna drainage basin meteorology station rainfall records in northern Algeria. It is concluded that the most extreme rainfall risk months are June, August and September, which may lead to floods or flash floods in the study area. A new concept is presented for the possible extreme value triggering months through the envelope curves as 'low', 'medium' and 'high' class potentials.

In this study, the paleo-flooding activities along the upper Amur River Delta were reconstructed based on the grain-size dataset of three sedimentary cores along a 120-kmtransect fromits alluvial valley. Our results indicate that the coarse sand fraction in marshes surrounding the upper Amur River Delta is closely linked to historical flooding activities. Six "busy" flooding periods were identified at 4.4-4.0 ka BP, 3.63.2 ka BP, 1.7-1.4 ka BP, 1.1-0.9 ka BP, 0.7-0.5 ka BP, and 0.2-0 ka BP, respectively. These flooding intervals correspond well to other sedimentary flooding records from the East Asia Summer Monsoon (EASM) domain, and are in-line with the strengthened EASM stages throughout the Late-Holocene. Thus, our dataset suggests that the EASM circulation, especially its associated precipitation, has played a critical role in the evolution of flooding regime during the Late-Holocene epoch in the Amur River Delta. The last 0.2 ka BP is an exception as the coarse sand accumulation rate increased significantly while the EASM precipitation shows no equivalent shift.

Climate information often remains underutilized and even when used, its influence on policy making is far from clear. In the Netherlands, climate stress tests were introduced to inform and stimulate climate adaptation policy on a municipal level. In the stress tests, risks and vulnerabilities were estimated for scenarios of extreme precipitation, heat stress, drought, and flooding. This article examines whether and how this new tool has effectuated mainstreaming of climate adaptation information into municipal policy. Based on interviews with municipal officials and document analysis we show that the stress tests did so along two general pathways. In the 'applied' pathway, the stress tests were used in an instrumental way to influence policy goals and measures. In the 'configuring' pathway, stress tests were primarily used for learning and persuasion, and mostly influenced problem perceptions and actor involvement. In the 'applied' pathway, the accuracy and resolution of the information were key factors; in the 'configuring' pathway, its influence depended on the accessibility of information and the kind of interaction during policy formulation. Which of the pathways predominated depended on how an adaptation problem fitted with existing policy arrangements. The findings show that stress tests are a promising tool for policy mainstreaming and for promoting local climate adaptation. They also highlight the importance of identifying the pathways of information use, in order to increase the impact of climate information.

As an instrumental-technical intervention, planning is mainly used to improve the physical environment (through concepts such as regulating waterproof facades of architecture, setting buffering zones, and designing green-blue corridors). However, the implementation of the proposed physical interventions is often challenging and necessitates assistance from practices such as climate assessment, policy disciplines, civil societies, and economic resources. These extensive perspectives have spawned many new research domains in the realm of spatial planning. This paper provides a review of the recent developments in flood resilience, risk management, and climate adaptation; based on this, it positions planning research and practice within these works of literature. Four clusters of thought are identified, mainly in the European and American scholarship of the last two decades. They are environmental concerns, disaster management concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns. Current planning research concentrates on disaster management in the underlying belief that planning is functionally efficient. The attention to environmental concerns, socio-economic concerns, and institutional concerns of planning research remains insufficient but has been growing. This, in turn, enlarges the scope of planning research and indicates future directions for study. These new concerns relate to spatial planning's ability to operate effectively in a multi-sectoral setting, despite limited resources and in the face of uncertain risk.

This study recorded the behaviour of GOH in highland refuges during periods of seasonal and extreme flooding in two protected areas in the Brahmaputra River valley (Assam, India): Kaziranga National Park (KNP) and Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary (BWS). Following the death after monsoon floods in 2016 of a lone sub-adult female translocated to BWS from KNP, the study compared the behaviour of this individual during high flood periods to that of other adults, sub-adults and calves in KNP in 2017. Adult rhinos of KNP spent most of the time resting during high flood periods, which may be a behavioural response to overcome stress. By contrast, both calves and sub-adult rhinos in KNP and especially the lone BWS sub-adult female rhino were observed swimming from one highland to another, despite the heavy floodwater current. Sub-adults in KNP dedicated considerable time to feeding; however, the sub-adult in BWS spent less time feeding than any of the age groups in KNP, and her weakened state from starvation may have contributed to her death after the floods receded. The study concludes by offering recommendations to help rhinos survive and recover from seasonal flooding. Adult animals may be the better choice for future rhino translocations from KNP to other flood plain habitats than sub-adult rhinos or a mother with calf.

Wouter			Flood insurance demand and probability weighting: The influences of regret, worry, locus of control and the threshold of concern heuristic	WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Cumulative prospect theory; Flood insurance demand; Hypothetical bias; Risk preferences	PROSPECT-THEORY; DECISION-MAKING; RISK ATTITUDES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOSSES; PSYCHOLOGY; DISASTER; EVENTS; MODEL; DETERMINANTS	Low-lying densely populated areas can be susceptible to flooding due to extreme river discharges. Insurance may be used to spread flood risk and reduce potential material damages. However, homeowners often purchase insufficient amounts of insurance against natural hazard risks like flooding, which may be due to the way they process probabilities. A common finding from (Cumulative) Prospect Theory is that individuals over-weight low probabilities and under-weight moderate to high probabilities in making decisions under risk. However, very low probabilities typical of flood risks are either significantly over-weighted or neglected altogether. This study aims to examine factors related to flood insurance demand regarding emotions specific to risk, like immediate and anticipated emotions, the threshold level of concern as well as personality traits, like locus of control. In addition, we compare results under real experiment incentives to hypothetical ones with high loss outcomes. Based on data collected from 1041 homeowners in the Netherlands, we find that: an internal locus of control and anticipated regret about potentially uninsured flood losses is related to higher flood insurance demand. The use of the threshold of concern model is related to more probability under-weighting/less probability over-weighting when probabilities of flooding are low. Several policies are suggested to overcome psychological factors related to low demand for flood insurance to improve future flood preparations.	[Robinson, Peter John; Botzen, W. J.

On the other hand, extreme values such as those of flood have non-stationary properties and using its data for hydrological studies requires stationary properties, while most meteorological variables have stationary properties. Some dams established in the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) have provided an opportunity to control all hydrological variable of catchment area. In this study, extreme values were simulated and confirmed in an annual scale for hydrometric stations constructed after constructing the reservoir using modified reservoir index (MRI) in Zarinehrood basin in south of Lake Urmia. Results obtained from evaluating trend of studied values expressed that the Nezamabad (NA) hydrometric station is influenced by Shahid Kazemi and Norouzlo reservoirs among stations in the Zarinehrood basin. MRI was used to rebuild studied data. Statistical tests were used to evaluate accuracy of the method. Results of correlation coefficient between maximum flow discharge data of NA hydrometric station and upstream station showed a 53% correlation. Also, results obtained for trend of rebuild series indicated that there is no significant trend in time series. Results also showed that the two sets of time series distribute the same statistics by evaluating statistical distribution fit on rebuild maximum flow discharge and maximum flow discharge of upstream station. Results obtained from measuring MRI demonstrated high efficiency of this method in producing maximum flow discharge for stations constructed after construction of the dam.

Land use/land cover, elevation, slope, drainage density, soil, and rainfall were considered as important flooding hazard factors. Analysis of flooding risk was undertaken for Ambo town's watershed using flooding hazard layer and the two elements at risk, namely human population and land use. Weighted linear combination (WLC) method was used in the process of criteria map aggregation for both flooding hazard and flooding risk. The result of the flooding hazard in the watershed reveals that more proportion of the watershed is high and very high flooding hazard area (60.58%). Moreover, more proportion of the town is high and very high flooding hazard area (66.87%). The result of the flooding risk in the watershed reveals that more proportion of the watershed is high and very high flooding risk area (41.76%). Moreover, half of the town is high and very high flooding risk area (50.09%). An integrated basin wide approach to flood management should be practiced as it is essential to address multiple water related issues at watershed level. Moreover, environmental education should be emphasized to build civic responsibility among the citizens.

Therefore, it is necessary to generate refined predictions of urban floods, such as the prediction of water accumulation processes at water accumulation points, which is of great significance for supporting water-related managers to reduce flood losses. In this study, 16 combination schemes of rainfall sensitivity indicators were used to determine the optimal scheme for predicting the depth of accumulated water, and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm in deep learning was used to build a prediction model of the accumulation process of urban stormy accumulation points. Among the 16 schemes, the relative error of scheme 1 is 15.39%, and the qualified rate is 92.86%. This scheme exhibits the highest accuracy for the prediction results of water accumulation depth. Given this finding, the GBDT algorithm was used to construct a regression prediction model of the water accumulation process based on the collected historical rainfall water accumulation data of 50 water accumulation points. The results demonstrated that the GBDT regression prediction model has a mean relative error of 19.77%, a qualified rate of 82.00%, and a peak average relative error of 5.48%, which verify the validity and applicability of the model for the real-time prediction of the process of water accumulation.

Local and scientific knowledge can be combined in a multi-hazard risk assessment to contribute to sustainable rural development. The aim of this article was to develop a multi-hazard risk assessment at the regional scale which classifies communities according to the risk level, proposes risk treatment actions, and can be replicated in the agropastoral, semi-arid Tropics. The level of multi-hazard risk of 13 communities of Hodh Chargui (Mauritania) exposed to meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought, as well as heavy precipitations, was ascertained with an index composed of 48 indicators representing hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. Community meetings and visits to exposed items enabled specific indicators to be identified. Scientific knowledge was used to determine the hazard with Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets, Landsat images, and the method used to rank the communities. The northern communities are at greater risk of agricultural drought and those at the foot of the uplands are more at risk of heavy rains and consequent flash floods. The assessment proposes 12 types of actions to treat the risk in the six communities with severe and high multi-hazard risk.

Wave characteristics are sensitive to changes in water depth in shallow and intermediate waters. However, wave models used for historical simulations and projections typically do not account for sea level changes whether from tides, storm surges, or long-term sea level rise. In this study, the sensitivity of projected changes in wave characteristics to the sea level changes is investigated along the Atlantic European coastline. For this purpose, a global wave model is dynamically downscaled over the northeastern Atlantic for the 1970-2100 period under the SSP5-8.5 climate change scenario. Twin experiments are performed with or without the inclusion of hourly sea level variations from regional 3D ocean simulations in the regional wave model. The largest impact of sea level changes on waves is located on the wide continental shelf where shallow-water dynamics prevail, especially in macro-tidal areas. For instance, in the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel in France, due to an average tidal range of 10 m, extreme historical wave heights were found to be up to 1 m higher (+30 %) when sea level variations are included. At the end of the 21st century, extreme significant wave heights are larger by up to +40 % (+60 cm), mainly due to the effect of tides and mean sea level rise. The estimates provided in this study only partially represent the processes responsible for the sea-level-wave non-linear interactions due to model limitations in terms of resolution and the processes included.

To improve the situation, policies have been established as a guide to assist in the implementation of agricultural technologies in the country. This study aims to evaluate the effect of two national policies on addressing nutrition, economics, and food security by introducing modern/existing technologies in the Phalombe district in Malawi. To gain insight into the representative farm operations, financial, demographic, and consumption behaviors of smallholder farmers, the data were obtained through a combination of focus group discussions, expert opinions, and various published reports, including both government and nongovernment sources. The farm simulation model (FARMSIM) was utilized to analyze district-level crop and livestock farm operations. In this study, four irrigation technologies (treadle pump system, motorized pump system, solar-powered system, and river diversion irrigation system) were assessed among the agricultural interventions implemented in Malawi. Also, seven land uses (i.e., corn, onion, bean, rice, tomato, leafy vegetable, and cabbage) were developed and simulated under irrigation scenarios. The irrigation systems and land use scenarios were evaluated based on economics, productivity, nutrition, and risk. The treadle pump and leafy vegetable scenario were generally identified as the most preferred combination. In addition, the productivity and riskiness of the other scenarios can be improved by selecting the best combination of crop and irrigation systems. The study concludes that government and private investment in subsidies for large-scale irrigation systems, as well as improvements to market prices and infrastructure, are necessary to boost food security and enhance the livelihood of smallholder farmers in rural Malawi.

So, our research developed a multicriteria paradigm for identifying " where are flooding-exposed risky districts that should be prioritized for interven-tion?" based on two powerful indicators: flood vulnerability and flood exposure. Our method-ology was tested in Alexandria, Egypt, which experiences the harshest rainfall annually and variations in socioeconomic and urban patterns like most global cities. One hundred thirteen climate-related Egyptian experts evaluated 44 flood risk-related indicators; the indicators were ranked using fuzzy AHP, followed by the differentiation of regions using TOPSIS, VIKOR, and WSM methods. Finally, map risky districts using interrelated horizontal layers of indicators. Our findings indicate that the spatial distribution of flood-prone districts increased in proximity to the traditional patterns of the city center and decreased when moving towards the dispersed patterns of the city's outskirts, indicating that urban form is a more effective indicator and has dual aspect effects (increase and decrease) in flood reduction when combined with other non-spatial in-dicators. Finally, a validation study was conducted to define the spatial congruency or mismatch between the simulated and realistic conditions. So, based on runoff data from 2015 to 2021, a deterministic coefficient (RC) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index were calculated with values of 0.89 and 0.93, respectively, indicating our analysis performed well. Our approach may assist policymakers in overcoming the shortage of data for contingency planning, especially in developing countries.

Managing soils to mitigate GHG emissions has been the focus of several studies in recent years. However, knowledge regarding the effects of land management on soil GHG emissions in the Missouri River floodplain (MRF) is scarce. This study evaluated soil carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions among conventional and alternative land use types in the MRF. Soil GHG emissions from three land use systems, corn-soybean rotation (AG), tree/grass agroforestry (AF), and riparian forest (RF) were investigated over the growing season. Mean cumulative soil GHG emissions from AF, RF, and AG over the two-year study period reached 6, 4, and 3 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)eq), respectively. Fertilizer application and soil saturation conditions after flooding events were the key drivers of soil N2O and CH4 emissions. No flooding occurred in the RF system, and this area remained a CH4 sink during the study period. A peak in CH4 flux in the AF and AG treatments was observed after flooding events. In floodplain land use systems, opportunities exist to mitigate soil GHG emissions and CO(2)eq by reducing N fertilizer application. With a wider vision focused on GHG emissions from the current and possible alternative land uses in the MRF, the output of this study gives a measure to assist in the development of integrated solutions and policies regarding climate change mitigation at the local scale.

Estimates of global thermosteric sea-level rises are well constrained by model projections, but local variability in dynamic sea-level arising from seasonal and interannual changes is less well characterised. In this paper we use satellite altimetry observations coupled with CMIP6 model projections to understand drivers of change in dynamic sea-level over the UK shelf seas. We find a northward shift in the atmospheric jet stream and a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to be the key drivers of local dynamic sea-level variability. Using a storyline approach to constrain climate system responses to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, we find that dynamic sea-level is predicted to rise between 15-39 cm by 2080-2099 along the east coast of England (ECE). Under a worst-case scenario, assuming maximum variability as seen in the CMIP6 projections, ECE dynamic sea-level rise could reach 58 cm by 2100. We illustrate the impact of this dynamic sea-level rise in addition to non-dynamic components on the risks posed by storm surge events in ECE using an idealised example. If a storm surge event of the magnitude of the one experienced in ECE on the 5th of December 2013 was to occur in 2100, an additional 1414 km(2) of land would potentially be affected in our worst-case idealised example, 22.4% of which can be attributed to dynamic sea-level rise.

The vastamounts of raw data that underpin forecast systems and the ability togenerate information on forecast skill have, until now, not been publiclyavailable. As part of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS; https://www.globalfloods.eu/, last access: 3 December 2022) service evolution, in this paper daily ensemble river discharge reforecasts and real-time forecast datasets are made free and openly available through the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS). They include real-time forecast data starting on 1 January 2020 updated operationally every day and a 20-year set of reforecasts and associated metadata. This paper describes the model components and configuration used to generate the real-time river discharge forecasts and the reforecasts. An evaluation of ensemble forecast skill using the continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) was also undertaken for river points around the globe. Results show that GloFAS is skilful in over 93 % of catchments in the short (1 to 3 d) and medium range (5 to 15 d) against a persistence benchmark forecast and skilful in over 80 % of catchments out to the extended range (16 to 30 d) against a climatological benchmark forecast. However, the strength of skill varies considerably by location with GloFAS found to have no or negative skill at longer lead times in broad hydroclimatic regions in tropical Africa, western coast of South America, and catchments dominated by snow and ice in high northern latitudes. Forecast skill is summarised as a new headline skill score available as a new layer on the GloFAS forecast Web Map Viewer to aid user interpretation and understanding of forecast quality.

Therefore, investigating the variations in extreme climatic events is vital in planning and developing agriculture and water conservation projects. Hence, the present study investigated the spatiotemporal variability of extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) over the Jhelum River basin (JRB) using the Mann-Kendall (MK) and innovative trend analysis (ITA) methods. In addition, variations in the event-based extreme precipitation (EEPs) and time distribution patterns (TDPs) were analyzed because EPIs considered the daily precipitation values only and the combined effect of the extreme events that last for more than 1 day were often neglected. The results show that the fixed and station-related EPIs, i.e., R10, R20, R25, CWD, Prcpt and R95p, exhibited significant decreasing trends at 06, 05, 04, 04, 07 and 05 stations, whereas an increasing trend was evident for consecutive dry days (CDD) at nine stations with a magnitude of 0.33 days/year, indicating a rise in the drought events compared to floods. Moreover, precipitation events with an amount of 40-290 mm, duration of 4-7 days and concentration ratio of 0.7-0.95 were found to be dominant across JRB. Therefore, an increase in the CDD and a decrease in the consecutive wet days (CWD) may change the magnitude, intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events and consequently pressure the availability of water resources. Therefore, the findings of this study may help understand the precipitation variability over JRB and play a pivotal role in future development projects.

J	Lo, SC; Tsai, HH				Lo, Shih-Che; Tsai, Hung-Hsu			Design of 3D Virtual Reality in the Metaverse for Environmental Conservation Education Based on Cognitive Theory	SENSORS			English	Article						virtual reality; cognitive theory; interactive VR portfolios; metaverse		Background: Climate change causes devastating impacts with extreme weather conditions, such as flooding, polar ice caps melting, sea level rise, and droughts. Environmental conservation education is an important and ongoing project nowadays for all governments in the world. In this paper, a novel 3D virtual reality architecture in the metaverse (VRAM) is proposed to foster water resources education using modern information technology. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was performed to observe a comparison between learning involving VRAM and learning without VRAM. The 3D VRAM multimedia content comes from a picture book for learning environmental conservation concepts, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning to enhance human cognition. Learners wear VRAM helmets to run VRAM Android apps by entering the immersive environment for playing and/or interacting with 3D VRAM multimedia content in the metaverse. They shake their head to move the interaction sign to initiate interactive actions, such as replaying, going to consecutive video clips, displaying text annotations, and replying to questions when learning soil-and-water conservation course materials. Interactive portfolios of triggering actions are transferred to the cloud computing database immediately by the app. Results: Experimental results showed that participants who received instruction involving VRAM had significant improvement in their flow experience, learning motivation, learning interaction, self-efficacy, and presence in learning environmental conservation concepts. Conclusions: The novel VRAM is highly suitable for multimedia educational systems. Moreover, learners' interactive VRAM portfolios can be analyzed by big-data analytics to understand behaviors for using VRAM in the future to improve the quality of environmental conservation education.

J	Schwarz, I; Kuleshov, Y				Schwarz, Imogen; Kuleshov, Yuriy			Flood Vulnerability Assessment and Mapping: A Case Study for Australia's Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						flood; flood vulnerability assessment and mapping; flood vulnerability index; hawkesbury-nepean catchment; Australia; flood risk assessments	DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; SOCIOECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; RISK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RESOLUTION; RUNOFF; IMPACT	Floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards to which Australia is exposed. The frequency of extreme rainfall events and consequential floods are projected to increase into the future as a result of anthropogenic climate change. This highlights the need for more holistic risk assessments of flood affected regions. Flood risk assessments (FRAs) are used to inform decision makers and stakeholders when creating mitigation and adaptation strategies for at-risk communities. When assessing flood risk, previous FRAs from Australia's most flood prone regions were generally focused on the flood hazard itself, and rarely considering flood vulnerability (FV). This study assessed FV in one of Australia's most flood prone regions-the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, and investigated indicator-based approaches as a proxy method for Australian FV assessment instead of hydrological modelling. Four indicators were selected with the intention of representing environmental and socio-economic characteristics: elevation, degree of slope, index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), and hydrologic soil groups (HSGs). It was found that combination of low elevation, low degree of slope, low IRSD score, and very-low infiltration soils resulted in very high levels of vulnerability. FV was shown to be at its highest in the Hawkesbury-Nepean valley flood plain region on the outskirts of Greater Western Sydney, particularly in Blacktown, Penrith, and Liverpool. This actionable risk data which resulted from the final FV index supported the practicality and serviceability of the proxy indicator-based approach. The developed methodology for FV assessment is replicable and has the potential to help inform decision makers of flood-prone communities in Australia, particularly in data scarce areas.

J	Wei, F; Zhao, L				Wei, Fang; Zhao, Lvwang			The Effect of Flood Risk on Residential Land Prices	LAND			English	Article						flood risk; residential land price; spatial Durbin model; Hangzhou	SEA-LEVEL RISE; PROPERTY-VALUES; IMPACT; AMENITIES; DISASTER; SPACE	Floods are one of the most frequent natural disasters today. Hence, it is highly important to explore the effect of flood risk on residential land prices to promote the rational allocation of land resources and incorporate climate change risk control into territorial spatial planning. This paper takes the primary urban area of Hangzhou as an example, based upon data from 424 residential land plots. With spatial autocorrelation analysis and the Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) approach, the spatial effect of flood risk on residential transaction land price was investigated. The results show that, ceteris paribus, plots with high risk of flooding suffer a price discount of 8.62%. The unique mechanism of the way flood risk affects land prices was discussed further from the perspectives of land ownership and land price systems in China. Furthermore, when the land price in surrounding areas increases one percent, the land price in the area will increase 14.32%. The spatial spillover effects of land price were analyzed with the flood information disclosure system and the stakeholders' considerations in land price comparison. The effect of flooding on residential land prices in Hangzhou is the result of government regulations and market allocations, which are fundamentally different from those of the free market allocations in many western countries. Interestingly, the risk of flooding is capitalized into the price, whether it is determined by government or market pricing. Integrating flood risk into land price determination can help promote the optimal allocation of land resources and minimize depreciation attributable to flood disasters.

The objective of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal changes in runoff at the main hydrological stations along the Minjiang River and the Dadu River between 1961 and 2016 using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and annual variation analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis and regression analysis were used to determine the contribution of anthropogenic disturbance, vegetation, and climatic conditions to runoff change. The runoff at each station of the Minjiang River showed a clear decreasing trend, whereas the decreasing trend of the Dadu River was not significant. Moreover, the discharge at the Shawan (SW) station upstream of the Dadu River and the Gaochang (GC) station downstream of the Minjiang River have changed significantly during the flood and non-flood seasons since 2000, while the discharge at other stations has not changed significantly. The average annual runoff in the non-flood season at SW and GC in 2011-2016 increased by approximately 26.21 and 36.47%, respectively, compared with 1961-2010. Anthropogenic disturbance, vegetation, and climatic conditions in the Minjiang River Basin accounted for 76.24, 13.62, and 10.14%, respectively, of the runoff change in the basin. Water consumption and total reservoir capacity were the specific factors most affecting runoff change in the basin, accounting for 15.10 and 13.94%, respectively, of the changes in runoff. The research can provide important support for the ecological restoration of Minjiang River Basin and Yangtze River Basin.

Previous studies had explored the effect of landscape pattern and topography on waterlogging based on historical waterlogging events records. However, the research on current waterlogging issues based on historical records had limitations since the impact factors of waterlogging are inconsistent due to the changes of surface and meteorological conditions. This paper applied a hydrological and hydrodynamic model named InfoWorks ICM, to simulate the urban waterlogging depth (UWD). Under the consistent surface and meteorological conditions, UWD were selected as the dependent variable to analyze the influence of landscape pattern and topography on waterlogging at multiple scales. Pearson correlation analysis and stepwise regression models were used to discover the relationship between these indices. According to the results, in terms of landscape composition, the percentages of built-up area and urban green space have the most significant influence on waterlogging. In addition, organizing average built-up area patch sizes and integrating green spaces with complex shape and high connectivity can improve the state of urban waterlogging. Besides, the rational allocation of topographic gradient is an effective measure at small scale. The adjusted R-2 of regression model were 0.723 at 400 m analysis scale, 0.323 at 600 m analysis scale, and 0.193 at 800 m analysis scale, indicating that attention should be paid to scale effect in similar research. This research can provide a reference for mitigating urban waterlogging disasters.

J	Okofo, LB; Martienssen, M				Okofo, Louis Boansi; Martienssen, Marion			A three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model to assess the feasibility of managed aquifer recharge in the Tamne River basin of Ghana	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Artificial recharge; Ghana; Numerical modelling; 3D lithology model; Hydrogeology	SUITABILITY; GIS	Increasing population growth and global climatic changes threaten water security in semiarid regions such as Northern Ghana. The Tamnean Plutonic Suite aquifer is the main source of water supply for the inhabitants of the Tamne River basin, which is a transboundary subbasin of the White Volta Basin, Ghana. The basin is a flood-prone area where flooding occurs every rainy season, but there is water scarcity during the dry season, mainly due to poor groundwater resources planning. It is expected that the population will increase in the next 10 years, implying a greater water demand. A steady-state and transient groundwater flow model has been developed to understand the hydrogeological conditions and assess the feasibility of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) in the area. A single granitic aquifer formation was delineated from the three-dimensional lithology modelling. The calibrated aquifer recharge through precipitation is very low due to high evapotranspiration and low rainfall. A MAR injection scenario was tested using the available treated floodwater that is registered during the rainy season in the area. The results show the total volume of water injected at the end of the 4-month study period is 11,000 m(3)/day (approximately 1.3 x 10(6) m(3)), which significantly increases aquifer storage and groundwater levels. The volume of water recovered at the end of 8 months (1.4 x 10(6) m(3)) is enough for domestic and irrigation purposes during the dry season. In general, MAR is feasible in augmenting the water levels in the area when combined with controllable irrigation and domestic withdrawals.

Nutrient and sediment dynamics change following a major flood event on a large, grassland river	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						extreme flood; Niobrara River; nitrate; nutrient cycling; phosphorus	PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; WATERSHEDS	River ecosystems can impact the quantity of materials and nutrients flowing into receiving waters. However, these processes may change with climate change, particularly with respect to the impacts of extreme flooding events. In this study, we examined the long-term impacts of an extreme flooding event, the 2019 U.S. Midwest floods, on nutrient loads and concentrations in an unconfined, fourth-order grassland stream, the Niobrara River, Nebraska. To compare historical trends to modern conditions, archived data and contemporarily sampled data were used in conjunction. Prior to the flood (1990-2018), NO3-N concentrations showed a strong seasonal pattern with no relationship with discharge, indicating a groundwater NO3-N source. Total phosphorus (TP), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), and total suspended solids (TSS) showed slight and individual seasonal patterns relating to discharge, following expected patterns of sediment sourced P. Post-flood, NO3-N concentrations declined by 91.5% (F-[2,F- 269] = 34.96, p < .0001). NO3-N depression in the system remained even once discharge returned to pre-flood levels. TP, DIP, and TSS (F ((2, 236)) = 38.14, ANOVA p < .0001; F-(2,F- 176) = 44.06, ANOVA p < .0001; F-(2,F- 205) = 25.98, ANOVA p < .0001) each saw elevation of 100%, 117%, and 66% respectively in 2019 with an expected drop in 2020 when discharge returned to pre-flood. It is unclear why NO3-N concentrations, unlike phosphorus, did not return to pre-flood levels in the 2 years of this study. The observation suggests extreme flooding events may cause complex, unexpected shifts in biogeochemical cycling in river ecosystems.

The latter was characterized by global warming of deep oceanic waters succeeded by a decrease of wind activity and ocean water circulation together with a decline in oceanic productivity. This study provides a detailed paleoenvironmental and depositional history of the Middle Miocene deposits from Mt. Pozeska Gora (the east part of Croatia). Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data with foraminiferal fauna coupled together with palynological data indicate both seasonal and long-term changes in surface water temperatures, nutrient contents, and salinity. Furthermore, it was possible to determine two phases of Middle Miocene flooding in the studied marine system: (a) a shallow, high nutrient marginal sea strongly affected by freshwater inputs corresponding to the thermal maximum and periods with enhanced precipitation during the Miocene Climate Optimum, and (b) a younger deeper marginal sea with a developed seasonal stratification, rather intermediate nutrient availability and reduced fresh-water inputs. Based on the microbiostratigraphy and strontium isotope stratigraphy (Sr-87/Sr-86) coupled with previously published high-precision geochronology, the timing of the first and second flooding can be correlated with the Langhian age -<= 15.4 Ma and 14.6 Ma, respectively Possibly, the properties of the surficial waters that were described as a part of the flooding phases in individual time intervals can indicate changes in circulation patterns as a result of potential influence of the open-sea water masses.

ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE			English	Article						Disaster risk reduction; serious game; anthropocene; uganda; landslide; flood	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RWENZORI MOUNTAINS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; SERIOUS GAMES; LANDSLIDE; KNOWLEDGE; UGANDA	The disaster risk reduction (DRR) community tends to treat disasters and risks in a managerial and technocratic way, thereby disregarding the highly political nature of DRR. An alternative epistemology of disasters, as "matters of concern", is proposed and tested. Mobilizing concepts from Chantal Mouffe and Bruno Latour, this paper illustrates how DRR can be transformed into a public issue. It is argued that education and policymaking on DRR would benefit from a recognition of the hybrid nature of disasters. A serious game is used to investigate proposed epistemology. The board game simulates political decision-making on the reduction of risks due to floods and landslides in South-West Uganda. It is hypothesized that the game can generate an ideal speech scenario that fosters discussions among players and possibly even creates a space of political confrontation. Discussions during ten gameplays have been recorded, transcribed and analyzed (1) to understand how the dominant epistemology facilitates an apolitical approach to disasters and (2) to understand the process of politicization and de-politicization brought about when playing the board game in order to derive recommendations for future tools to facilitate a political appreciation of disasters. Our results indicate that participants effectively experience affects, power relations and confrontations during the game, but that a call for consensus and technical solutions is used by the players to close the discussions and move on with concrete solutions. Insights from this paper contribute to understanding why DRR is frequently treated as a technical issue in local and international disaster governance. Epistemology and approaches proposed in this paper are expected to stimulate innovative experiments towards a more political approach to DRR education and policy.

Historically, floodplains were considered an important sink for potentially toxic elements (PTEs). With increasing flood frequency and duration, due to climate change and land use change, it is important to understand the impact that further flooding may have on this legacy contamination. In this study a field-based approach was taken, extracting soil pore waters by centrifugation of soils sampled on multiple occasions from multiple locations across a floodplain site, which lies adjacent to the River Loddon in southeast England. Flooding generally decreased pore water PTE concentrations and significantly lower pore water concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Cr were found post-flood compared to pre-flood. The dominant process responsible for this observation was precipitation with sulphides resulting in PTE removal from the pore water post-flood. The changes in pH were found to be associated with the decreased pore water concentration of Cu, which suggests the pH rise may have aided adsorption mechanisms or precipitation with phosphates. The impact of flooding on the release and retention of PTEs in floodplain soils is the net effect of several key processes occurring concurrently. It is important to understand the dominant processes that drive mobility of individual PTEs on specific floodplains so that site-specific predictions can determine the impact of future floods on the environmental fate of legacy contaminants.

J	Shen, MX; Chui, TFM				Shen, Mingxi; Chui, Ting Fong May			Contrasting scaling relationships of extreme precipitation and streamflow to temperature across the United States	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						flood; climate change; extreme precipitation; flood generating; scaling analysis	REGIME CHANGES; TRENDS; SEASONALITY; CLIMATOLOGY; RAINFALL; INCREASE; NETWORK	Recent studies have reached inconsistent conclusions from scaling analysis about whether flood or extreme precipitation is more sensitive to warming climate. To explain the reasons behind the inconsistency, here we first used scaling analysis to illustrate how extreme daily precipitation and streamflow scale with daily air temperature across the Continental United States (CONUS). We found both similar and opposite scaling in extreme precipitation and streamflow. It indicates based on scaling analysis, the sensitivity of extreme streamflow to warming climate can be either similar, higher or lower to that of extreme precipitation. We further explored why there are contrasting scaling relationships in the CONUS. Generally, the similar scaling was found in regions where the timing of extreme precipitation and streamflow is correspondent, as well as with similar temporal evolution in extreme event timing and magnitude, e.g., the west coast and southern plains, implying extreme precipitation is the dominant driver of local floods. However, for regions with dissimilar scaling in extreme precipitation and streamflow (e.g., Rocky Mountains, southern plains), the characteristics of extreme streamflow show large difference to those of extreme precipitation, and the temporal evolution of extreme streamflow timing and magnitude are more correlated with factors/processes such as soil moisture and snowmelt. This study reflects that the contrasting scaling relationships of extreme precipitation and streamflow are oriented from the local hydro-climatological specifics. Using scaling analysis to compare the sensitivity of extreme precipitation and streamflow to warming climate is not suitable. Instead, we should focus more on local flood generating mechanisms or flood drivers when investigating floods in the changing climate.

Here, nine global datasets were considered for this study, and after initial screening, four datasets, such as Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) early run calibrated, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF)-ReAnalysis (ERA5) and Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Reanalysis (IMDAA), were selected for detailed comparison. These data products were analysed at monthly, seasonal and annual time scale for whole Sri Lanka and also for three distinguished climate zones (wet, intermediate and dry) for the period 2001-2015. The datasets were further evaluated based on their ability to capture the extreme events, based on recent designated dry year and wet year. All four datasets represent the annual and monthly climatology of Sri Lanka well; however, discrepancies are seen at seasonal scale. CHIRPS had the best performance in the wet zone and ERA5 in dry and intermediate zones. Although all datasets distinctly identified the wet year and dry year with respect to the normal average, the interannual variability was explicitly identified by CHIRPS and ERA5. Therefore, for replicating the national and zonal climatology, both ERA5 (dry and intermediate zones) and CHIRPS (wet zone) are suitable. With the perspective of hydrological applications, both datasets can be used in development of hydrological models for applications such as flood forecasting, reservoir management and climate change impact assessment as an alternative to observed rainfall data in data scarce regions.

We apply the process-based Regional Flood Model (RFM) to simulate a 5000-year flood event catalog for all major catchments in Germany and derive risk curves based on the losses per economic sector. The RFM uses a continuous process simulation including a multisite, multivariate weather generator, a hydrological model considering heterogeneous catchment processes, a coupled 1D-2D hydrodynamic model considering dike overtopping and hinterland storage, spatially explicit sector-wise exposure data and empirical multi-variable loss models calibrated for Germany. For all components, uncertainties in the data and models are estimated. We estimate the median Expected Annual Damage (EAD) and Value at Risk at 99.5% confidence for Germany to be euro0.529 bn and euro8.865 bn, respectively. The commercial sector dominates by making about 60% of the total risk, followed by the residential sector. The agriculture sector gets affected by small return period floods and only contributes to less than 3% to the total risk. The overall EAD is comparable to other large-scale estimates. However, the estimation of losses for specific return periods is substantially improved. The spatial consistency of the risk estimates avoids the large overestimation of losses for rare events that is common in other large-scale assessments with homogeneous return periods. Thus, the process-based, spatially consistent flood risk assessment by RFM is an important step forward and will serve as a benchmark for future German-wide flood risk assessments.

Therefore, a community-based risk assessment is attempted in the context of riverine floods in the rarh plains with special reference to the Mayurakshi River Basin based on the nature of flood hazard and community vulnerability. Flood hazard is measured in terms of flood frequency, depth and durations while the community vulnerability is assessed using its physical, economic, demographic and social-infrastructural components. The present study is executed over a statistically significant sample size of 2382 households across the 43 villages spread in 5 community development (C.D.) blocks. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been applied for the risk assessment and the relative importance index has been used to quantify the community behaviour. The results portray that the C.D. blocks such as Kandi having the maximum flood magnitude depicts a strong negative relation (R-2 = 0.63) with economic vulnerability while the lesser flood-prone C.D. blocks such as Nabagram have strong positive relation (R-2 = 0.66) indicating a typical societal transformation coevolved with flood hazards. The ANOVA shows that the religion-based community risk differs significantly in terms of economic and social-infrastructural vulnerability while income-based community risk differs for hazard propensity and total vulnerability. The main driving force leading to this difference in vulnerability and risk is the agricultural distress intensifying the labour migration that brings higher per capita income through foreign remittances. Besides, community behaviour and different adaptation strategies also play important roles in community risk.

After a certain period of time, timbers tend to degrade and it becomes more and more difficult to seek cost-effective replacement hardwood sleepers. To provide a shortterm solution, many rail infrastructure managers use an interspersing method of track maintenance. The interspersed sleeper of railway tracks, which is a spot replacement of old timber sleeper with concrete or composite counterparts, is often utilised as a temporary maintenance measure for secondary railway tracks such as low-traffic lines, yards, balloon loops or siding. Reportedly, the performance of railway lines including the interspersed tracks can quickly deteriorate when the tracks are exposed to heavy rains and floods. In many cases, ballast washaway can be often seen. This study is the world first to demonstrate the effects of ballast washaway on the vulnerability assessment of interspersed railway tracks using nonlinear finite element simulations, STRAND7. Two sets of moving point loads representing a bogie along the rails have been established to investigate the worst-case, potential actions for impaired performance of sleepers and differential settlements of the track. In this study, the emphasis is placed on the effects of ballast washaway on the maximum displacement of rails and the relative track geometries (i.e. top and twist). The maximum bending actions causing the failures of the track components are also investigated. The new insights will help track engineers develop appropriate climate change adaptation methods and policies for operations of interspersed railway tracks facing extreme rainfall and flooding conditions.

J	Haque, AN				Haque, Anika Nasra			Climate risk responses and the urban poor in the global South: the case of Dhaka's flood risk in the low-income settlements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Household adaptation; Communal adaptation; Flood risk; Urban poor; Dhaka; Low-income urban settlement	CHANGE ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE	The impacts of climatic hazards pose disproportionate risks on the poorer groups who are often the least able to adapt. The low-income urban settlements1 present the extreme cases where the vulnerability to climate risks increases manifold due to pre-existing socio-economic vulnerabilities (e.g. developed through lack of basic services). Despite wide acknowledgement of Dhaka's growing vulnerability to climate change, there is hardly any recent documentation on the existing micro-level adaptation practices, particularly on the most vulnerable lowincome communities who are the hardest hit and often lacks the pre-conditions for successful adaptation. Due to the lack of data the understanding of the ongoing phenomenon in Dhaka is not clear and this study attempts to fill the gap by identifying the ways in which Dhaka's low-income population respond to their flood risk. The study adopts mixed-methods (questionnaire survey, focus group discussions, transect walks) to collect required data covering different scales, i.e. household and community. The results show despite being challenged by numerous pre-existing conditions, the vulnerable communities show great resilience to climatic risks based on their limited resources, local knowledge and skills. The study also reveals that the urban poor does not respond to the physical risk itself, rather they respond to what that risk means to their livelihood. Based on the analysis of the existing adaptation responses, the study identifies ways in which the macro-level efforts can be integrated with the micro-level responses to achieve meaningful longer-term resilience.

Dynamics of river flows towards sustaining floodplain wetland fisheries under climate change: A case study	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						river hydrology; fisheries; wetlands		Wetlands play an important ecological role by providing shelter and habitat for diverse fish species, migratory birds, macrophytes and other aquatic organisms. Hydrological connectivity with the main river channel has a critical role in fish diversity and production in floodplain wetland. The present study showed the seasonal hydrological alteration on fish species distribution in Ansupa wetland, connected with tropical river Mahanadi, India. The river discharge showed a variation from 4549 cusec during lean season (April) to 204716 cusec during monsoon (August). It has been recorded that water flows/discharge above 200000 cusec only, inundate the wetland resulting in exchange of free flows of fish species and nutrients. The study period for the fish species diversity was undertaken during 2017-18. A total of 46 fish species were observed under the orders Cypriniformes (18), Perciformes (12), Siluriformes (7), Synbranchiformes (2), Cyprinodontiformes (1), Clupeiformes (1), Beloniformes (1), Osteoglossiformes (1), Mugiliformes (1), Anguilliformes (1) and Tetraodontiformes (1). According to the conservation status of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, four species Parambassis lala, Ompok bimaculatus, and Anguilla bengalensis are in the category of Near Threatened. Analysis showed that taxonomic distinctness is more during winter than the monsoon and pre-monsoon, indicating monsoon could play a significant role in the fish species recruitment through river connectivity. Climatic data was analysed for a period of 34 years and indicated that an increment of 0.2 degrees C in water temperature and average increase of 129mm rainfall at the study site. This slight increase in rainfall over the years could be one of the factors responsible for the fish recruitment in the Ansupa wetland, through river connectivity underlining the importance of flood for wetland fisheries recruitment and sustainability.

Prediction of Future Extremes During the Northeast Monsoon in the Coastal Districts of Tamil Nadu State in India Based on ENSO	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Northeast monsoon; ENSO; extremes; CMIP5; ONI; Tamil Nadu coast	SOUTH PENINSULAR INDIA; EL-NINO; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; SUMMER MONSOON; OCEAN DIPOLE; OSCILLATION; CMIP5; CIRCULATION; ENSEMBLE	The coastal districts of Tamil Nadu (CDT) receive a maximum portion of rainfall during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM) season from October to December (OND). It is during this season that the coastal community of Tamil Nadu encounters severe cyclonic storms causing floods, and the lack of uniform rainfall during this season leads to drought. The study focuses on analyzing the intraseasonal, interannual and interdecadal trend between the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) northeast monsoon rainfall (NEMR) and ENSO southwest monsoon rainfall (SWMR) for the years from 1971 to 2015. The direct dependence of excess and deficit rainfall on the El Nino and La Nina events, respectively, during the last five decades is evident from the obtained results. Moreover, the intraseasonal climate anomaly values have been used to account for the deviations from normal in the rainfall pattern. Projection of extreme NEM events in the CDT up to mid-century (2050) was derived from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) simulations for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The bias-corrected sea surface temperature (SST) data from the models were used to calculate the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) for the historical period (1971-2015) which was then compared to the observed data. The same was also used for NEM extreme event validation and evaluation. The proposed approach has important implications for climatological studies and also for evaluating the impact of climate change on localized regions, which will aid in predicting future extreme events.

Low-impact development (LID) is an effective approach to improve urban flood resistance, but there is a lack of quantitative evaluation criteria to determine the best scenario in the newly built and built-up urban areas. In this study, based on the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method (FCE), a multi-index evaluation system is established to quantify the LID performance for the environment, technology, economy, and society. For overcoming subjective arbitrariness, the Criteria Importance Though Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods are used to evaluate the weight of each evaluation index. The proposed method is demonstrated for the Xi'an City, China. Results show that the integrated configuration of green roof, infiltration pavement and grass swale has the best comprehensive efficiency under the proposed method. More specifically, the allocation of different LID combinations in the newly built area can effectively manage the flooding in this area. However, the comprehensive efficiency of increasing the diameter of the storm sewer is optimal in the built-up area. The increased pipe diameter can discharge more rainwater through the urban storm sewer and mitigate overflow. A multi-index evaluation framework beyond the traditional subjective evaluation standard is established, which can quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of LID facilities. The proposed quantification evaluation method can provide an efficient recommendation for sponge city construction and evaluation.

J	Babcicky, P; Seebauer, S; Thaler, T				Babcicky, Philipp; Seebauer, Sebastian; Thaler, Thomas			Make it personal: Introducing intangible outcomes and psychological sources to flood vulnerability and policy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Risk management; Vulnerability assessment; Resilience; Coping capacity; Justice; Equity	NATURAL HAZARD MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HURRICANE-KATRINA; RISK-MANAGEMENT; PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH; RESILIENCE; MITIGATION; JUSTICE	Vulnerability assessments play a central role in deciding on measures for flood risk reduction. Vulnerability itself manifests as tangible (e.g. building damage) and intangible (e.g. distress, disruption of livelihoods) outcomes caused by a flood event. Traditionally, vulnerability assessments have been focusing on the physical and social sources that drive these outcomes, while psychological sources have largely been neglected. This paper expands the current physical and social perspective on vulnerability by demonstrating the added value of psychological sources to more accurately identify those who are most vulnerable to flooding. Based on survey data of 1127 households living in flood-prone areas in Austria, we confirm that tangible and intangible outcomes represent conceptually distinct types of flood impacts. A series of hierarchical regression models shows that psychological sources do not play a critical role for tangible outcomes, as they do not significantly add to the variance already explained by physical and social indicators. However, psychological sources have substantial unique explanatory value for intangible outcomes, and may supersede certain physical indicators (e.g., risk zone is a physical proxy indicator for the underlying psychological factor 'perceived flood probability'). By contrast, social indicators retain their effect size even if psychological indicators are included. Thus, expanding the scope of vulnerability outcomes calls for simultaneously expanding the scope of sources of vulnerability. The results caution against catch-all risk reducing measures; instead, risk managers should address the vulnerability sources specific to particular outcomes. To improve social equity, flood policy instruments should incorporate intangible outcomes and psychological sources of vulnerability.

A set of archive data, literature re-analysis, statistical data, monitoring data, and surveyed materials were collected and qualitatively and quantitatively analysed to support a holistic investigation of disaster impacts and social resilience. The results indicate that (a) natural disasters occurred frequently but were distributed over place and time and had various impacts, which left possibilities for maintaining social development with diverse and specific coping strategies; (b) strong central and local governance continually improved infrastructure and engineering technologies, and collaboration in social networks with local experience and disaster cultures were the major contributing factors that enhanced social resilience at various levels; (c) the THR area demonstrated various features of social resilience to natural disasters in terms of spatial-temporal scales, where the combination of multiple resilience measures enabled the resilience of the entire social system at various places over long time periods. Generally, larger social systems with diverse response capabilities were more resilient than small and individual entities over a long time scale. The study highlights that the THR region withstood frequent natural disasters but maintained a general development of social economy, transportation, and advanced technologies, and performed a positive transformation to a more resilient status. Overall, this paper describes the scale effects of multiple resilience measures along the THR and calls for specific studies on social resilience and transformation of diverse social entities over multiple spatial-temporal scales.

However, existing hydrological modeling frameworks are mostly constrained to a relatively coarse resolution, unrealistic input information, and insufficient evaluations, especially for the large domain, and they are, therefore, unable to address and reconstruct many of the water-related issues (e.g., flooding and drought). In this study, a 0.0625-degree (similar to 6 km) resolution variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model developed for China from 1970 to 2016 was extensively evaluated against remote sensing and ground-based observations. A unique feature in this modeling framework is the incorporation of new remotely sensed vegetation and soil parameter dataset. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first application of VIC with such a long-term and fine resolution over a large domain, and more importantly, with a holistic system-evaluation leveraging the best available earth data. The evaluations using in-situ observations of streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture (SM) indicate a great improvement. The simulations are also consistent with satellite remote sensing products of ET and SM, because the mean differences between the VIC ET and the remote sensing ET range from -2 to 2 mm/day, and the differences for SM of the top thin layer range from -2 to 3 mm. Therefore, this continental-scale hydrological modeling framework is reliable and accurate, which can be used for various applications including extreme hydrological event detections.

One of the principal obstacles that hinders effective decision making is insufficient spatial knowledge frameworks. Cities climate adaptation planning must become strategic to rethink and transform urban fabrics holistically. Contemporary urban planning should merge future threats with older and unsolved criticalities, like social inequities, urban conflicts and "drosscapes". Retrofitting planning processes and redefining urban objectives requires the development of innovative spatial information frameworks. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to overcome knowledge production limits and to support climate adaptation planning. The research was undertaken in collaboration with the Metropolitan City of Venice and the Municipality of Venice, and required the production of a multi-risk climate atlas to support their future spatial planning efforts. The developed tool is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS), which aids adaptation actions and the coordination of strategies. The model recognises and assesses two climate impacts: Urban Heat Island and Flooding, representing the Metropolitan City of Venice (CMVE) as a case study in complexity. The model is composed from multiple assessment methodologies and maps both vulnerability and risk. The atlas links the morphological and functional conditions of urban fabrics and land use that triggers climate impacts. The atlas takes the exposure assessment of urban assets into account, using this parameter to describe local economies and social services, and map the uneven distribution of impacts. The resulting tool is therefore a replicable and scalable mapping assessment able to mediate between metropolitan and local level planning systems.

In order to study this impact on specific areas, the present study identified the spatiotemporal variation of erosive rainfall and the influence of its variation on streamflow and sediment discharge within the Ganjiang River Basin. Daily average rainfall data were obtained from 23 national meteorological observation stations along with streamflow and sediment concentration data collected for 1964-2013 at 6 control stations. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall method and Pettitt test were used for trend analysis and changepoint detection, and the modified double mass curve method was used to quantify the effects of both erosive rainfall variation and human activities on hydrological regime shifts. Results showed significant monthly variation in erosive rainfall and significant increases in rainstorms over the entire watershed, particularly in the downstream subzone and northeast corner of the upstream subzone. While moderate rain showed an insignificant decrease in both subzones and the entire watershed, heavy rain showed no significant variation over the entire watershed but did show a significant increase in both the midstream and downstream subzones. The changes in accumulative erosive rainfall had only small effects on reduction in sediment discharge after the changepoint year. In contrast, human activities contributed to more than 50% of the changes in sediment discharge in the entire basin. These findings provide a research basis for the study of extreme climate, flood disaster prevention, and soil erosion prediction over the entire watershed.

The comparative multiple-case study covers three objects realized between 2014 and 2017 at the Vistula riverbanks in Warsaw, Poland: pile founded Beach Pavilion, amphibious Boulevard Pavilion, and floating Water Tram Terminal. The research was based on the blueprints analysis as well as on on-site observations in the phase of construction and operation and interviews. The general characteristic of the three resilient typologies has been confirmed in the study. The pile building has an almost unlimited range of operation regarding the water level on the cost of a relatively remote location from the river, but during an exceptionally extreme flood, it will be flooded. Floating buildings provide the best visual and physical contact with water, cannot be flooded, and may be relocated but access to them from land is hampered, especially during very low and very high water levels. Amphibious buildings seem to be a compromise of water proximity and reliability of operation in all circumstances. A closer look reveals technical problems with buoyant structures. In the case of the floating terminals, problems with mooring on the semiwild freezing river remain a challenge. The amphibious buildings are still in the phase of implementation, waiting for their first test in natural flooding conditions.

The funding challenge necessarily involves multiple levels of government, due to the regional nature of CFRR public goods involved. Yet there has been little research comparing such multilevel arrangements across countries, and in particular exploring the performance of public funding arrangements for providing coastal flood risk reduction. We address this gap, applying fiscal federalism to develop a multilevel governance analysis of public decision-making and fiscal authorities for CFRR in the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Australia. For each country, we locate key decision-making and fiscal authorities in multilevel governance arrangements, and analyse their alignment with the benefits of CFRR measures (spillovers). We find diverse coastal flood risk governance arrangements ranging from highly centralised (NL), mixed arrangements, involving regional centralisation (Germany) or partial devolvement (UK), to full decentralisation (AUS). Further, we find that in accordance with fiscal federalism, multilevel coastal flood risk governance arrangements are generally reflective of the distribution of the benefits across different levels of government, with some exceptions (Germany and UK). Finally, exploring the outlook of current arrangements under sea-level rise, we find that major fiscal redistributions may be put under pressure by rising costs likely under SLR and future coastal development. This is particularly the case for those systems which operate under hazard-based, as opposed to risk-based, coastal protection policies. Further, we find that both fully and moderately decentralised arrangements may require greater central support for alternative measures, such as retreat, in light of growing financial burdens on local governments.

In forested wetlands, hydrological regimes have been identified as crucial factors that shape the community's attributes and composition patterns. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the response of a tropical forested wetland diversity and structural attributes, as well as its species composition to two types of environmental proxies related to flooding and salinity regimes: microtopography and distance to water bodies. The forest was characterized by sampling all the individuals with DBH >= 10 cm found inside twenty-five 25 x 50 m plots. Each plot's microtopographic variables and distance to water bodies were extracted using a LiDAR point cloud. The response of the community's attributes to the quantified environmental proxies was analyzed using an RDA ordination. Community composition was the only attribute where the ordination was significant, particularly only its first axis. Additional analysis showed that Rhizophora mangle was gradually substituted by Terminalia buceras as the most abundant species along the RDA first axis. This first axis was significantly correlated with two environmental proxies: distance to the lagoon's edge and standard deviation of ground surface elevation. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the abundance of three species was explained by these environmental proxies. R. mangle abundance showed a negative response to standard deviation of ground surface elevation, while T. buceras and Chrysobalanus icaco showed a positive response to distance to the lagoon's edge.

Landscape changes in avulsive river systems: Case study of Taquari River on Brazilian Pantanal wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Fluvial avulsion; Taquari megafan; Landscape changes; Satellite image processing; Temporal analysis	IMAGE-ANALYSIS; LAND-USE; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; MEGAFAN; BASIN; LAKE; CONSERVATION; RADARSAT-2; QUATERNARY	The Pantanal is an important active sedimentary basin in central South America where highly diverse flora and fauna are sustained by seasonal floods. Intense land use in the catchment areas enhanced sediment load and destabilized avulsive river systems in the plains. A well-known avulsion in the Taquari River during the 1980-90s, called "Ze da Costa", has shifted the river mouth and drastically changed the nearby landscapes, making them difficult to map because of the hard access and the large variations in spectral and spatial attributes of raster data like Landsat images. Therefore, we developed a useful method to map and explore landscape changes in "Ze da Costa" avulsion that combines geotagged field pictures, randomly selected high-resolution orbital truths, normalized difference vegetation index, digital elevation models, linear spectral mixture models and Landsat historical imagery in pixel-based and object-oriented supervised classifications. We found that bands in green, red, and near-infrared spectra provide better mapping results with object-oriented algorithms for deriving and studying temporal dry/wet ratio dynamics. The temporal analyses of the dry/wet ratio showed that avulsions in the Taquari River have the potential to change permanently the "Ze da Costa" area into a dry landscape, making it susceptible for land use (deforestation and fire), except areas seasonally inundated by the floods of the Paraguay River. Overall, our method might be also useful for long-term studies of land use and climate change in avulsive rivers in wetlands around the world. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

After Hurricane Harvey, several households called Texas poison control centers to report snakebites that occurred when rising water flooded homes. Patterns of snakebite before and after hurricane landfalls have not been well studied. Methods-We reviewed retrospective surveillance data from the Texas Poison Control Network to examine snakebites possibly related to tropical storms/hurricanes that hit Texas between 2000 and 2017. For that assessment, we compared 2 groups of counties: those designated for individual assistance (impact counties) by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and all others (nonimpact counties). Typically, counties with individual assistance declarations are those in which damage is worse and resident return may be delayed. Results-Eleven named tropical storms/hurricanes struck Texas between 2000 and 2017; 9 received individual assistance declarations. During the 18 y, 2037 snakebites were reported in the 30 d after and the 30 d before landfalls in 9 storms; 132 (6%) occurred poststorm in impact counties, and 13 of 132 (9%) of the case narratives mentioned hurricanes as a contributing factor. Impact counties were not statistically more likely to report snakebites in the 30 d after landfall for any of the 9 storms or overall, nor did we find differences in patient demographic characteristics, type of snake, and care patterns post- and prestorm. Conclusions-There was no evidence of increases in snakebites after hurricanes in Texas during the study period. More detailed evaluations may be warranted in other regions that experience hurricanes and have venomous snake populations.

Physiological disorders, enzymes inactivation as well as altering the cellular redox homeostasis are attributed to these stressors, limiting plant survival, as well as crop yield loss. Considering the potential threat from these adverse situations, plant biologists are searching for new aids to combat crop loss and plant survival. Contrary, plants also have developed many adaptive features, and defense mechanisms, among which the synthesis of signaling molecules such as gasotransmitters-nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), are very important. These signaling molecules play vital roles in enhancing antioxidant defense and synergistic interactions with phytohormones and other protective molecules, are considered as the most promising and effective against abiotic stresses. In recent years, numerous pieces of evidence showed the endogenous concentration of both of these gasotransmitters can regulate each other as well as specific defense-related entities, especially within the antioxidative mechanisms. Moreover, NO and H2S donors have also been tested exogenously on different plant species, and both of them showed promising protection against adverse conditions. Although a significant advancement in exploring the molecular basis of such protections has been made recently, still a lot is to find out. Therefore, in this review, we have illustrated a panorama of the intimate relationship between these two signaling molecules, conferring abiotic stress tolerance in plants based on available literature. Moreover, we will try to give an indication of the research gaps and future research prospects in this specific ground.	[Bhuyan, M. H. M.

Multiobjective Direct Policy Search Using Physically Based Operating Rules in Multireservoir Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multiobjective reservoir optimization; Multireservoir systems; Direct policy search; Parameterization simulation optimization; Policy myopia	WATER-RESOURCES; MULTIPURPOSE RESERVOIR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS	This study explores the ways to introduce physical interpretability into the process of optimizing operating rules for multireservoir systems with multiple objectives. Prior studies applied the concept of direct policy search (DPS), in which the release policy is expressed as a set of parameterized functions (e.g., neural networks) that are optimized by simulating the performance of different parameter value combinations over a testing period. The problem with this approach is that the operators generally avoid adopting such artificial black-box functions for the direct real-time control of their systems, preferring simpler tools with a clear connection to the system's physics. This study addresses this mismatch by replacing the black-box functions in DPS with physically based parameterized operating rules, for example by directly using target levels in dams as decision variables. This leads to results that are physically interpretable and may be more acceptable to operators. The methodology proposed in this work is applied to a network of five reservoirs and four power plants in the Nechi catchment in Colombia, with four interests involved: average energy generation, firm energy generation, flood hazard, and flow regime alteration. The release policy is expressed depending on only 12 parameters, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to existing approaches of multiobjective DPS. The resulting four-dimensional Pareto-approximate set offers a variety of operational strategies from which operators may choose one that corresponds best to their preferences. For demonstration purposes, one particular optimized policy is selected and its parameter values are analyzed to illustrate how the physically based operating rules can be directly interpreted by the operators.

The aim is to investigate how disparities in overall socioeconomic status influence environmental justice outcomes for Canadian flood risk management planning and funding structures. A micro-dataset of the 2016 Canadian census of population was used to derive a comprehensive SES index over 5739 census tracts. The index comprises 49 theoretically-important and environmental policy-relevant indicators of vulnerability that represent diverse aspects of socioeconomic, demographic, and ethnicity status of Canadians. Bartlett's test of sphericity, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, Cronbach's alpha scale reliability, and goodness-of-fit for factor's solution were employed to assess validity, reliability, and consistency in the dataset before applying principal components analysis. Our data revealed 11 statistically-significant multidimensional factors, which together explained 80.86% of the total variation. Levene's homogeneity of variance test disclosed a considerable socioeconomic disparity across census tracts, census metropolitan areas (CMAs), and provinces/territories in Canada. Social vulnerability tends to be geographically stratified across Canada. For example, Drummondville, Saguenay, and Granby CMAs (all in Quebec) had the lowest SES scores, whereas Vancouver and Toronto CMAs had the highest SES scores. Prevalence of spatial variations in the SES scores has significant implications for appraising overall social well-being and understanding the relative social vulnerability of population subgroups. The new place-based SES index has potential for assessing environmental justice outcomes in flood risk management at the census tract level.

J	Evans, SG; Godsey, SE; Rushlow, CR; Voss, C				Evans, Sarah G.; Godsey, Sarah E.; Rushlow, Caitlin R.; Voss, Clifford			Water Tracks Enhance Water Flow Above Permafrost in Upland Arctic Alaska Hillslopes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						permafrost; water tracks; hydrologic cycling; coupled modeling	KUPARUK RIVER-BASIN; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ACTIVE-LAYER; THERMAL HYDROLOGY; MODEL FORMULATION; HEAT-TRANSFER; THAW; TEMPERATURE; CARBON	Upland permafrost regions occupy approximately one third of the Arctic landscape. In upland regions, hydrologic fluxes are influenced by water tracks, curvilinear features on hillslopes that preferentially fill with and route water in response to snowmelt and rainfall when the soil above continuous permafrost thaws in the summer. As continued warming of the Arctic may alter hydrologic cycling leading to increased frequency of extreme hydrologic events like drought and flooding as well as modification of biogeochemical cycling, it is imperative to untangle the interplay between precipitation, runoff, and subsurface flow as water is routed from upland Arctic regions to the Arctic Ocean. This study quantifies how ground surface temperatures affect groundwater discharge from hillslopes with water tracks in the upland Arctic by employing a three-dimensional, physically based subsurface flow model with variable saturation and freeze and thaw capabilities that is calibrated to field measurements from the Upper Kuparuk River watershed on the North Slope of Alaska, USA. Model analysis indicates that higher ground surface temperatures along water track hillslopes promote increases in groundwater discharge where water tracks act as conduits for large-recharge events and continue to discharge groundwater into the autumn after the adjacent hillslope has frozen. Simulating the conditions that distinguish water tracks from their hillslope watersheds changes subsurface water storage and ground thermal responses but does not alter the total magnitude of groundwater discharge outside of parameter uncertainty. These findings suggest that water tracks play a complex and critical role in hydrologic cycles of the upland Arctic.

Chemical control of torpedograss and common reed under altered salinity conditions	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						glyphosate; imazapyr; Panicum repens L.; Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud; storm surge	PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; SALT TOLERANCE; CRYPTIC INVASION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; GULF-COAST; GROWTH; GLYPHOSATE; LINEAGES; SURVIVAL	Environmental conditions, such as salinity, flooding, and drought, can affect morphological and physiological features of plants, including leaf traits, biomass allocation, and growth rate. Changes in these features can impact herbicide absorption and translocation. This may present management challenges for species that grow in a variety of environmental conditions, such as torpedograss (Panicum repens L.) and common reed [Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin ex. Steudi. To understand how salinity affects herbicide efficacy, plants of each species were grown in freshwater (0.7 ppt) or saline (15 ppt) conditions in a greenhouse and evaluated for growth characteristics after 2 wk. Torpedograss showed reductions in height, leaf number, stem number, biomass, and growth rate under high-salinity conditions. Common reed stem numbers were lower under freshwater conditions, but no other differences were observed. Plants were then treated with either imazapyr (0.14, 0.28, 0.56, and 1.12 kg ae ha(-1)) or glyphosate (0.56, 1.12, 2.24, and 4.48 kg ae ha(-1)) (four replications per treatment, plus a nontreated control, per salinity regime). Injury and aboveground biomass were measured 30 days after treatment (DAT), and above- and belowground biomass 60 DAT. Saline conditions reduced glyphosate and imazapyr efficacy on torpedograss, likely due to plant responses to salinity such as lower leaf number, leaf area, and growth rate. Observed differences in injury and biomass were more pronounced at the lower herbicide application rates, particularly for plants treated with glyphosate. The effects of salinity on herbicide efficacy for common reed were not significant.

Sedimentary reconstruction with a high resolution remains difficult without conducting expensive, destructive and/or time-consuming analyses. In this study, high resolution CT-scan profiles (0 center dot 6 mm resolution) were used to investigate their potential for detecting flood deposits induced by heavy rainfall events. This method was applied to a sediment core dated with fallout radionuclides - covering a 120 year period - collected in a pond draining a small forested catchment (French Massif Central - Central France). Between 1960 and 2017, 28 layers were deposited. Seventy-six percent of these deposits were correlated to the occurrence of heavy rainfall (>50 mm) recorded during one or two consecutive days. The remainder of the deposits detected with the Computer Tomography (CT) scanner (n = 5) were not correlated to weather events. They mainly occurred in response to landscape management operations (for example, afforestation works as a result of the major 1999 storm). This period was indeed characterized by an increase in the delivery of Cs-137-enriched sediment, demonstrating a greater topsoil contribution to sediment during major forest management operations. The intensity of detrital layers has significantly decreased throughout time after a major land use change that took place in 1948 and land abandonment. The frequency of heavy rainfall and associated detrital deposits has nevertheless increased by 60% and 75%, respectively, between the years 1960 and 2017. These results outline the potential of CT-scan for reconstructing long-term flood deposits associated with heavy precipitation.

High-altitude and long-range transport of aerosols causing regional severe haze during extreme dust storms explains why afforestation does not prevent storms	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Regional severe haze; Massive dust storm; Satellite observation; Optical properties	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; AIR-POLLUTION; EVENTS; SATELLITE; CLIMATE; BIOMASS; CHINA; LIDAR	Climate change is predicted to induce more extreme events such as storms, heat waves, drought and floods. Dust storms are frequently occurring in northern China. Those storms degrade air quality by decreasing visibility and inducing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To control dust storms, the Chinese government has launched a large-scale afforestation program by planting trees in arid areas, but the effectiveness of this program is still uncertain because the trajectories and altitudes of dust transport are poorly known. In particular, afforestation would be effective only if dust transport occurs at low altitudes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the extreme dust storm from May 2 to 7, 2017, which resulted in record-breaking dust loads over northern China. For that, we used dust RGB-composite data from the Himawari-8 satellite and the cloud-aerosol lidar, moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data, and surface monitoring data. The source regions of the dust storms were identified using the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory model and infrared pathfinder satellite observation. Contrary to our hypothesis, results show that dust is transported at high altitude of 1.0-6.5 km over long distances from northwestern China. This finding explains why the afforestation has not been effective to prevent this storm.

We explore the underlying mechanisms based on a survey-based dataset maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service. An annual average of 6518 flood occurrences was reported, which caused economic damages of 3351 million USD per year. Flash flood and flood contributed to 53% and 32% of total occurrences and was associated with a larger share of damaging events (SDE). Results show that the higher impacts by flood and flash flood on property and crop are partly attributed to the greater intensity of rainfall. In addition, flood has the highest unit cost of damages. Notably, despite an upward tendency in economic damages by flash floods, no evident change trend is observed for inland floods as a whole. Further analysis shows changes in economic damages by heavy rain and flash flood are mainly governed by the increased annual frequency and hazard intensity, but the change of trend in their vulnerability indicators (i.e., SDE and Damage Per Event (DPE)) is not obvious. Regarding floods, it was not possible to attribute the variations in economic losses to hazard and vulnerability, as no significant tendency is found except for an increasing SDE. Despite limitations of length of records, data collection, and methodology, the difference in economic impacts and the related hazard and vulnerability revealed in this study can help better target future adaptation and mitigation measures.

As part of an ongoing collaborative modeling research program in the river system, researchers conduct annual interviews with key local water managers to characterize local climate adaptation strategies and implementation barriers, and identify science information needs to prioritize ongoing research activities. This article presents new findings from a third wave of interviews conducted with the same water managers following the historic 2017 wet year. Comparison of these data suggests that managers increased their adaptation efforts described during previous consecutive drought years (2015 and 2016). In 2017, comparatively fewer managers described climate uncertainty as an implementation barrier, exemplifying recent hydroclimate variability as the "new normal" climate for which they should plan. An assessment of recent conditions reveals that recent water years bound historical observations and are consistent with estimated paleoclimate extremes in terms of magnitude, but not persistence, of both dry and wet conditions. Comparison to projected future climate conditions affirms managers' perspectives that increased hydroclimate variability, inclusive of drought and flood extremes, defines the new normal climate anticipated for the region. To support long-term adaptation planning, managers requested that researchers prioritize simulations of alternative water management strategies that account for nonstationary climate patterns and quantify implications system-wide. This article illustrates how interdisciplinary research that integrates local knowledge with applied climate science research can support adaptive water management in snow-fed river systems.

J	Uenzelmann-Neben, G				Uenzelmann-Neben, Gabriele			Variations in ice-sheet dynamics along the Amundsen Sea and Bellingshausen Sea West Antarctic Ice Sheet margin	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN			English	Article							PINE ISLAND BAY; OUTER CONTINENTAL-SHELF; CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; DEBRIS FLOW DEPOSITS; TROUGH-MOUTH FAN; PACIFIC MARGIN; SEDIMENTARY PROCESSES; TECTONIC EVOLUTION; EMBAYMENT SHELF; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Modern global warming and its possible contribution to sea-level rise and flooding of low-lying coastal areas have moved both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets into the focus of public and scientific interest. Research has concentrated on reconstructing the dynamics of the ice sheets in order to understand their vulnerability to a changing climate by collecting multidisciplinary data and conducting numerical simulations. Synchronous changes in ice-sheet extent along its margin are assumed by a number of authors. The study presented here analyzes the regional and chronological appearance, distribution, and modification of sedimentary features and structures identified at the slope and rise off the West Antarctic Ice Sheet margin to test whether this assumption is correct. In general, a synchronous West Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamic is not supported by the analysis presented here; instead, this study documents a west-east trend with an early Miocene ice advance in the Amundsen Sea, while a glacial advance in the Bellingshausen Sea occurred only post-15 Ma. For the Bellingshausen Sea, stronger variability in sediment flux is observed, indicating stronger variability in ice extent. The dominance of downslope or along-slope sediment transport shows opposing trends between the two seas, which also reflects the advance/retreat of the local ice sheet and thus an increase/decrease in sediment input from the continent and a modification in intensity and relocation of the bottom current pathways. A possible reason for this west-east trend in ice-sheet dynamics may be the local geology (hinterland and basal), basal geomorphology, and the geometry of the local ice sheets.

Over the last 4 decades, research on natural hazards has become increasingly advanced and in-depth. With the continued development of science and technology and the complex changes in the environment, reviewing research fields and exploring current research hot spots and trends have become a key issue. In this study, 25,969 publications from the Web of Science were selected and statistically analyzed using bibliometrics to extract information on authors, institutions, countries/regions, journals, disciplines, keywords, and abstracts. Research hot spots were identified by machine learning. The results showed that (1) the number and growth rate of publications related to natural hazards are continuously increasing; (2) the author Biswajeet Pradhan, the institution of Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country of US, and the journal Natural Hazards are the most prolific in each aspect, respectively, and Geosciences Multidisciplinary is the most important subject; (3) keyword analysis showed that earthquakes, landslides, and floods are the core of natural hazards research, and climate change, disaster prevention and mitigation, and emergency management have received more and more attention in recent years; and (4) among the topics obtained from latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models, the most frequent topics are "Mechanism and simulation" and "Risk Assessment," and "Drought and water hazards" and "Machine learning" are developing rapidly.

Extreme Rainfall Indices in Southern Levant and Related Large-Scale Atmospheric Circulation Patterns: A Spatial and Temporal Analysis	WATER			English	Article						extreme rainfall indices; Levant region; trend analysis; teleconnection indices	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MEDITERRANEAN OSCILLATION; DAILY PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; DATA SET; TRENDS; VARIABILITY; EVENTS; PROJECTION; IMPACT	This study aims to provide a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of the annual and seasonal extreme rainfall indices over the southern Levant from 1970 to 2020. For this, temporal and spatial trends of 15 climate extreme indices based on daily precipitation at 66 stations distributed across Israel and Palestine territories were annually and seasonally analyzed through the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope estimator. The annual averages for frequency-based extreme indices exhibited decreasing trends, significantly for the Consecutive Dry Days. In contrast, the percentiles- and intensity-based extreme indices showed increasing trends, significant for extremely wet days, Max 1- and 3-day precipitation amount indices. The study area had expanding periods of extreme dry spells for spring and correspondingly shortening extreme wet spells for spring, winter and the combined winter-spring. Moreover, most of spring indices showed negative trends. Conversely, most winter indices displayed positive trends. Regarding the influence of large-scale circulation patterns, the North Sea Caspian pattern, the Western Mediterranean Oscillation, and ENSO were the primary regulators of the winter, spring, and autumn extreme indices, respectively. These findings contribute to a better understanding of extreme rainfall variability in the Levant region and could be utilized in the management of water resources, drought monitoring, and flood control.

J	Doeffinger, T; Rubinyi, S				Doeffinger, Tess; Rubinyi, Steven			Secondary benefits of urban flood protection	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Flood protection; Secondary benefits; Co-benefits; Triple dividend of resilience; Cost-benefit analysis		The combined effects of urbanization and climate change put a large portion of the population at risk from pluvial, fluvial, and coastal flooding. To continue to strive for sustainable development, cities will need to protect flood-prone areas, but this will require significant investments in both green and grey infrastructure solutions. Yet, a significant financing gap will need to be bridged to increase cities' resilience. The decision as to which flood protection intervention to finance typically includes an analysis of primary costs (construction) and benefits (averted damages). However, an array of potential secondary benefits occur with increased flood protection that are often not assessed, such as increased well-being and ecosystem health. This review provides a timely over-view of the secondary benefits of urban flood protection, a brief analysis of whether they have been included in cost-benefit analyses for investments in urban flood protection projects, and a discussion of methodological concerns. Of the twenty projects reviewed, fourteen make mention of secondary benefits, yet only four quantify them in their analysis. Advances in evaluation methodologies may reduce quantification challenges, but a move away from traditional cost-benefit analysis may be necessary to incorporate a full range of secondary benefits. Ultimately, we argue that a more thorough understanding of the secondary benefits of urban flood protection and their quantification methods could unlock additional financing for flood protection infrastructure, especially in urban centers of developing countries.

Forecasting the river hydrodynamic changes is critical for flood management under climate change and intensified human activities. However, efficient and accurate river modeling is challenging, especially with complex lake boundary conditions and uncontrolled downstream boundary conditions. Here, we proposed a coupled framework by taking the advantages of interpretability of physical hydrodynamic modeling and the adaptability of machine learning. Specifically, we coupled the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a 1-D HydroDynamic model (GRU-HD) and applied it to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest river in China. We show that the GRU-HD model could quickly and accurately simulate the water levels, streamflow, and water exchange rates between the Yangtze River and two important lakes (Poyang and Dongting), with most of the Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE $\mathrm{K}\mathrm{G}\mathrm{E}$) above 0.90. Using machine learning-based predicted water levels, instead of the rating curve approach, as the downstream boundary conditions could improve the accuracy of modeling the downstream water levels of the lake-connected river system. The GRU-HD model is dedicated to the synergy of physical modeling and machine learning, providing a powerful avenue for modeling rivers with complex boundary conditions.

This study aims to document the long-term impacts of the spring floods of 2019 in Quebec by (1) describing the population affected by the floods; (2) assessing the impacts on the respiratory system according to levels of exposure; and (3) determining the association between stressors and respiratory health. Methods: A population health survey was carried out across the six most affected regions 8-10 months post-floods. Data were collected on self-reported otolaryngology (ENT) and respiratory symptoms, along with primary and secondary stressors. Three levels of exposure were examined: flooded, disrupted and unaffected. Results: One in ten respondents declared being flooded and 31.4% being disrupted by the floods. Flooded and disrupted participants reported significantly more ENT symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.18; 95% CI: 2.45-4.14; aOR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.45-2.14) and respiratory symptoms (aOR: 3.41; 95% CI: 2.45-4.75; aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.10-1.91) than the unaffected participants. All primary stressors and certain secondary stressors assessed were significantly associated with both ENT and respiratory symptoms, but no "dose-response" gradient could be observed. Conclusion: This study highlights the long-term adverse effects of flood exposure on respiratory health.

This study explores how the research direction of rice under drought, waterlogging or both stresses has evolved over the past three decades, based on bibliometric analysis using Vosviewer 1.6.15 and HistCite Pro. Data were collected from the academic database of Web of Science. The results showed that 12 journals had a high number of publications and highly local citations. Meanwhile, the three journals of Field Crops Research, Journal of Experimental Botany and Plant Physiology could be the most influential leaders in this field. The author Arvind Kumar had the highest contribution to the output of articles, and Lizhong Xiong had a greater impact on the field. China, and Chinese institutions, were dominant in terms of the number of articles, but Japan, Germany, UK and institutions in USA and Japan had a higher quality of publications on average. Scholars are concerned with using transgenic methods for improving rice productivity with increasing abiotic stress tolerance; the research topics of rice cultivars, irrigation, water-use efficiency and soil fertility may be gradually shifting from a single theme to intertwining with the themes of genomics and abiotic/biotic resistance with climate change in the future.

Coastal wetland ecosystems are sensitive to the potential changes and impacts resulting from a rise in sea level. In the coastal region of the Gulf of Mexico, freshwater swamps are wetlands located further inland than mangroves, and while influenced by the tides, maintain freshwater conditions. Due to their location, the rise in sea level could increase the levels of flooding and salinity in these ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate, under greenhouse conditions, the effect of nine flood and salinity treatments on the survival, growth, and increase in the biomass of Annona glabra (pond apple) seedlings (average height: 18.6 +/- 1.61 cm). The treatments combined two factors: water level (Saturation, Flood, Flood-Drought) and salinity (0, 5 and 15 parts per thousand). Seedling survival was greater under freshwater conditions. Increases in height and diameter, and leaf and biomass gain, were more significant under saturation and freshwater conditions. Based on our results, we conclude increased flood levels and salinity will negatively affect the natural establishment of A. glabra seedlings in freshwater swamps under a scenario of rising sea level.

J	Salata, S; Arslan, B				Salata, Stefano; Arslan, Bertan			Designing with Ecosystem Modelling: The Sponge District Application in Izmir, Turkey	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood management; climate vulnerability; risk mitigation; adaptation; urban planning; sponge districts	URBAN COMPACTNESS; SOIL PROTECTION; LAND; RESILIENCE; SERVICES; ENVIRONMENT; SUPPORT; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT	Climate change is threatening coastal cities affected by multiple hazards worldwide. Due to the increase in extreme weather events and the low capacity of cities to adapt to these odds, losses, exposure, and fatalities arise with the occurred events. Besides, traditional hazard mapping and risk planning techniques often fall behind when facing a climate crisis since extreme changes in quantity, frequency, and distribution of meteorological phenomena are observed. Specific and localized flood vulnerability mitigation strategies need to be developed, particularly for settlements on coastal and sloppy areas with a high risk of stream accumulation during rainfall days. This paper uses the urban flood risk mitigation of Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) generated within the Natural Capital Project to determine Izmir's cloudburst vulnerability level. The city has experienced several cloudbursts in the last couple of months which inundated densely populated areas. The soil's hydrologic conductibility and the land use/land cover (LULC) map were required as main inputs. The LULC map was produced on the basis of surface imperviousness. The model calculates the run-off volume and how much is retained by soil and vegetation. Outputs were used to concretely apply the sponge district concept while designing performance-based ecosystem solutions. In the light of the findings, the new performance-based design demonstrated how digital ecosystem modelling could support the urban design decision-making process.

Estimating the flood discharge as a result of flood frequency analysis is very substantial to make necessary preparations for possible floods. Data covering 36 years were collected from different stream gauging stations (SGS No: D17A016 and EIEI 1731) in Eastern Mediterranean Basin. With these data, flood discharge values were computed for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 years. Normal, Log-Normal, Gumbel, Pearson Type III and Log-Pearson Type III statistical distribution methods were used. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were performed to determine which distribution fitted the flood discharge the best. The study showed that the highest flood discharge among the probability distributions for both SGSs came from the Log-Normal distribution, and the lowest discharge was calculated with the Normal distribution. The K-S tests showed that all probability distributions conformed to the 20% significance level. For SGS D17A016, the flood values calculated with Log-Normal distribution were compatible with a 90% confidence interval according to the Chi-square test. Flood values obtained with the other distributions were found within the 10% significance level. In the Chi-square test for SGS EIEI-1731, all probability distributions fell within a 10% significance.

In the first stage of the study, an inventory of the areas affected by floods was made in the study area, and a number of 205 flood points were identified. Further, 12 flood predictors were selected to be used for final susceptibility mapping. The six models' training was performed by using 70% of the total flood points that have been associated with the values of flood predictors. The highest accuracy (0.973) was obtained by the RF model, while J48 had the lowest performance (0.825). Besides, by classifying flood predictors' values in flood and non-flood pixels, the six flood susceptibility maps were made. High and very high flood susceptibility values cover between 17.71% (MLP) and 27.93% (ANFIS) of the study area. The validation of the results, performed using the ROC Curve, shows that the most accurate flood susceptibility values are also assigned to the RF model (AUC = 0.996).

Nature Based Solutions are increasingly recognised as a natural insurance against flood risks in vulnerable areas. This requires collaboration at landscape scale between providers and beneficiaries of flood control. In particular, mechanisms to incentivise owners of land could potentially offer cost-effective ways to reduce damage to urban infrastructure. We conduct a choice experiment among farmers located in the vicinity of a river to assess their willingness to accept a contract that would allow a local Danish municipality to periodically flood farmland to reduce urban flood risks. Results indicate that farmers on average are hesitant about entering into abatement contracts, especially if they have prior experience of crop losses due to extreme weather events. If they were to agree on a contract they would prefer a separate compensation for lost crops; a collective negotiation and higher rather than lower yearly payments. Surprisingly, data did not show a significant preference for or against a requirement to grow flood resistant crops. The results suggest that a contract with a separate damage compensation and based on individual negotiation would on average require an annual payment of 290Euro/ha for farmers with no prior experience of crop losses and 469Euro/ha for farmers who have experienced crop losses.

Salt marsh elevation and responses to future sea-level rise in the Knysna Estuary, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Article						coastal squeeze; Rod Surface Elevation Table; SLAMM; Spartina maritima; South Africa	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL LANDSCAPES; VULNERABILITY; WETLANDS; MODEL; CONSERVATION; MIGRATION; IMPACTS; EROSION; FLOODS	Sea-level rise is a significant threat to salt marshes. However, these habitats can respond by increasing their relative elevation, or by migrating into adjacent areas. Here we provide the first report on surface elevation change for salt marsh at the Knysna Estuary, South Africa, and predict the responses of these habitats to sea-level rise using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Recent (2018) surface elevation measurements at lower intertidal salt marsh sites were compared with those from 2009-2011. The long-term (1960-2017) relative sea-level rise (RSLR) was estimated as 2.19 mm y-1 and only two of the seven sites assessed are keeping pace with this RSLR. The SLAMM, which was applied to a focus area near Thesen's Island, predicted up to 40% loss of upper intertidal salt marsh by 2100, because development in the adjacent area prevents habitat migration. Currently, salt marsh habitats cover a total of 667 ha, and artificial structures are present along 20.7 km of the perimeter. Protecting areas for salt marsh migration should be a conservation priority, because this estuary supports the third largest area of intertidal salt marsh in the country. Monitoring the responses of coastal wetlands should be prioritised so that natural capital contributes towards future resilience.	[Raw, J. L.; Riddin, T.; Wasserman, J.; Lehman, T. W. K.; Adams, J.

Agriculture has substantially altered the biogeochemical silica cycle via the harvest of the grain and straw of silica-rich crops. China is a developing agricultural country that experiences frequent natural disasters. Although the spatiotemporal changes in the occurrence of natural disasters are well known for individual disaster events, the study of the effects of multiple disasters on cereal crop productivity and the resultant silica harvest is still relatively new. To make the connection between natural disasters and the silica biogeochemical cycle, we compiled a dataset of natural disasters and crop production and silicon contents in cereal crops (rice, wheat, and maize) in China using province-level data from 1988 to 2016. Our results show that the area affected by natural disasters declined significantly after 2000, and changes in the area affected by natural disasters varied at the province level. From 1988 to 2016, the total silica losses from grain and straw harvests due to natural disasters were 7.14 and 53.10 million tons, respectively. Half of the silica loss in more than half of the provinces was caused by drought. Our study suggests that drought prevention will increase the size of the silica sink and thereby increase the size of the carbon sink in China's agriculture.

Green infrastructure has gained increasing attention as one of the strategies for adaptation to mega-floods because it can concurrently enhance regional biodiversity and ecosystem services. Previous studies have assessed the efficacy of flood-control infrastructure in protecting biodiversity in urban areas. However, whether such infrastructure enhances biodiversity in other environments remains largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the function of flood-control basins constructed for flood risk management as summer habitat for wetland species in agricultural landscapes. We compared the species assemblages of four different taxa (fishes, aquatic insects, birds, and plants) among four water body types (flood-control basins, channelized watercourses, drainage pumping stations, and remnant ponds). We found that the flood-control basins had comparable or higher species richness and abundance of most taxa than the other water body types. We also found that the species compositions in the flood-control basins were characterized by pioneer species, which prefer shallow water or can adapt to fluctuations in water levels (e.g., herbivorous insects, shorebirds, and hygrophytes). These findings suggest that flood-control basins can provide summer habitat for wetland species, especially for species that inhabit environments with hydrological variation, and utilizing flood-control basins as green infrastructure is a reasonable option for conserving regional biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

In this work we analyse the uncertainty introduced in the assessment associated to the method to assign the probability of occurrence to coastal flood hazards. To this end we have compared the use of two general methods, the response and the event approaches. Different procedures are used to characterise coastal inundation hazards depending on the analysis scale and data availability. Thus, a range of possibilities has been analysed, from simple estimators such as run-up to modelled flood-prone areas. The analysis has been performed for all wave and water level conditions around the Spanish coast. The results show that the differences between the methods are location-dependent, and thus, determined by the exposure to wave and water level conditions. When using the event approach, the run-up or total water level (with good correlation between waves and surge) distributions reasonably approximate those of the response approach with low associated uncertainty. When the assessment aims to output overtopping discharges or inundation maps, observed differences suggest that the event approach would produce misleading conclusions in inundation-related coastal management and decision-making.

In this work, the openTELEMAC-MASCARET modelling system was selected to represent the dynamics of the Minho estuary, a very shallow estuary located at the Northwestern Iberian Peninsula coast. Calibration and validation results confirm the accuracy of the numerical tool, with small root mean square errors, close to null bias and the close to unit correlation and skill coefficients obtained for water level and currents velocity at several estuarine locations. The obtained results depict a tide dominated estuary with a delay in the tide phase and a marked asymmetry in the tide curve that increases upriver. Additionally, an upstream diminution of M-2 and an upstream augmentation of M-4 was observed, classifying this estuary as flood-dominated. The represented current patterns show that variations in the intensities of the main driving forces alter the behaviour of the hydrodynamical patterns within the estuary, with a clear dependence on bathymetric and topographic characteristics. During flood events, larger estuarine regions become submerged due to the low margins and the wetland characteristics, highlighting the need for accurate numerical models that can be used as a decision-making support tool for effective and integrated estuarine management.

In this study, we developed a paradigm to assess flood economic vulnerability and risk at the urban mesoscale, focusing on urban land use. A hydrological simulation was used to evaluate flood hazards through inundation analyses, and a hazard-vulnerability matrix was applied to assess flood risk, enhancing the economic vulnerability assessment by quantifying the differing economic value and flood losses associated with different land types. The case study of Wangchengpo, Changsha, China, found average total economic losses of 126.94 USD/ m2, with the highest risk in the settlement core. Residential areas had the highest flood hazard, vulnerability, and losses (61.10% of the total loss); transportation areas accounted for 27.87% of the total economic losses due to their high flooding depth. Despite low inundation, industrial land showed greater economic vulnerability due to higher overall economic value (10.52% of the total). Our findings highlight the influence of land types and industry differences on flood vulnerability and the effectiveness of land-use inclusion in urban-mesoscale analyses of spatial flood characteristics. We identify critical areas with hazard and economic vulnerability for urban land and disaster prevention management and planning, helping to offer targeted flood control strategies to enhance urban resilience.

Using sub-daily precipitation for grid-based hydrological modelling across Great Britain: Assessing model performance and comparing flood impacts under climate change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Hydrology; Precipitation; Rainfall; Rainfall-runoff model; UKCP18	SOIL-MOISTURE; RIVER FLOW; RESOLUTION; RAINFALL; UK; DROUGHTS; DATASET; RUNOFF	Study region: Great Britain. Study focus: National-scale grid-based hydrological models are usually run at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, but driving data are often not available at the required resolutions. Here, a recent observation-based hourly 1 km gridded precipitation dataset is applied with a 1 km hydrological model to simulate daily mean river flows. Performance is compared to use of equallydisaggregated and profile-disaggregated daily data, for a large number of catchments. Hourly and daily precipitation from a high-resolution convection-permitting climate model (CPM) are then used to drive the hydrological model for baseline (1980-2000) and future (2060-2080) periods, to investigate differences in potential peak flow changes. New hydrological insights: On average, use of observation-based hourly data provides a clear improvement over equally-disaggregated daily data for high flows and peak flow bias, a small improvement for average flows and mean flow bias, but little difference for low flows. Performance in faster-responding catchments typically improves more; performance in some catchments degrades. Use of profile-disaggregated daily data provides the small mean flow bias improvement and some peak flow bias improvement, but other factors degrade. On average, future changes in peak flows from hourly CPM precipitation are only slightly larger than from equally-disaggregated daily data. Future work will look at simulation of hourly mean flows.

Pakistan, which is located on the northern edge of the Indian monsoon, is highly vulnerable to heavy rainfall and has witnessed several debilitating floods exacerbated by global warming in recent years. However, the mechanisms for the frequent Pakistan floods are yet not fully understood. Here, we show that the Middle East is undergoing an increase in land heating during spring, which is responsible for 46% of the intensified rainfall over Pakistan and northwestern India during 1979-2022. This springtime land warming causes a decline in sea level pressure (SLP), which strengthens the meridional SLP gradient between the Middle East and the southern Arabian Sea and drives the changes of low-level jet (LLJ) subsequently. The impact persists into summer and results in a northward shift of the monsoonal LLJ, accompanied by strong positive vorticity in the atmosphere and enhanced moisture supply to Pakistan. Consequently, the transition region between the summer monsoon in South Asia and the desert climate in West Asia is shifted northwestward, posing significantly enhanced risk of floods over Pakistan and northwestern India. In recent decades, land warming over the Middle East and a northward shift of the low-level jet in the atmosphere have led to unprecedented summer monsoon rainfall increase over Pakistan and northwestern India, areas that used to be arid to semi-arid.

Enhancing megacities' resilience to flood hazard through peri-urban nature-based solutions: Evidence from Mexico City	CITIES			English	Article						Nature-based solutions; Urban floods; Peri-urban areas; Water flow regulating ecosystem service; Mexico City; Spatial analysis	SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND; MAPPING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; INSURANCE VALUE; MANAGEMENT	Floods are one of the most frequent natural hazards in almost every country, with climate change exacerbating their frequency and intensity. Nature-based solutions (NbS) can be a cost-effective way to make human settlements more resilient to flooding. However, decision-makers need reliable information on which to base NbS policy and funding. This research estimates the potential of peri-urban NbS to regulate water flow and the benefits downstream through the development of supply and demand indicators for the context of complex megacities. In our Mexico City case study the supply indicator is the runoff coefficient, which is spatially estimated across peri-urban areas, and the economic value is estimated using replacement cost (grey infrastructure). The demand indicator identifies floodprone areas based on spatially explicit ponding events and avoided costs of insurance flood claims data and estimates with parametric cost functions. The supply indicator provides straightforward information for decisionmakers to spatially target conservation in peri-urban areas where runoff coefficients are high combined with flood-prone areas, while the lowest coefficients reinforce the importance of policies for protected areas. In combination with demand indicator information, we find NbS in peri-urban upstream catchments is cost-effective compared to avoidable flood-related costs and alternative investments in grey infrastructure.

The results highlight the unique nature of the anthropogeniccarbonates and reveal novel insights into the importance of secondaryminerals in dictating the fate of CO2 in basalt reservoirs. Carbon-negative strategies such as geologic carbon sequestrationin continental flood basalts offers a promising route to the removalof greenhouse gases, such as CO2, via safe and permanentstorage as stable carbonates. This potential has been successfullydemonstrated at a field scale at the Wallula Basalt Carbon StoragePilot Project where supercritical CO2 was injected intothe Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). Here, we analyze recoveredpost-injection sidewall core cross-sections containing carbonate nodulesusing & mu;-XRF chemical mapping techniques that revealed compositionalzonation within the nodules. The unique nature of the subsurface anthropogeniccarbonates is highlighted by the near absence of Mg in an ankerite-likecomposition. Furthermore, a comparison between pre- and post-injectionsidewall cores along with an in-depth chemical mapping of basalt porelining cements provides a better understanding into the source andfate of critical cationic species involved in the precipitation ofcarbon mineralization products. Collectively, these results providecrucial insights into carbonate growth mechanisms under a time-dependentpore fluid composition. As such, these findings will enable parameterizationof predictive models for future CO2 sequestration effortsin reactive reservoirs around the world.	[Miller, Quin R. S.; Cao, Ruoshi; Schaef, H.

Floods are often considered a necessity by the conser-vation community in semi-arid regions since they recharge important aquifers and wetlands, which are critical areas for biodiversity conservation. However, floods threaten tourism infrastructure, given their destructive nature. This study maps and evaluates flooding hotspots in 19 South African national parks and assesses flood occurrence and their impact on tourism. A mixed methods approach was adopted, utilising primary data collected from interviews, surveys, field observations and secondary data sources. The study found that most flood hotspots are located in the Kruger National Park, with more than nine hotspots in Mapungubwe National Park, and almost all flooding events are linked to extreme weather events. Flooding incidents are increasing in these parks, devastatingly impacting tourism infrastructures, such as camps, roads, bridges and heritage and picnic sites. Other parks concerned about flooding include the Wilderness section of the Garden Route, Bontebok National Park and isolated events in some parts of the Kgalagadi, Augrabies and Mokala National Parks. The most affected parks are within the pathway of tropical cyclones. The study recommends engineering, nature-based solutions and the development of early warning systems to manage these flood risks in national parks.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of environmental factors in anthropized and conserved areas on the endoparasite community structure in fish at different trophic levels, in addition to verifying that some species of Digenea are indicators of conserved environments.MethodsThe study was carried out in the Upper Jurua River region, Western Amazon, Brazil. Six sampling sites were selected in this region and grouped in conserved and degraded environments. Fish were caught from periods of drought and flood, using passive and active sampling methods. Fish collected were measured, weighed, necropsied and the parasites found were counted, fixed, and subjected to morphological analysis. Physical and chemical variables and environmental characteristics were measured in all sites.ResultsThe present study demonstrated that environmental variables in a floodplain system can influence the richness, diversity, composition and abundance of endoparasites in hosts at different trophic levels. In addition, anthropized environments may favor the abundance of some generalist parasites and present a more homogeneous biota between seasonal periods compared to conserved environments.ConclusionStudy contributed with information supporting the importance of conservation of aquatic environments, and demonstrated that fish parasites can be excellent indicators of environments.

This study investigated the influence of urban land cover change on spatiotemporal changes in flood peak discharge and flood volume within a rapidly urbanizing catchment located in Beijing, China. We used Landsat satellite data ranging from 1986 to 2017 to monitor and quantify urban growth. Moreover, the Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) coupled with meteorological data was utilized to examine the impact of urban growth on hydrological responses. The results revealed that major changes in land use/cover (LULC) were detected in the urban landscape, which increased from 25.22% to 65.48% of the total catchment area, while agricultural land decreased from 64.85% to 25.28% during 1986-2017. The flood peak discharge and flood volume average of the three rainstorms events reached 7.02% and 11.93%, respectively. Furthermore, the changes in flood peak discharge and flood volume were more obvious at the sub-catchment scale.

We present a new spatial dataset of road-river structures attributed as culverts, bridges, or fords, and use this along with data on gradient and stream order to estimate structure sensitivity and exposure in and out of special areas of conservation (SAC) and built-up areas to determine vulnerability to damage across river catchments in Wales, UK. We then assess hazard of flooding likelihood at the most vulnerable structures to determine those posing high risk of impact on roads and river-obligate species (fishes and mussels) whose persistence depends on aquatic habitat connectivity. Over 5% (624/11,680) of structures are high vulnerability and located where flooding hazard is highest, posing high risk of impact to roads and river-obligate species. We assess reliability of our approach through an on-ground survey in a river catchment supporting an SAC and more than 40% (n = 255) of high-risk structures, and show that of the subset surveyed > 50% had obvious physical degradation, streambank erosion, and scouring. Our findings help us to better understand which structures pose high-risk of impact to river-obligate species and humans with increased flooding likelihood.

However, they are susceptible to clogging causing premature degradation. As part of the Dutch Delta Plan, Dutch municipalities were encouraged to put infiltrating pavements into practice. Disappointing experiences made a significant number of municipalities decide, however, to stop further implementation. A need existed to better understand how infiltrating pavements function in practice. Through 81 full-scale infiltration tests, we investigated the performance of infiltrating pavements in practice. Most pavements function well above Dutch and international standards. However, variation was found to be high. Infiltration rates decrease over time. Age alone, however, is not a sufficient explanatory factor. Other factors, such as environmental or system characteristics, are of influence here. Maintenance can play a major role in preserving/improving the performance of infiltrating pavements in practice. While our results provide the first indication of the functioning of infiltrating pavement in practice, only with multi-year measurements following a strict monitoring protocol can the longer-term effects of environmental factors and maintenance actually be determined, providing the basis for the development of an optimal maintenance schedule and associated cost-benefit assessments to the added value of this type of climate adaptation.

The automatic processing scheme of S1 data was set up for the mapping of open-water flooding (OWF) and flooding under vegetation (FUV). The extremely mild winter of 2019/2020 resulted in several large floods at floodplains that were detected from S1 imagery with a maximal OWF extent up to 5000 ha and maximal FUV extent up to 4500 ha. A significant correlation (r(2) > 0.6) between the OWF extent and the closest gauge data was obtained for inland riverbank floodplains. The outcome enabled us to define the water level at which the water exceeds the shoreline and flooding starts. However, for a coastal river delta floodplain, a lower correlation (r(2) < 0.34) with gauge data was obtained, and the excess of river coastline could not be related to a certain water level. At inland riverbank floodplains, the extent of FUV was three times larger compared to that of OWF. The correlation between the water level and FUV was <0.51, indicating that the river water level at these test sites can be used as a proxy for forest floods. Relating conventional gauge data to S1 time series data contributes to flood risk mitigation.

This threat has historically been managed through sewers and combined sewer overflows; however, it is now well recognised that, alone, these legacy systems are insufficient to manage the growing pressures from climate change, population growth and urbanisation. This realisation has led to research and practice developing a broad range of new technologies to enhance the coping capacities of existing sewer systems through capturing and attenuating or reusing surface water across catchments using sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). However, despite technical understanding, industry champions and significant best practice, SuDS remain underutilised, particularly at a synergistic catchment scale where they can be most effective. In this paper we respond to this challenge by developing preliminary screening tools to enhance the visibility of SuDS among the multidisciplinary decision-makers responsible for directing strategic surface water management. We achieve this through upscaling a regional decision support model and demonstrating implementation across a case study in South West England. We find that it is possible to use easily accessible and open-source data to provide initial indications of SuDS opportunities and that this early visibility in the decision-making process can be used to support the consideration of novel and effective surface water management strategies.

The goal of this study was to develop a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-Best Worst Method (BWM) based ecomentalist land suitability model to identify optimal locations for wind farms, and to evaluate existing planning preferences. Nine assessment criteria and nineteen constraints were used, and BWM was implemented to reckon the criteria weights. The wind velocity was designated to be the most outstanding assessment criterion, followed by land cover/use, proximity to specific conservation zones, proximity to urban settlements, slope, proximity to wetlands and important bird zones, and others. Standardized thematic suitability maps were presented using Weighted Overlay approach in GIS environment. The findings indicate that 40.90% of the study zone is suitable, and 54.39% of available wind turbines coincide with the suitable classes proposed in this study. This indicates that 45.61% of the real planning preferences are made without considering environmental conditions (e.g. visual impact, noise impact, deforestation, habitat damage to flora and fauna, and land fragmentation), land use features, and disaster conditions (e.g. snowslides, landslides, flood zones). This study provides an ecomentalist, conservationist, and sustainable background for siting wind farms.

Socio-economic, demographic and environmental changes (e.g., flooding) pose substantial and shifting barriers to effective freshwater pollution management in Dhaka, with direct implications for population health. We draw on the insights from 25 semi-structured interviews with government, non-government, industry and academic key informants to: (1) examine current levels of engagement and collaboration among key stakeholders in the freshwater pollution management context; (2) assess the subsequent capacity of those actors to adapt to challenging conditions and to improve water pollution management; and (3) consider the opportunities to enhance current institutional arrangements in ways that build linkages among key stakeholders across levels and sectors. Our research highlights a general interest among participants for more collaborative and adaptive processes in freshwater pollution management in Dhaka. However, findings also highlight the pressure water sector actors feel about the time required to make progress on water pollution management challenges, and the concern that collaboration will exacerbate those challenges. Furthermore, our findings show the overlapping jurisdictional claims and mandates in Dhaka that make concerted action difficult, and that ultimately undermine clarity for collaborative and adaptive action.

Here, we use the 2018-2019 landslide inventory data together with various geo-environmental factors and show that the landslide activity in the WG region is amplified by anthropogenic disturbances. We applied a generalized feature selection algorithm and a random forest susceptibility model to demonstrate the major topographic controls of landslides and the risk associated with them in the WG region. Our results show that road cutting and slopes modified to plantations are the strongest environmental variable (50% - 73% within 300 m buffer distance) related to the landslide patterns, whereas short-duration intense precipitation in the high elevated terrain, profile concavity, and stream power contributed to the initiation of landslides. The susceptibility models made for the present, and Global Climate Models (GCM) under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario predicts the vulnerable nature of WG for future climate extremes. Our results highlight the impacts of Anthropocene hazards and sensitivity of the WG ecosystem, and a greater focus therefore should be placed to reduce the vulnerability and increase preparedness for future events.

In Romania, the hydrometric activity for ENERB it is currently composed of 14 representative basins (RB) of which the Trebes-Negel (184 km(2)) was selected as RB for Eastern Carpathian and Subcarpathian transition zone. Located in one of the most affected territories by hydrological hazards, the Trebes-Negel RB reacted as a small-scale flood sensor for the entire region. Using the well-documented discharge and pluviometric database collected at five gauge stations within the study area, we develop the first comparative analysis of historical flood events that occurred in the Trebes-Negel RB post-1990. Five exceptional floods were selected: flood events from July 2 to July 8, 1991; flood events from June 16 to June 22, 1992; flood events from July 11 to July 14, 2005; flood events from July 26 to July 31, 2010; and flood events from June 28 to July 1, 2018. All flood events envisaged were caused by heavy rains, when significant amounts of precipitations were recorded which sometimes exceeded 100 mm/day.

The paper reports on a hydrogeological, chemical (major, minor and trace elements) and isotopic (delta D-H2O, delta O-18-H2O, delta N-15-NO3, delta O-18-NO3, delta B-11, Rn-222) survey of groundwater at the Cumae archaeological site, which is located in the coastal north-western sector of the volcanic district of Phlegraean Fields (southern Italy), where groundwater flooding phenomena occur. Results show the presence of a complex coastal volcanic-sedimentary aquifer system where groundwater quality is influenced mainly by: (i) aquifer lithology and localized ascent of magmatic fluids along buried volcano-tectonic discontinuities, (ii) mixing of groundwater, deep mineralized fluids and seawater during groundwater pumping, and (iii) nitrate contamination >50 mg/L from non-point agricultural sources. Moreover, delta D and delta O-18 point toward fast recharge from seasonal precipitations, while the isotopic ratios of N and O in nitrate reveal the contribution of mineral and organic fertilizers as well as leakage from septic tanks. Results can assist the local archaeological authority for the safeguarding and management of the archaeological heritage of the Cumae site.

Changes in Hydrology of the Ganges Delta of Bangladesh and Corresponding Impacts on Water Resources	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						surface water hydrology; climate variability and change; flood; rivers; streams; drought; land use; land cover change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; BRAHMAPUTRA; REGIME; FLOW; MANAGEMENT; DROUGHT; CURVES; MODEL	The Ganges Delta in Bangladesh is an example of water-related catastrophes in a major rural river basin where limitations in quantity, quality, and timing of available water are producing disastrous conditions. Water availability limitations are modifying the hydrologic characteristics especially when water allocation is controlled from the upstream Farakka Barrage. This study presents the changes and consequences in the hydrologic regime due to climate- and human-induced stresses. Flow duration curves (FDCs), rainfall elasticity, and temperature sensitivity were used to assess the pre- and post-barrage water flow patterns. Hydrologic and climate indices were computed to provide insight on hydro-climatic variability and trend. Significant increases in temperature, evapotranspiration, hot days, heating, and cooling degree days indicate the region is heading toward a warmer climate. Moreover, increase in high-intensity rainfall of short duration is making the region prone to extreme floods. FDCs depict a large reduction in river flows between pre- and post-barrage periods, resulting in lower water storage capacity. The reduction in freshwater flow increased the extent and intensity of salinity intrusion. This freshwater scarcity is reducing livelihood options considerably and indirectly forcing population migration from the delta region. Understanding the causes and directions of hydrologic changes is essential to formulate improve water resources management in the region.

EVALUATION OF SPATIOTEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PRECIPITATION EXTREMES VARIATIONS IN AMUR RIVER BASIN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						precipitation extremes trend analysis wavelet analysis abrupt change Amur River basin	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUMMER MONSOON; TRENDS; EVENTS; CHINA; PROJECTIONS; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; RAINFALL; FLOOD	Between 25th July and 19th August 2013, Amur River basin received some of its most extreme precipitation on record. The floods caused by the heavy rain brought affected Amur River and its 4 major tributaries. Hailun and Hailar stations break daily maximum precipitation record with 153.6 mm in 30th July, and 85.8 mm in 27th July, respectively. Based on daily precipitation observations at 25 stations from 1954 to 2014, the trends, periodicities and abrupt changes of five extreme precipitation indices in Amur River basin were investigated to the Spatiotemporal Characteristics of the extreme precipitation. Areaaveraged annual total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT), maximum 1 -day precipitation amount (Rxlday), maximum 5 -day precipitation amount (Rx5day), very wet days (R95) and extremely wet days (R99) had non-significant trends. By wavelet analysis for annual PRCPTOT, Rxlday, Rxlday, R95 and R99 series, the real part wavelet phase of main periods were mostly located at positive peaks in 2013, which were corroborated by abrupt change analysis. Multi -cycle superimposition of main periods is possibly the main cause for extreme precipitation in 2013. The record -breaking daily precipitation data improve 100 -year recurrence interval (111.47 mm) to 130.61 mm in Hailun and raise 100 -year recurrence interval from 78.95 mm to 87.91 mm in Hailar.

An exploratory bibliometric analysis of risk, resilience, and sustainability management of transport infrastructure systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Risk management; Transport infrastructure systems; Resilience; Sustainability; Robustness; Bridge networks; Flood risk; Climate change; Decision-making; Bibliometric analysis; Science mapping	SEISMIC RISK; NETWORKS; RECOVERY; FRAMEWORK	Transport infrastructure systems (TIS) are key enablers of economic development and welfare. However, such infrastructures are exposed to natural and anthropogenic hazards that have caused structural failures, traffic disruptions, injuries and fatalities, and damages to the environment. These past events have underscored the need for more resilient transportation systems. However, reducing risks and achieving more resilient infrastructure systems may result in greater resource consumption and environmental impacts, demanding the consideration of sustainability requirements in the management of TIS. Therefore, this paper conducts an exploratory study to map the current knowledge in the domain of risk, resilience, and sustainability management of TIS. As a first step, the system identification of TIS in the context of their management is conducted for the purpose of providing the basis for searching for relevant information. This step sets the baseline for conducting a bibliometric analysis of 16,395 scientific works extracted from the Scopus database between 1990 and 2022. Two quantitative bibliometric techniques are used, namely term co-occurrence and bibliographic coupling. The former technique allows to distinguish the different disciplinary contributions and to identify research gaps. The latter technique facilitates the identification of the main contributors (authors and countries) and the relatedness of research communities. The bibliometric analysis performed provides the basis for future research and development to improve the management of TIS and highlights the potential for transferring knowledge from other research domains.

This issue has motivated former analysis based on satellite imagery, revealing a decreasing trend in global burned areas. However, few studies have addressed burn severity trends, rarely relating them to climate variables, and none of them at the global scale. Within this context, we characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of burned area and severity by biomes and continents and we analyzed their relationships with climate over 17 years. African flooded and non-flooded grasslands and savannas were the most fire-prone biomes on Earth, whereas taiga and tundra exhibited the highest burn severity. Our temporal analysis updated the evidence of a decreasing trend in the global burned area (-1.50% year(-1); p < 0.01) and revealed increases in the fraction of burned area affected by high severity (0.95% year(-1); p < 0.05). Likewise, the regions with significant increases in mean burn severity, and burned areas at high severity outnumbered those with significant decreases. Among them, increases in severely burned areas in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of South America and tropical moist broadleaf forests of Australia were particularly intense. Although the spatial patterns of burned area and severity are clearly driven by climate, we did not find climate warming to increase burned area and burn severity over time, suggesting other factors as the primary drivers of current shifts in fire regimes at the planetary scale.

Many simulation models have been proposed and used for urban planning and management. Still, there are a few modeling options available for the purpose of evaluating the effects of various stormwater control measures (SCM), including LID (low-impact development) controls (green roof, rain garden, porous pavement, rainwater harvesting), upland off-line controls (sedimentation, filtration, retention-irrigation) and online controls (detention, wet pond). We explored the utility and potential of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as a modeling tool for urban stormwater planning and management. This study demonstrates how the hydrologic modeling strategies of SWAT and recent enhancements could help to develop efficient measures for solving urban stormwater issues. The case studies presented in this paper focus on urban watersheds in the City of Austin (COA), TX, where rapid urbanization and population growth have put pressure on the urban stormwater system. Using the enhanced SWAT, COA developed a framework to assess the impacts on erosion, flooding, and aquatic life due to changes in runoff characteristics associated with land use changes. Five catchments in Austin were modeled to test the validity of the SWAT enhancements and the analytical framework.

This bibliometric review examined the research trends and hot topics related to NBS for urban stormwater management. The study utilized a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze 176 articles from the Web of Science database, covering the period from 2016 to 2022. Results showed that NBS is a widely researched topic with a growing trend in publications in recent years, led by the United States, China, and several European countries. The majority of NBS articles were research papers (82%) with a focus on environmental performance rather than social and economic dimensions. Quantitative methods were more frequently used in research articles, particularly statistical analysis/modeling. Interviews and discussions were the most common qualitative method used. The review identified the most relevant countries, affiliations, authors, and journals in the field. Furthermore, hot topics in NBS research were highlighted, including ecosystem services, climate change, and sustainability. The study also emphasized that future research perspective should focus on interdisciplinary and collaborative research, scaling up and mainstreaming NBS, and exploring new ways of integrating different disciplines and stakeholders in the research process. The findings of this review provided insights into the current state of NBS research and offer valuable information for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of urban stormwater management.

Changing Seasonality of Annual Maximum Floods over the Conterminous US: Potential Drivers and Regional Synthesis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; SHIFTS; PRECIPITATION; EVENTS; TRENDS; STATES; COMBINATION; RUNOFF	Understanding the flood-generating mechanisms that influence flood seasonality in a region provides information on setting up relevant contingency measures. Although former studies estimated flood seasonality at regional/continental scale, limited/no studies have investigated the climate/basin drivers that influence the changes in flood seasonality. Considering this, the current study performed two analyses: (1) estimated the changes in the seasonality of annual maximum floods (AMF) between pre- and post-1970 across Hydroclimate Data Network basins over the conterminous US, and (2) identified the predictors that influence the change in the seasonality from a set of climate and geomorphic variables. Significant changes in the AMF seasonality were noted for approximately half of the basins in the eastern US, but low to no change was found in most basins in the central/western US. We found, except in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic basins, a decrease in the seasonality index, indicating floods arriving more uniformly is typically associated with an increase in the precipitation days in basins. On the other hand, increase in the seasonality index, indicating floods occurring more concentrated in time, is typically associated with an increase in the extreme precipitation in basins. Among the basin characteristics, elevation has a more dominant role than the drainage area in changing the flood seasonality. Elevation affects the form of precipitation, particularly in the western US, because floods arrive more distributed over the year (i.e., decrease in flood seasonality index), which potentially indicates increased warming resulting in early snowmelt.

"Half a flood's no good": flooding, viticulture, and hydrosocial terroir in a South Australian wine region	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						Irrigation; Flooding; Langhorne Creek; Terroir; Viticulture; Wine regions	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MCLAREN VALE; NEW-ZEALAND; WATER; PLACE; ADAPTATION; TERRITORY; INDUSTRY; IMPACTS; FRANCE	Floods generate both risks and benefits. In Langhorne Creek, South Australia, a historically-embedded system of shared floodwater management exists among farmers, who rely on semi-regular flood inundations as part of the region's hydrosocial terroir - a dynamic conjunction of water, landscape, social relations and agricultural practice. Unruly floods coexist with a heavily regulated and precisely measured system of modern water management for viticultural irrigation across the region. Since the mid-twentieth century, groundwater extraction and new pipeline schemes have linked Langhorne Creek to the Murray Darling Basin water management system, which has displaced flooding as the primary source of irrigation water. The associated modernist shift towards the rationalization of water as a measurable resource has acted to sideline flood irrigation. Yet, floods maintain important viticultural, ecological and social roles in Langhorne Creek, adding to the flexibility and resilience of the region in response to water management challenges. The system involves technological and infrastructural components, such as flood gates and channels, but also relies upon the cooperation and coordination of community members. Local vignerons suggest that flood irrigation is environmentally as well as economically beneficial, rejuvenating riparian wetlands along watercourses. A more formal acknowledgement of the specific regional experiences of water management in a wine region like Langhorne Creek helps to fill a gap between emplaced and hydrosocial understandings of flood irrigation and broader assumptions about flooding as wasteful and inefficient.

In particular, the article focuses on the significance of key cultural assumptions embedded in the texts -and a revival of The Torrents in 2019 - including those to do with land use in a period of accelerating development. This approach offers new insights into the dominance of mining, irrigation, and dam-building activities within the Australian ethos, landscape, and economy. One of these insights is the framing of development as progressive. The article thus also examines how development projected as progressive takes place amid the continuing denial of prior occupation of the land by First Nations peoples and of knowledge systems developed over thousands of years. The intersectional settler-colonialist-ecocritical approach here seeks to capture the compounding ecosystem that is modern Australian theatre and its critique. The intention is not to apply revisionist critiques of 1950s plays but to explore the historical relationship between humans, colonialism, and the physical environment over time. Denise Varney is Professor of Theatre Studies in the School of Culture and Communication at the University of Melbourne. Her research is in modern and contemporary theatre and performance, with published work in the areas of ecocriticism, feminism, and Australian theatre.

Flash flood response of a catchment can be strongly governed by a rainfall's spatiotemporal variability and is influenced by storm movement which drives a continuous spatiotemporal change throughout a rainfall event. In this work, the sensitivity of runoff and flooded areas to rainfall movement are assessed in the Kan catchment (Iran). The allochthonous nature of floods in the catchment and how they interact with the effects of rainfall movement are investigated. Fifty synthetic rain hyetographs are generated and traversed over the catchment under different velocities and directions and used to force a 1D/2D hydrodynamic model. The results suggest rainfall movement affects the runoff response in different degrees. Peak discharge, hydrograph shapes and flooded areas are affected. Storms with higher velocities result in higher peaks and faster onsets of runoff and consequently higher flooded areas in comparison to slower storms. The direction of the movement also plays a role. Storms moving along the average direction of the stream result in higher peaks and flooded areas. The relevance of storm direction is greater for slow moving storms. Additionally, the influence of rainfall movement is modulated by hyetograph structure, and the allochthonous behavior is greatly dependent on the location within the drainage network at which it is assessed.

Floods were more frequent in the 19th (central Europe) and early 20th century (western Europe) than during the mid-20th century and again more frequent since the 1970s. The causes of this variability are not well understood and the relation to climate change is unclear. Palaeoclimate studies from the northern Alps suggest that past flood-rich periods coincided with cold periods. In contrast, some studies suggest that more floods might occur in a future, warming world. Here we address the contribution of atmospheric circulation and of warming to multidecadal flood variability. For this, we use long series of annual peak streamflow, daily weather data, reanalyses, and reconstructions. We show that both changes in atmospheric circulation and moisture content affected multidecadal changes of annual peak streamflow in central and western Europe over the past two centuries. We find that during the 19th and early 20th century, atmospheric circulation changes led to high peak values of moisture flux convergence. The circulation was more conducive to strong and long-lasting precipitation events than in the mid-20th century. These changes are also partly reflected in the seasonal mean circulation and reproduced in atmospheric model simulations, pointing to a possible role of oceanic variability. For the period after 1980, increasing moisture content in a warming atmosphere led to extremely high moisture flux convergence. Thus, the main atmospheric driver of flood variability changed from atmospheric circulation variability to water vapour increase.

Since 2004, the retreat rate of glacier has reached as high as 5.0 km(2) a(-1), while the growth rate of glacial lake has reached 0.24 km(2) a(-1). We take five typical lakes as our case study and find that the retreat of glacier area reaches 31.2 %, while the glacial lake area has expanded by 166 %. Moreover, we reconstruct the topography of the lake basin to calculate the water capacity and propose a water balance equation (WBE) to explore the lake evolution. By applying the WBE to the five lakes, we calculate the water supplies of the last few years and compare this with the results of field surveys, which are in agreement, within an error of only 1.86% on average. The WBE also reveals that the water supplies to the lake depend strongly on the altitude. Lakes at low altitudes are supplied by glacier melting, and lakes at high altitudes are supplied by snowmelts. The WBE is not only applicable for predicting future changes in glacial lakes under climate warming conditions but is also useful for assessing water resources from rivers in the central Himalayas.

The present study reports the impact of a severe summer drought followed by a catastrophic flood in 2018 on soil microarthropod density and biological soil quality across 25 tropical home gardens. Drought reduced the density of organisms six-fold and flooding caused a further threefold reduction. Biological soil quality in the home gardens that were not flooded was restored during the monsoon season but this was just partially possible for microarthropod population size. Three months after flooding, the microarthropod groups encountered were generally able to re-establish their population to the condition prior to flooding. However, none of the group recovered to the mean seasonal values. The severity of previous drought seemed to have overridden any possible adaptation to annual summer water scarcity. Plant species richness in home gardens played a key role towards mitigation and possible resilience to disturbance of these ancient agroecosystems. The capacity of the soil microarthropod communities to recover over the long term after extreme climatic events and its relevance to maintaining ecosystem functions and services in home gardens through soil fertility warrant further investigation.

Multi-Century Impacts of Ice Sheet Retreat on Sea Level and Ocean Tides in Hudson Bay	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							JAMES BAY; RISE; MODEL; AGE; EARTH; ANTARCTICA; CANADA; FLOOD; SHELF	Past and modern large-scale ice sheet loss results in geographically variable sea level changes. At present, in Hudson Bay, Canada, sea level is decreasing due to glacial isostatic adjustment, which represents a departure from the globally averaged sea level rise. However, there are large uncertainties in future sea level trends with further polar ice sheet retreat in the coming centuries. Sea level changes affect ocean tides considerably because tides are highly sensitive to changes in bathymetry. Here, we present multi-century sea level projections associated with a suite of past and future ice loss scenarios and consider the impact of these changes on ocean tides using an established tidal model. Modern tides in Hudson Bay are poorly resolved due to large uncertainties in bathymetry. To establish an initial condition for our simulations, we constrain bathymetry in the bay using tide observations. Due to gravitational, Earth rotational and deformational effects, Greenland ice loss will produce a small sea level fall in the bay, while Antarctic ice loss will produce a larger than average sea level rise. Our results show that the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate change strongly impacts the magnitude and sign of future sea level and tidal amplitude changes in the region, with the largest changes predicted in Hudson Strait and Foxe Basin. We emphasize that further constraints on bathymetry and accurate projections of sea level and tides in Hudson Bay are imperative for assessing the associated impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems.

To examine the impacts of intensive versus extensive events, we investigated the loss structure of global flood-induced mortality by using the cumulative loss ratio, marginal benefit chart, and cumulative loss plot. Drawing on the flood-induced mortality data for four decades (1976-2016) from the international disaster database EM-DAT, we defined the levels of flood loss according to the frequency of flood-induced deaths, and calculated the cumulative mortality and the marginal benefits of flood loss prevention practices at different levels. Our analysis showed that for the world's leading 30 countries with large flood-induced mortality and different levels of development: (1) 70% of them have the cumulative deaths from extensive floods exceeding half of those caused by intensive floods in the study's four data decades; and (2) 80% of them tend to gain less marginal benefit with increasing levels of flood prevention, with their marginal benefits peaking at loss prevention levels of 2-year or 5-year flood-induced mortality. These results indicate that, in the long run, the cumulative deaths of extensive floods are comparable to that of intensive events, and prevention of loss from extensive events can be an efficient way to reduce the total loss. For flood risk management under conditions of climate change, extensive loss events deserve more consideration.

Apart from property damage, hurricanes can damage natural coastal communities and wash solid waste into coastal waters and wetlands. Our goal was to develop a rapid, synoptic survey method to evaluate what happens to the coasts of small islands after hurricanes. This study reports on the development of a hurricane rapid ecological assessment method (H-REA) that was carried out on small islands in collaboration with local communities. The H-REA focused on property damage, vegetation damage, flooding, coastal erosion, and solid waste accumulation in the coastal environment. The H-REA method was developed to evaluate the hurricane damage from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and then applied to assess Hurricane Irma's damage to both the built and natural environments in 2017. The H-REA proved to be an important tool for the rapid assessment of 2017 hurricane impacts on the southern Bahamian islands; results are shown for Great Exuma. The H-REA results highlighted the variability of damage across the islands as well as the value of coastal set-backs and protected coastal wetlands in reducing both property damage and the amount of solid waste, including plastics, entering the coastal oceans. A spatial database was established to visualize the patterns of building damage, flooding, and vegetation loss; the spatial database allows for the assessment of damage from successive hurricanes.

In recent years, urban waterlogs caused by heavy rainfall has become a major concern threatening urban safety and socioeconomic development. This paper aimed to reveal the spatial pattern of waterlogging risk in 89 prefecture-level cities of Eastern China by a comprehensive analysis on extreme rainfall, socioeconomic exposure and urban adaptability. Hazard intensity index was calculated on 20-year return period value of maximum daily precipitation. Exposure index was based on the total urban population and local gross domestic product, while adaptability index was an integrated evaluation of drainage pipeline density, river network density and greening rate of urban area. Risk assessment was a synthesis judgment of hazard intensity index, exposure index and urban adaptability index, according to which the cities in Eastern China were classified into five risk levels. The six cities with the highest level of waterlogging risk were Shenzhen, Beijing, Maoming, Yangjiang, Shanwei and Dongguan, which indicates relatively stronger intensity of meteorological hazard, higher density of socioeconomic exposure and the weakness of urban adaptability in these cities. The high risk cities would suffer much more losses than other cities in Eastern China when hit by an extreme rainfall. This paper could provide a scientific basis for urban waterlogging risk identification and governance, as well as for technical measures development and capacity building of disaster prevention and reduction.

Less is known about the consequences of experiencing repeated flood events for the resilience of households and companies. In this paper, we therefore explore how multiple floods experience affects the resilience of exposed households and companies. Resilience was made operational through individual appraisals of households and companies' ability to withstand and recover from material as well as health and psychological impacts of the 2013 flood in Germany. The paper is based on three different datasets including more than 2000 households and 300 companies that were affected by the 2013 flood. The surveys revealed that the resilience of households seems to increase, but only with regard to their subjectively appraised ability to withstand impacts on mobile goods and equipment (e.g., cars, TV, and radios). In regard to the ability of households to withstand overall financial consequences of repetitive floods, evidence for nonlinear (quadratic) trends can be found. With regard to psychological and health-related consequences, the findings are mixed but provide tentative evidence for eroding resilience among households. Companies' resilience increased with respect to material assets but appears to decrease with respect to ability to recover. We conclude by arguing that clear and operational definitions of resilience are required so that evidence-based resilience baselines can be established to assess whether resilience is eroding or improving over time.

However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production.

Using a Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and an Urban Heat Index (UHI) to model winter flood and summer heat hazard potential respectively, this research uses a geographic information system (GIS) to develop a combined index, and tests for relationships between sociodemographic variables and environmental hazard potential. Along with data from the American Community Survey, and tax lot information, index values are summarized by census block groups, and tested against sociodemographic and biophysical variables for correlations. An exploratory regression identifies unique combinations of variables that produce the highest degree of explanation across all census block groups. Spatial models, including a spatial error model, spatial lag model and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model further tests how relationships vary across Portland, and identifies areas that may face acute impacts from flooding and heat. Results show combined sewer pipe density, green space, impervious surface, population density, and percentage of population without higher education explained 69% of the variation of the combined hazard potential. GWR further identified how these variables were non-stationary across space in their relationship with the combined hazard index and explained 80% of the variation of combined hazard potential. Our findings offer practitioners and researchers a dual-hazard perspective for assessing the role of socioeconomic conditions when designing resilient infrastructure.

Investigating the role of model structure and surface roughness in generating flood inundation extents using one- and two-dimensional hydraulic models	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						flood extent; HEC-RAS; hydraulic models; LISFLOOD-FP; model structure; surface roughness	UNCERTAIN BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; RASTER-BASED MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TOPOGRAPHIC DATA; WATER-FLOW; 1D; RIVER; RESOLUTION; RISK; CALIBRATION	Hydraulic models play an important role in determining flood inundation areas. When considering a wide array of one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models, selecting an appropriate model and its calibration are crucial in an accurate prediction of flood inundation. This study compares the performance of four commonly used 1D and 2D hydraulic models, including HEC-RAS 1D, HEC-RAS 2D, LISFLOOD-FP diffusive, and LISFLOOD-FP subgrid, with respect to their model structure and their sensitivity to surface roughness characterisation. Application of these models to four study reaches with different river geometry and roughness characterisation shows that for a given set of roughness condition, the geometry, including the sinuosity, reach length and floodplain width, does not affect the performance of a 1D or 2D model. Overall, the performance of a 1D model is comparable to the 2D models used in the study, with the 2D models showing slightly better results. The performance of 2D models is affected by low channel roughness, and it improves with increasing channel roughness that enables more water to enter into the floodplain. On the contrary, the performance of 1D model is positively affected with increasing floodplain roughness. When the models are evaluated for uniform versus distributed roughness characterisation in the floodplain, the uniform surface characterisation provides the best results compared to the distributed roughness characterisation.

Traditionally, these changes have been observed at a local level providing insight to local dynamics but not general trends, or at a coarse resolution that does not capture localized shifts. Using historic flood data between 2000-2023 across the Contiguous United States (CONUS), we identify the relationships between flood exposure and population change. We demonstrate that observed declines in population are statistically associated with higher levels of historic flood exposure, which may be subsequently coupled with future population projections. Several locations have already begun to see population responses to observed flood exposure and are forecasted to have decreased future growth rates as a result. Finally, we find that exposure to high frequency flooding (5 and 20-year return periods) results in 2-7% lower growth rates than baseline projections. This is exacerbated in areas with relatively high exposure to frequent flooding where growth is expected to decline over the next 30 years. Using historical data across the U.S., the authors find that population declines are associated with flood exposure. Projecting this relationship to 2053, the authors find that flood risk may result in 7% lower growth than otherwise expected.

This study aims to review the literature on the newly proposed phenomenon known as drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA). A comprehensive summary is provided to round up the numerous approaches employed to identify DFAA events, as well as its mechanisms and impacts. To provide a reference for responding and managing the emerging intensity and frequency of DFAA events, we conclude the paper by listing the insufficiency of current research and suggesting possible future research directions. As for the impact of DFAA, besides the loss of life and property which can be caused by any natural disaster, a DFAA event severely threatens food security by making a lasting and profound impact on the land productivity through the alteration of the combining conditions of water, soil, and temperature. As for the future research directions, existing indexes developed for DFAA identification should be improved by downscaling the temporal and spatial scale, with interactions of neighboring drought and flood events taken into consideration. What's more, to better protect human society from the losses caused by DFAA, researches on accurate DFAA prediction are encouraged.

However, the net-exchange dependence on hydrothermal conditions and wetland integrity remains unclear. Using a global-scale in situ database on net greenhouse gas exchanges, we show diverse hydrology-influenced emission patterns in CO2, CH4 and N2O. We find that total CO2-equivalent emissions from wetlands are kept to a minimum when the water table is near the surface. By contrast, greenhouse gas exchange rates peak in flooded and drained conditions. By extrapolating the current trajectory of degradation, we estimate that between 2021 and 2100, wetlands could result in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to around 408 gigatons of CO2. However, rewetting wetlands could reduce these emissions such that the radiative forcing caused by CH4 and N2O is fully compensated by CO2 uptake. As wetland greenhouse gas budgets are highly sensitive to changes in wetland area, the resulting impact on climate from wetlands will depend on the balance between future degradation and restoration. Global in situ observations show greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands are lowest when the water table is near the surface, and therefore rewetting wetlands could substantially reduce future emissions.

Focusing on post-flood conditions, the framework considers potential limitations on vehicle access and transport based on flood depths and road widths. The usability of the framework was evaluated by applying it to Seoul, South Korea, the location chosen for this case study. Fourteen criteria were constructed, and TDWMS suitability was determined based on a weighted sum analysis. Compared with the existing TDWMSs in Seoul, the minimum, maximum, and mean suitability scores of the TDWMSs identified using the proposed framework improved by 27.27%, 11.54%, and 23.08%, respectively. The described approach can inform the decision-making of urban planners to improve resilience to flooding by identifying candidate sites with relatively superior suitability ratings. Our approach also serves as a starting point for the development of integrated models and solutions capable of addressing complicated decision-making problems for TDWMS selection that consider post-disaster conditions.

In this study, a novel methodology named GALDIT-SUSI was applied in the floodplain of the Volturno River mouth for the current (2018) and future (2050) evaluation of seawater intrusion accounting for the expected subsidence and groundwater salinization rates. Several input variables such as digital surface model, land use classification, subsidence rate and drainage system have been mapped via remote sensing resources. The current assessment highlights how areas affected by salinization coincide with the semiperennial lagoons and inland depressed areas where paleosaline groundwaters are present. The future assessment (2050) shows a marked increase of salinization vulnerability in the coastal strip and in the most depressed areas. The results highlight that the main vulnerability driver is the Revelle index, while predicted subsidence and recharge rates will only slightly affect groundwater salinization. This case study indicates that GALDIT-SUSI is a reliable and easy-to-use tool for the assessment of groundwater salinization in many coastal regions of the world.

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (1971) is one of the longest-standing international agreements on biodiversity conservation. Its central objective is the maintenance of the ecological character of Wetlands of International Importance and the wise use of all wetlands. Here, we examine how the maintenance of ecological character has been addressed in Australia as part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, one of the most ambitious water reform programs to be undertaken globally and intended to restore water from irrigated agriculture to the environment. We analyse policy and planning documents from Commonwealth and state jurisdictions on the management of environmental water. Despite stated objectives to conserve Ramsar wetlands in the Basin Plan, we found a pattern of complex and convoluted arrangements for delivering environmental water to Ramsar wetlands and a lack of transparency and accountability about how Ramsar obligations are considered within each jurisdiction. We conclude that consideration of the ecological character of Ramsar wetlands has been marginalised by governments when managing environmental water, despite the statutory requirements to maintain these wetlands.

Drought forecasting is an important tool for drought management. Uncertainty is a major challenge in drought forecasting. In order to provide a short-term effective drought prediction, this study provides a new point into drought prediction from the timing-prediction perspective. The key part of this essay lies in its fractal theoretical framework guided by the self-similarity principle, which fully considers the complexity, disorder and regularity of agricultural drought. At the same time, information diffusion theory is used to polish the raw data, especially some data about winter wheat in Zhengzhou in China. The results as follows: 1) the change trend of drought in the study region is consistent with the past; 2) the time of meteorological drought, summer maize does not necessarily lead to drought, but most timing prediction work is consistent, they have shared the similar cyclical changing-laws; and 3) the occurring time of the next drought calculated is consistent with the actual observation results. Therefore, the method established in this study is effective, and it can provide some reference for the prediction of agricultural drought outbreak time.

This study aims to find the relationship between the socioeconomy of the community living and flood events in the district of Pekan, Pahang. This involved geographic analyses which combined data on vulnerability index components represented by Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping. A field survey was conducted to assess the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), comprising major and sub-components of vulnerability for ten sub-districts in Pekan. LVI mapping was performed for every major component of the LVI with spatial data on the district. Households in the Gancung sub-district were found to be more vulnerable to flooding impact, with a high exposure index (0.59), but reported a positive vulnerability based on adaptive capacity (0.06). Penyur (0.51) was the most vulnerable and sensitive in terms of food security during the flood season. LVI assessment in the Pekan district could be used as an indicator to change livelihoods, survival food storage practices, and other preventive measures in order to curb damages and injuries when annual flooding strikes in the future.

Financial innovation is one way through which resources can be secured, while also providing business opportunities for market actors. The insurance sector, in particular, has been at the forefront of such innovation, developing financial instruments to manage the flooding, fire, and storm risks that characterize an increasingly unstable world. We examine one such financial instrument-the catastrophe bond-which transfers extreme risk from insurers and reinsurers to capital markets. Using a comprehensive database of all catastrophe bonds issued through March 2016, we find that the modeling which underlies catastrophe bonds is not demonstrably better than guesswork at predicting the financial consequences of extreme events. Moreover, secondary data reveal that market actors are under no illusions about the level of precision and accuracy provided by the models. Our analysis suggests that catastrophe bonds do not lend themselves to analysis through conventional sociological theories of financial markets. Drawing on theories of ignorance, we reflect on the social arrangements that sustain financial markets in contexts of extreme uncertainty. We conclude with some cautionary notes for harnessing financial tools in support of the SDGs. [GRAPHICS] .

Examples of anthropic factors are climate change, eutrophication and construction of reservoirs. This study evaluated the influence of three factors - seasonality, type of environment and the presence of aquatic macrophytes - on various ecological attributes of rotifers in a river-lake system located in the Parana River floodplain. Monthly samplings were conducted during 1993 and 1994. The mean species richness per sample was 60 species. The seasonality and the type of environment influenced the ecological attributes of rotifer assemblages, while the presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes did not. Species richness was highest in the lake system and during the months when water levels were low. Multivariate analysis indicates a small group of species associated with the low water-level phase. In contrast, many species were associated with high water levels or increasing water levels. The seasonal variation of hydrological cycle and the type of environment are the most important factors for rotifer structure in natural conditions.

Therefore, the ability to predict flood-prone areas in advance is crucial for effective risk management. The objective of this research is to assess and compare three convolutional neural networks, U-Net, WU-Net, and U-Net++, for spatial prediction of pluvial flood with a case study at a tropical area in the north of Vietnam. They are relative new convolution algorithms developed based on U-shaped architectures. For this task, a geospatial database with 796 historical flood locations and 12 flood indicators was prepared. For training the models, the binary cross-entropy was employed as the loss function, while the Adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) algorithm was used for the optimization of the model parameters, whereas, F1-score and classification accuracy (Acc) were used to assess the performance of the models. The results unequivocally highlight the high performance of the three models, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 96.01%. The flood susceptibility maps derived from this research possess considerable utility for local authorities, providing valuable insights and information to enhance decision-making processes and facilitate the implementation of effective risk management strategies.

Appropriate coping behaviours can help reduce disas-ter risks and protect lives and property. However, the mechanisms underlying the influence of different coping behaviours remain poorly understood. This study collected questionnaire data from Henan Province, China, and used a structural equation model to explore the influencing fac-tors, influence degree, and influence path of positive, negative, and risky coping behaviours. The results showed that (1) the level of risk perception increased with increasing familiarity with dis-asters and information about consequence severity and with decreasing trust in authorities. Per-ceived controllability improved with increased familiarity with disasters, trust in authorities, and reduced information about consequence severity; (2) risk perception and perceived controllabil-ity moderated the impact of familiarity with disasters, information about consequence severity, and trust in authorities for three different coping behaviours; (3) information about consequence severity was the greatest driving force affecting positive coping behaviours and negative coping behaviours and the degree of trust in the authorities was the greatest driving force affecting risky coping behaviours. These findings provide a reference for the government to guide the public to adopt positive coping behaviours and reduce the risks of natural hazards.

Quantifying the effects of sea level rise driven marsh migration on wave attenuation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Storm Surge; ADCIRC plus SWAN; Chesapeake Bay; Hurricane Irene; Marsh Accretion; Saltmarsh Ecosystem Services	COASTAL SALT-MARSHES; STORM-SURGE; TIDAL MARSH; VEGETATION; MODEL; VULNERABILITY; FUTURE	Sea level rise (SLR) is the most significant climate change-related threat to coastal wetlands, driving major transformations in coastal regions through marsh migration. Landscape transformations due to marsh migration are manifested in terms of horizontal and vertical changes in land cover and elevation, respectively. These processes will have an impact on saltmarsh wave attenuation that is yet to be explored. This study stands as a comprehensive analysis of spatially distributed wave attenuation by vegetation in the context of a changing climate. Our results show that: i) changes in saltmarsh cover have little to no effect on the attenuation of floods, while ii) changes in elevation can significantly reduce flood extents and water depths; iii) overland wave heights are directly influenced by marsh migration, although iv) being indirectly attenuated by the water depth limiting effects of water depth attenuation driven by changes in elevation; v) the influence of saltmarsh accretion on wave attenuation is largely evident near the marsh edge, where the increasing elevations can drive major wave energy losses via wave breaking. Lastly, vi) considering the synergy between SLR, marsh migration, and changes in elevation results in significantly more wave attenuation than considering the eustatic effects of SLR and/or horizontal marsh migration alone, and therefore should be adopted in future studies.

In particular, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3 aims to, "by 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world". Addressing this challenge is essential for improving the livelihoods of those most affected by DLDD and for safeguarding against the most extreme effects of climate change. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for improved monitoring of DLDD in the context of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Strategic Objective 2 (SO2) and its expected impacts: food security and adequate access to water for people in affected areas are improved; the livelihoods of people in affected areas are improved and diversified; local people, especially women and youth, are empowered and participate in decision-making processes in combating DLDD; and migration forced by desertification and land degradation is substantially reduced. While it is critical to develop methods and tools for assessing DLDD, work is needed first to provide a conceptual roadmap of the human dimensions of vulnerability in relation to DLDD, especially when attempting to create a globally standardized monitoring approach.

In order to enhance urban capacity to cope with floods and reduce losses, the comprehensive emergency-response capacity to flood disaster (CERCF) was studied in Zhengzhou City, which is seriously affected by floods. Firstly, the evaluation index system of flood emergency capacity was constructed from three aspects, including pre-disaster prevention capacity, during-disaster disposal capacity and post-disaster recovery capacity. Secondly, the weight of each index was calculated by the combination of the entropy weight method and the coefficient of variation method, and the evaluation model was established by the comprehensive index method. Thirdly, the CERCF of Zhengzhou City was classified into three grades by the Jenks natural-breakpoint classification method. Finally, the contribution model was used to reveal the contribution factors of flood emergency capacity in Zhengzhou city. The following beneficial conclusions were drawn: (1) The overall CERCF of Zhengzhou City was on a low level. The proportions of the study area at low, medium and high levels were 58.33%, 33.33% and 8.34%, respectively. Spatially, the CERCF was high in central regions and low in in the west and east parts of Zhengzhou City. (2) It was found that PDPC and PDRC made the greatest contribution, while DDDC has a relatively low contribution degree.

On one hand, it builds on, and further substantiate the utility of, the innovation of conceptualizing brokerage activity and brokerage exclusivity separately, whilst analyzing them together. On the other hand, it also builds on the seminal notion of qualitatively different brokerage roles and introduces the conceptual innovation of brokerage role diversity to study the implications of and for actors occupying one or several roles to similar or varying degrees. These implications are further unpacked by analyzing the specific brokerage activity and exclusivity for each brokerage role separately, before reassembling the results into a rich description of the patterns of brokerage among different types of actors. This three-dimensional approach was applied to study brokerage in a network of individual actors governing flood risk mitigation in a catchment area in Southern Sweden. The results suggest that studying these three dimensions of brokerage simultaneously provides a sharper lens that picks up important nuances that available approaches may fail to reveal. The paper makes a substantive contribution to the knowledge of brokerage in collaborative governance of complex issues, as well as a methodological contribution to the study of brokerage in general.

In flood risk management, the assessment of community resilience is standard practice. This study aims to assess the community flood resilience of some selected Upazilas of Jamalpur District in Bangladesh. Appropriate indicators were selected to determine flood resilience through an extensive literature review. The indicators were provided with a weight based on the expert's judgment. A structured questionnaire, consisting of appropriate questions, was prepared to collect data for all indicators. A total of 400 households were surveyed from five flood-affected Upazilas, including Dewanganj, Islampur, Madarganj, Melandaha, and Sharishabari to collect primary data. Resilience index is an analytical tool representing a numeric score ranging from 0 to 1 for each variable. The value obtained from the field survey had been divided by the weighted value of that particular variable to calculate the variable resilience index (VRI). Then, by averaging the VRI values, composite resilience index (CRI) values were calculated. The calculated CRI values are 0.30, 0.37, 0.36, 0.36, and 0.38 out of 1 in Dewanganj, Islampur, Madarganj, Melandaha, and Sharishabari Upazila, respectively, which suggest low community resilience to flooding. This study recommends enhancing the social, economic, institutional, and physical components, which can be executed through community awareness and disaster preparedness programs, to help communities strengthen resilience and cope with floods.

With high latitudes experiencing warming at a faster pace than the global average, especially during the NGS, a major concern is that enhanced mineralization of soil organic carbon will steadily increase CO2 emissions from northern peatlands. In this study, we conducted laboratory incubations with soils from boreal and temperate peatlands across Canada. Peat soils were pretreated for different soil moisture levels, and CO2 production rates were measured at 12 sequential temperatures, covering a range from - 10 to + 35 degrees C including one freeze-thaw event. On average, the CO2 production rates in the boreal peat samples increased more sharply with temperature than in the temperate peat samples. For same temperature, optimum soil moisture levels for CO2 production were higher in the peat samples from more flooded sites. However, standard reaction kinetics (e.g., Q(10) temperature coefficient and Arrhenius equation) failed to account for the apparent lack of temperature dependence of CO2 production rates measured below 0 degrees C, and a sudden increase after a freezing event. Thus, we caution against using the simple kinetic expressions to represent the CO2 emissions from northern peatlands, especially regarding the long NGS period with multiple soil freeze and thaw events.

River Damming Reduces Wetland Function in Regulating Flow	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hydrological services; Wetlands; Damming regulation; Streamflow simulation; Hydrological modeling; Nenjiang River basin	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; WATERSHED HYDROLOGY; CUMULATIVE IMPACTS; BASIN; MODEL; CLIMATE; SWAT	The global scale wetland loss or degeneration triggers the assessment of how their function provisions are likely to change under different management scenarios. However, how and to what extent river damming can modify the hydrological function of wetlands remain largely unknown. In this study, we apply a distributed hydrological modeling platform for a larger river basin in Northeast China with a paired modeling scenario: (1) modeling with no dam present (i.e., under natural conditions), and (2) modeling with dam present (i.e., under disturbed conditions). The overarching goal of the study is to quantify the effect of damming on wetland hydrological processes. The modeling study demonstrates that river damming can alter the wetland effect on daily flow by significantly reducing flow under low flow conditions but slightly increasing flow under high flow conditions. Damming can impact the wetland function in alleviating floods with a 7% decrease when compared to the natural conditions without a dam. Consequently, the supporting effect of wetlands on baseflow is weakened substantially by damming regulation. These results indicate that river damming can impair flow regulation functions of downstream wetlands, and therefore, new flow regulation and optimization strategies for achieving complementary hydrological functions of wetlands and reservoirs are important to maximize basin resilience to hydrological extremes under climate change.

J	Rana, IA; Bhatti, SS; Jamshed, A; Ahmad, S				Rana, Irfan Ahmad; Bhatti, Saad Saleem; Jamshed, Ali; Ahmad, Shakil			An approach to understanding the intrinsic complexity of resilience against floods: Evidences from three urban communities of Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Capacity; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Pakistan; Urban flooding	VULNERABILITY; RISK; FRAMEWORK; HAZARDS; AREAS; MODEL	Rapid and unplanned urbanization has resulted in the settlement and expansion of marginalized communities in flood-prone areas. Consequently, the devastating impacts of urban flooding have increased recently, further augmented by the changing climatic patterns resulting in more frequent flooding. However, to effectively enhance resilience at the community level, it is essential first to understand its components and indicators. This study proposed and tested a methodology to assess community resilience against urban flooding - 57 indicators of resilience were identified, which were classified into six domains, namely social, economic, infrastructural, institutional, natural, and psychological. The data was collected through a questionnaire survey in three com-munities of Rawalpindi, Sialkot, and Muzaffargarh cities in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The data of resilience indicators were standardized, and an index-based approach was used to assess the community resil-ience in the six domains. The relative importance of each domain was evaluated through input from field experts translated into weights through the analytic hierarchy process method. Thereafter, overall community resilience was constructed, and statistical methods were employed to compare resilience and its domains. A significant difference in resilience was observed among the selected communities. Recommendations based on relative urgency, complexity, and impact were devised to help institutions make informed decisions to improve com-munity resilience against floods.

Building energy demand is either provided by fossil fuels or fossil-fuel-generated electricity in Iran, so the energy resources are mainly non-renewable. The current study addressed such an unbalanced pattern by proposing an applicable cross-disciplinary methodology for a sustainable urban design. A case study was conducted in a site located in northern Tehran, and multiple sustainable design alternatives were examined. Water, electricity, and energy demands were compared between a conventional design and a sustainable one. Water and energy management scenarios were defined, encompassing rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, efficient landscape plantation and irrigation, water treatment, reducing construction materials? heat transfer, and photovoltaic electricity generation on site. Evaluations showed promising results indicating: 69.73 % less water demand from city water supply; 68.60 % less electricity demand from national grid; 43 % reduction in cooling and 56 % reduction in heating loads. The decentralized water management system reduced the risk of over flooding in the city wastewater network. Furthermore, a shift to renewable energy resources was achieved, and fossil fuel consumption consequences were alleviated by applying a grid-connected photovoltaic system.

Resultantly, the farmers are compelled to adopt several risk-management activities to cope with these risks. Therefore, the study aims to explore the risk management tools and their association with farmers' risk perception, risk-averse attitude, and other socio-economic factors. We collected data from 200 respondents from two districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The study employed a multivariate probit model to investigate the association among dependent variables (risk management tools) and explanatory variables. Findings indicated that floods and heavy rains were not the sources of risk for most of the large farmers. The majority of small farmers were risk-averse. The multivariate probit model results exposed that farmers' age, their risk perception about the heavy rains, and the size of landholding were positively associated with the adoption of assets depletion as a risk management tool. Farmers' age, education, off-farm income, and farmers' risk-averse attitude were positive, while the farming experience was negatively associated with consumption reduction. Moreover, farming experience, risk perception about the floods and heavy rains, and risk-averse attitude are positively associated with the adoption of diversification. Farmers in the study area were vulnerable, and they were relying on traditional tools of risk management. Hence, the government is suggested extending agricultural credit and crop insurance facilities to these farmers.

This requirement is challenging in locations such as the Himalayas, which are characterised by unpredictable hydroclimatic behaviour with dramatic small-scale spatial and temporal variability. River level monitoring sensors that are affordable and easy-to-operate could support flood risk management activities in the region. We therefore identify potential for a local participatory monitoring network that also serve to overcome existing data gaps, which represent the main bottleneck for establishing an effective community-based flood early-warning system. We have applied a citizen science-based hydrological monitoring approach in which we tested low-cost river level sensors. Initial results, collected over summer 2017 from two stations on the River Karnali, suggest that our system can successfully be operated by non-scientists, producing river level data that match those obtained from an adjacent government-operated high-tech radar sensor. We discuss potential opportunities to integrate these low-cost sensors into existing hydrological monitoring practice. Combined with an adaptive, community-led approach to resilience building, we argue that our low-cost sensing technology has the potential not only to increase spatial network coverage in data-scarce regions, but also to empower and educate local stakeholders to build flood resilience.

This paper attempts to analyze the vulnerability of coastal areas of the Chittagong District in the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. This study explores the spatial variations of coastal vulnerability of the study area using three physical variables and four social variables with a spatial analytical method. In this regard, a Physical Vulnerability Index (PVI), and a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) have been prepared for the research area. Finally, a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) was constructed within a geographic information system combining both PVI and CVI. The vulnerability indices reveal that the rural areas are more vulnerable to disaster than the urban areas. According to the PVI, SVI, and CVI about 66%, 48%, and 43% areas are highly vulnerable respectively. Despite of data limitations in constructing the PVI and SVI, this research is the first endeavor to apply a composite CVI based on geospatial techniques in the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. The CVI results illustrate that the coasts are the most vulnerable to flooding, storm surges and cyclones. In this study, CVI is presented as a tool to identify areas of vulnerability in the zones of the coastal district Chittagong. The CVI will serve as a practical guideline for policy makers to introduce policies and plans to mitigate the natural hazard-induced disaster impacts on the coastal Bangladesh.

Ensemble models of GLM, FDA, MARS, and RF for flood and erosion susceptibility mapping: a priority assessment of sub-basins	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Flood; erosion; prioritization; machine learning; ensemble; susceptibility	RANDOM FOREST MODELS; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; WATERSHED PRIORITIZATION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DECISION-SUPPORT; RISK-ASSESSMENT; SOIL; GIS; CLASSIFICATION; SUBWATERSHEDS	The mountainous watersheds are increasingly challenged with extreme erosions and devastating floods due to climate change and human interventions. Hazard mapping is essential for local policymaking for prevention, planning the mitigation actions, and also adaptation to extremes. This study proposes novel predictive models for susceptibility mapping for flood and erosion. Furthermore, this study elaborates on prioritizing the existing sub-basins in terms of erosion and flood susceptibility. A comparative analysis of generalized linear model (GLM), flexible discriminate analyses (FDA), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), random forest (RF), and their ensemble is performed to ensure highest predictive performance. Furthermore, the priority of the sub-basins in terms of sensitivity to erosion and flood was determined based on the best model. The results showed that the GLM, FDA, MARS, RF, and ensemble models had an area under curve (AUC) 0.91, 0.92, 0.89, 0.93 and 0.94, respectively, in modeling the flood susceptibility. Also, the GLM, FDA, MARS, RF, and ensemble models had an AUC of 0.93, 0.92, 0.89, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively, in determining erosion susceptibility. Priority assessment based on the best model, the ensemble approach, indicated that the sub-basins SW3 and SW5 were found to have high sensitivity to the flood and soil erosion, respectively.

Natural disasters and infectious disease in Europe: a literature review to identify cascading risk pathways	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review							LEPTOSPIROSIS; DRIVERS; ILLNESS; AREAS	Background: Natural disasters are increasing in their frequency and complexity. Understanding how their cascading effects can lead to infectious disease outbreaks is important for developing cross-sectoral preparedness strategies. The review focussed on earthquakes and floods because of their importance in Europe and their potential to elucidate the pathways through which natural disasters can lead to infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: A systematic literature review complemented by a call for evidence was conducted to identify earthquake or flooding events in Europe associated with potential infectious disease events. Results: This review included 17 peer-reviewed papers that reported on suspected and confirmed infectious disease outbreaks following earthquakes (4 reports) or flooding (13 reports) in Europe. The majority of reports related to food- and water-borne disease. Eleven studies described the cascading effect of post-disaster outbreaks. The most reported driver of disease outbreaks was heavy rainfall, which led to cross-connections between water and other environmental systems, leading to the contamination of rivers, lakes, springs and water supplies. Exposure to contaminated surface water or floodwater following flooding, exposure to animal excreta and post-disaster living conditions were among other reported drivers of outbreaks. Conclusions: The cascade effects of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, include outbreaks of infectious disease. The projection that climate change-related extreme weather events will increase in Europe in the coming century highlights the importance of strengthening preparedness planning and measures to mitigate and control outbreaks in post-disaster settings.

Decentralized infrastructures like rainwater harvesting (RWH) can ease both issues. Yet, most studies find RWH offers limited infrastructure capacity at high cost. Previous assessments, however, fail to consider two critical advantages: multi-functionality and high adaptability. By improving the incorporation of these advantages in our analysis of 1.06 million buildings with distinct design and water demand characteristics and 20-year hourly precipitation records in New York City (NYC), we demonstrate, contrary to existing studies, that strategically designed, financed and implemented rooftop RWH systems in all or a subset of the buildings can meet large-scale infrastructure development needs for water supply and stormwater management. RWH implementation featuring public-private partnerships (PPP) in 43-96% of the buildings can serve 17-29% of the city's non-drinking water demands while reducing the public expenditure per unit of water supply by 13-85%. The distributed citywide RWH implementations pre vent 35-56% of rooftop runoff from entering the sewage system, rivers, and/or waterways per month, with observed rooftop runoff reductions as high as 90% for a single rain event.

Northern high latitudes, including the Arctic, experience a variety of climate-related extreme events, yet there has been little attempt to synthesize information on extreme events in this region. This review surveys work on various types of extreme events in northern high latitudes, addressing (1) the evidence for variations and changes based on analyses of recent historical data and (2) projected changes based primarily on studies utilizing global climate models. The survey of extreme weather and climate events includes temperature, precipitation, snow, freezing rain, atmospheric blocking, cyclones, and wind. The survey also includes cryospheric and biophysical impacts: sea ice rapid loss events, Greenland Ice Sheet melt, floods, drought, wildfire, coastal erosion, terrestrial ecosystems, and marine ecosystems. Temperature and sea ice rank at the high end of the spectra of evidence for change and confidence in future change, while drought, flooding and cyclones rank at the lower end. Research priorities identified on the basis of this review include greater use of high-resolution models and observing system enhancements that target extreme events. There is also a need for further work on attribution, impacts on ecosystems and humans, and thresholds or tipping points that may be triggered by extreme events in high latitudes.

Why linking flood risk perception and behavior requires more than "it's the individual, stupid"	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						behavior; disaster risk reduction; flood; flood risk management; risk perception	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNICATION; DISASTER; MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; RESPONSES; EXPERIENCES; CAPACITIES	A common assertion in discussions of flooding is that risk perception is critical and is linked to risk-mitigating behavior. Furthermore, many assert that the adverse effects of floods could be reduced by changes in risk communication, thereby influencing risk perception to foster mitigating behavior. We argue that these assertions are based on quite questionable underlying assumptions: That stakeholders are generally aware of flood risk, that they have the capacity to engage in disaster risk reduction, and that their actions can be effective. The belief in and policies influenced by these three questionable assertions support, in turn, policies that shift responsibility for flood risk reduction onto individuals and homeowners, without regard for social and spatial justice issues. In contrast, we argue that context matters to understanding the complexity of the relation between flood risk perception and behavior, local power relations, and other constraints and opportunities that affect stakeholders. While the academic community has long played a pivotal role in supporting practical flood risk management, future research should take a more critical perspective on the underlying assumptions and focus on improving coordination across theories, methods, and variables, fostering comparative studies across disciplines, contexts, and scales.

Waterlogging refers to the saturation of the soil with water where the root system of plants are submerged, however, the ability of AC Saltlander green wheatgrass (Elymus hoffmannii Jensen & Asay, ACS) and smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss., SB) to tolerate waterlogging or with salinity remains unknown. Two experiments were conducted in a phytotron to evaluate the effects and the recovery of ACS and SB following water receding. An incomplete Latin square design was used with six treatments [two species x three waterlogging durations (no waterlogging, 3 and 5 wk of waterlogging)]. Neither the 3 nor 5 wk of waterlogging had effects on forage yields, plant heights, or root biomass for ACS; while for SB all characteristics decreased in both duration treatments. Waterlogging combined with salinity further decreased forage productivity and root biomass for both ACS and SB. Both species resumed regrowth after the excess water receded, and their regrowth yields and nutritive values were similar in either waterlogging or salinity alone, although ACS regrowth yields were higher than SB after 3 and 5 wk of waterlogging with salinity. Therefore, ACS performed better than SB in areas that have the risk of spring waterlogging alone or with moderate salinity. The implication of this research is that waterlogging risks can be partially minimized by careful management.

The present study quantifies the marginal and compound contributions of hazard and vulnerability to flood-risk through an innovative concept of Risk-classifier, designed in the form of a 5 x 5 choropleth. The proposed framework is demonstrated at the finest administrative scale of village-level over Jagatsinghpur district in Mahanadi River basin, Odisha (India) for two-time frames: Scenario-I (1970-2011) and Scenario-II (1970-2001). An increase in high and very high hazard and vulnerable villages is noticed in Scenario-I, the majority of them lying in the coastal stretches (S-E region) and adjoining flood plains of Mahanadi River (N-W region). Scenario-I is characterized by the majority of hazard-driven and compound (both hazard and vulnerability) risk villages, while Scenario II is characterized by a majority of vulnerability driven-risk villages. For the vulnerability-driven risk villages, rigorous enforcement of policies and mitigation schemes are recommended, while for hazard-driven risk villages, enhancement of structural measures and flood-plain zoning should be exercised. Such exhaustive flood-risk information may serve as a valuable cartographic product for the civic authorities and stakeholders and help in prioritizing flood mitigation actions for improved environmental planning and management.

High stream intermittency in an alpine fluvial network: Val Roseg, Switzerland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							HEADWATER STREAMS; GLACIAL FLOODPLAIN; FLOW INTERMITTENCY; TEMPORARY STREAMS; RIVER; PATTERNS; SENSORS; HETEROGENEITY; CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY	More than one-third of the world's rivers cease to flow and go dry on a periodic basis-so-called intermittent rivers. The frequency and duration of flow intermittency in running waters are increasing due to climate change and water demands for human use. Intermittency effects on stream biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are dramatic and are expected to become increasingly prevalent in alpine landscapes in the near future. This project used modified field sensors to measure flow intermittency, temperature, and water origin (groundwater, precipitation, glacier) at high spatio-temporal resolution throughout an alpine fluvial network (Val Roseg, Switzerland). We continuously recorded water presence in 30 tributary streams and validated sensor performance with field-collected measures. Three different flow regimes were observed in the network, including periodically intermittent, seasonally intermittent, and permanently flowing streams. Twenty-four streams (80% of recorded streams) dried at least once during the sampling period. Principal components analysis along with generalized additive models showed alpine streams with low average temperature and high conductivity (groundwater-fed) were prone to permanent flow, whereas streams with higher average temperature and low conductivity (glacier-fed) typically had intermittent flow. The field sensors proved precise for simultaneously measuring flow intermittency, temperature, and water origin at high resolution throughout the river network. Overall, this approach provides an effective way to develop eco-hydrological models that examine the effects of flow intermittency on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in riverine networks.

Using Hurricane Isabel (2003) as a case study, the storm is placed under the climatic conditions projected for 2050 and 2100. Higher sea surface temperature increases the latent heat release from the ocean, resulting in large increases in storm intensity and maximum sustained wind speeds. The storm surge height, defined as the difference between storm tide and astronomical tide, is amplified in the future climate and amounts to ~30% of the relative sea level rise. Hardening shorelines further increases the storm surge height in the middle and upper parts of the Bay by up to 0.5 m. Sea level rise has a modest impact on the storm surge height: decreasing it by 0.1-0.2 m if the low-lying areas are allowed to be flooded but increases it by 0.1-0.3 m if hypothetic walls are placed at the current coastline. Ocean warming is the main driver of storm surge amplification in the future climate. Energy budget analysis shows that allowing flooding over low-lying areas leads to a significant energy loss and reduces the storm surge height in the estuary.

Cities located in flood-prone areas beside coasts, rivers, or both are at risk because such extreme events are often coupled with insufficient drainage capacity to offload peak discharge and withstand the surge levels. Further, the combined drivers of non-climatic factors, such as increasing urbanisation and social-economic development, and climatic drivers such as increasing extreme rainfall patterns, storms, surges, and global mean sea-level rise are unstoppable. This makes it problematic to continue to rely on improving flood protection to secure resilience. This review focuses on the lessons from recent major flood events in Europe, S Asia, E Asia, Australia, America and Africa, including the causes of the events and the post-flood responses. These responses and options are core values to understand both the importance of addressing flood resilience, by responding to floods and the explicit ways to improve risk communication among stakeholders, administration and the public which seem to be the keys to minimising flood impacts on communities. Given the continuous growth of human exposure, we suggest an urgent call for authorities to enact better flood preparation and response strategies in their flood disaster risk reduction plans and policies. This review provides implications for improving the resilience of Chinese cities and elsewhere.	[Chan, F. K.

The effect on flood control was determined through flood analysis performed by varying the reservoir storage rates. Based on the flood analysis results, Japan's flood damage costs were estimated. Using three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5), we evaluated the flood control potential of reservoirs under future climate conditions. When the reservoirs were empty, the damage cost reduction rate resulting from the use of reservoirs across Japan was small, ranging from 1.1% to 2.3%, but as the damage cost reduction rate did not change under all future scenarios, reductions in flood damage were not affected by changes in rainfall under future climate conditions. Moreover, some prefectures showed high damage cost reduction effects. In northern part of Japan and numerous prefectures in western Japan, the potential to reduce damage through flood control by irrigation reservoirs was high. Some prefectures experienced similar reduction levels as those under alternative adaptation strategies. In the Kanto region, flood control by irrigation reservoirs had low potential for reducing damages. Even among prefectures with low water storage capacities of irrigation reservoirs, the potential to mitigate the effect of damage was high.

Mapping of Flood-Prone Areas Utilizing GIS Techniques and Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Duhok, Kurdistan Region of Iraq	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						urban floods; Geographic Information System (GIS); Remote Sensing (RS); Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP); Duhok; Iraq	RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARD; VULNERABILITY; SENSITIVITY; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; IMPACT; RIVER	One of the most common types of natural disaster, floods can happen anywhere on Earth, except in the polar regions. The severity of the damage caused by flooding can be reduced by putting proper management and protocols into place. Using remote sensing and a geospatial methodology, this study attempts to identify flood-vulnerable areas of the central district of Duhok, Iraq. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique was used to give relative weights to 12 contributing parameters, including elevation, slope, distance from the river, rainfall, land use land cover, soil, lithology, topographic roughness index, topographic wetness index, aspect, the sediment transport index, and the stream power index in order to calculate the Flood Hazard Index (FHI). The relative importance of each criterion was revealed by a sensitivity analysis of the parameter values. This research developed a final flood susceptibility map and identified high-susceptible zones. This was classified anywhere from very low to very high classifications for its potential flood hazard. The generated map indicates that 44.72 km(2) of the total land area of the study area in Duhok city has a very high susceptibility to flooding, and that these areas require significant attention from government authorities in order to reduce flood vulnerability.

The resilience of the territory to climate change threats is strongly linked to its progressive transformation. This fact is extremely evident in coastal systems, which are intrinsically fragile systems due to their high environmental value and strong anthropogenic pressure. The existing tools and techniques provide to outline future transformation effects through the scenarios analysis. This work has the objective to evaluate the effects of land use changes in the territory of the Abruzzo coast. The conversion from natural soils to artificial uses has a significant impact on several ecosystem services. The regulation services considered in this work are flood regulation, carbon storage and sequestration, and habitat for biodiversity. The first is directly connected to soil sealing which determines a reduction of water infiltration with the consequent overloading of the existing sewerage systems. The quantitative evaluation is made using the concept of surface runoff coefficient. Instead, the estimation of the last two ecosystem services has been made using InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) models, specifically the Carbon Storage and Sequestration model and the Habitat Quality model. The results show that Land Use Changes (2012-2018) caused a potential increase of 10% in runoff and an annual Carbon Sequestration loss estimated at about euro820,000.

Nonetheless, how biochar modification affects N2O emissions during freeze-thaw cycles is not completely clear. In our research, during freeze-thaw cycles, microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of maize straw biochar (MB) or rice straw biochar (RB) addition on soil N2O emissions under different water conditions. The N2O emissions peaked at the initial stage of thawing in all the soils, and the total N2O emissions were considerably greater in the flooded soils than in the nonflooded soils. Compared with the soils without biochar addition, RB and MB amendments inhibited N2O emissions by 69 and 67%, respectively. Moreover, after biochar addition, the abundance of AOB amoA genes decreased by 9-13%. Biochar addition significantly decreased the content of microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) in flooded soil during thawing, which was significantly correlated with N2O emissions and nitrification and denitrification communities. The PLS-PM further revealed that biochar can inhibit the production and emission of soil N2O by reducing soil MBN during soil thawing. In addition, soil moisture directly significantly affects N2O emissions and indirectly affects N2O emissions through its influence on soil physicochemical properties. Our results revealed the important function of biochar in decreasing the emission of N2O in flooded soil during freeze-thaw cycles.

Bolivia ranks in the top ten countries in terms of total annual burnt, with fires affecting an estimated 2.3 million hectares of forest in 2020. However, in comparison to the Brazilian Amazon, there has been little research into the fire regime in Bolivia. The sparse research and the limited literature on the subject indicate that fire activity is higher in the Bolivian Amazon basin's dry forests and flooded savanna zones, and that agriculture and drought are the primary causes of fire activity. In this study, trend analysis and emerging hotspot analysis are deployed to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of fire activity and boosted regression tree models to identify the drivers of forest fire within each ecoregion of the Bolivian Amazon basin. Comparable to most of the Brazilian literature, this study finds that fire activity and fire season length is higher in the flooded Beni Savanna, and Chiquitano seasonally dry tropical forests than in the Bolivian Amazon ecoregion. This study also identifies moisture stress and human activity as the main drivers of fire dynamics within the region. It is intended that this research will offer a foundation for future research and conservation activities aimed at better understanding the fire regime of the Bolivian Amazon basin.

To address this knowledge gap, we used bird and vegetation data from Coyote Creek Field Station (CCFS), in the southern San Francisco Bay Area, to assess the progress of two riparian revegetation projects (1987 Revegetation, 1993 Revegetation) over nearly two decades. Restoration success was measured by changes in 1) vegetation structure and composition, and 2) avian abundance, diversity, and community composition. We compared the two revegetated areas to a remnant riparian reference site and a managed floodplain overflow channel in three time periods (1996-1998, 2004-2006, 2012-2014) using ANOVA, Tukey's HSD tests, and beta diversity analysis of avian community composition. Over time, the restored areas became more similar to the remnant riparian reference site in four of seven indices. The avian community became more similar across the habitat areas over time, although differences remained. Migratory birds declined across all habitat areas, while resident and wintering birds declined in one revegetated habitat only. Overall we found that different types of data told different stories, indicating both convergence with the reference site and ongoing differences. Our findings highlight the need for multifaceted approaches to evaluating restoration success.

J	Wang, SZ; Garlock, M; Deike, L; Glisic, B				Wang, Shengzhe; Garlock, Maria; Deike, Luc; Glisic, Branko			Feasibility of Kinetic Umbrellas as Deployable Flood Barriers during Landfalling Hurricanes	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar); Dam-break experiment; Finite-element modeling; Smoothed particle hydrodynamics; Storm surge; Hurricane Sandy; Kinetic umbrella	SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; WAVE GENERATION; SPH; FLOWS; ABSORPTION; CONCRETE	The legacy of structural artist Felix Candela is defined by his integration of thin hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar) shells within architecture across the Americas. One such form is the inverted umbrella, arising from the merger of four straight-edged hypar quadrants. The strength and elegance embodied by this geometry facilitated the recent conceptualization of kinetic umbrellas as an adaptable alternative to conventional floodwalls against surge-induced coastal inundation. Although the conceptual feasibility of such structures under hydrostatic inundation has been ascertained, their performance under combined surge and wave loading remains unknown. This paper used a three-dimensional (3D) numerical scheme integrating smoothed particle hydrodynamics with finite-element modeling for the structural analysis of kinetic umbrellas under the hydrodynamic regime. The technique was validated via dam-break testing involving 3D-printed specimens, and through empirical wave pressure formations at full scale. The behavior of kinetic umbrellas subject to surge and wave impact imparted by Hurricane Sandy (2012) at Monmouth Beach, New Jersey, was evaluated across different hypar geometries and angles of wave attack. Results showed the introduction of hypar geometry significantly enhances structural performance such that a 100-mm-thick umbrella successfully can resist hydrodynamic wave forces accompanying 2.7 m of inundation from landfalling hurricanes. Ultimately, this paper illustrates a creative yet practical structural engineering solution for mitigating the effects of climate change in coastal communities.

Sedimentology and geomorphology of Lake Yamma Yamma-A long-lived structurally controlled playa lake of the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA			English	Article						Lake Eyre Basin; field survey; remote sensing; sedimentology; grain size; geomorphology; dryland deltas; tectonism	ANASTOMOSING CHANNEL SYSTEM; COOPER-CREEK; BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; STRATIGRAPHY; RIVER; ARCHITECTURE; SHORELINES; CHRONOLOGY; FLOODPLAIN; RESPONSES	Intraplate tectonism and continental climate change have important roles in the evolution of the arid Lake Eyre Basin, one of the world's largest interior basins, and a place with economic, environmental, and cultural significance for many Australians. Just off one of the main rivers of the Basin, Cooper Creek, Lake Yamma Yamma a 20 km by 40 km ephemeral feature - traps sediment similar to 750 km upstream and similar to 90 m higher than the ultimate base level of the Basin - Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. This paper is the first to report on the sedimentology and geomorphic evolution of this modern ephemeral playa lake. Field-based sedimentology, laboratory-based grain size analysis, satellite image interpretation, inundation frequency maps, hydrological data, and digital elevation data, were used to interpret sedimentary processes and the evolution of the lake. Results suggest Lake Yamma Yamma is a long-lived feature. Evolution is primarily structurally controlled, with the main lake delta migrating north-west over time. Quaternary fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian deposition is likely controlled by intraplate tectonism, and palaeo-shorelines may be remnant features of a prior climate regime. Age dating of this sedimentary archive could provide important information on the history, palaeoclimate, and evolution of the Lake Eyre Basin, and the Australian continent.

The stems of this invasive plant die back following the first autumn frosts, leaving the soil unprotected during winter and spring floods. In Quebec (Canada), riverbank erosion may also be accentuated by ice during mechanical ice breakups. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of knotweed on riverbank erosion along a river invaded by the species, within a context of floods with ice. The elevation along 120 cross-sectional riverbank profiles, occupied or not by knotweed, was measured before and after the spring flood of 2019. On average, riverbanks occupied by knotweed had nearly 3 cm more soil erosion than riverbanks without knotweed, a statistically significant difference. Stem density also influenced erosion: the higher the density, the greater the soil loss. Certain riverside conditions, such as the slope of the riverbank or being located on an islet, interacted with knotweed, further accentuating erosion. Soil losses measured between November 2018 and May-June 2019 were particularly pronounced, but the spring flood was also exceptional, with a recurrence interval close to 50 years. On the other hand, soil loss from rivers invaded by knotweed can be expected to increase over time, as this invasive species spreads rapidly in riparian habitats.

A trench sediment profile of Maedun Cave (MC), South Korea, was analyzed geoarchaeologically. Multi-proxy analyses (palynomorphs, grain size, magnetic susceptibility, animal bones and artifacts) reflected the vegetation, hydroclimate and lives of prehistoric people at Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (ca. 40-30k cal a bp) in the early Late Paleolithic. The palynoflora consisted of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs. Under the air-circulation system in the cave, anemophilous pollen flowed in during the day, whereas waterborne pollen and spores, and freshwater algae, were transported by flooding during the summer monsoon rainy season. Mixed conifer and deciduous broad-leaved forest with an understory of pteridophytes flourished around the north-east central Korean Peninsula during MIS 3. Freshwater algae and grass pollen records may reflect precipitation intensity. It is assumed that they had flowed in during flooding caused by high precipitation during the enhanced East Asian summer monsoon, corresponding to Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) events 5 and 8 of delta O-18 GISP2 and Hulu Cave. The prehistoric people hunted herbivorous animals in the area around MC and sheltered inside it seasonally. They also used the grains of oats growing near the dwelling as a source of food.

On 25 June 2020, the outburst of the Jiwenco Glacial Lake (JGL) in the upper reaches of Nidu river in Jiari County of the QTP reached the downstream Niwu Township on 26 June, causing damage to many bridges, roads, houses, and other infrastructure, and disrupting telecommunications for several days. Based on radar and optical image data, the evolution of the JGL before and after the outburst was analyzed. The results showed that the area and storage capacity of the JGL were 0.58 square kilometers and 0.071 cubic kilometers, respectively, before the outburst (29 May), and only 0.26 square kilometers and 0.017 cubic kilometers remained after the outburst (27 July). The outburst reservoir capacity was as high as 5.4 million cubic meters. The main cause of the JGL outburst was the heavy precipitation process before outburst and the ice/snow/landslides entering the lake was the direct inducement. The outburst flood/debris flow disaster also led to many sections of the river and buildings in Niwu Township at high risk. Therefore, it is urgent to pay more attention to glacial lake outburst floods and other low-probability disasters, and early real-time engineering measures should be taken to minimize their potential impacts.

Ongoing monitoring of basic hydrological (river-water level and streamflow) and climate data are the basis for sustainable water management and long-term flood control planning. The lack of data has proven to be particularly negative during this period of global climate change, when non-seasonal flooding (during summer) is becoming increasingly frequent, and the resulting damage greater. The aim of this study was to analyse the possible use of tree ring width chronologies of trees growing in floodplain areas to reconstruct hydrodynamic variables (river-water level and streamflow). The study analysed the influence of climatic and hydrological variables on the growth of narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl) in the Sava River basin. The results indicate the significant potential of narrow-leaved ash tree-ring width chronologies to reconstruct the summer streamflows of the Sava River (R-2 = 0.45). These results can serve to develop long-term data series on the summer streamflows of the river, thereby enabling better insight into its spatial and temporal dynamics with the goal of more successful, sustainable management of floodplain areas.

However, the role of groundwater depletion on flood potential in India remains unexplored. We examine the role of changes in terrestrial water and groundwater storage on flood potential using in situ and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites observations and the simulations from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) has declined significantly (p value <0.05) with a rate of -0.63 cm yr(-1) during 2002-2016 in the Indian subcontinent. Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus, Brahmani, and Subernarekha river basins experienced a significant decline while Godavari, Mahi, Tapi, and Narmada basins witnessed a substantial increase in TWS during 2002-2016. The relative contribution of TWS on flood potential is higher than precipitation for the majority of the subcontinental river basins. The significant increase/decline in TWS in the subcontinental river basins is driven by the changes in groundwater storage either due to groundwater pumping or natural variability in climate. A significant decrease (increase) in the flood potential in Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Indus (Godavari, Narmada, and Tapi) is linked to the changes in groundwater storage, which shows the influence of groundwater storage variability beyond water and food security in the region.

However, the timing and mechanism of the integration of upstream and downstream reaches of the YR is still debated, with estimates ranging from >34 Ma to similar to 0.15 Ma. Here we address this debate by studying the detrital-zircon age spectra from three boreholes that penetrate late Miocene sediment in the lower YR floodplain. Our results show a significant provenance change between 1.6 and 1.5 Ma marking the input of new materials from the Middle Reach and/or the Upper Reach, suggesting the upstream and downstream parts of the YR were connected between 1.6 and 1.5 Ma. This late establishment of the YR is not consistent with the timing of uplift of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and surrounding mountain ranges and thus precludes a tectonic control; however, it follows the Plio-Pleistocene onset of large-amplitude sea level changes, associated with a worldwide increase of fluvial incision. We propose that Plio-Pleistocene base level fluctuations likely triggered fluvial erosion propagating upstream from the YR lower reach and were thus the main driving force for river integration.

An assessment of the optimum timing of coastal flood adaptation given sea-level rise using real options analysis	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change adaptation; coastal flooding; cost-benefit analysis; flexibility; flood risk analysis; real options; sea-level rise; uncertainty	CLIMATE; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; SOLENT; ROBUST; UK	There is large uncertainty about the changing magnitude and occurrence of coastal flood events with sea-level rise; which poses significant challenges to adaptation planning. Recent decision-making employs flexible options that can be modified/adjusted over time to address uncertainty. This research analyses a real option based method for assessing adaptation investment timing under coastal flooding and sea-level rise. This method recognises and values the flexibility of waiting as an additional adaptation option under an uncertain future, that is, the key question concerns when the option is best implemented? Real options are applied using a test-case in Lymington (UK), a floodprone coastal town. Our findings show that the option value (i.e., the net value of the overall benefit minus cost) grows with rising sea level to a maximum, which is the optimal time for the adaptation investment. The optimum investment time tends to occur at the same magnitude of sea-level rise (relative to 1990) across most sea-level rise scenarios for the same socio-economic scenario. Hence, monitoring sea-level rise provides important information to plan adaptation. The analysis provides an analytical framework on how and when to implement the adaptation option given the various future scenarios which can be developed further.

Understanding the mechanisms of how habitat degradation drives changes in spatial patterns of species assemblages is fundamental to conservation science. We conducted an empirical study to investigate the species richness (alpha-diversity) and community composition (beta-diversity) of benthopelagic biota along the gradient of human modification in West Dongting Lake, China. The study site is a large floodplain lake that has been subjected to long-term intensive human use. For a better understanding of how beta-diversity responds to human disturbance, we also distinguished between two patterns of beta-diversity, i.e., turnover and nestedness. We found that both alpha- and beta-diversity of the benthopelagic assemblage decreased along the intensity gradient of human modification, indicating the strong homogenizing effect of anthropogenic habitat alternation. Our results also suggested that multiple processes, including environmental filtering, dispersal limitation, and biological interactions, were important in shaping the benthopelagic assemblage structure because spatial turnover other than nestedness dominated the total beta-diversity at both the lake and habitat level. These findings support that habitat restoration by removing artificial banks and channels and increasing the landscape naturalness would be the key for this highly modified floodplain lake.

Better understanding of the benefits regarding the biodiversity of different silvicultural practices is important for sustainable landscape management. Conservation targets in forested landscapes should be determined by land managers and policy-makers, based on serious ecological research. This study deals with response of bird diversity to three different habitat types of temperate hardwood floodplain forests, which reflect specific forms of forest management. Research was based on long-term field bird census in the years 1998 to 2002 applying the point count method. Data was analysed using regression analysis with dummy variables. The results of the study indicate that hardwood floodplain forest heterogeneity, supported by different types of forest management (old-growth forest protection, group-selection harvesting and forest edge protection), provides large-scale habitat mosaic conditions suitable for many breeding bird species with different ecological niches. This result suggests that comparison of bird diversity response to different forest management types can be used as a decision support tool for sustainable landscape management strategy and local management practices in forested cultural lowland landscapes. Improvements in both regional and local ecological knowledge are generally needed in order to control floodplain land use decisions, which are typically made on the scale of landscape management.

A Parsimonious Framework of Evaluating WSUD Features in Urban Flood Mitigation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						water sensitivity urban design (WSUD); urban flood damage; linear regression; tradeoff; PCSWMM	WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GREEN ROOFS; DESIGN; RISK; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; QUANTITY; CAPACITY	In this study, a parsimonious framework for supporting Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) was proposed to seek a tradeoff between investment of WSUD features and mitigation of urban flood damage. A two-dimensional (2D) hydrological-hydraulic simulation model, PCSWMM, was adopted to simulate the rainfall-runoff process and inundation scenarios, and the flood damages was evaluated based on inundated water depths and damage curves. The sensitivity of deploying various design features to flood control effects was also tested, which provided useful information for identifying potential design parameters (like conduit sizes and pond locations). The proposed framework was applied to a hypothetical case adapted from an urban district in the tropical region considering various WSUD features (i.e. rainwater storage pond, rain garden, and conduit upgrading). The results showed that when the gross investment of WSUD features increased from 0 to 1.19 million $, the damage cost would decrease from 4.61 to 3.41 million $; a linear relationship (with a R-square fit at 0.9) was found suitable to represent the relationship between the investment and the damage. The proposed framework is effective in helping assess the balance between mitigation of urban flood damage and adoption of WSUD features, and could be used to support urban water managers for a more science-based decision making towards flood risk management.

Cities located along coastal areas and rivers are increasingly facing flood problems. Urbanization in combination with climate change has increased localized torrential rainfall, causing more frequent floods in some areas. Local governments have implemented hard and soft measures to mitigate the potential impact; however, public awareness of flood risk is needed for these measures to be effective. This study exploited a characteristic of the hedonic price model and investigated changes in flood risk perception by assessing changes in land value over decades in flood-prone areas in Tokyo. The flood damage records show a decrease in flood damage in vulnerable low-lying areas, while the situation remains the same in high-lying areas. The land value of the most vulnerable area has increased more than that of less vulnerable areas. The results indicate that implementing effective measures and mitigating the impacts may diminish the awareness of flood risk, and the flood risk presented on the flood hazard map may not garner the expected attention. The findings also imply that investing in flood mitigation is worthwhile and could increase resilience in vulnerable areas. Furthermore, ensuring the precautionary acts of residents and confirming the effectiveness of reactive adaptation measures contribute to reducing future loss in the context of diminishing flood risk perception.

A flood frequency analysis has been traditionally performed under stationarity assumption indicating that the statistical properties of historical flooding will not change over time. Climate change and variability challenges the stationarity assumption, and a flood frequency analysis without consideration of non-stationarity can result in under- or overestimation of the design floods. In this study, non-stationarity of annual maximum floods (AMFs) was investigated through a methodology consisting of trend and change point tests, and non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (NSGEV) models, and the methodology was applied to Campaspe River Basin as a case study. Statistically significant decreasing trends in AMFs were detected for almost all stations at the 0.01 significance level in Campaspe River Basin. NSGEV models outperformed the stationary counterparts (SGEV) for some stations based on statistical methods (i.e., Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC)) and graphical approaches (i.e., probability and quantile plots). For example, at Station 406235, AIC and BIC values were found to be 334 and 339, respectively, for the SGEV model, whereas AIC and BIC values were calculated as 330 and 334, respectively, for the NSGEV 15 model with time-varying location and scale parameters. Deriving a design flood from conventional stationary models will result in uneconomical water infrastructure design and poor water resource planning and management in the study basin.

Wild relatives of rice are potential sources for drought-resistant traits. Therefore, we compared root growth and drought response among 22 wild Oryza species, from which Oryza glumaepatula was selected as a promising source for further exploration. A geographically diverse panel of 69 O. glumaepatula accessions was then screened for drought stress-related traits, and 6 of these accessions showed lower shoot dry weight (SDW) reduction, greater percentage of deep roots, and lower stomatal density (STO) under drought than the drought tolerant O. sativa variety, Sahbhagi dhan. Based on whole-genome resequencing of all 69 O. glumaepatula accessions and variant calling to a high-quality O. glumaepatula reference genome, we detected multiple genomic loci colocating for SDW, root dry weight at 30 to 45 cm depth, and STO in consecutive drought trials. Geo-referencing indicated that the potential drought donors originated in flood-prone locations, corroborating previous hypotheses about the coexistence of flood and drought tolerance within individual Oryza genomes. These findings present potential donor accessions, traits, and genomic loci from an AA genome wild relative of rice that, together with the recently developed reference genome, may be useful for further introgression of drought tolerance into the O. sativa backgrounds. Phenotypic and genomic characterization of wild relatives of rice under drought stress reveals promising accessions, showing deeper root growth under drought and lower stomatal density.

It leads to the increase of rainstorm and flood risk, which poses a threat to the flood control safety of Lancang-Mekong Basin. Based on the precipitation data of four global climate models of CMIP6, this paper selected six indexes, including PRCPTOT and R10, to study the change characteristics of the extreme precipitation indexes in the Lancang-Mekong Basin during 1980-2020 and predicted the development trend of the extreme precipitation indexes in the Lancang-Mekong Basin during 2021-2050. The results show that from 1980 to 2020, the extreme precipitation events in regions I and IV showed an increasing trend, while those in regions II and III showed a decreasing trend. From 2021 to 2050, the extreme precipitation events in all regions of the Lancang-Mekong River show an upward trend, and most indexes increased compared with the historical period. The extreme precipitation indexes in most regions increases the most under the scenario of SSP5-8.5, while the increase is small under the scenario of SSP2-4.5; The six extreme precipitation indexes selected in the paper can better reflect the trend of extreme precipitation events and floods. The trend of extreme precipitation indexes in the Lancang-Mekong River basin in the future is more significant, which indicates that it may be affected more frequently by extreme precipitation events and floods.

Yet, the hydrologic connectivity between many river-floodplain ecosystems has been severed by anthropogenic activities that have markedly altered these ecological processes. Superimposed over anthropogenic reductions in river-floodplain connectivity, climate change is also shifting flood characteristics to produce more intense, unpredictable floods. To more efficiently manage river-floodplain ecosystems, additional research characterising the ecological consequences of unpredictable floods on fish movements is required. In this study, we used a modified fyke net to characterise the patterns and identify the important drivers of lateral movements of fish emigrating from the floodplain during contraction of a high-magnitude, late-summer flood in the Fourche LaFave River, Arkansas, in 2007. We captured approximately 43,200 fish emigrating from the floodplain over an 8-day period, representing 38 distinct species from 12 families. We related fish-emigration patterns to different stages of flood contraction and linked species-specific emigration to water-level fluctuations and associated changes in floodplain habitat availability and quality. We also show that some species exhibit body-size emigration patterns, where larger individuals emigrated from the floodplain earlier than smaller individuals. To meet conservation goals for maintaining healthy riverine ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, it will be necessary to continue characterising and identifying the ecological consequences of shifting flood characteristics within river-floodplain ecosystems.

Although hydraulic infrastructure has the potential to cause several impacts on river systems and the environment, their relevance in water resources systems is irrefutable. The human services that dams and reservoirs provide to society, e.g., hydroelectricity, water supply, irrigation, or flood control, are vital services that society requires to develop. Despite this fact, the interactions of dams and reservoirs in the river systems of South America have not been explored from a hydrological perspective. In this study, we present the first assessment of the potential effects of water storage at a basin scale in South America. For this purpose, first we present an analysis of the current conditions and the influence of water storage in the basins of the continent. Then, we estimate the potential water availability of each basin, to evaluate the role of water storage in the availability of water in the continent. Our findings indicate that the 'Colorado' and 'Negro' basins in Argentina are the most influenced by water storage in the continent. Moreover, our results suggest that reservoirs improve the potential water availability capacity, particularly in the southern basins of the continent. With this study, we expect to provide helpful insights about the current interactions of reservoirs with the river systems of the continent.

Study focus: Lake Hawassa is one of the major Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes with an endorheic basin system located near Hawassa town. The Lake water is vital to the surrounding communities for irrigation, domestic water supply, recreation, and fish harvesting. The morphological changes due to flood water from the surrounding agricultural areas were noticed and the water quality deteriorates which will be reflecting the agricultural productivity in the region and negatively impacted the socio-economic development. The lake morphometric changes were investigated by using cartographic ArcGIS mapping and bathymetric mapping and during the analysis, the thermal Infrared data of Landsat (TM) was used in the digital elevation model (30 x 30 m) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The morphometric changes for a period of 46 years were considered in this study. The Secchi discs and echo-sounder were used to during the preparation of bathymetric maps and kriging interpolation was used for the water depth assessment of the lake. New hydrological insights for the Lake: The surface area of the Lake increased by 11.28 % from 1973 to 2019. The depth and volume decreased by 33.04 % and 25.32 %, respectively over the same period. The observed Secchi disc depth was 2.06 m. It was found that the increased surface area due to sedimentation and eutrophication in the Lake.

Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) represent a relatively new response towards disaster risk reduction, water security, and resilience to climate change, which has a potential to be more effective and sustainable than traditional measures. However, in practice, these measures are still being applied at a slow rate while traditional grey infrastructure remains as a preferred choice. This can be attributed to several barriers which range from political and governance to social and technological/technical. More generally, there is a lack of sufficient knowledge base to accelerate their wider acceptance and uptake. The present work provides contribution in this direction and addresses the question of effectiveness of different types of NBS (i.e., small-and large-scale NBS) and their hybrid combinations with grey infrastructure. The work has been applied on the case of Ayutthaya, Thailand. The results suggest that the effectiveness of small-scale NBS is limited to smaller rainfall events whereas the larger (or extreme) events necessitate combinations of different kinds of measures with different scales of implementation (i.e., hybrid measures).

However, other Ecosystem Services (ES) became increasingly relevant in response to the challenges of urbanization and climate change. In total, 90 scientific articles addressing ES considered crucial contributions to the quality of life in cities are reviewed. These are classified as (1) regulating ES that minimize hazards such as heat, floods, air pollution and noise, and (2) cultural ES that promote well-being and health. We conclude that the planning and design of UGI should balance both the provision of ES and their side effects and disservices, aspects that seem to have been only marginally investigated. Climate-sensitive planning practices are critical to guarantee that seasonal climate variability is accounted for at high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, diverging and seemingly inconsistent findings, together with gaps in the understanding of long-term effects, create obstacles for practitioners. Additionally, the limited involvement of end users points to a need of better engagement and communication, which in overall call for more collaborative research. Close relationships and interactions among different ES provided by urban greenery were found, yet few studies attempted an integrated evaluation. We argue that promoting interdisciplinary studies is fundamental to attain a holistic understanding of how plant traits affect the resulting ES; of the synergies between biophysical, physiological and psychological processes; and of the potential disservices of UGI, specifically in Nordic cities.

In this study, a storm water management model was used to analyze the hydrological and water-quality effects of rain gardens (also known as bioretention cells) as nonpoint source control solutions in low-impact development (LID) practices for an urban catchment in the Nakagyo Ward area of Kyoto in Japan. The results of simulations with input involving Chicago hyetographs derived for different rainfall return periods (referred to as 3 a, 5 a, 10 a, 30 a, 50 a and 100 a) indicated the effectiveness of this arrangement, in particular for rainstorm 3 a, which exhibited the maximum contaminant reduction ratio (Total Suspended Solids (TSS) 15.50%, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) 16.17%, Total Nitrogen (TN) 17.34%, Total Phosphorus (TP) 19.07%) and a total runoff reduction volume of 46.56 x 106 L. With 5 a, the maximum number of flooding nodes was reduced to 87, demonstrating that rain gardens handle rainfall effectively over a five-year return period. There was a one-minute delay for 100 a, which again indicates that rain gardens support control of urban runoff and mitigate flooding. Such gardens were associated with reduced stormwater hazards and enhanced resistance to short-term rainstorms at the research site, and should be considered for urban planning in Kyoto and other cities all over the world.

In this sense, this study intends to analyze the environmental dynamics of the Jurua Watershed in the Amazon. We used monthly weather data derived from Reanalysis 2. The products fire foci, vegetation index and surface water index derived from the MODIS sensor for a monthly time series from 2001 to 2018. The ARIMA model was used to simulate future changes from NDFI. The lowest rainfall years of the series were 2005, 2010 and 2016 also observed for soil moisture in 2005 and 2016; the most rainfall years were 2009 and 2014, with the highest values of flooded areas in January, 23,772 km(2). The highest concentration of fire foci occurred in August and September, coinciding with the lowest NDFI values found (1421 km(2)and 890 km(2)), with the years 2005 and 2010 with highest fire foci. The EVI showed higher values from October to December with values close to 0.57, the lowest values in June and July (0.50). The years 2009 and 2015 showed largest flooded area records, 2005 and 2010 the lowest records. The PCA pointed out the rain as the variable of greatest influence in the basin with 0.98, followed by hot flashes with - 0.90. NDFI was highly correlated with rainfall and ARIMA modeling allowed the generation of a reliable future scenario and a significant downward trend in flooded areas by 2030.

However, the precipitation damage that is induced by the gas injection may be inevitable. The precipitation pressure point test of gas injection, and the WAG parallel double-tube long-core flooding experiment under different injection conditions were systematically performed to obtain the optimum injection parameters. The variations of petrophysical properties were caused by precipitation, and its morphology was also determined by centrifugal capillary force and environmental scanning electron microscope. The precipitation pressure rised with the increase of the amount of gas injection, generally 2.0 MPa similar to 3.0 MPa higher than the bubble point pressure (P-b), and it was confirmed by X-ray energy spectrum and scanning electron microscope that the precipitation was mainly asphaltene. The optimum injection parameters for WAG were Gas-Water Ratio (GWR) of 1:1 and slug size of 0.1 HydroCarbon Pore Volume (HCPV), which benefited the recovery of low-permeability and high-permeability pipe by additional recovery of 28.5% and 17.4% respectively, while WAG process enhanced the total oil recovery by 23.4%. The pore volume and median radius of capillary pressure of all cores were both reduced with more obvious effects on conglomerate. Combined with the results of sediment saturation, it also showed the poorer the physical properties of the cores, the severer the influence of the precipitation. Overall, the WAG could greatly improve the recovery but the influence of precipitation must be considered.

J	Bazart, C				Bazart, Cecile			Improving relocation acceptability by improving information and governance quality/results from a survey conducted in France	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Adaptation to climate change; Sea level rise; Perceptions; Acceptability; Communication	SEA-LEVEL RISE; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; CLIMATE; ADAPTATION; HUMOR; DETERMINANTS; BELIEF	This article focuses on the acceptability of relocation of the goods the most exposed due to sea level rise, and this increasingly recommended strategy to reduce coastal vulnerability. However, the implementation of these measures raises significant individual and political resistance. The themes of this research relate specifically to the role of communication and to trust in the institutions responsible for implementing this measure. Communication has to be designed in a way to decrease distortions in individuals' risk perception and to help improving quality of the governance of the adaptation to coastal flooding due to sea level rise. We conducted a questionnaire among 782 French coastal residents to deal with these two main dimensions of the acceptability of relocation. Firstly, we question the conditions for a favourable communication strategy by estimating the differentiated impact of communication using fear or conversely humour. Secondly, we study trust in institutions in charge of the implementation of relocation policies with several criteria of governance quality. Our results underline that humour-based communication has the comparative advantage of inducing a stronger emotional response in terms of stimulating interest and thought. Furthermore, the survey highlighted the influence of governance quality. These results confirm the decisive role of governance mechanisms for the acceptability of relocation. They also suggest a need for ongoing support to awareness-raising measures taking into account, among other psychological factors, the need for people to feel that they have some control over implemented measures.

However, defining disaster risk reduction and resilience as policy goals geared towards reducing vulnerability and minimizing risk requires a closer examination. This research examines operationalization of resilience in programs and budgets of development plans in Indonesian cities. This paper investigates the documentation of planning policies in the Indonesian context, examining National to local level efforts. The research specifically analyzes case studies at two cities, Semarang and Tegal, and highlights how these sites have accommodated the term resilience to address flooding. The scope of the research focuses on flooding as it is the most commonly experienced hazard across Indonesia. Content analysis is applied to assess identified planning documents. The content analysis is further verified through focus group discussions among key stakeholders. Findings indicate that there are fourteen areas of plans/programs in terms of reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, improved management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness to address flooding in the two selected cities. The elaboration of resilience-related programmes provides important lessons, namely that operationalizing resilience should be integrative and comprehensive, and require both short-term actionable initiative(s) and long-term transformative frameworks.

J	Duy, PN; Chapman, L; Tight, M				Phan Nhut Duy; Chapman, Lee; Tight, Miles			Resilient transport systems to reduce urban vulnerability to floods in emerging-coastal cities: A case study of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam	TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Flood vulnerability; Flood resilience; Resilient transport; Spatial planning and management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; IMPACT; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK	The role of transportation is becoming ever more important as cities are spatially expanded along with urban development, yet highly agglomerated by complex activities over their geographic territory. Flooding incidents in cities across the world have exposed the vulnerability of transport networks which can result in significant, lasting disruption. This appears to be overlooked in emerging-coastal cities, especially prone to flooding as plans for transport development, are ultimately driven by economic drivers resulting in uncontrolled urbanisation. By using a combined method of hydrological flood modeling and GIS analysis, this paper demonstrates the increasing vulnerability of the transport system in Ho Chi Minh City based on current plans for transport development. The paper highlights the need to consider a new approach to transport planning and advocates the application of a Resilient Transport System (RTS) which can be integrated into potential revisions of city master plans to help Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) shift from resistance to resilience to extreme floods. The focal point of the concept is the spatial transfer of transport flows based on a pre-organised structural and flexible transport system constituted by links, nodes and relevant services in terms of different levels of elevation and locations. The intrinsic value of its application to the transport plan is that a city can retain a certain capacity (probably on a smaller scale) of its transport system in order to mitigate potential impacts on urban activities resulting from flood disruptions.

After the dam's construction in 1997, the reservoir started filling up, expanding to a size of over 600 km2. Therefore, its possible influence on maintaining the size and water level of this waterbody is significant and concerning. This research utilized wavelet coherence analysis to examine the temporal correlation and phase coherence among various datasets, including dam injection (1998-2018) and discharge (2003-2018) data, ground station precipitation data along the Yangtze River (1998-2020), and river discharge raster maps 1998-2018. The analysis revealed a strong coherence between dam operation and river discharge rates, as well as a minor seasonal coherence between dam operation and precipitation. The periodic properties of the datasets indicate that, in addition to the general seasonal changes observed in the wavelet coherence analysis, other periodic signals in the datasets are also coherent over time. This coherence may be attributed to the simultaneous impacts of dam operation on precipitation and river discharge. The reasons for this coherence are still unknown, and further studies are required, incorporating information on soil moisture, groundwater levels, air humidity, and the monsoon, to understand how the dam affects them.

Using multiobservational datasets and model simulations covering the period 1960-2018, this study investigates the relationship that links the thermal contrast between the Asian landmass and the Indian Ocean (TCAI) to the ASM and evaluates the effects of the various driving factors that influence the TCAI in the climate models. The tropospheric TCAI is highly consistent with the ASM circulation, with a stronger ASM circulation and larger tropospheric TCAI before the 1970s and after the late 1990s than those seen from the 1970s to the late 1990s. The tropospheric TCAI is also closely related to rainfall over the Indian landmass and the south-flood-north-drought pattern over eastern China. Thus, the tropospheric TCAI reliably reflects the state of the ASM system and could be used as a new ASM index that directly describes the land-sea thermal contrast. The variation of the surface TCAI is highly consistent with that of the tropospheric TCAI. The model simulation suggests that the main drivers of the surface TCAI are anthropogenic forcing and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO). Anthropogenic forcing dominates SAT variations over the Indian Ocean, whereas the AMO plays a major role in SAT variations over the Asian landmass, which introduces a large uncertainty into the projections of the ASM.

In the context of flood risk reduction, a central impediment of transformational change is a struggle over how public participation is understood and practiced. Risk institutions are often portrayed as resistant to change, which overlooks the individuals within institutions who struggle to implement innovative power-sharing approaches/arrangements. Using two rounds of qualitative interviews spread over 5 years, this research identifies factions within the risk sector-those who view participation as awareness raising and those who are struggling to make participation part of a wider commitment to power-sharing: a group that, for the purpose of this analysis, we call "mavericks." Through focus on how mavericks struggle for change, this analysis uncovers tensions that arise as individuals attempt to alter prevailing knowledge-practices. The findings highlight the importance of experiential learning, active listening, and the alteration of space. By applying a relational conceptualisation, we explore how mavericks advocate for relationship building, which alters spaces of public participation and, in that way, lays the foundation for transformational social innovations. The conclusions offer flood risk researchers perspective on the institutional struggles that preconfigure how frontrunner projects are or are not able to facilitate the community participation needed to successfully implement societal transformations.

J	Fu, GT; Zhang, C; Hall, JW; Butler, D				Fu, Guangtao; Zhang, Chi; Hall, Jim W.; Butler, David			Are sponge cities the solution to China's growing urban flooding problems?	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						community resilience; flood resilience; nature-based solution; sponge city; stormwater management	WATER MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE	Nature-based solutions have been promoted as a sustainable solution for urban stormwater management and they are currently adopted at an unprecedented speed and scale to build sponge cities in China, with a primary aim to solving urban flood problems. However, there are limits to how much rainfall sponge cities can absorb, hence, they are unlikely to be a panacea for flooding problems in cities. We argue that bottom-up community-based measures are essential part of the intervention development framework that is required to transform sponge cities into flood resilient cities. This community-based approach can effectively build on the distinctive and unique feature of Chinese cities, that is, the prevalence of gated communities, which provides a solid foundation for implementing community-based measures for flood management. A range of such community-based measures including resilience mapping, property-based resistant and resilient measures, flood insurance, and social resilience building are discussed. Flood resilience building does not just mean investments in gray-green-blue infrastructure, it requires social transformation toward flood resilient communities. This article provides a roadmap for the next stage development of sponge cities which plays a key role in coping with extreme storm events and adapting to climate change in cities.

Here, we combine flood hazard and social vulnerability index to capture the potential risk of flood. In this paper, Nanjing was taken as the case study to explore the spatial pattern of social vulnerability towards flood at the community scale by developing an index system. Based on the flood risk results of ArcSWAT, the risk of flood disaster in Nanjing was evaluated. The results show the following. (1) Social vulnerability exhibits a central-peripheral pattern in general, which means that the social vulnerability degree is high in the central city and decreases gradually to the suburbs. (2) The susceptibility to flood disaster has a similar circle-layer pattern that is the highest in the urban centre, lower in the exurban areas, and the lowest in the suburb areas. (3) By using the GIS-based zoning approach, communities are classified into four types by comprehensively considering their flood susceptibility and social vulnerability. The spatial pattern is explained, and policy recommendation for reducing flood risk is provided for each type of community. The research has important reference significance for identifying the spatial pattern of social vulnerability to flood and then formulating targeted adaptation countermeasures.

This study evaluates uncertainty sources in the quasi-global river discharge and inundation simulations using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrologic model and the Catchment-based Macroscale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) hydrodynamic model, forced with five high-resolution satellite precipitation datasets. The simulated discharge is first evaluated against more than 2852 sites selected from the Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archive (GSIM) dataset, and then the simulated inundation is compared with complementary multiple satellite observations. Globally, about 38% - 43% of the stations produce reasonable discharge simulations with positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) on monthly time scale. The simulations show good agreement for flood fractions with mean correlations ranging from 0.47 to 0.62 for satellite detected events. The potential uncertainties sources of discharge and inundation simulation related to physics setting and forcing datasets, such as precipitation, land surface model, routing model, and observation from site and satellite are discussed, as well as future directions for improving large-scale model applications. By using default model settings, we hope our study can offer valuable insights into the applicability of flood simulations and provide guides for model development.

Ultra-high resolution regional climate projections for assessing changes in hydrological extremes and underlying uncertainties	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Regional climate projection; Hydrological extremes; Drought; Flood; Copula	RIVER-BASIN; DROUGHT INDEX; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; SENSITIVITY; PROVINCE	The frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events (droughts and floods) have been increasing over the past few decades, which has been posing a threat to water security and agriculture production. Thus, projecting the future evolution of hydrological extremes plays a crucial role in sustainable water management and agriculture development in a changing climate. In this study, we develop the high-resolution projections of multidimensional drought characteristics and flood risks using the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the horizontal grid spacing of 4 km for the Blanco and Mission River basins over South Texas. Uncertainties in model parameters are addressed explicitly, thereby leading to probabilistic assessments of hydrological extremes. Our findings reveal that the probabilistic multivariate assessments of drought and flood risks can reduce the underestimation and the biased conclusions generated from the univariate assessment. Furthermore, our findings disclose that future droughts are expected to become more severe over South Texas even though the frequency of the occurrence of droughts is projected to decrease, especially for the long-term drought episodes. In addition, South Texas region is expected to experience more floods with an increasing river discharge. Moreover, the Blanco and Mission river basins will suffer from higher flood risks as flood return periods are expected to become longer under climate change.

The approach is demonstrated through a case study application focused on San Mateo County and Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area. We use the Coastal Storm Modelling System (CoSMoS) for detailed predictions of coastal flooding and inundation of bay-shore segments. The result of these hydrodynamic interactions leads to transportation network disruptions that, in turn, lead to changes in traffic flow patterns. Specifically, under a 0.5-m sea level rise scenario that is expected to occur in 2054, we forecast transportation network disruptions due to the inundation from the sea level rise and assess the impacts of protecting OLUs in the two counties of interest in terms of travel time delay reduction over the entire San Francisco Bay Area. We use agent-based traffic simulation (MATSim) with a daily activity list for 500,000 commuters. Finally, our results identify the most critical OLUs in San Mateo County and Santa Clara County. We conclude that the optimal coastal segment protection strategies depend strongly on the hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring counties and OLUs and on the traffic flow patterns after inundations. In forthcoming studies, long-term land use pattern change should be considered to establish protection strategies of coastal areas. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

We investigated female fitness consequences of hybridization in two sister species that are endemic to a threatened tidal marsh ecosystem: Saltmarsh (Ammospiza caudacutus) and Nelson's (Ammospiza nelsoni) sparrows. We found increasing nest flooding rates due to rising sea levels are outpacing potential adaptive benefits of hybridization due to very low overall nesting success in both the Nelson's and Saltmarsh sparrows. In the center of the hybrid zone across two years, we determined the success of 201 nests of 104 pure and admixed Saltmarsh and Nelson's Sparrow females, genotyped using a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing. We evaluated 5 metrics of female fitness and modeled nesting success in relation to genotypic, environmental, and nesting characteristics. We found differential fitness among Saltmarsh, Nelson's, and hybrid females, such that birds with predominantly Saltmarsh Sparrow alleles had higher reproductive success than birds with predominantly Nelson's Sparrows alleles, and hybrids were intermediate. Fledging success increased with two known tidal marsh nesting adaptations: nest height and nesting synchrony with tidal cycles. We found a positive relationship between hybrid index and fitness in daily nest survival in 2016, but not in 2017, likely due to differing levels of precipitation and nest flooding between years. The strongest and most consistent predictors of daily nest survival were nesting synchrony with lunar tidal flooding cycles and daily maximum tide height. Fitness patterns suggest that there may be an adaptive benefit of interspecific geneflow for the Nelson's Sparrow at the detriment of the Saltmarsh Sparrow; however, flooding rates are so high in many years they mask any fitness differences between the species, and all females had poor nesting success, regardless of genetic makeup. & BULL; This study explores female fitness consequences of hybridization between Saltmarsh and Nelson's Sparrows.& BULL; We evaluated 5 metrics of female fitness, and modeled nesting success in relation to genotype, environment, and nesting characteristics.& BULL; We found differential fitness among Saltmarsh, Nelson's, and hybrid females, such that birds with more Saltmarsh Sparrow alleles had higher reproductive success than birds with predominantly Nelson's Sparrow alleles, and hybrids had intermediate success.& BULL; The most consistent predictors of nest survival and fledging success were daily maximum tide height and female nesting adaptations that mitigate the risk of nest flooding.& BULL; High rates of nest flooding due to rising sea levels may be masking species-specific effects and fitness consequences of hybridization due to very low overall nesting success in both species. La hibridacion y la introgresion pueden promover el potencial adaptativo y la resiliencia evolutiva en respuesta a las crecientes presiones del cambio climatico; tambien pueden interrumpir la adaptacion local y llevar a depresion hibrida. Investigamos las consecuencias de la hibridacion en la aptitud biologica de las hembras en dos especies hermanas endemicas de un ecosistema amenazado de marismas de marea: Ammospiza caudacutus y A. nelsoni. Encontramos que las crecientes tasas de inundacion de nidos debido al aumento del nivel del mar estan superando los posibles beneficios adaptativos de la hibridacion debido al muy bajo exito general de nidificacion tanto en A. nelsoni como en A. caudacutus. En el centro de la zona hibrida, durante dos anos determinamos el exito de 201 nidos de 104 hembras puras y mezcladas de A. caudacutus y A. nelsoni, genotipadas mediante un panel de polimorfismos de un solo nucleotido obtenidos mediante secuenciacion de ADN asociada al sitio de restriccion de doble digestion. Evaluamos cinco metricas de aptitud de las hembras y modelamos el exito de nidificacion en relacion con caracteristicas genotipicas, ambientales y de nidificacion. Encontramos una aptitud diferencial entre las hembras de A. caudacutus, A. nelsoni y las hibridas, de modo que las aves con alelos predominantemente de A. caudacutus tuvieron un mayor exito reproductivo que las aves con alelos predominantemente de A. nelsoni, y las hibridas estuvieron en una posicion intermedia. El exito de emplumamiento aumento con dos adaptaciones conocidas para la nidificacion en marismas de marea: la altura del nido y la sincronizacion de la nidificacion con los ciclos de las mareas. Encontramos una relacion positiva entre el indice de hibridacion y la aptitud en la supervivencia diaria de los nidos en 2016, pero no en 2017, probablemente debido a diferentes niveles de precipitacion e inundacion de los nidos entre anos. Los predictores mas fuertes y consistentes de la supervivencia diaria de los nidos fueron la sincronizacion de la nidificacion con los ciclos de inundacion lunar y la altura maxima diaria de la marea. Los patrones de aptitud sugieren que puede haber un beneficio adaptativo del flujo genetico inter-especifico para A. nelsoni a expensas de A. caudacutus; sin embargo, las tasas de inundacion son tan altas en muchos anos que enmascaran cualquier diferencia de aptitud entre las especies, y todas las hembras tuvieron un bajo exito de nidificacion, independientemente de su composicion genetica.

However, there has been a lack of thorough characterization of the geometric properties of segmented defects, let alone systematically calculate the severity level of sewer defects and quantitatively evaluate their impacts on flood conditions in hydrodynamic models. This study proposed a comprehensive framework and related metrics to accurately and automatically detect, segment, characterize, and evaluate the impacts of sewer defects on flooded nodes and volumes by integrating a DeepLabv3+-based segmentation technique, an automated geometric characterization and severity quantification module, and a GIS and SWMM-based hydrodynamic modeling. The results clearly showed in details where and how much the urban flooding was affected by the different defect types. The segmentation model achieved satisfactory detection performance, with mean pixel accuracy (MPA), mean intersection over union (MIoU), and frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU) of 0.99, 0.74 and 0.95, respectively. In terms of severity level quantification, there were 98%, 90%, 90% and 83% of predictions consistent with real conditions for falling off, obstacle, disjoint and leakage. It was shown that the number of surcharging manholes and total flood volume (TFV) were greatly affected by sewer defects, with over 16% increase in TFVs under all investigated rainfall events. The results addressed the impacts of sewer defects on urban flooding and demonstrated the powerful tools provided by the proposed framework for decision-making on sewer defect detection and management.

Constructed wetlands for the treatment of combined sewer overflow upstream of centralized wastewater treatment plants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Combined sewer overflow; Wastewater treatment plant; Nature-based solution; Constructed Wetland; Treatment Wetland; Ecosystem service	REDUCTION; CSO; CHALLENGES; QUALITY; GREEN; RIVER	Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) constitute nowadays a major environmental concern, representing one of the main untreated sources of pollution for receiving water bodies. Additional, in recent years, the frequency and intensity of CSOs have increased due to the growing urbanisation and climate change. Although there is no single effective strategy, one of the most promising approaches for the control and treatment of CSOs can be found in nature-based solutions (NBS), such as constructed wetlands (CWs). Despite the demonstrated potential of CWs to treat CSOs, the only data reported in the literature refer to CSO-CW systems located along the sewerage network. This research represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first monitoring of a full-scale CSO-CW designed to treat the combined sewer overflow upstream of the WWTP located in Carimate, in the province of Como (Italy). The system is a multistage CW, composed by a 1st vertical subsurface flow (VF) stage (total area of 8500 m2) and a 2nd free water surface (FWS) stage (total area of 4500 m2). The observed removal rates during the 3 years monitoring campaign (mean values equal to 83.2%, 64.6%, 63.8% for COD, TP, and N-NH4+ respectively) confirmed the treatment efficiency of CW system for all the investigated parameters, consistent with literature data for CSO-CWs in line with the sewerage network, despite its large scale and different hydraulic character-istics. Furthermore, the system also provides additional ecosystem services such as flood mitigation (average CSO interception of 82%), enhancement of biodiversity and a low operational and maintenance cost.

Therefore, we use the hydrometeorological PISCO dataset (0.1 & DEG; x 0.1 & DEG;) to drive a sub-catchment conceptual rainfall-runoff (ARNO/VIC) model and a river-routing (RAPID) model in thousands of river reaches. We identify 43 hydrological zones (with 122 sub-zones) to run the hybrid hydrological modeling framework (ARNO/VIC+RAPID) with previously calibrated and validated parameters with 43 fluviometric stations for 1981-2020. Simulated flow series show a higher performance at daily scale (KGE & GE; 0.75, NSEsqrt & GE; 0.65, MARE & LE; 1, and -25% & LE; PBIAS & LE; 25%) for catchments located at the Pacific coast and the Andes-Amazon transition, and good representation (R & GE;0.75) of seasonal and interannual variability.New hydrological insights for the region: Increasing hydrological hazards such as floods highlight the importance of a systematic hydrological analysis and modeling at national level in gauged and ungauged catchments in Peru. This study introduces a new hydrological dataset of simulated daily flow series. The results are helpful for short-term flood risk scenario simulations and longterm water resource planning as the outcomes can provide valuable information for hydrologists and water resource managers in Peruvian regions with limited or no access to in-situ networks.

J	Azad, MJ; Pritchard, B				Azad, Md Javed; Pritchard, Bill			The importance of women?s roles in adaptive capacity and resilience to flooding in rural Bangladesh	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Gender; Flood; Human capital; Social capital; Financial capital; Adaptive capacity	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; COASTAL BANGLADESH; NATURAL DISASTERS; GENDER; ADAPTATION; RECOVERY; PEOPLE; VULNERABILITY; EXPERIENCES	In rural Bangladesh, patriarchal gendered norms aggravate the vulnerability of women to di-sasters such as floods because of male dominance in access to resources and decision-making. Furthermore, these processes can render invisible women's vital roles in flood preparedness, response, rehabilitation, and recovery. A first step in addressing such gender-based inequalities in disaster contexts is to recognise and acknowledge the varied contributions made by women when a flood strikes. This paper sets out a framework to document women's roles in building adaptive capacity and resilience to floods in rural Bangladesh, using testimony evidence from 20 Focus Group Discussions in the highly flood-prone area of Sirajganj District in north-western Bangladesh. These FGDs consisted of both men and women, providing an inclusive arena for participants to express their perspectives on the roles of women during flood conditions. Re-sponses were coded within the categories of human, social and financial capital, informed by Sustainable Livelihoods Analysis. In human capital terms, women's formal and informal educa-tion and skills were identified as critical community assets. With regards to social capital, bonding, bridging and, to a lesser extent, linking forms of social capital were recognised and valued by FGD participants. In terms of financial capital, women were identified as contributing to household capacity in flood times through livelihood diversification and the protection of household financial assets. These results highlight the need for a more formal and prominent acknowledgement of women's role in disaster policy.

In this study, the Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture dataset (CCI SM, a product of the European Space Agency (ESA)) adjusted based on Soil Water Index (SWI) was used as an additional (in relation to discharge) observed dataset in agro-hydrological modeling over a large-scale transboundary river basin (Odra River Basin) in the Baltic Sea region. This basin is located in Central Europe within Poland, Czech Republic, and Germany and drains into the Baltic Sea. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool+ (SWAT+) model was selected for agro-hydrological modeling, and measured data from 26 river discharge stations and soil moisture from CCI SM (for topsoil and entire soil profile) over 1476 sub-basins were used in model calibration for the period 1997-2019. Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) indices were chosen as objective functions for runoff and soil moisture calibration, respectively. Two calibration strategies were compared: one involving only river discharge data (single-objective - SO), and the second one involving river discharge and satellite-based soil moisture (multi-objective - MO). In the SO approach, the average KGE for discharge was above 0.60, whereas in the MO approach, it increased to 0.67. The SPAEF values showed that SWAT+ has acceptable accuracy in soil moisture simulations. Moreover, crop yield assessments showed that MO calibration also increases the crop yield simulation accuracy. The results show that in this transboundary river basin, adding satellite-based soil moisture into the calibration process could improve the accuracy and consistency of agro-hydrological modeling.

Climate-induced hydrological change (CHC) has impacted the way flood control structures are used, altering the spatiotemporal water distribution. Based on "what-if " scenarios, we determine relative impacts of SLR and CHC on increased flood risk over southern Louisiana and examine the role of water management, via flood control structures, in mitigating flood risk over the region. Our findings show that CHC has increased flood risk over the past 28 years. The number of affected people increases as extreme hydrological events become more exceptional. Water management reduces flood risk to urban areas and croplands, especially during exceptional hydrological events. For example, currently (i.e., 2016-2020 period), CHC-induced flooding puts an additional 73 km(2) of cropland under flood risk at least half of the time (median flood event) and 65 km(2) once a year (annual flood event), when compared to a past period (1993-1997). A 10- to 20-fold increase relative to SLR-induced flooding. CHC also increases population vulnerability in southern Louisiana to flooding; additional 9,900 residents currently live under flood risk at least half of the time, and that number increases to 27,400 for annual flood events. Residents vulnerable to SLR-induced flooding is lower (6,000 and 3,300 residents, respectively). Conclusions are that CHC is a major factor that should be accounted for flood resilience and that water management interventions can mitigate risks to human life and activities.

This study investigates forced changes to unforced modes of wintertime atmospheric circulation variability and associated impacts on precipitation over the North Pacific and adjacent regions based on the 40-member Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble across the 1920-2100 period. Each simulation is subject to the same radiative forcing protocol but starts from a slightly different initial condition, leading to different sequences of internal variability. Evolving forced changes in the amplitude and spatial character of the leading internal modes of 500-hPa geopotential height variability are determined by applying empirical orthogonal function analysis across the ensemble dimension at each time step. The results show that the leading modes of internal variability intensify and expand their region of influence in response to anthropogenic forcing, with concomitant impacts on precipitation. Linkages between the Pacific and Atlantic sectors, and between the tropics and extratropics, are also enhanced in the future. These projected changes are driven partly by teleconnections from amplified ENSO activity and partly by dynamical processes intrinsic to the extratropical atmosphere. The marked influence of anthropogenic forcing on the characteristics of internal extratropical atmospheric circulation variability presents fundamental societal challenges to future water resource planning, flood control, and drought mitigation.

The enset [Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman] farming system is one of the most sustainable indigenous farming systems in Ethiopia. The present study uses observations and literature to review the ecosystem services of enset, the resilience of the farming system to global change, and the implications of replacing it with cereals and cash crops. From a sustainability point of view, enset is a multipurpose crop; and delivers provisioning services (food, feed, fuel, fiber, mat, wrapping, fencing, traditional medicine), cultural services (identity, homegarden ornament, and greenery), regulation services (carbon and nutrient sequestration, soil protection and control of local microclimate) and supporting services (soil formation and water cycle). It is a staple food for over 20 million people in the south and southwestern part of Ethiopia. The crop is resistant to drought, flood and frost, and can be harvested and stored for food over long periods of time. Unlike annual crops, enset requires less tillage and few off-farm inputs. In enset-coffee homegarden, the enset shade improves soil moisture availability and moderates the effect of climate change on coffee. The broad leaves of enset intercept heavy rain, reduce soil erosion and facilitate groundwater recharge. However, in most parts of Ethiopia, enset is hardly known as a food source or considered as a hardship crop. Finally, we suggest disease prevention, improvement of processing technology and farm income helps to avert the current trend of transitions from enset farming system to cash crops.

An integrated approach for physical, economic, and demographic evaluation of coastal flood hazard adaptation in Santa Monica Bay, California	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						coastal flooding; sea level rise; adaptation; multi-criteria analysis; hydrodynamic modeling; California	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; INFRASTRUCTURE; BENEFITS; HAZUS; MODEL; LAND	The increased risk of coastal flooding associated with climate-change driven sea level rise threatens to displace communities and cause substantial damage to infrastructure. Site-specific adaptation planning is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of flooding on coastal residents and the built environment. Cost-benefit analyses used to evaluate coastal adaption strategies have traditionally focused on economic considerations, often overlooking potential demographic impacts that can directly influence vulnerability in coastal communities. Here, we present a transferable framework that couples hydrodynamic modeling of flooding driven by sea level rise and storm scenarios with site-specific building stock and census block-level demographic data. We assess the efficacy of multiple coastal adaptation strategies at reducing flooding, economic damages, and impacts to the local population. We apply this framework to evaluate a range of engineered, nature-based, and hybrid adaptation strategies for a portion of Santa Monica Bay, California. Overall, we find that dual approaches that provide protection along beaches using dunes or seawalls and along inlets using sluice gates perform best at reducing or eliminating flooding, damages, and population impacts. Adaptation strategies that include a sluice gate and partial or no protection along the beach are effective at reducing flooding around inlets but can exacerbate flooding elsewhere, leading to unintended impacts on residents. Our results also indicate trade-offs between economic and social risk-reduction priorities. The proposed framework allows for a comprehensive evaluation of coastal protection strategies across multiple objectives. Understanding how coastal adaptation strategies affect hydrodynamic, economic, and social factors at a local scale can enable more effective and equitable planning approaches.

Human-centered flood mapping and intelligent routing through augmenting flood gauge data with crowdsourced street photos	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Flood; Crowdsourcing; Artificial intelligence; Floodwater depth; Route optimization; Emergency management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL MEDIA; RISK PERCEPTION; EVACUATION; INUNDATION; IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; SYSTEM	The number and intensity of flood events have been on the rise in many regions of the world. In some parts of the U.S., for example, almost all residential properties, transportation networks, and major infrastructure (e.g., hospitals, airports, power stations) are at risk of failure caused by floods. The vulnerability to flooding, particularly in coastal areas and among marginalized populations is expected to increase as the climate continues to change, thus necessitating more effective flood management practices that consider various data modalities and innovative approaches to monitor and communicate flood risk. Research points to the importance of reliable information about the movement of floodwater as a critical decision-making parameter in flood evacuation and emergency response. Existing flood mapping systems, however, rely on sparsely installed flood gauges that lack sufficient spatial granularity for precise characterization of flood risk in populated urban areas. In this paper, we introduce a floodwater depth estimation methodology that augments flood gauge data with user-contributed photos of flooded streets to reliably estimate the depth of floodwater and provide ad-hoc, risk-informed route optimization. The performance of the developed technique is evaluated in Houston, Texas, that experienced urban floods during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. A subset of 20 user-contributed flood photos in combination with gauge readings taken at the same time is used to create a flood inundation map of the experiment area. Results show that augmenting flood gauge data with crowdsourced photos of flooded streets leads to shorter travel time and distance while avoiding flood-inundated areas.

The attention from researchers and decision-makers to understand the key role of flood regulation service (FRS) in flood management has arisen. However, the mechanism of FRS supply-demand is little known from landscape scale. The FRS assessment methodology considering interacts between source, sink, and flow landscape was proposed in this study. The spatial distributions of surface runoff generation, runoff reduction capacity, and flood inundation were mapped using one-dimensional rainfall-runoff method SCS-CN and two-dimensional flood propagation model CADDIES. Four 3-hour designed rainfall scenarios ranging from nuisance to extreme events (3a, 11a, 56a, and 100a) were simulated. The Liuyang River Watershed in Changsha Municipality, China was selected for case study. The results showed that, the differences of runoff reduction coefficient and runoff generation volume between vegetation and built-up landscape have shortened. The peak flood depth, extent of flood inundation, and peak flood velocity have increased continuously with the growing rainfall intensity. The number of source-sink mismatch catchment was the highest under 56 and 100a, and the most of source-sink match catchments were observed under 3a. Under four rainfall scenarios, the changes of source-sink relationships were witnessed and the potentials of flow zone in source-sink mismatch catchments have increased. The FRS management framework concerning supply-demand connections has been proposed based on source-sink-flow analysis. These findings could provide a scientific basis for sustainable urban flood management and disaster risk mitigation.

Informal settlements refer to unplanned settlements and areas where the housing doesn & rsquo;t comply with the current housing codes and regulations and is thus characterized by a lack of legal set-tlement and housing plan approvals resulting in poor physical infrastructures and social services. Urban flood risks have been given less attention compared to rural riverine flooding in developing cities yet they cause more havoc. Using the appropriate set of models, flood modeling in urban settings is critical in integrated flood risk management. Study focus: This study uses a desk review format to promote urban flood modeling knowledge and practice in integrated flood risk management in developing cities. In this regard, the study presents the review of various flood models highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and the significant role of model calibrations in addressing uncertainties while capturing the local sce-narios. The paper further presents the role of model stacking where different models are used to understand the same hazard evolution at various scales. New hydrological insights for the region: As developing cities grow, so do the flood risks, especially in the informal settlement. This study reveals the importance of comprehensively understanding the flood dynamics at various scales. The study points out the important role of model stacking and calibrations which allows the understanding of flood risks at various city scales for an in-tegrated city flood risk management. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	[Tom, Randa O.; Joanes, Atela O.; Haron, Akala] African Ctr Technol Studies, Nairobi, Kenya; [George, Krhoda O.] Univ Nairobi, Dept Geog, Nairobi, Kenya; [Tom, Randa O.; Joanes, Atela O.] Africa Res & Impact Network, Nairobi, Kenya	University of Nairobi	Tom, RO (corresponding author), POB 45917-00100, Nairobi, Kenya.	tomranda12@gmail.com			UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) Urban Disaster Risk Hub; NERC [NE/S009000/1] Funding Source: UKRI	UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) Urban Disaster Risk Hub; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))	This review was done under the Nairobi Risk hub which is one of the city hubs under tomorrow?s Cities project.

This study develops a probabilistic method to downscale 3-hourly runoff to hourly resolution. Hourly data recorded at the Poldokhtar Stream gauge (Karkheh River basin, Iran) during flood events (2009-2019) are divided into two groups including calibration and validation. Statistical tests including Chi-Square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicate that the Burr distribution is proper distribution functions for rising and falling limbs of the floods' hydrograph in calibration (2009-2013). A conditional ascending/descending random sampling from the constructed distributions on rising/falling limb is applied to produce hourly runoff. The hourly-downscaled runoff is rescaled based on observation to adjust mean three-hourly data. To evaluate the efficiency of the developed method, statistical measures including root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and correlation are used to assess the performance of the downscaling method not only in calibration but also in validation (2014-2019). Results show that the hourly downscaled runoff is in close agreement with observations in both calibration and validation periods. In addition, cumulative distribution functions of the downscaled runoff closely follow the observed ones in rising and falling limb in two periods. Although the performance of many statistical downscaling methods decreases in extreme values, the developed model performs well at different quantiles (less and more frequent values). This developed method that can properly downscale other hydroclimatological variables at any time and location is useful to provide high-resolution inputs to drive other models. Furthermore, high-resolution data are required for valid and reliable analysis, risk assessment, and management plans.

The hydraulic and integrated modelling approaches appear to stand out in the sequence of flood risk models that have been presented because of their predictive accuracy. The former has a high probability of under predicting and the latter has a high tendency to over-predict. This study proposed a modelling approach that combines the hydraulic and integrated models using analytical hierarchical raster fusion techniques to strengthen the weaknesses of the individual models. This study seeks to undertake a flood inundation model, a runoff model, and raster fusion models using GIS and HEC-RAS rain-on-grid methods to map flood risk and perform a flood infrastructural susceptibility assessment in the Ona river basin of Ibadan city. The flood risk model's main findings revealed that 48.2% of the Ona river basin is exposed from moderate to very high flood risk. It was revealed that rainfall introduces excess stormwater into the basin, but the stream channels associated with physical features are the major influencing factors. Also vulnerable to very high flood magnitudes include places with high building, road and rail network density, and locations with a high density of damaged bridges and culverts. This study shows that the robust modelling approach presented here yielded insightful results that can be used by relevant authorities to implement flood management models and define priorities for flood catastrophe risk planning, early warning, and preparedness.

Modeling Patterns and Controls of Food Web Structure in Saline Wetlands of a Rocky Mountain Basin	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						saline wetlands; wetland food webs; invertebrate food webs; microalgae; bacterivory; deposit-feeders; dissolved organic matter	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; MINNOW PIMEPHALES-PROMELAS; FRESH-WATER; FATHEAD MINNOW; AMBYSTOMA-TIGRINUM; TIGER SALAMANDERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITIES; LAKES; DISPERSAL	Semiarid intermountain basins of western North America contain many wetlands driven by flood irrigation from mountain snowpack. With decreasing snowpack and increasing urban water demands, maintaining these islands of productivity within otherwise dry shortgrass steppe requires understanding factors that support wetland food webs. In the Laramie Basin, Wyoming, USA the two main wetland types differ in consistency of freshwater inflow and salinity-oligosaline (0.5-5 parts per thousand TDS) wetlands dominated by the macroalgae Chara spp., and mesosaline (5-18 parts per thousand) wetlands dominated by the submersed vascular plant Potamogeton pectinatus. Food web models indicate that production of epiphytic and benthic microalgae and bacteria was limiting to higher trophic levels. Production of benthic microalgae in more shaded sediments within Chara stands was only 11% of that in Potamogeton stands. However, total microalgal production was 32% greater in Chara stands because epiphyton production was 3 times higher. Nevertheless, macroinvertebrate production was 3.7 times higher in Potamogeton stands. Greater production of epiphytic (50% higher) and benthic (84% higher) bacteria fulfilled additional food web inputs required in mesosaline wetlands, which had 50% higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 84% higher sediment organic carbon available to bacteria. Dispersal limitation of amphipods after more frequent drawdowns in mesosaline wetlands may have promoted much higher biomass of competing chironomid larvae. Thus, vegetation type and direct algivory appeared less important to the structure and production of invertebrate food webs than were sediment organic matter, freshwater inflow that dilutes DOC as bacterial food, and the frequency of drawdowns that inhibit taxa with limited dispersal capability.

The impact on flood frequency was evaluated using multiple climate models under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios for 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s compared to 1976-2005. Hydrologic Engineering Center of Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) was used to simulate streamflow after sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation of the model for the catchment. Flood frequency analysis was initiated after discharge through a longer section followed by frequency analysis by partial duration series approach which provides a better result even though threshold selection is cumbersome. The results from the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test illustrate a slight increase in annual rainfall. The projected flow is expected to increase in autumn, summer, and annually by 8.34, 13.54, and 5.02% in the 2050s and 12.20, 18.06, and 11.87% in 2080s, respectively, under RCP4.5, while it is likely to increase in summer and annually by 15.66 and 5.82% in 2050s and 10.55 and 29.51% in 2080s, respectively, under RCP8.5. Flood frequency was analyzed by using Gumbel's method. The flood magnitude predicts a positive change for 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 years recurrent periods under both scenarios. This research paves way to reduce the negative impacts of flooding and plays a vital role in providing estimates of recurrence floods which are used in designing roads, dams, and bridges for sustainable water resources management.

These heterogeneous landscapes harbour high levels of biodiversity and some of the earliest records of human occupation and plant domestication in Amazonia. While persistent Indigenous legacies have been demonstrated elsewhere in the Amazon, it is unclear how past human-environment interactions may have shaped vegetation composition and structure in the ARE. Here, we examine 6000 years of archaeological and palaeoecological data from Laguna Versalles (LV), Bolivia. LV was dominated by stable rainforest vegetation throughout the Holocene. Maize cultivation and cultural burning are present after ca 5700 cal yr BP. Polyculture cultivation of maize, manioc and leren after ca 3400 cal yr BP predates the formation of Amazonian Dark/Brown Earth (ADE/ABE) soils (approx. 2400 cal yr BP). ADE/ABE formation is associated with agroforestry indicated by increased edible palms, including Mauritia flexuosa and Attalea sp., and record levels of burning, suggesting that fire played an important role in agroforestry practices. The frequent use of fire altered ADE/ABD forest composition and structure by controlling ignitions, decreasing fuel loads and increasing the abundance of plants preferred by humans. Cultural burning and polyculture agroforestry provided a stable subsistence strategy that persisted despite pronounced climate change and cultural transformations and has an enduring legacy in ADE/ABE forests in the ARE. This article is part of the theme issue 'Tropical forests in the deep human past'.	[Maezumi, S.

Several international agencies have already highlighted the extent of disaster-induced migration and called for interventions. Though these agencies present a broad perspective, either at international, national, or regional level, the status of existing empirical studies on migration induced by specific disaster events is somewhat unknown. Hence, this paper reviews the existing empirical literature on disaster-induced migration with a special emphasis on the spatio-temporal variability in migration types and patterns in response to both slow onset and rapid onset disasters. Using the Web of Science database, PRISMA framework is followed to select 43 research articles to conduct bibliometric analysis and systematic review. The review findings demonstrate a prevalence of studies on migration due to rapid onset disasters like flood, landslides and earthquakes compared to slow onset disasters like droughts. Also, migration from rural areas to urban areas are found to be the most common spatial pattern of migration irrespective of the type of disaster. The existing studies are found to concentrate on the economic drivers that induced disaster-induced migration with very less or no focus on other social or political drivers or an interplay of drivers that may lead to migration. The review demonstrates that apart from considering migration as an adaptation strategy, it is important to conduct more extensive studies on the dynamics, types and patterns, and interaction mechanism of different drivers of migration for future disaster preparedness.

That is to say, if the inter-arrival time between rainfall events with a 100-year frequency is less than the IETD (Inter-Event Time Definition), the event can be considered a mega event. Therefore, the aim of this study was to implement flood inundation analysis using the hypothetical mega event from two consecutively occurring events of 100-year frequency, and select the optimal shelters using a developed method for minimizing casualties from floods. The Gyeongan stream basin, which is a tributary of the Namhan River in Korea, was selected as the study area. This study calculates mega flood discharge using the SSARR (Stream Synthesis and Reservoir Regulation) model, and conducts a flood inundation analysis of mega floods via the level pool method and the HEC-GeoRAS model. An inundation map was constructed, and the inundated area was classified into three zones and five administrative districts. Sixteen shelters were selected as candidates based on the criteria of the local government safety management plans and the Guidelines for Establishing the Disaster Relief Plan of 2013. To evaluate the candidates for evacuation in each district, we selected seven evaluation indicators from the shelter criteria of several countries, and calculated the weights of the indicators using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. As a result, four optimal shelters were selected in the study area. The results of the study can be used as the basic information for analyzing mega natural disaster events and inundation, and for establishing evacuation shelters, which are one of the non-structural flood protection measures.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of extent variation in environmental (in)justice patterns by analyzing the statistical associations between socio-economic marginality and environmental vulnerability at three different spatial scopes: metropolitan areas, municipalities, and boroughs. Using census and geospatial data, our case study focuses on the relations between income and color/race, on the one hand, and susceptibility to flooding and landslides, on the other, in Brazil's two largest cities (Sa & SIM;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro). We constructe an integrated, census tract-level database using areal weighting interpolation combining census with susceptibility data to perform k-means multivariate clustering analysis. Although our results show that the most vulnerable to landslides and flooding are non-white, low-income people - confirming common environmental justice claims - they also suggest that spatial extent impinges on statistical patterns. While the clusters are very similar in the metropolitan and municipal scales, pointing to a fractal-like structure, they differ significantly at the borough scale. This smaller scale reveals a different picture, one in which well-to-do white people are just as exposed to hazards (especially flooding) as non-white, middle-to lower-middle-class people. We argue this is a result of elite self-exposure to risk, which is supported by sociospatially unjust distribution of risk-mitigation infrastructures. Policymakers should pay attention to such scale-dependent complexities in devising ways to cope with the increasing inequities brought about by climate change.

This study investigates the relationship between daily and longer-duration EP and corresponding W at a global scale by analyzing remote-sensed and reanalysis data sets from 2003 to 2019. An assessment of the consistency in the temporal trend across various W data sets reveals a consistent statistically significant upward trend during the period. This upward trend, while predominant worldwide, is especially significant over tropical land regions. W is found to generally be positively correlated with surface (dew point) temperature, suggesting a rise in temperature will cause a greater W over time. To assess whether EPs occur coincident with extreme W, the Concurrent Extremes Index (CEI) is proposed, which compares the cumulative distribution functions between the two variables and assumes a value of unity if ranks of the EP series are identical to that of the coincident W series, and zero with no correspondence. For EP (defined as the five largest 1-day events per year on average), a high CEI is pronounced across the tropics, except for rainforests. The W-EP relationship is noticeably weakened in nontropics, except the inland regions of North America and East Asia. An assessment indicates that as the duration of the EP becomes longer, the influence of W on EP decreases. However, the contrast in the W-EP relationship between the tropics and nontropics is found to become more pronounced as longer-duration EPs are considered.

This study focuses on the reconstruction of the Holocene deposition history of the Loosbach valley at the Pestenacker site, a Late Neolithic wetland occupation in the northern Alpine forelands of Central Europe (South Germany). Since 2011, it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage 'Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps'. This study aims to reconstruct a potential passing of a Middle Holocene hydrological tipping point in the Loosbach valley and its interrelation with the Late Neolithic onset of valley occupation at that time. In this context, we make use of chronostratigraphical data sets about the Holocene fluvial dynamics of Loosbach stream from available archaeological excavation reports and spatially enlarge the local model of Holocene stream evolution with high-resolution direct push cross-sections from the proximate fen stratigraphies. As a result, the onset of the Late Neolithic settlement phase corresponds with a local hydrological tipping point at the wetland site of Pestenacker. Increased cooling and climatic humidity led to stream incision into the valley floor that resulted in draining, a local decrease of the groundwater table and the end of fen formation. As an apparently contradictory result of this process, increased water availability and run-off correspond with increased edaphic aridity on the valley floor. The latter may have made it possible to settle the valley floor during the late Neolithic. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Temporal and spatial patterns of common hippopotamus populations in the Okavango Delta, Botswana	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						aerial surveys; habitat use; Hippopotamus amphibius; population trends; spatial patterns	GONAREZHOU-NATIONAL-PARK; AMPHIBIUS; WETLANDS; WATER; CLIMATE; RIVER; CONSERVATION; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY; RESOURCES	Conservation requires reliable estimates of a species' population and their spatial distribution. Knowledge of large-scale habitat use and population trends in common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; hereafter hippo) in wetland ecosystems is limited, with no studies of hippo populations in the Okavango Delta (the Delta), Botswana. We examined the drivers of long-term trends and spatial patterns in the Delta's hippo population, using 13 years of aerial surveys (1996-2018) informing on the potential impacts of changes in inflow, flooding patterns and rainfall on hippo populations. We estimated temporal changes in hippo populations and relationships with rainfall and inflow. We also examined how spatially explicit hippo counts related to flood and surface water extent and vegetation class at different scales. The Delta's hippo population has increased, probably due to increasing long-term rainfall and inflow, following a period of severe drought/low flooding. Hippos were positively associated with areas with high variation in flooding and negatively associated with broad-scale surface water extent, indicating hippos avoided permanent swamps and main channels, probably due to water depth, lack of nearby grazing, and thick riparian vegetation. At a fine scale, hippos relied on large lagoons for daytime refuge. The most recent population estimate indicates that Botswana has the third highest hippo population in Africa, reflecting the importance of the Delta. Reductions in inflow and rainfall from climate change and water resource development would threaten these hippo populations by reducing grazing availability, lagoon sizes, and seasonal swamps. Ongoing monitoring of hippos should continue as they represent a good indicator for the entire floodplain ecosystem.	[Inman, Victoria L.; Bino, Gilad; Kingsford, Richard T.; Leggett, Keith E.

In the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, little is known about the demographic structural status and recruitment of floodplain and riparian tree species. The aim of this study is to provide a baseline assessment of the current demographic structure of the ecosystem-defining tree species: River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah), Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) within the basin in Queensland. Tree size data were collected from 131 plots of 0.25 ha located along major waterways and the abundance of individuals at the seedling, young tree, mature and senescent life cycle stages was determined. The diameter size distribution for the four species approximated a negative exponential distribution (reverse J-curve). Low tree abundance in the < 10-cm diameter class in all the species relative to the reverse J-curve suggested low recruitment and possible early evidence of a decline in the sustainability of the populations according to the Law of de Liocourt. This low abundance of young trees was more pronounced in Black Box and extended to the < 20-cm diameter class, but this species was not well replicated, and more data are required. In addition, the low abundance of recruitment trees occurred concurrently with the observed below average rainfall and erratic rainfall distribution in the last two decades relative to long-term totals. These results suggest a need for management interventions to foster seedling recruitment such as grazing management and tree planting programmes to ensure species establishment and survival along basin waterways.

The concentrations of determinands in the inflow vary greatly from those in the river, leading to very long mixing lengths in the river downstream of the inflow location. Ideally, a two-dimensional (2D) model would be used on a small scale to capture the mixing of the two flow streams. However, for large-scale applications of several hundreds of kilometres of river length, such an approach demands too many computational resources and too much computational time, especially if the application will at some point require ensemble input from climate-change scenario data. However, a one-dimensional (1D) model with variables varying in the longitudinal flow direction but averaged across the cross-sections is too simple of an approach to capture the lateral mixing between different flow streams within the river. Hence, a quasi-2D method is proposed in which a simplified 1D solver is still applied but the discretisation of the model setup can be carried out in such a way as to enable a 2D representation of the model domain. The quasi-2D model setup also allows secondary channels and side lakes in floodplains to be incorporated into the discretisation. To show proof-of-concept, the approach has been tested on a stretch of the lower Athabasca River in Canada flowing through the oil sands region between Fort McMurray and Fort MacKay. A dye tracer and suspended sediments are the constituents modelled in this test case.

While the KRB has vast water resources, these resources are subject to extreme hydrologic events and, as a result, are not adequately managed to deal with the stress during drought conditions in the transboundary setting with no formal agreement or treaty. Rapid population growth and increases in agricultural land will require balanced water distribution to meet the array of needs. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to evaluate distribution options for flow frequencies under existing and proposed large dams in the headwaters of the KRB. The calibrated SWAT streamflow results are employed for statistical analyses of the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) and Annual Cumulative Deficit Volume (ACDV) to investigate hydrologic drought time series and identify the role of proposed dams to be used for drought mitigation. Based on the SSI, proposed dams can provide additional storage that will partially address hydrologic droughts in the future. At the same time, restrictions on agricultural land expansion and water intakes are other measures to facilitate balanced water resource availability. This study discusses the intricacies of transboundary conflict and cooperation, water rights, and drought risk management; as well, recommendations for a KRB transboundary Drought Task Force (DTF) between Afghanistan and Pakistan are provided, to develop a science-based policy for using the stored waters in large dams for drought relief, fairly and transparency.</p>	[Taraky, Yar M.; McBean, Edward; Daggupati, Prasad; Shrestha, Narayan Kumar; Jiang, Albert; Gharabaghi, Bahram] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Liu, Yongbo] Univ Guelph, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada	University of Guelph; University of Guelph	Gharabaghi, B (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.	ytaraky@uoguelph.ca; emcbean@uoguelph.ca; lyongbo@uoguelph.ca; pdaggupa@uoguelph.ca; shresthn@uoguelph.ca; zjiang@uoguelph.ca; bgharaba@uoguelph.ca	Gharabaghi, Bahram/F-9977-2016; Daggupati, Prasad/D-8886-2017	Gharabaghi, Bahram/0000-0003-0454-2811; Jiang, Albert/0000-0002-3541-5498	Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada [400675, 400677]	Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))	This research was funded by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (#400675 and #400677).		76	6	7	2	16	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4441		WATER-SUI	Water	OCT	2021	13	19							2628	10.3390/w13192628	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192628			23	Environmental Sciences; Water Resources	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources	WH7NG		gold			2024-04-22	WOS:000707858900001

This study focused on the Lidian alluvial fan in the northern piedmont of Zhongtiao Shan, north China, to study the fluvial responses to paleoenvironmental changes since the late Last Glacial Maximum. In combination with series of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C dating data on fan sediments, sedimentary analyses indicated that the primary fan accumulation was controlled by episodic millennium-scale debris and sheet flood flow related aggradation during 13.3-13.0, 12.7-11.3, 6.2-4.5, and 4.5-2.8 cal ka BP. Between the accumulation periods, the fan process was dominated by aeolian paleosol-and-loess sequence development and the reworking of fan clasts. Considering regional hydraulic conditions and sediment flux, we proposed that the millennium-scale episodic debris flow related fan aggradation during 13.3-13.0, 12.7-11.3, and 4.5-2.8 cal ka BP was controlled by high-volume sediment influx of the permafrost and physical weathering during cold events. The millennium-scale sheet flood-dominated fan aggradation event during 6.2-4.5 cal ka BP was related to the abrupt coarsening and high sediment yield forced by tectonic uplift. We also suggest that the scattered distributed channelized floods and debris backfilling sediments within the fine-grain layers indicate that the deposition of irregular fan lobe accumulation coincided with hydraulic shifts over shorter temporal scales.

In 2017 and 2018, we monitored 855 nests of four species of colonial nesting waterbirds on Rabbit Island, LA, to determine factors affecting nest and chick success. Based on logistic exposure models of nests, tricolored herons had the greatest likelihood of survival to hatch (mean (95% confidence interval)) (77% (65.9-83.1%)), followed by brown pelicans (70% (59.9-98.5%)), roseate spoonbills (70% (38.9-83.8%)), and Forster's terns (12% (10.7-12.2%)). Likelihood of survival to fledge was highest for tricolored herons (32% (12.8-40.7%)), followed by brown pelicans (28% (19.5-28.6%)), roseate spoonbills (47% (43.7-53.3%)), and Forster's terns (0% (0.005-0.01%)). Nesting strategy and nest timing impacted survival rate; however, the effect depended on timing of inundation events as the timing of inundation events varied across years. Flooding was the primary cause of nest failure for most species. In 2003-2012, rapid expansion in brown pelican colony numbers and significant chick production occurred at Rabbit Island, but hydrologic records indicate no island inundation occurred during the breeding season from the beginning of the hydrologic record (2006) through 2011. Thus, our results contrast with those of previous studies conducted under different hydrologic conditions and demonstrate the challenges of short-term studies informing coastal restoration in a system that is influenced by multi-year to multi-decadal climatic cycles.

Experiments were con-ducted using a medical grade CT scanner to determine saturation using a custom Python script. The saturation and differential pressure across the core were then used to derive four empirical constants to calculate relative permeability. This methodology increases temporal efficiency while reducing experimental complexity. Addition-ally, we show that the method can be used to determine scCO(2) relative permeability in a wide range of lithologies and flow rates, and with the ability to account for matrix dissolution during scCO(2) flooding. Plain Language Summary: : The ability to capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important component of efforts to slow climate change. Long-term geologic storage of CO2 requires accurate descriptions of injected CO2 in subsurface rock formations to account for stored volumes and develop adequate risk monitoring. Effectively describing the migration of CO2 injected in underground reservoirs requires an accurate description of how CO2 moves and interacts with the rock. Relative permeability, or the description of how efficiently a fluid moves in a porous media while in the presence of other fluids, is the most utilized tool for describing the competitive flow of fluids. In this study, we detail a modified unsteady-state methodology using computed tomography that provides relative permeability quickly and can be used to analyze heterogenous media. The methodology can be used to describe the impacts of dissolution on CO2 transport through reactive cores, which to the authors knowledge, has not been described in the literature previously.

In the present study, we have analyzed the long-term trend of 116 years (1901-2016) of precipitation and distribution of extreme precipitation index over the Kosi River Basin (KRB), which is one of the frequent flooding rivers of India, using the 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees resolution gridded precipitation datasets obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), India. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test together with Sen's slope estimator was employed to determine the trend and the magnitude of the trend of the precipitation time series. The annual and monsoon seasons revealed decreasing trends with Sen's slope values of -1.88 and -0.408, respectively. For the extreme indices viz. R10 and R20 days, a decreasing trend from the northeastern to the southwest part of the basin can be observed, whereas, in the case of highest one-day precipitation (RX1 day), no clear trend was found. The information provided through this study can be useful for policymakers and may play an important role in flood management, runoff, and understanding related to the hydrological process of the basin. This will contribute to a better understanding of the potential risk of changing rainfall patterns, especially the extreme rainfall events due to climatic variations.

To reveal chemical weathering processes and environmental health risks during flood periods, water samples were collected in the upper reaches of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in 2020. HCO3- and Ca2+ were the most abundant anions and cations of the river water, respectively. The range of HCO3- concentration was between 1.81 and 3.02 mmol/L, while the mean content of Ca2+ was 1.03 mmol/L. The results of the Piper diagram and element ratios revealed that the river solutes were mainly contributed by carbonate weathering and gypsum-rich evaporite dissolution. A mass balance model indicated that the contribution order of sources to cations in the main channel (Yibin-Luzhou) was evaporites > carbonates > atmospheric input > silicates. The order in the Chongqing-Three Gorges Dam was carbonates > atmospheric input > evaporites > silicates. These results showed a lithologic control on hydrochemical characteristics. Most sampling sites were suitable for agricultural irrigation according to the water quality assessment. However, indexes sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and soluble sodium percentage (Na%) were higher than 1.0 in Yibin-Luzhou and 30% in Yibin-Chongqing, respectively, suggesting a potential sodium hazard. In addition, except Tuojiang River and Shennong River, the risk of sodium hazard in tributaries was relatively low. High Na+ concentration in irrigation water can damage soil structure and function and ultimately affect agricultural production. Water quality in the upstream of a Piper diagram should attract enough attention.

WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate Change; Flood; Hook structure; Precipitation extremes; Thermodynamic responses	HOURLY PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; HUMID FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; PART 2; RUNOFF; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; CHINA; REFORESTATION; DEPENDENCE; INCREASES	Atmospheric moisture holding capacity increases with temperature by about 7% per degrees C according to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. Thermodynamically then, precipitation intensity should exponentially intensify and thus worsen flood conditions as the climate warms. However, regional and global analyses often report a nonmonotonic (hook) scaling of precipitation and runoff, in which extremes strengthen with rising temperature up to a maximum or peak point (T-pp) and decline thereafter. The underlying cause of this hook structure is not yet well-understood, and whether it may shift and/or regulate storm runoff extremes under anthropogenic climate warming remains unknown. Here, we examine temperature scaling of precipitation and storm runoff extremes under different climate conditions using observations and large ensemble hydroclimatic simulations over mainland China. In situ observations suggest a spatially homogeneous, negative response of relative humidity to warming climates over 34.6% of the land area, and the remaining hook-dominated regions usually show a colder T-pp than that of precipitation or storm runoff extremes. The precipitation and streamflow series over mainland China's catchments throughout the 21st century are projected by a model cascade chain under a high-end emission scenario (RCP 8.5), which involves 31 CMIP5 climate models, 11 CMIP6 climate members, a daily bias correction method, and four lumped conceptual hydrological models. The CMIP5 ensemble projects that the hook structures shift toward warmer temperature bins, resulting in 10%-30% increases in storm runoff extremes over mainland China, while the CMIP6 ensemble projects more severe flood conditions in future warming climates.

Reservoir operations for each member of an ESP are individually modeled to forecast system conditions and calculate risk of reaching critical operational thresholds. Reservoir release decisions are simulated to manage forecasted risk with respect to established risk tolerance levels. EFO was developed for Lake Mendocino, a 111,000 acre-foot reservoir near Ukiah, California, to evaluate its viability to improve reservoir storage reliability without increasing downstream flood risk. Lake Mendocino is a dual use reservoir, owned and operated for flood control by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and operated for water supply by Sonoma Water. EFO was simulated using a 26-year (1985-2010) ESP hindcast generated by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center, which provides 61-member ensembles of 15-day flow forecasts. EFO simulations yield generally higher storage levels during the flood management season while maintaining needed flood storage capacity by strategically prereleasing water in advance of forecasted storms. Model results demonstrate a 33% increase in median storage at the end of the flood management season (10 May) over existing operations without marked changes in flood frequency for locations downstream from Lake Mendocino. EFO may be a viable alternative for managing flood control operations at Lake Mendocino that provides multiple benefits (water supply, flood mitigation, and ecosystems) and provides a management framework that could be adapted and applied to other flood control reservoirs.

We explore the impact of this uncertainty on economic damage due to sea-level rise for 136 major coastal cities. We compare the probability distribution for damage under the assumption of no adaptation for two relative sea-level projections: the RCP 8.5 scenario from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and a High-end scenario that incorporates expert opinion on additional ice- sheet melting. We use the 50th and 95th percentiles to estimate expected damage and one risk measure, the Expected Shortfall ES (95%), which represents the impact of low-probability, high-damage coastal flood risk (above the 95th percentile). Aggregate expected damage by 2050 under RCP 8.5 is US$1,600 billion, while the aggregate risk measure ES(95%) is almost twice as much as the average damage at US$3,082 billion. Under the High-end scenario, ES(95%) figures in Guangzhou and New Orleans by 2050 are twice as high as the expected damage. The city of Guangzhou leads the ranking under both scenarios, followed by Mumbai and New Orleans. Our results suggest that it is critical to incorporate the possibility of High-end scenarios into coastal adaptation planning for future sea-level rise, especially for risk-averse decision-making.

The predicted increase in flooding frequency and severity due to climate change could increase N2O emissions and shift grasslands froma net CH4 sink to a source. Therefore, effectivemanagement strategies are critical formitigating greenhouse gas emissions fromflood-prone grasslands. We tested howrepeated flooding affected the N2O and CH4 emissions from11 different plant communities (Festuca arundinacea, Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis, and Trifolium repens in monoculture, 2- and 4-species mixtures), using intact soil cores froman 18-month old grassland field experiment in a 4-month greenhouse experiment. To elucidate potential underlying mechanisms, we related plant functional traits to cumulative N2O and CH4 emissions. We hypothesized that traits related with fast nitrogen uptake and growth would lower N2O and CH4 emissions in ambient (non-flooded) conditions, and that traits related to tissue toughness would lower N2O and CH4 emissions in flooded conditions. Wefound that flooding increased cumulative N2O emissions by 97 fold and cumulative CH4 emissions by 1.6 fold on average. Plant community composition mediated the flood-induced increase in N2O emissions. In flooded conditions, increasing abundance of the grass F. arundinacea was related with lower N2O emissions; whereas increases in abundance of the legume T. repens resulted in higher N2O emissions. In non-flooded conditions, N2O emissions were not clearly mediated by plant traits related with nitrogen uptake or biomass production.

While scenario planning integrating urban growth prediction modeling is becoming more common, these models have not been effectively linked with future flood plain changes due to sea level rise. This study advances scenario planning by integrating urban growth prediction models with flood risk scenarios. The Land Transformation Model, a land change prediction model using a GIS based artificial neural network, is used to predict future urban growth scenarios for Tampa, Florida, USA, and future flood risks are then delineated based on the current 100-year floodplain using NOAA level rise scenarios. A multi-level evaluation using three urban prediction scenarios (business as usual, growth as planned, and resilient growth) and three sea level rise scenarios (low, high, and extreme) is conducted to determine how prepared Tampa's current land use plan is in handling increasing resilient development in lieu of sea level rise. Results show that the current land use plan (growth as planned) decreases flood risk at the city scale but not always at the neighborhood scale, when compared to no growth regulations (business as usual). However, flood risk when growing according to the current plan is significantly higher when compared to all future growth residing outside of the 100-year floodplain (resilient growth). Understanding the potential effects of sea level rise depends on understanding the probabilities of future development options and extreme climate conditions.

This motivates many studies to optimally design UDSs often using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) as they can explore trade-offs between conflicting objectives (e.g., cost vs. system reliability). However, MOEA-based approaches are typically computationally demanding and their solutions are often practically unacceptable as engineering domain knowledge is often not explicitly considered. To address these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient optimization framework for UDS design, where an engineering-based design method (EBDM) is developed to generate approximate solutions to initialize the MOEA's search, thereby greatly enhancing the optimization efficiency. To improve the solution practicality, two ideas have been implemented in the proposed optimization method (PM): (i) the variability of peak depths across pipes is minimized and (ii) a constraint is introduced to ensure that sizes of pipes in the downstream direction are no smaller than their corresponding upstream diameters. Two real-world UDSs of different size are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PM. Results show that (i) the proposed EBDM is effective in producing initial solutions that are very close to the final solutions identified by the optimization methods, (ii) the minimization of the variability of peak depths in pipes is practically meaningful as it can facilitate to identify solutions with great ability in handling future uncertainties (e.g., rainfall variability), and (iii) the PM significantly improves optimization efficiency and solution practicality compared to the traditional optimization approach, with benefits being more prominent for larger UDSs.

Understanding rivers and their social relations: A critical step to advance environmental water management	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Review						environmental flows; environmental water allocations; freshwater; rivers; social-ecological systems	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FLOW REQUIREMENTS; COLORADO RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOODPLAIN; PEOPLE; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; FISH	River flows connect people, places, and other forms of life, inspiring and sustaining diverse cultural beliefs, values, and ways of life. The concept of environmental flows provides a framework for improving understanding of relationships between river flows and people, and for supporting those that are mutually beneficial. Nevertheless, most approaches to determining environmental flows remain grounded in the biophysical sciences. The newly revised Brisbane Declaration and Global Action Agenda on Environmental Flows (2018) represents a new phase in environmental flow science and an opportunity to better consider the co-constitution of river flows, ecosystems, and society, and to more explicitly incorporate these relationships into river management. We synthesize understanding of relationships between people and rivers as conceived under the renewed definition of environmental flows. We present case studies from Honduras, India, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia that illustrate multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts where recognizing and meeting diverse flow needs of human populations was central to establishing environmental flow recommendations. We also review a small body of literature to highlight examples of the diversity and interdependencies of human-flow relationships-such as the linkages between river flow and human well-being, spiritual needs, cultural identity, and sense of place-that are typically overlooked when environmental flows are assessed and negotiated. Finally, we call for scientists and water managers to recognize the diversity of ways of knowing, relating to, and utilizing rivers, and to place this recognition at the center of future environmental flow assessments.

However, Miocene continental climate dynamics and the forcing of aridification are still not well constrained. Neogene lacustrine mudflat deposits in the Ili Basin in southeast Kazakhstan provide a well-exposed paleoclimate archive. Here, we present a detailed rock magnetic study of a middle Miocene playa cycle deposited in a closed basin. We use high-resolution rock magnetic parameters, lithological studies and geochemistry to reconstruct the playa environment and the depositional conditions. The rock magnetic mineralogy of the playa cycle is controlled by hematite and two fine-grained magnetite phases. Increased magnetic concentrations occur during dry mudflat conditions, with a lower groundwater table and increased aridity. The underlying processes controlling the observed variation in magnetic concentrations are a complex interplay of diagenetic processes during and after deposition. The data support an authigenic origin of both magnetite phases, one formed before and the other after sediment consolidation. Early diagenetic formation of fine-grained magnetite by microbial activity is followed by post-depositional formation of a secondary fine-grained magnetite phase. The rock magnetic results such as magnetic concentration-dependent parameters, ARM/SIRM and s-ratio indicate a sensitive record of (ground) water availability and aridity changes in the Ili Basin. We suggest that they can serve as an effective proxy for detailed paleo-environment reconstruction of playa evolution, not only in the middle Miocene Ili Basin but also in comparable floodplain/playa lake settings.

The precipitation in DJK basin has been observed to be a decreasing trend, which inevitably has a negative impact on the water resources management and planning in the MRCSNWDP. In this paper, the four varying-parameter probability distribution function models called as GEV-1, GEV-2, PE3-1, and PE3-2 were firstly proposed to assess the DJK annual precipitation change at the level of quantile, then the Bayesian method was used to quantify the uncertainty of such assessment results, finally the equivalent reliability (ER) method was applied to calculate the return level of DJK annual precipitation corresponding to the different return periods and different length of planning periods. Results indicated that quantiles of DJK annual precipitation with the given non-exceedance probabilities of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 experienced an obvious decreasing trend in the observed period, and in the future, the quantile of annual precipitation was expected to become less. The ER-based estimation of the return level of DJK annual precipitation corresponding to the return period of 10, 20, 50, and 100years over the next few decades showed that such return level with a given return period would decrease but its uncertainty would increase with the length of planning period increasing. These could bring great challenges to the water resource management and planning of the MRCSNWDP.

J	Gori, A; Blessing, R; Juan, A; Brody, S; Bedient, P				Gori, Avantika; Blessing, Russell; Juan, Andrew; Brody, Samuel; Bedient, Philip			Characterizing urbanization impacts on floodplain through integrated land use, hydrologic, and hydraulic modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Floodplain management; Flood risk; Land use/land cover change; Urbanization; Distributed hydrologic model	URBAN-GROWTH; RIVER-BASIN; STREAM FLASHINESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RUNOFF; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; AREA	In the United States, fluvial flood risk is managed by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which delineates areas that have a 1% chance of flooding each year (i.e. the 100-year floodplain). Development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume, shortening the time to peak, and altering the extent of the floodplain. This paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100-year floodplain in a watershed in Houston, TX through land use projection, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site-scale development policies on runoff response. The methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1D/2D unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates. Current site-scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050. Results indicate that the 100-year floodplain can expand by up to 12.5% across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies, and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18.8%. This study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds, and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development.

The irrigation efficiency trap: rational farm-scale decisions can lead to poor hydrologic outcomes at the basin scale	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						groundwater-surface water; aquifer recharge; Idaho; Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer; irrigation efficiency; return flow; reach gain	MANAGED AQUIFER RECHARGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-POLICY; SURFACE-WATER; RIVER-BASIN; CONSERVATION; CALIFORNIA; SYSTEMS; FLOOD; TECHNOLOGIES	Agricultural irrigation practices have changed through time as technology has enabled more efficient conveyance and application. In some agricultural regions, irrigation can contribute to incidental aquifer recharge important for groundwater return flows to streams. The Henrys Fork Snake River, Idaho (United States) overlies a portion of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer, where irrigated agriculture has occurred for over a century. Using irrigator interviews, aerial and satellite imagery, and statistical streamflow analysis, we document the impact of farm-scale decisions on basin-scale hydrology. Motivated to improve economic efficiency, irrigators began converting from surface to center-pivot sprinkler irrigation in the 1950s, with rapid adoption of center-pivot sprinklers through 2000. Between 1978-2000 and 2001-2022, annual surface-water diversion decreased by 311 Mm3 (23%) and annual return flow to the river decreased by 299 Mm3 over the same period. Some reaches that gained water during 1978-2000 lost water to the aquifer during the later period. We use an interdisciplinary approach to demonstrate how individual farm-scale improvements in irrigation efficiency can cumulatively affect hydrology at the landscape scale and alter groundwater-surface water relationships. Return flows are an important part of basin hydrology in irrigated landscapes and we discuss how managed and incidental aquifer recharge can be implemented to recover return flows to rivers.

We define "riverscour" as "open riparian habitats of rocky, stable-substrate (bedrock, boulder, cobble) zones, often along high-gradient streams, where periodic high-energy flows (water, ice, debris) and edaphic factors inhibit woody vegetation and promote persistent grassland-shrubland-open woodland-outcrop communities rich in conservative heliophytes." A key factor distinguishing riverscour from gravel and sand bars and other floodplain habitats is that these areas are underlain by more stable substrates, which resist structural reworking by floodwaters. Within Eastern Unglaciated North America, we mapped 1322 stream reaches totaling 2385.8 km containing riverscour. Given their small size, these communities support a disproportionately large number of rare, endemic, and undescribed species. For example, within a five-county area in Tennessee, riverscour makes up significantly less than 1% of the area but contributes at least 37 (25%) of the region's 150 state- and federally-listed vascular plant species. There are numerous threats to riverscour, the greatest being inundation caused by impoundment of rivers and associated downstream hydrologic alterations. Interruption of scouring processes associated with flooding and/or ice promotes succession toward larger woody species and away from open herbaceous/shrub-dominated vegetation. Other threats include invasive species, recreation pressure, and climate change. These threats, coupled with high biodiversity and historical losses, make protection and proper management of riverscour ecosystems especially important in conserving the native biodiversity of eastern North America.

Moreover, the water distribution system's ability to supply consumers is being overwhelmed because of urbanization, population concentration, and increases in water consumption. For this reason, to solve the water shortage problem, water reuse technologies are developing and improving that perform simple chemical treatment processes to reuse water for flushing toilets, washing, gardening, etc. but not as drinking water. However, most water reuse systems are designed and operated as independent systems, such as reusing water used in individual buildings or using rainwater. Therefore, this study develops an optimal design for the combined water systems, which is modeling and designing water distribution systems, urban drainage systems, and water reuse systems simultaneously to solve the water shortage and reduce flooding damage. To consider the combined water systems design, the existing water distribution system (WDS) demand is divided into drinking water and other uses, and the resource of other water is assumed by the rainwater storage tank for covering the amount of exceeding precipitation. To derive optimal design solutions for the combined three water systems, single- and multi-objective optimization techniques are applied considering various design criteria (i.e., construction cost, system resilience, and flooding volume on the exceeding design rainfall intensity). The developed combining water system design techniques could be used to create designs that solve the problems of medium and long-term water shortages and sustainable water systems development.

Today, Nature-based solutions (NbS) are required to respond to challenges such as flooding that affect both the human population and estuarine ecosystems. Estuarine ecosystems such as saltmarshes and floodplain forests provide valuable services, and wetland restoration for flood control is suggested. Recently, flow velocities attenuating the effects of juvenile floodplain willows and wave attenuation through White willow trees under extreme conditions have been found. Services in flood control seemed promising. However, large woods do not bend and may cause turbulence. On the contrary, complex and flexible woody vegetation bends in response to currents and reduces velocities, thereby inducing lower turbulence, but knowledge of the diversity and structure of tidal willow floodplain forests (TWFF) is lacking. Thus, first, an observational study on the occurrence of TWFF in European estuaries along the North Sea was carried out. Based on findings in aerial images, only small TWFF fragments were confirmed in the field for the Elbe, Ems, Dutch delta, and the Scheldt estuary. Based on these findings and the analyses of management plans, the restoration of TWFF was planned, implemented, and studied, including a long-term study at the Elbe estuary upstream stretch. The results of the restoration efforts are provided, including the long-term study (2012-2022) on a restored TWFF in the Elbe estuary, which could serve as a pilot for TWFF restoration and adapting estuarine communities to climate change via NbS.

The inclusion of natural water retention measures (NWRM) such as dike relocation and floodplain restoration into the German guidelines for flood protection institutionalized the new concepts in Germany. Whereas small scale NbS and the affected population have already been subject to thorough scientific research, large-scale NbS and the decision-makers assigned with the measure's implementation have yet to be studied. How do administrative decision-makers perceive the new approach and measures? Are there particular attitudes among the decision-makers regarding NbS? Which aspects of implementing large-scale NbS influence possible attitudes? Which hurdles do decision-makers concern for the implementation of the new concepts? This paper investigates these questions on the example of dike relocation and floodplain restoration using Q-methodology with administrative decision-makers of flood protection authorities in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The consecutive statistical analysis unveiled three significant viewpoints among the decision-makers. The viewpoints/attitudes were classified as 1. The Convinced, 2. The Concerned and, 3. The Evaluators, defined by varying and individual concerns on the implementation of dike relocation and floodplain restoration. Hereby, this study delivers insights on large-scale NbS as well as on the issues of their implementation.

Study focus: Recent drawdown of the delta's abundant shallow lakes and rivers has deteriorated vital habitat for wildlife and impaired navigation routes. Here, we report continuous measurements at similar to 50 lakes during open-water seasons of 2018 and 2019 to improve understanding of hydrological processes causing lake-level variation. New hydrological insights for the region: Analyses reveal four patterns of lake-level variation attributable to influential hydrological processes, which provide the basis for a new lake classification scheme: 1) 'Drawdown' (>= 15 cm decline) by evaporation and/or outflow after ice-jam floods, 2) 'Stable' lake levels (<15 cm change) sustained by rainfall, 3) 'Gradual Rise' by inundation from the open-drainage network, and 4) 'Rapid Rise' by input of river floodwater. River flooding during the open-water season is an under-recognized recharge mechanism yet occurred extensively in the Athabasca sector and appears to be a common occurrence based on the Athabasca River hydrometric record. Lake-level loggers show strong ability to track shifts in hydrological processes, and can be integrated with other methods to decipher their causes and ecological consequences across water-rich landscapes.

However, these results were obtained by approximating the equilibrium climate using transient simulations with steadily warming. This approach was recently criticised due to the warmer global land temperature and higher mean precipitation intensities of the transient climate in comparison with the equilibrium climate. Therefore, it is unclear whether floods and droughts projected under a transient climate can be systematically substituted for those occurring in an equilibrated climate. Here, by employing a large ensemble of global hydrological models (HMs) forced by global climate models, we assess the validity of estimating flood and drought characteristics under equilibrium climates from transient simulations. Differences in flood characteristics under transient and equilibrium climates could be largely ascribed to natural variability, indicating that the floods derived from a transient climate reasonably approximate the floods expected in an equally warm, equilibrated climate. By contrast, significant differences in drought intensity between transient and equilibrium climates were detected over a larger global land area than expected from natural variability. Despite the large differences among HMs in representing the low streamflow regime, we found that the drought intensities occurring under a transient climate may not validly represent the intensities in an equally warm equilibrated climate for approximately 6.7% of the global land area.

The realization of sustainability of eco-environments has long been a key issue. Consequently, we analysed the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to identify solutions to the sustainable development of such regions. We first reviewed the eco-environmental changes in the CLP and discussed the impacts of human activities over the past 3000 years, and then summarized previous experiences on the protection and restoration of degraded eco-environments. Our study indicates that the increasing demand for cultivated land has led to the destruction of vegetation and subsequent worsening of soil erosion on the CLP, which in turn, has led to an increase in floods in the Yellow River basin. However, many positive measures, such as slope cropland abandonment and afforestation have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the eco-environment via reducing soil erosion, and decreasing sediment input and flood disasters in the Yellow River in recent decades. Nonetheless, emerging problems such as water shortage, food insecurity, rapid urban development, and over-exploitation of energy resources hinder the sustainable development of the eco-environment in the CLP. Given the historical and present eco-environmental situations of the CLP, we provide suggestions for the sustainable development of both the eco-environment and social economy, which could serve as guidelines for eco-environmental design and government policy-making in semi-arid regions globally.

For the grid division, the topographic gradient change is taken as the control variable and different optimization criteria are designed according to different land types. In the numerical model, the Godunov-type method is adopted for the spatial discretization, the TVD-MUSUL and Runge-Kutta methods are used to improve the model's spatial and temporal calculation accuracies, and the simulation time is reduced by leveraging the GPU acceleration. The model is applied to ideal and actual case studies. The results show that the numerical model based on a non-uniform grid enjoys a good stability. In the simulation of the urban inundation, approximately 40%-50% of the urban average topographic gradient change to be covered is taken as the threshold for the non-uniform grid division, and the calculation efficiency and accuracy can be optimized. In this case, the calculation efficiency of the non-uniform grid based on the optimized parameters is 2-3 times of that of the uniform grid, and the approach can be adopted for the actual flood simulation in large-scale areas.

Coastal areas generally receive the greatest economic losses from tropical cyclones; however, research suggests that losses in the inland zone can occasionally be higher than the coastal zone. Previous research assessing the inland impacts from tropical cyclones was limited to the areas that are adjacent to the coastal zone only, where losses are usually higher. In this study, we assessed the spatial distribution of inland property damage caused by tropical cyclones. We included all the inland counties that fall within the inland zone in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Additionally, different factors, including meteorological storm characteristics (tropical cyclone wind and rain), elevation, and county social-economic vulnerability (county social vulnerability index and GDP) were assessed to measure their influence on property damage, using both ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. GWR performs better than the OLS, signifying the importance of considering spatial variations in the explanation of inland property damage. Results from the tristate region suggest that wind was the strongest predictor of property damage in OLS and one of the major contributing factors of property damage in the GWR model. These results could be beneficial for emergency managers and policymakers when considering the inland impacts of tropical cyclones.

Potential Impacts of Future Urbanization and Sea Level Rise on Florida's Natural Resources	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coastal; freshwater; landscape conservation cooperative; pine; scrub; wetland	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; COASTAL TOURISM; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT	As urban development continues to encroach into natural systems, these ecosystems experience increasing degradation to their form and function. Changing climatic conditions further compound the losses in biodiversity and ecosystem function. The state of Florida is known for its biodiversity but has experienced declines in species populations and habitats because of urbanization and sea level rise. Because Florida benefits from a multibillion-dollar income from natural resources tourism, these declines challenge the state's economy. In this study, we assessed the potential future impacts of urbanization and sea level rise on a suite of conservation targets that have been set for the state. We developed six scenarios of all combinations of intermediate and high sea level rise paired with two types of urbanization, sprawling and compact, in both 2040 and 2070 to examine the potential future threats to conservation targets in High Pine and Scrub, Coastal Uplands, and Freshwater Aquatics ecosystems. Our results show projected decreases in extent and area of these priority ecosystems into the future. Under Florida's current trends in urbanization practices, projections indicate a greater impact on conservation targets than if sprawl reduction practices are implemented. Projections indicate that Coastal Uplands will experience the greatest loss in area, at up to 47%. Conservation-focused urban planning and climate adaptation strategies can help protect Florida's natural resources with benefits to Florida's tourism economy as well as critical ecosystem functions and services such as coastal flood protection and storm surge risk reduction.

Three basic conceptual hydrological models, XAJ, TANK and SCS, are selected and applied for design flood estimation in two small-scale basins of northern China. Model parameter calibration is based on both the optimization algorithm SCE-UA and artificial adjusting, by using a combined objecting function of flood peak, volume and process. Each model singles out a set of optimal parameters as input to simulate the design flood process. The simulation results are compared with original engineering design standards and instantaneous unit hydrograph method. The results show that the XAJ model has the best performance in simulating the 100-year design flood in study basins. The SCS model also gives acceptable results, but the TANK model on the other hand in an underestimated flood peak with a prolonged recession period, which is not likely to be applicable. This study is to test the applicability of the conceptual hydrological models in simulating the design flood process in small-scale watersheds and should be a supplement to the traditional methods and further deliberation to a ungauged basin. Starting from the most basic models with simple structures, it is hoped that the methodology can be transferred to more complicated and physically based models with more realistic description of the rainfall-runoff transformation mechanism and dynamic mechanism for climate change.

Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90-92%, Kappa = 79-84%, Success ratio = 94-96%, Threat score = 80-84%, and Heidke skill score = 79-84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions.

The construction or reinforcement of levees can attract more assets and people in flood-prone area, thereby increasing the potential flood damage when levees eventually fail. Moreover, structural protection measures can generate a sense of complacency, which can reduce preparedness, thereby increasing flood mortality rates. We explore these phenomena in the Jamuna River floodplain in Bangladesh. In this study area, different levels of flood protection have co-existed alongside each other since the 1960s, with a levee being constructed only on the right bank and its maintenance being assured only in certain places. Primary and secondary data on population density, human settlements, and flood fatalities were collected to carry out a comparative analysis of two urban areas and two rural areas with different flood protection levels. We found that the higher the level of flood protection, the higher the increase of population density over the past decades as well as the number of assets exposed to flooding. Our results also show that flood mortality rates associated with the 2017 flooding in Bangladesh were lower in the areas with lower protection level. This empirical analysis of the unintended consequences of structural flood protection is relevant for the making of sustainable policies of disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change in rapidly changing environments.

Likely and High-End Impacts of Regional Sea-Level Rise on the Shoreline Change of European Sandy Coasts Under a High Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scenario	WATER			English	Article						sea-level rise; high-end; shoreline retreat; projections; Europe	SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ICE-SHEET; PROJECTIONS; EROSION; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; BEACHES; VULNERABILITY; SIMULATIONS	Sea-level rise (SLR) is a major concern for coastal hazards such as flooding and erosion in the decades to come. Lately, the value of high-end sea-level scenarios (HESs) to inform stakeholders with low-uncertainty tolerance has been increasingly recognized. Here, we provide high-end projections of SLR-induced sandy shoreline retreats for Europe by the end of the 21st century based on the conservative Bruun rule. Our HESs rely on the upper bound of the RCP8.5 scenario "likely-range" and on high-end estimates of the different components of sea-level projections provided in recent literature. For both HESs, SLR is projected to be higher than 1 m by 2100 for most European coasts. For the strongest HES, the maximum coastal sea-level change of 1.9 m is projected in the North Sea and Mediterranean areas. This translates into a median pan-European coastline retreat of 140 m for the moderate HES and into more than 200 m for the strongest HES. The magnitude and regional distribution of SLR-induced shoreline change projections, however, utterly depend on the local nearshore slope characteristics and the regional distribution of sea-level changes. For some countries, especially in Northern Europe, the impacts of high-end sea-level scenarios are disproportionally high compared to those of likely scenarios.

These considerations usually pose a new challenge to the urban planner because the achievement of a sustainable design through low impact development (LID) practices would be affected by the selection and the distribution of them. This study proposed a means to optimize the distribution of LIDs with the concept of considering the reduction of the flood peak and the hydrologic footprint residence (HFR). The study region is a densely populated place located in New Taipei City. This place has been developing for more than 40 years with completive sewer systems; therefore, the design must consider the space limitations. The flood reduction induced by each LID component under different rainfall return periods was estimated, and then the detention ponds were also conducted to compare the improvements. The results showed that the performance of LIDs dramatically decreased when the return periods were larger than ten years. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) was then applied to optimize the spatial distribution of LIDs under different budget scenarios, and to decide the priority of locations for the LID configuration. Finally, the Monte Carlo test was used to test the relationship between the optimal space configuration of LIDs and the impermeability of the study region. A positive correlation was uncovered between the optimal allocation ratio and the impermeable rate of the partition. The study results can provide general guidelines for urban planners to design LIDs in urban areas.

The integration of alternative approaches, such as socio-hydrological and socio-technological sciences, has gained prominence in urban space planning and development. The mapping of environmental susceptibility represents a promising alternative for the integrated management of natural disasters. However, for this to be used as a socio-technological tool, transiting to a participative management of urban environment, it is necessary to simplify and reduce the associated costs. In this sense, the objective of this study was to propose a socio-technological tool for the punctual and spatial mapping of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in urban regions. The method is designed to combine ease and low cost of application with a simplified but physically sensitive socio-hydrological assessment of eight factors of influence. The methodological tool was tested in a Brazilian district where entire socio-hydrological scenario of urban flooding in developing countries is observed. The results show that the method can provide a simple and consistent view, reaching an overall accuracy of 73.67% of the flooding points. In general, the method provides information that can support decision-making by government agencies in developed and developing countries, as well as civil society, in relation to participatory urban zoning, drainage management, and water conservation.

Phenology and Seasonal Ecosystem Productivity in an Amazonian Floodplain Forest	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						tropical wetlands; floodplain phenology; eddy covariance; GPP; MODIS; MAIAC; seasonality	DROUGHT SENSITIVITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION; MODIS; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATIONS; PATTERNS; GROWTH	Several studies have explored the linkages between phenology and ecosystem productivity across the Amazon basin. However, few studies have focused on flooded forests, which correspond to c.a. 14% of the basin. In this study, we assessed the seasonality of ecosystem productivity (gross primary productivity, GPP) from eddy covariance measurements, environmental drivers and phenological patterns obtained from the field (leaf litter mass) and satellite measurements (enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/multi-angle implementation correction (MODIS/MAIAC)) in an Amazonian floodplain forest. We found that ecosystem productivity is limited by soil moisture in two different ways. During the flooded period, the excess of water limits GPP (Spearman's correlation; rho = -0.22), while during non-flooded months, GPP is positively associated with soil moisture (rho = 0.34). However, GPP is maximized when cumulative water deficit (CWD) increases (rho = 0.81), indicating that GPP is dependent on the amount of water available. EVI was positively associated with leaf litter mass (Pearson's correlation; r = 0.55) and with GPP (r = 0.50), suggesting a coupling between new leaf production and the phenology of photosynthetic capacity, decreasing both at the peak of the flooded period and at the end of the dry season. EVI was able to describe the inter-annual variations on forest responses to environmental drivers, which have changed during an observed El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) year (2015/2016).

J	Laeni, N; van den Brink, M; Arts, J				Laeni, Naim; van den Brink, Margo; Arts, Jos			Is Bangkok becoming more resilient to flooding? A framing analysis of Bangkok's flood resilience policy combining insights from both insiders and outsiders	CITIES			English	Article						Flood resilience; Flood risk management; Bangkok; Developing country; Framing	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; URBAN POLITICAL ECOLOGY; PLANNING-THEORY; CITIES; CHALLENGES; ROTTERDAM	The rapidly urbanizing cities in Southeast Asia experience increasing flood impacts due to the consequences of climate change. In these cities, policy efforts to build flood resilience are gaining momentum. The aim of this paper is to understand and assess flood resilience policy development, particularly in cities in developing countries. Bangkok is one of the cities that participates in the 100 Resilient Cities Programme (100RC) - the international policy platform for building resilient cities. In 2017, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) launched the 'Bangkok Resilience Strategy' to translate the resilience concept to its urban context. A framing perspective is adopted to reconstruct the strategy, process and anticipated outcome of Bangkok's flood resilience policy. We studied data obtained from 'insiders' (involved policy makers, experts and consultants) and 'outsiders' (local communities, civil society organizations and news media). Findings indicate that the economic growth frame is prevailing in the development of Bangkok's flood resilience policy, prioritizing structural flood protection with little attention for flood adaptation measures and related social impacts among vulnerable communities. The role of local communities and civil society in the formulation of Bangkok's flood resilience policy is limited. This paper therefore recommends cities in developing countries and cities in the 100RC Programme to organize a more inclusive resilience building process for addressing social problems regarding urban poor communities along with increasing flood safety and protection.

Operational Flood Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Images: A Case Study from Bangladesh	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						flood mapping; damage assessment; SAR image; Sentinel-1; Landsat-8; Google Earth Engine; GEE; Bangladesh	LAND-COVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIME-SERIES; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; EARTH; CROP; EXPERIENCE; ACCURACY	Bangladesh is one of the most flood-affected countries in the world. In the last few decades, flood frequency, intensity, duration, and devastation have increased in Bangladesh. Identifying flood-damaged areas is highly essential for an effective flood response. This study aimed at developing an operational methodology for rapid flood inundation and potential flood damaged area mapping to support a quick and effective event response. Sentinel-1 images from March, April, June, and August 2017 were used to generate inundation extents of the corresponding months. The 2017 pre-flood land cover maps were prepared using Landsat-8 images to identify major land cover on the ground before flooding. The overall accuracy of flood inundation mapping was 96.44% and the accuracy of the land cover map was 87.51%. The total flood inundated area corresponded to 2.01%, 4.53%, and 7.01% for the months April, June, and August 2017, respectively. Based on the Landsat-8 derived land cover information, the study determined that cropland damaged by floods was 1.51% in April, 3.46% in June, 5.30% in August, located mostly in the Sylhet and Rangpur divisions. Finally, flood inundation maps were distributed to the broader user community to aid in hazard response. The data and methodology of the study can be replicated for every year to map flooding in Bangladesh.

In Italy, the geo-hydrological risk is widespread depending on the geomorphological settings, climate conditions and anthropic pressure. Accurate knowledge regarding the spatial and temporal extensions of past events, as well as the associated damages, allows the elaboration of hazard and risk maps. The resulting data are strongly dependent on the accuracy and efficiency of the sources used for data collection. In the framework of a long-term regional project, we compiled a geospatial database of geo-hydrological hazards and damage that occurred in the Apulian region of southern Italy over the last few decades. We used a validated database structure and improved it for practical and scientific purposes, thereby making it compliant with the needs of the stakeholders (i.e., regional civil protection agency) as it considers the regional geo-hydrological peculiarity and, at the same time, it follows the FLOOD and INSPIRE European directives.Based on the research and analysis of different information sources, we propose a method for quantitatively evaluating the availability, efficiency, and accuracy of each utilized source (i.e., source of information total quality index-SIQI) in an objective and reproducible manner. The SIQI index of the sources used is analyzed and discussed.We discuss the collected data on geo-hydrological processes and/or damage between 2008 and 2019, analyze their temporal and geographical distribution, and make comparisons with other national catalogues and daily geo-hydrological warning alerts.

Understanding the Challenges of Hydrological Analysis at Bridge Collapse Sites	WATER			English	Article						hydrological extremes; bridge collapse sites; flow distribution; trend; seasonal variation; predictor variables	GOODNESS-OF-FIT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; IMPACTS; FAILURES; PACKAGE	There is a crucial need for modeling hydrological extremes in order to optimize hydraulic system safety. It is often perceived that the best-fitted distribution accurately captures the intricacies of the hydrological extremes, particularly for the least disturbed watersheds. Thirty collapse sites with the least disturbed watersheds within the Appalachian Highland region in the U.S. are identified and used to test this perception. Goodness-of-fit tests, time series analysis, and comparison of predictor variables are carried out to find out the best-fitted distribution, identify trends and seasonal variation, and assess site variability. The study results are found to be inconclusive and sometimes contradictory; sometimes even complex distribution models do not provide better results. For most sites, the historic peak flow data are best-fitted with multiple distributions, including heavy and light tails. For monthly flow data, seasonal variation and trend cannot be categorized since no definitive, distinct tendency can be identified. When comparing sites best-fitted with a single distribution to sites best-fitted with multiple distributions, significant differences in certain geospatial characteristics are identified. However, these characteristics at the watershed scale are claimed to be less important in predicting the behavior of a flood event. All of these results capture the difficulties and inconsistencies in interpreting the results of hydrologic analysis, potentially reducing the robustness of the hydrologic tools used in the design and risk assessment of bridges.

Previous research on UPF prediction has mainly focused on hydrological models, which required a large amount of data. However, a data-driven method can significantly reduce the computational cost by using rainfall amounts to predict pluvial flooding. Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves using the Gumbel method can provide a better interpretation of the correlation between rainfall intensity, duration, and probability of occurrence of a given rainfall amount. In this study, machine learning models (ML) for rainfall amounts were used to identify flood points in a case study conducted in Karachi, Pakistan. Thirteen inundation factors were used for the ML models, including a new factor, curve number. Ten ML models were applied first on training and then on validation data, yielding the inundation points. The training and validation process of the model included 384 flood points. Several statistics were used to verify the performance and accuracy of the model. We found that the Light Gradient Boost Machine and Random Forest Classifier models were the most accurate in training and validating the model, while the Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor models were the least accurate in training and validating the model. The study provides valuable information for decision makers to protect communities from flood hazards by incorporating the likely intensity and duration of rainfall events and carefully selecting influencing factors into flood event prediction models.

Particularly, the paper assesses the economic value associated with the provision of a set of ecosystem services (flood control, recreational activities, biodiversity) and ecosystem disservices (pest abundance) provided by blue/green infrastructure using a discrete choice experiment. Results indicated that flood control is the most highly valued ecosystem service, followed by recreation and biodiversity. Household willingness to pay for flood control-related benefits is higher than the willingness to pay for other ecosystem services and disservices. Results further suggest that overlooking the existence of ecosystem disservices generated by the installation of blue/green infrastructure measures, such as sponge parks, could lead to the overestimation of welfare effects. This is the first study to account for the value of potential ecosystem disservices associated with blue/green infrastructure in the context of developing countries. It is suggested that these policies should be designed in a way to strengthen cities' resilience and deliver the conditions needed to improve human wellbeing, while minimising the effects of welfare-reducing elements. Future research conducting environmental valuation studies should integrate both ecosystem services and disservices in order to generate policy recommendations that improve local communities' wellbeing.(C) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Urban growth prediction models are now used to simulate potential future urban growth scenarios but impacts of future flood risks due to sea level rise (SLR) on future development have not been studied well. Owing to its higher predictive accuracy, this study employs the Multi layer perceptron (MLP) based Artificial Neural Network-Markov Chain (ANN-Markov) model to simulate three future urban growth scenarios (business as usual (BAU), planned growth (PG), and sustainable growth (SG)) in Miami Metropolitan Area (Miami MSA), and three SLR scenarios (1 ft, 2 ft, and 3 ft) were spatialized with the current high-risk flooding (HF) zone to delineate future flood risk areas. Then the flood risks of future urban development in each growth scenario were assessed at both regional (MSA) and local (County) scales. Results show that current land use plan (PG) slightly decreases flood risks at the regional scale but not always at the local scale compared to the without growth regulation scenario (BAU). Nevertheless, flood risks in the PG scenario are significantly higher compared to the without growth in the HF zone scenario (SG). Urban growth scenario predictions can help prepare for and understand the SLR impacts.

The possible bias induced by geometric distortion has never been thoroughly investigated with dedicated laboratory experiments. In this study, we combine experimental and computational modeling to systematically assess the influence of the distortion ratio, that is, the ratio of horizontal to vertical scale factors, on upscaled flow depths and discharge partition between streets. Three flow configurations were considered: a street junction, a street bifurcation, and a small synthetic urban district. When the distortion ratio is varied up to a value of about 5, the upscaled flow depths at the model inlets decrease monotonously and the flow discharge in the branch that conveys the largest portion of the flow is greatly enhanced. For equal flow depths at the model outlets and depending on the configuration, the distortion effect induces a variation of the upstream flow depth approximately from similar to 4% to similar to 17% and a change in outlet discharge partition up to 24 percentage points. For a distortion ratio above 5, both upscaled upstream flow depths and outlet discharge partition tend to stabilize asymptotically. Our study indicates the direction and magnitude of the bias induced by geometric distortion for a broad range of flow cases, which is valuable for offsetting these effects in practical laboratory studies of urban flooding.

J	Liu, XY; Yang, SI; Ye, T; An, R; Chen, CZ				Liu, Xiaoyan; Yang, Saini; Ye, Tao; An, Rui; Chen, Cuizhen			A new approach to estimating flood-affected populations by combining mobility patterns with multi-source data: A case study of Wuhan, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urban flood; Affected population; Commuting activity; Monte Carlo simulation; Social media data	OF-INTEREST DATA; CENTRAL SHANGHAI; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; EXPOSURE; EVENT; CITY; SIMULATION; GUANGZHOU	Estimating flood impacts on daily activities is vital to disaster risk reduction and urban resilience. Human mobility on complex road networks has caused citizens, especially automobile commuters, to suffer from remarkable impacts on rainy days. However, quantitative studies of these harms have been limited. In this paper, we develop a new approach to estimating flood-affected populations, including their quantity, structure, and spatial distribution, by integrating commuter mobility patterns and road inundation records using multi-source data. Mobility patterns were built by the Gravity model with point-of-interest (POI) data and then downscaled to individual routes by Monte Carlo simulation. Inundation locations and impassable roads were retrieved by combining flood hazard maps with social media data. This approach was applied to Wuhan, a large city in Central China, to estimate the affected automobile commuters under a typical flood event (July 6, 2016) and three flood scenarios (10-year, 20-year, and 50-year). Our approach produces an estimate of the affected population that is more accurate and detailed than existing approaches. It also provides high-resolution impact information for urban studies and can be applied easily to other cities and disasters that include road closures. It will help governments to estimate affected populations rapidly and assess indirect economic losses caused by labor disruptions and work delays.

The tool is one of the main outputs of the PROLINE-CE Project, an EU project funded within the Interreg Central Europe (CE) Programme (2014-2020). The aim of this paper is illustrating the design and the methodological approaches proposed for the operative development of the tool. Furthermore, the paper provides the results of a number of tests carried out to evaluate the understandability of the analysis's processes and assessing the stakeholders' acceptance. Specifically, GOWARE-DST has been developed for supporting single users or groups of users in the decision-making process. The tool has been provided with a catalogue of 92 BMPs to handle water issues in different land use contexts. The selection of practices suitable for addressing the specific user's requirements is supported by the Analytic Hierarchy Process, a method that allows filtering a subset of BMPs by accounting for the relative importance that the user assigns to each characterizing criterion. GOWARE-DST represents an innovative tool for supporting users at different levels of planning (operational and strategic) by promoting sustainable land and water management and defining long-term governance activities.

J	Shawul, AA; Chakma, S				Shawul, Alemayehu A.; Chakma, Sumedha			Trend of extreme precipitation indices and analysis of long-term climate variability in the Upper Awash basin, Ethiopia	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							RAINFALL TIME-SERIES; RIVER-BASIN; SEASONAL RAINFALL; HOMOGENEITY; TEMPERATURE	Assessing the spatial and temporal variability of climate data is one of the basic requirements to solve the hydrological and water management problems. In this manuscript, a comprehensive assessment of data quality, precipitation concentration index (PCI), Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, and extreme climate change indices analyses were performed. The standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT), the Pettitt test, the Buishand range test, and the Von Neumann ratio test were used for homogeneity analysis, and most of the climate stations exhibited homogenous precipitation series. The annual mean and dry season PCI values demonstrated higher spatial and temporal variability or irregular distribution of precipitation, whereas PCI in the wetter seasons indicated low precipitation concentration in the Upper Awash basin. The MK trend test exhibited a significantly increasing trend of maximum temperature; however, the trend of mean annual and extreme precipitation events was insignificant for the majority of stations. Moreover, the magnitude and trend of ten main extreme precipitation indices were constructed. Unlike the mean annual precipitation, larger values of the extreme 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) annual precipitation were obtained in the downstream areas of the basin which could signify the prevalence higher flood risk in this portion of the basin. The highest predicted 100-year annual maximum daily (AMD) precipitation was obtained at Zikuala station as 128.5 mm. Statistical analysis of the magnitude and trend of extreme precipitation indices and spatial variability of climate data is imperative for the integrated water resource planning and management decisions.

The runoff travels faster to the watershed outlet, accumulates, and might cause flooding. Urban areas are affected by flooding, with consequences that might result in severe economic damage and even hazard to life. The paper will estimate the effect of rapid urbanization on runoff and on groundwater recharge. The model includes the Shiloh catchment basin located in a karstic mountainous terrain in Israel for a time period of rapid development from 1978 to 2018. Evaluation of surface permeability was based on land-use classifications from Landsat datasets using the Q-GIS 3.4 platform. Multiyear runoff coefficient estimation was calculated based on annual runoff and rainfall series. The evaluation suggests natural permeable areas were constantly declining from about 400 km(2) (nearby 100% of the Shiloh basin) in 1978 to about 100 km(2) in 2018 and that nonpermeable areas increased to 95 km(2) and semi-permeable areas to 250 km(2). Despite annual precipitation decrease during the last two decades, the annual runoff coefficient has a pronounced tendency to increase. This research suggests that the anthropogenic impact on the Shiloh basin and, hence, similar watersheds encourages runoff accumulation, resulting in extreme flood events recurrence while significantly reducing the groundwater recharge.

Interactions among many environmental variables and the tree community in continuous riverine forests affect their formation and add to their complexity, making our understanding of these habitats particularly challenging. We evaluated the tree species diversity and richness in relation to relief and flooding regimes in the watershed of a riparian forest in southern Brazil. The environments of the topographic gradients were classified according to relief and soil. Canonical correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis were used for the environmental classification. A detailed soil survey showed that the organic matter content and pH are quite distinct among the environmental categories. Frequent flooding of low intensity on the floodplain was associated with incipient and shallow channels, greater frequency of livestock encroachment, and lower frequency of shade-tolerant species dominance in the deep relief of the valleys and the headwaters. We conclude that there is a dynamic flow of species migration between the flooded and non-flooded environments in small channels and that the narrow deep channels in the floodplain with less frequent and intense flooding favor an expansion of the upland tree species into riparian areas, with channel shape and depth important variables in the impact of cattle encroachment on vegetation. The greatest tree diversity was found in the ravine habitats in the intermediate landscapes.

In this study, the aim was to determine the dominant processes governing the total suspended solid (TSS) concentration at the water surface in Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, which is a large, shallow-water lake. Satellite remotely sensed daily reflectance data from 2003 to 2017 were used. Seasonal changes in TSS concentration indicated that bottom sediment resuspension during dry seasons was mostly caused by wind and the TSS concentration was closely correlated with the water depth of the lake. The TSS concentration during flood periods was controlled by both wind and inflow currents from the Tonle Sap River. Additionally, we confirmed that surface/subsurface flow with a low TSS concentration from forests on the floodplain lowered the TSS concentration year round, except during August and September. This fact implied that the floodplain forest area decrease may increase the lake TSS concentration. An analysis of the long-term changes in TSS indicated that a decrease in the water level during flood periods resulted in the high TSS concentrations observed during the subsequent dry periods. Therefore, climate change and water resource development, which are likely to cause water level reductions in the Mekong River during flood periods, may increase the TSS concentration in Tonle Sap Lake, particularly during the dry season.

Identifying these adaptive genetic variabilities is crucial not only to improve our knowledge of the genetic mechanism of local adaptation but also to explore the adaptation potential of species.ResultsUsing 10 natural populations and 12 start codon targeted (SCoT) markers, a total of 430 unambiguous loci were yielded. The Bayesian analysis of population structure clearly demonstrated that the 10 populations of P. bungeana could be subdivided into three groups. Redundancy analysis showed that this genetic divergence was caused by divergence selection from environmental variables related to the ecological habitats of avoidance of flooding and avoidance of high temperature and humidity. LFMM results indicated that Bio1, Bio5, Bio8, Bio12, Bio14, and Bio16, which are related to the ecological habitat of P. bungeana, were correlated with the highest numbers of environment-associated loci (EAL).ConclusionsThe results of EAL characterization in P. bungeana clearly supported the hypothesis that environmental variations related to the ecological habitat of species are the key drivers of species adaptive divergence. Moreover, a method to calculate the species landscape adaptation index and quantify the adaptation potential of species was proposed and verified using ecological niche modeling. This model could estimate climatically suitable areas of species spatial distribution. Taking the results together, this study improves the current understanding on the genetic basis of local adaptation.

Variability and predictability of the Northeast India summer monsoon rainfall	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Atlantic zonal mode; causality; intertropical convergence zone; Northeast India summer monsoon rainfall; predictability; predictors; south equatorial Indian Ocean Dipole; tropical Northwest Pacific; variability	TROPICAL ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEMISE; ONSET	The mesoscale orography over one of the wettest regions of the world makes the Northeast India (NEI) vulnerable to hydrological disasters while sustaining a biodiversity "hotspot." The monsoon rainy season over the NEI is known to be longer than June-September (JJAS), but an objective definition has been lacking. Understanding the drivers and predictability of rainfall variability over the region is key for sustainable development planning and adaptation to increasing disasters in the backdrop of a warming climate but remained poor due to lack of a working definition of "summer monsoon season" over NEI. Here, using the relationship between rainfall over the region and winds at 850 hPa over North Bay of Bengal (BoB), we provide an objective definition of the monsoon season over NEI and argue that the "summer monsoon rainy season" over the NEI (NEIR) is from May to September (MJJAS). In contrast to a significant negative relationship between JJAS Central India (CI) rainfall and a JJAS El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, the MJJAS rainfall over the NEI has no relationship with MJJAS or JJAS ENSO. Instead, we unravel that (a) the tropical Northwest-Pacific (TNWP) sea surface temperature (SST), (b) the South Equatorial Indian Ocean Dipole (SEIOD) and (c) the Atlantic Zonal mode (AZM) are potential drivers of the NEIR variability. Using a causal inference algorithm, namely the Peter and Clark Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI) method, we show that SEIOD directly influences NEIR while TNWP SST has a two-way connection with the NEIR. While "internal variability" may be higher over the NEI, significant modulation of the variances of the subseasonal fluctuations by predictable drivers like the Atlantic Nino and North Atlantic water temperature provides optimism for seasonal prediction of the NEIR.

A critical profile (CP) is a location where a path of concentrated surface runoff might enter an inhabited area causing potential damage, e.g. by flooding, water erosion and torrential mudflows. Critical profiles have been determined using modified methodological guidelines for identifying critical points by the T. G. Masaryk Water Research Institute in Prague, 2009. In the model watershed Drevenica (117.27 km(2)), 27 profiles have been identified, where concentrated flow paths and the boundaries of built-up areas intersect. Four of the profiles have contributing areas of 0.3-10 km(2), average slope > 3.5% and the share of arable land >40% as well as the critical conditions indicator according to the methodological guidelines and have been verified in terrain. Surveys and analysis also pointed out that another three profiles have indications of erosion runoff during rainfalls of varying intensity. By modifications of the original thresholds, these profiles have been included as critical. The lower threshold for contributing area was reduced to 0.2 km(2). A new set of parameters was added by the authors, namely the proportion of land with higher soil erosion risk levels (SERL) 2 to 5, exceeding 20% and threshold surface runoff volume > 6000 m3. Critical profiles with their contributing areas are prime candidates for multi-functional ecological engineering measures.

Although there are many such indices, we still lack an index to measure connections and cohesion within a community-the social fabric (as we refer to it) that connects its members with each other and with the place. We propose an indicator-based index social fabric index (SoFI) to both measure and map the spatial dimension of the social fabric within and across communities. We investigate approaches to constructing social fabric indices and conduct uncertainty and sensitivity analyses for each stage of constructing the underlying model of the social fabric, which includes indicator transformation, normalization, principal component selection and rotation, and weighting. From this effort, we find that the precision of the index increases with social fabric levels, corresponding to lower social vulnerability. Global sensitivity analysis shows that the coordinate transformation and PCA selection play especially important roles in determining total uncertainty. Furthermore, the preceding step tends to absorb the uncertainty contributions of the following steps through construction interactions. Finally, we consider the importance of the emotional and psychological effects of the social fabric concept and provide suggestions for future work so that we will be able to develop a more transparent, comprehensive, and robust social fabric index model.

This review has three objectives: (1) determine which natural hazard or natural disaster had the most vulnerability studies; (2) identify which infrastructure type was most prevalent in studies related to flood resilience infrastructure; and (3) investigate the current stage of research. This review was conducted with three stages. Based on stage one, floods have been extremely present in research from 1981 to 2021. Based on stage two, transportation infrastructure was most studied in studies related to flood resilience. Based on stage three, this systematic review focused on a total of 133 peer-reviewed, journal articles written in English. In stage three, six research categories were identified: (1) flood risk analysis; (2) implementation of real-time flood forecasting and prediction; (3) investigation of flood impacts on transportation infrastructure; (4) vulnerability analysis of transportation infrastructure; (5) response and preparatory measures towards flood events; and (6) several other studies that could be related to transportation infrastructure resilience to flood events. Current stage of studies for increasing transportation resilience to flood events was investigated within these six categories. Current stage of studies shows efforts to advance modeling systems, improve data collections and analysis (e.g., real-time data collections, imagery analysis), enhance methodologies to assess vulnerabilities, and more.

Flood events can impact hydrological processes, carbon (C) transport, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study monitored river flow and sediment concentrations in an intermittent river during a flood event. Water samples were measured for water quality factors and C transport indices. CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 flux (FCO2) were also analyzed. Remote sensing data were used to analyze soil erosion in the basin. Results indicate that the total sediment load from the flood was approximately 5503.1 t, with sediment concentrations showing a direct relationship with flow discharge. By completing a hysteresis loop and soil erosion level analysis, soil erosion from the river source and runoff surface scour were found to be the primary sources of sediment. The flood significantly increased particulate organic carbon and decreased dissolved organic carbon. During the flood, pCO(2) ranged between 669 and 1229 ppm, indicating that the IRES served as a carbon source, with pH and total dissolved solids being the main influencing factors. The FCO2 varied between 20.16 and 568.33 mg m(-2) h(-1) and revealed a significant positive correlation with pCO(2). After the flood ended, CO2 emissions increased and remained high for a long time. The study findings have substantial implications for IRES responses to extreme flood events, which are predicted to increase in intensity under climate change.

RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						community rating system; dynamic panel model; federal flood mitigation assistance; flood risk mitigation	PANEL-DATA; RISK	With the inexorable march of climate change, increased flooding is inevitable. Understanding the feedback between federal flood mitigation policies and the ways in which local governments build flood resilience is a significant gap in the literature. In particular, the effect that federal flood mitigation grants have on the intensity of local flood mitigation is nonexistent. This work measures flood risk mitigation by using the level of participation in FEMA's Community Rating System (CRS). Communities that participate in the CRS and undertake mitigation are awarded points; more points imply a higher level of participation. Since its inception in 1990, CRS communities have received considerably more federal pre-disaster flood mitigation grants compared to non-CRS communities. This study assesses the effect of federal pre-disaster flood mitigation grants on the level of participation in the CRS program. We use data on Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs and CRS participation data between 2010 and 2015. We link these data to flood risk and socioeconomic information. Our results indicate (i) federal pre-disaster flood mitigation grants do not appear to significantly influence the level of CRS participation, (ii) the effect of flood risk and socioeconomic factors on the level of CRS participation are mixed, and (iii) the current level of CRS participation is influenced by the previous level of CRS participation, which is not tied to federal pre-disaster flood mitigation grant. These findings add to the growing discussions on the drivers and barriers of local flood risk mitigation.

Flood forecasting is carried out by determining the river discharge and water level using hydrologic models at the target sites. If the water level and discharge are forecasted to reach dangerous levels, the flood forecasting system sends warning messages to residents in flood-prone areas. In the past, hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models have been successfully used for the time series forecasting. However, the prediction errors grow exponentially with the forecasting period, making the forecast unreliable as an early warning tool with enough lead time. Therefore, this research aimed to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting models by employing real-time monitoring network datasets and establishing temporal and spatial links between adjacent monitoring stations. We evaluated the performance of the LSTM, the Convolutional Neural Networks LSTM (CNN-LSTM), the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), and the Spatio-Temporal Attention LSTM (STA-LSTM) models for flood forecasting. The dataset, employed for validation, includes hourly discharge records, from 2012 to 2017, on six stations of the Humber River in the City of Toronto, Canada. Experiments included forecasting for both 6 and 12 h ahead, using discharge data as input for the past 24 h. The STA-LSTM model's performance was superior to the CNN-LSTM, the ConvLSTM, and the basic LSTM models when the forecast time was longer than 6 h.

The fate of this input and its consequence for water quality is poorly understood. This study investigated the transformation and leaching of PN using a 56-day incubation experiment with five PN sources: forest floor humus, upland mineral A horizon, stream bank, storm deposits, and stream bed. Experiments were subjected to two moisture regimes: continuously moist and dry-wet cycles. Sediment and porewater samples were collected through the incubation and analyzed for N and C species, as well as the quantification of nitrifying and denitrifying genes (amoA, nirS, nirK). C- and N-rich watershed sources experienced decomposition, mineralization, and nitrification and released large amounts of dissolved N, but the amount of N released varied depending on the PN source and moisture regime. Drying and rewetting stimulated nitrification and suppressed denitrification in most PN sources. Storm deposits released large amounts of porewater N regardless of the moisture conditions, indicating that they could readily act as N sources under a variety of conditions. The inputs, processing, and leaching of large, storm-driven PN inputs become increasingly important as the frequency and intensity of large storms is predicted to increase with global climate change.

Our morphology and chronology results show aggradation of a fan (57.7 ka) during the Late Pleistocene and T-1 to T-5 fluvial terraces (13.1 to 6.0 ka) during the terminal Pleistocene to Holocene, and deposition of palaeoflood sediments (3.9-3.8 ka) over the T-3 terraces during the Late Holocene. Considering the known uplift rates along the Himalayan frontal thrust, and our estimated aggradation rates, we derived channel palaeogeometry and calculated peak discharge at the site of palaeoflood deposits. We conclude that the Markanda River's peak discharge was several orders of magnitude higher during the Late Holocene than the modern-day peak discharge of 100-year return period. The palaeoflood deposits represent larger flooding of the foothill rivers that sustained flows in the downstream reaches of the Ghaggar-Hakra palaeochannel during the Late Harappan civilisation.

The ability to forecast streamflow is crucial, as it can help mitigate flood risks. Long-term stream flow data records are needed for hydropower plant construction, flood prediction, watershed management, and long-term water supply use. An accurate assessment of streamflow is considered as very challenging and critical tasks. A new predicting model is developed in this research, combining the technique of sunflower optimization (SFA) as an evolutionary algorithm with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm to predict streamflow in Malaysia's Jam Seyed Omar (JSO) and Muda Di Jeniang (MDJ) stations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on Q (t) (t: the number of the current day) before model creation to pick essential inputs for a maximum of 6 lags. With the classical MLP and two other hybrid MLP models (MLP-particle swarm optimization (MLP-PSO) and MLP-genetic algorithm (MLP-GA)), the results of the MLP-sunflower algorithm (SFA) were benchmarked. As compared to other models, the MLP-SFA could be able to reduce the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by a value of between 12 and 21% at the JSO station and between 8 and 24% at the MDJ station. In conclusion, this research found that combining MLP with optimization algorithms improved the precision of the stand-alone MLP model, with SFA integration being the most efficient.

Landscapes variability and the early peopling of the inter-Andean Magdalena Valley, Colombia (South America)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Tropical hunter-gatherers; Environmental dynamics; Late pleistocene-middle holocene period; Site formation; Geoarchaeology	SETTLEMENT; RIVER; MODEL	The Magdalena River is the longest inter-Andean river in Northern South America. We focus on the middlesection calling attention to the implication of a geoarchaeological approach to understanding the role of depositional and erosional processes over time in the preservation and destruction of archaeological sites. Most likely the majority of the earliest Preceramic deposits - predating ca 12,900 BP - left in ancient shores and terraces, were erased or buried. Archaeological early remains are recorded on the alluvial paleo-terraces and piedmont hillslopes of the lowlands throughout the Pleistocene/Holocene Transition, during and after the El Abra Stadial - equivalent to the Younger Dryas period (ca. 12,900?11,700 cal BP). From the Terminal Pleistocene through the Middle Holocene specialized hunter-gatherers occupied floodplains and alluvial fan surfaces, as well as the relict high terraces remnants. The presence of industries with bifacial tools, - such as triangular stemmed points, and pressure retouched well finished tools (plano-convex scrapers) - occurred only throughout preceramic times. Climatic changes (above all precipitation variability), vegetation belt shifts and volcanism have affected geomorphic shifts in the lowlands of the Magdalena Valley. These changes are primarily responsible for the limited evidence of preceramic occupations. The early archaeological record is a dependent variable in the larger context of an evolving landscape. This relationship is critically important in evaluating the importance of the Magdalena Valley in the early settlement of the Northwest South American lowlands.

J	Yang, HY; Chen, G; Chong, Y; Jin, JC; Shi, W				Yang, Heyi; Chen, Guan; Chong, Yan; Jin, Jiacheng; Shi, Wei			Quantitative Prediction of Outburst Flood Hazard of the Zhouqu "8.8" Debris Flow-Barrier Dam in Western China	WATER			English	Article						Zhouqu debris flow; barrier dam; dam break; outburst flood; risk		In recent years, the intensified influences of global climate change and human activities have increased the frequency of large-scale debris flow disasters. As a result, main river channels often become blocked, thus forming a disaster chain of rivers dammed by debris flow followed by outburst flooding. In order to quickly and easily reveal the dynamic process of a debris flow dam breach, and quantitatively predict the outburst flood hazard, this study takes the Zhouqu "8.8" debris flow barrier dam in Western China as an example. Based on a stability assessment, China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research's Dam Breach Slope (DBS-IWHR), China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research's Dam Breach (DB-IWHR), and Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) were integrated to simulate the development of dam breach, breach flood, and outburst flood evolution, respectively, under different scenarios. The simulated peak discharge flow of the actual spillway was 317.15 m(3)/s, which was consistent with the actual discharge of 316 m(3)/s. The results under different scenarios showed that, with the increased inflow of the barrier lake, the erosion rate of the dam increased, the peak discharge of the dam break flood increased, the peak arrival time shortened, and the downstream flooding area increased. These findings could provide scientific support for risk management and emergency decision-making with respect to barrier dam failure.

J	Chaudhuri, RR; Sharma, P				Ray Chaudhuri, Ranjana; Sharma, Prateek			Addressing uncertainty in extreme rainfall intensity for semi-arid urban regions: case study of Delhi, India	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Extreme rainfall; Short duration; Uncertainty; Semi-arid; Bayesian; Delhi	DURATION-FREQUENCY CURVES; IDF CURVES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DESIGN; DISTRIBUTIONS; STATISTICS; EVENTS; UPDATE; MODEL	Classical approaches are used to develop rainfall intensity duration frequency curves for the estimation of design rainfall intensities corresponding to various return periods. The study modelled extreme rainfall intensities at different durations and compared the classical Gumbel and generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions in semi-arid urban region. The model and parameter uncertainties are translated to uncertainties in design storm estimates. A broader insight emerges that rainfall extremes in 1 h and 3 h are sensitive to the choice of frequency analysis (GEV in this case) and helps address anticipated intensification of extreme events for short duration at urban local scale. In comparison with Gumbel, GEV predicts higher extreme rainfall intensity corresponding to various return periods and duration (for 1-h duration the increase in extreme rainfall intensity is from 27 to 33% for return periods 10 years and higher, 3-h and 50-year return period-20%, 3-h and 100-year return period-20.6%, 24 h at similar return periods-10%). The Bayesian posterior distribution has a calibration effect on the GEV predictions and reduces the upper range of uncertainty in the GEV probability model prediction from a range of 16-31% to 10-28.4% for return period varying from 10 to 50 year for 1-h storms. In geographically similar areas these extreme intensities may be used to prepare for the rising flash flood risks.

In this study, we investigated the impact of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes on the hydrological response of the Erbil basin in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). In the studied area, the LULC changes were calculated for 1984, 1994, 2004, 2014 and 2019 using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and satellite images. The analysis of LULC changes showed that the change between 1984 and 2004 was slower than that between 2004 and 2019. The LULC analysis revealed a 444.4% growth in built-up areas, with a 60.4% decrease in agricultural land between 1984 and 2019. The influence of LULC on urban floods caused by different urbanization scenarios was ascertained using the HEC-GeoHMS and HEC-HMS models. Over 35 years, there was a 15% increase in the peak discharge of outflow, from 392.2 m(3)/s in 1984 to 450 m(3)/s in 2014, as well as the runoff volume for a precipitation probability distribution of 10%, which increased from 27.4 mm in 1984 to 30.9 mm in 2014. Overall, the probability of flash floods increased in the center of the city due to the large expansion of built-up areas.

Aquatic plants, especially submerged plants, play key roles in water ecosystems. Liangzi Lake experienced severe flooding in July 2010, and the elevated water levels lasted for 3 months. In this study, 10 transects with 120 monitoring points were set up for monthly monitoring during the 3-year period, encompassing the period before and after the flooding (2009-2011). The numbers, biomass, and diversity of the submerged plants, as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake water, were surveyed. There were 12 species belonging to 7 families and 7 genera in Liangzi Lake. Eleven of the submerged plant species were found in 2009, but, after the flood, that number decreased to five in 2011. The total biomass differed significantly over the three years (P < 0.05), with the largest biomass in 2009 and smallest in 2011. In 2009 and 2010, Potamogeton maackianus was the dominant species, but its dominant position weakened in 2011. After the flood, water transparency decreased, and the water depth, turbidity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus increased. A redundancy analysis between the submerged plants and environmental factors found that the water transparency, turbidity, and water depth were the key environmental factors affecting the plants. These results suggest that the long-lasting severe flooding of Liangzi Lake in 2010 led to the degradation of both the submerged plant community and water quality.

Nine study sites in Eastern Quebec (Canada) were used to develop the index, for a total of 122.4 km of roads. The index includes 14 parameters relating to the following: the exposure of a site to erosion and coastal flooding hazard; the characteristics of the road segment; the characteristic of the road network; and adaptation to erosion (e.g. the presence of defence structures). Each parameter received a score between 1 and 5 according to its propensity to increase (5) or not (1) the vulnerability of the road. CREFVI values for the study sites vary between 0 and 159.1 and have been divided into 5 classes reflecting the actions needed to reduce the site's vulnerability: Not vulnerable (no intervention necessary), Low, Medium, High, Critical (immediate intervention required). For the roads analyzed, 0.5 km have a critical CREFVI value as of 2020, 1.7 km as of 2060 and 2.6 km by 2100. Currently, only 20.6% of the road segments are vulnerable to coastal hazards, but this percentage rises to 36.4% by 2060 and to 54.3% by 2100.

A relatively small increase in sea level could affect natural coastal systems. In a study of long-term changes in sea level and measurements of postglacial rebound, monitoring vertical land motion (VLM) is of crucial interest. This study presents an approach to estimate precise sea level trends based on a combination of multi-sensor techniques in the Malaysian region over 19 years. In this study, satellite altimeters (SALT) were used to derive absolute sea levels (ASLs). Tide gauge (TG) stations along the coast of Malaysia were utilised to derive the rate of relative sea levels using sea level changes and VLMs. To obtain ASL at TGs, VLM at these stations were computed using Global Positioning System (GPS), Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS InSAR), and SALT minus TG. The computed VLMs mostly show similarities in signs rather than magnitude. The findings from the multi-sensor techniques showed that regional sea level trends ranged from 2.65 +/- 0.86 mm/yr to 6.03 +/- 0.79 mm/yr for chosen sub-areas, with an overall mean of 4.47 +/- 0.71 mm/yr and overall subsidence. This information is expected to be valuable for a wide variety of climatic applications and for studying environmental issues related to flooding and global warming in Malaysia. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

One promising approach for enhancing flood risk management is the utilization of emergency calls as a valuable data source. This paper proposes two primary applications of these calls: 1) enhancing the cartography of flood risk areas and 2) improving risk communication systems. The disastrous flood event that took place in the Vega Baja region (Spain) in September 2019 is taken as a case study for this research. On the one hand, by analysing and geolocating emergency calls related to this flood event, we identify additional affected zones that are not represented in the existing cartography, leading to more comprehensive and accurate mapping. On the other hand, the analysis of the 112 calls is used to create a contextbased catalogue of warning messages, tailored to address the unique requirements and challenges faced by the local population during the flood event under study. Thus, emergency calls serve as a direct link between the needs of affected population during a flood event and emergency response agencies. Overall, the outputs of this research underscore the importance of integrating emergency call data into flood management frameworks to enhance preparedness, response, and resilience in flood-prone regions in the framework of climate change.

Physical experiments were conducted to measure the overtopping landward of an ideal fringing reef profile of different widths. Water depths over the reef flat were varied, together with the freeboard elevation of the beach crest or coastal maximum. The analysis evaluated the performance of conventional and new models in predicting overtopping flows, leading to the development of two new expressions based on a recently proposed general expression. The analysis compares model performance using both offshore wave conditions and wave and water level conditions at the beach toe at the landward end of the reef flat, with the latter providing more robust predictions. The current empirical overtopping models perform poorly using offshore wave conditions. Using wave conditions at the beach toe, the squared normalized deficit of freeboard emerged as a robust predictor, exhibiting a strong linear correlation with overtopping flow rate and overtopping volume. Two new empirical constants for the conventional overtopping models were derived from the data, which reflect the influence on the overtopping of wave transformation and momentum transfer during wave breaking and propagation across the reef.

Italy, which has the largest number of sites on the World Heritage List, offers many examples of interactions between atmospheric phenomena and cultural heritage. The research presented here aimed to investigate the potential of one of these sites, Alberobello in the Apulia region, to respond to the stresses induced by intense weather phenomena that occurred in August 2022. Data from conventional and nonconventional sensors were employed to characterize the event. During previous studies, regions prone to meteorological risk were identified based on long-term model analyses. According to these studies, the marked area resulted in a region sensitive to convective precipitation and thus represents an interesting case study. The weather event investigated caused flooding and damage in the Alberobello surroundings; however, the UNESCO site showed a positive response. We explored the reasons by consulting the literature to outline the site's peculiarities, especially its architectural features, building materials, and terrain morphology. The results revealed that the mutual relationship between the buildings and the environment and the dual role of cultural heritage are values that need to be protected as a resource for natural hazard mitigation.

This study uses max-stable processes to examine spatial extremes of annual maxima precipitation. The generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters are expressed as simple linear combinations of geographical coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) and topography. The results show that topography, geographical coordinates, and time (as a temporal covariate) were important covariates in reproducing the stochastic extreme precipitation field using the spatial generalized extreme value (SPEV). The inclusion of time as a covariate further confirms the impacts of climate change on extreme precipitation in the NCRB. The fitted SPEV was used to predict the 25- and 50-year return period levels. The fitted Extremal-t max-stable process model captured the spatial dependency structure of the extreme precipitation in the NCRB. The study is relevant in quantifying the spatial dependency structure of extreme precipitation in the Northern Great Plains. The result will contribute as a decision-support system in climate adaptation strategies in the United States and Canada.

Comparison of <i>Ratioing</i> and <i>RCNA</i> Methods in the Detection of Flooded Areas Using Sentinel 2 Imagery (Case Study: Tulun, Russia)	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban floods; Radiometric Rotation Controlled by No-change Axis (RCNA); Ratioing; remote sensing; Tulun	REGION; IMPACT	Climate change and natural disasters caused by hydrological, meteorological, and climatic phenomena have a significant impact on cities. Russia, a continental country with a vast territory of complex geographic-ecological environments and highly variable climatic conditions, is subject to substantial and frequent natural disasters. On 29 June 2019, an extreme precipitation event occurred in the city of Tulun in the Irkutsk oblast, Russian Federation, which caused flooding due to the increase in the water level of the Iya River that passes through the city, leaving many infrastructures destroyed and thousands of people affected. This study aims to determine the flooded areas in the city of Tulun based on two change detection methods: Radiometric Rotation Controlled by No-change Axis (RCNA) and Ratioing, using Sentinel 2 images obtained before the event (19 June 2019) and during the flood peak (29 June 2019). The results obtained by the two methodologies were compared through cross-classification, and a 98% similarity was found in the classification of the areas. The study was validated based on photointerpretation of Google Earth images. The methodology presented proved to be useful for the automatic precession of flooded areas in a straightforward, but rigorous, manner. This allows stakeholders to efficiently manage areas that are buffeted by flooding episodes.	[Fernandez, Helena Maria; Granja-Martins, Fernando; Pereira, David A. B.; Isidoro, Jorge M. G.

Here, we appraise the potential of four key adaptation strategies to reduce flood risk across Europe based on flood risk modelling and cost-benefit analysis. We find that reducing flood peaks using detention areas is economically the most attractive option. In a scenario without climate mitigation (3 degrees C global warming), they can lower projected flood losses in Europe by 2100 from euro44(30-61) billion to euro8.1(5.5-10.7) billion per year and lower population exposed by 84% (75-90%) or achieve a risk level comparable to today. The economic investment required over 2020-2100 would provide a return of euro4(3.5-6.3) for each euro1 invested. The risk reduction potential of strengthening of dykes is somewhat lower, at 70% (59-83%) for a comparable annual investment. Implementing building-based flood proofing and relocation measures is less cost-effective but can reduce impacts in localized areas. With increasing river flooding risk caused by climate and socioeconomic changes, different adaptation strategies can help to improve the resilience to the threat. This Analysis compares four major options, then examines the potential benefits and costs across Europe under different scenarios.

The study adopted a mixed-methods approach, involving the collection and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data. We collected the data through seventeen interviews and 392 household surveys in Glefe, Accra, Ghana. We then conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data to understand participants' perceptions and the factors influencing their flood risk perceptions. The factors were used to produce hypotheses about flood risk perception. We subsequently performed regression analyses using the quantitative data to test the hypothesised relationships. The findings revealed that fear, flood experience, and coping experience were the major factors influencing residents' flood risk perceptions. Taken together, these factors had varying levels of influence on risk perceptions, with fear being the most statistically significant. However, it seems that experience held sway over residents' opinions, views, and perceptions. The perceived likelihood of future flooding events was therefore determined by residents' experience with flooding and coping. The study recommends incorporating the flooding and coping experiences of residents into adaptation mechanisms because these influence their perceptions of the flooding risks.

Besides flood mitigation, green roofs provide additional benefits for the urban environment (e.g., reducing the urban heat island and ensuring energy saving for the underneath building). Moreover, green roofs facilitate the increase of urban biodiversity, attracting different species of small animals, and upgrade the city aesthetic value. Among the different types of green roofs, multilayer blue-green roofs present an additional layer to store water during rainfall events. As part of the Polder Roof field lab project, prototypes of multilayer blue-green roof developed by the Dutch company Metropolder were installed in four Italian cities: Cagliari, Palermo, Perugia, and Viterbo. The four prototypes and the experimental set up are described and the potential benefits of this innovative solution are discussed. Preliminary analyses, from December 2020 to December 2021, enable to estimate runoff reduction and thermal properties of multilayer blue-green roofs, underlying the high potential of this nature-based solution, which allows to retain most of the rainfall events and to mitigate the daily temperature variability.

In this study, the dynamic resilience of the Gregorio catchment (Sao Carlos, Brazil) was assessed. The catchment lacks environmental monitoring and suffers from recurrent floods. The resilience curves were made considering the water depth in the drainage system as the performance index, obtained by simulations with SWMM and HEC-RAS. The calibration of the flood extension was performed using citizen science data. The contribution to increasing the dynamic resilience by implementing decentralized low impact development (LID) practices was also evaluated. For this purpose, bioretention cells were added to the SWMM simulations. The resilience curves were then calculated for the current and future climate scenario, with and without LID, for return periods of 5, 10, 50, and 100 years and duration of 30, 60, and 120 min. Intensity-duration-frequency curves (IDFs) updated by the regional climate model MIROC5 for 2050 and 2100 were used. The results showed a significant improvement in the system's resilience for light storms and the current period due to LID practice interventions. Efficiencies were reduced for moderate and heavy storms with no significant drops in floodwater depth and resilience regardless of the scenario.

J	Galiatsatou, P; Iliadis, C				Galiatsatou, Panagiota; Iliadis, Christos			Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves at Ungauged Sites in a Changing Climate for Sustainable Stormwater Networks	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						IDF curves; simple scaling; nonstationarity; ungauged site; stormwater network design	EXTREME-VALUE ANALYSIS; IDF CURVES; QUANTILE REGRESSION; REGIONAL ESTIMATION; RAINFALL EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION; RISK; FRAMEWORK; PROPERTY; IMPACTS	Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves representing the variation of the magnitude of extreme rainfall events with a return period and storm duration are widely used in hydrologic infrastructure design, flood risk management projects, and climate change impact studies. However, in many locations worldwide, short-duration rainfall-observing sites with long records do not exist. This paper introduces a new methodological framework for extracting IDF curves at ungauged sites transferring information from gauged ones with a relatively homogeneous extreme rainfall climate. This methodology is grounded on a simple scaling concept based on the multifractal behaviour of rainfall. A nonstationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution fitted to annual rainfall monthly maxima at the ungauged site using a moving-time window approach is also applied to consider effects of a changing climate on IDF curve construction. An application is presented at the study site of Fourni, Crete, to derive IDF curves under changing climate conditions and present implications of the proposed methodology in the design of a sustainable stormwater network. The methodology introduced in this work results in increased rainfall extremes up to 20.5%, while the newly designed stormwater network is characterised by increased diameters of its primary conduits, compared to the ones resulting under fully stationary conditions.

Drivers of sustained sanitation access: social network and demographic predictors of latrine reconstruction after flooding disasters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FECAL CONTAMINATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY; TRENDS; IMPACT; STRATEGIES; HOUSEHOLDS; RECOVERY	Flooding disasters pose a threat to sanitation services and can result in loss of access that exacerbates challenges to achieving universal access. To maintain and even improve access to sanitation services, a better understanding of latrine reconstruction decisions is needed. Reconstruction is defined here as the digging of a new latrine pit to replace a pit that collapsed or was filled due to a flooding disaster. To this end, social network analysis was used to identify household and social network variables associated with a household's (i) decision to reconstruct their latrine and, if they reconstructed, (ii) to choose an improved over an unimproved latrine. Of the 380 flood-affected households in Ethiopia, flooding disaster damage resulted in high loss of latrine access as 43% did not reconstruct a latrine. A household was more likely to reconstruct their latrine if their social contacts owned latrines and less likely to reconstruct if their social contacts were also flood-affected. Of households that reconstructed, a household was more likely to choose an improved latrine if they had a larger household size and their head had a higher educational attainment and was older. Overall, the results suggest that social networks may be important to understanding latrine reconstruction after flooding disasters and can be used to improve sanitation resilience.

Understanding historical changes in extreme precipitation is critical for disaster prevention and risk assessment. The Mekong River Basin (MB) is vulnerable to natural disasters related to extreme precipitation. In the past ten years, the MB has experienced some destructive extreme precipitation events. Our concern is whether the historical extreme precipitation events in the MB have increased in a warming climate. This study investigates the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation in the MB from 1951 to 2015 using a high-quality precipitation product and eight indices of extreme precipitation. These indices consistently indicate that the trend in extreme precipitation in the Upper Mekong Basin (UMB) is opposite to that in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). Extreme precipitation has generally decreased in the UMB but increased in the LMB. The areas with significant increasing extreme precipitation are mainly located in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The areas with a statistically significant decline in extreme precipitation primarily occur in the Lancang (China's section of the Mekong river) and Thailand. Also, the magnitude of changes in extreme precipitation is significantly larger in the LMB than that in the UMB, which potentially increases flooding risks in the LMB. The findings from this study are useful for guiding disaster-prevention efforts in the MB.

Mapping the danger to life in flash flood events adopting a mechanics based methodology and planning evacuation routes	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						flash floods; flood evacuation route; flood risk management; flood hazard; flood modelling; human stability in floods; shock capturing models	HUMAN STABILITY; RISK; HAZARD; MODEL; VULNERABILITY; INSTABILITY; SIMULATION; AREA	Extreme flood events are becoming more frequent and challenging due to climate change. Key objectives of this study are to evaluate different criteria used in assessing the hazard to people during flood events and, once determined, the most suitable method is then used to assess the hazard and the safest route(s) for evacuation during a flood event and for a particular case study. The results of the application of two criteria are analysed in terms of the flood hazard assessment with the two criteria being based on a widely used empirical approach and a mechanics based approach. Both criteria are used to assess the flood hazard to people during an extreme flash flood, which occurred on 16th August 2004 in Boscastle (UK). Results obtained for this study have highlighted that the mechanics based criteria are preferable in identifying the ideal escape routes, when considering the flood characteristics and the corresponding response of a human body. The main novelty of this study lies in linking the flood hazard rating with the human body characteristics, when determining the safest route and with a revised formula being developed, which includes the effects of ground slope in the application to a real case study.

When using such outputs to parametrize pluvial flood risk simulations in an urban setting, we need to identify ways to characterize imperviousness and flood exposure. We develop data-driven approaches for establishing this link, and we focus on the data resolutions and spatial scales that should be considered. We use regression models linking aggregated building areas to total imperviousness and models that link aggregated building areas and simulated flood areas to flood damage. The data resolutions used for training regression models are demonstrated to have a strong impact on identifiability, with too fine data resolutions preventing the identification of the link between building areas and hydrology and too coarse resolutions leading to uncertain parameter estimates. The optimal data resolution for modeling imperviousness was identified to be 400 m in our case study, while an aggregation of the data to at least 1000 m resolution is required when modeling flood damage. In addition, regression models for flood damage are more robust when considering building data with coarser resolutions of 200 m than with finer resolutions. The results suggest that aggregated building data can be used to derive realistic estimations of flood risk in screening simulations.

For such reasons, knowledge about the completeness is important and allows to define the period for which the historical range of variability of the documented events can be stated. Based on an extensive collection of torrential events in Austria (more than 21,000), a robust completeness analyses is presented, based on historiographic as well as statistical approaches. The analyses are based on a 3 W-standard, "When did it happen?", "What happened?", and "Where did it happen?", for all documented events. Hence, a completeness of the whole torrential event catalog can be assumed, if the yearly number of events is independent of the reporting rate-the number of reported events per year. We further present completeness periods of (i) the documented torrential processes, "floods", "bedload processes", and "debris flows" as well as of (ii) the documented event-intensities, "low", "medium", "high", and "extreme". In a first order analysis, an increase in events for the resulting completion period could not be detected. However, a strong correlation to the total rainfall sum above the 99th percentile seems to be evident.

Despite the basin's importance for sustainable water use and its specific place in socio-economy of Turkey, the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation are not thoroughly studied. This study aims to improve the understanding of spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and extreme precipitation indices (i.e. annual maximum 1-day and 5-day precipitation, maximum number of consecutive dry and wet days) in the basin for the period 1970-2017. To this end, trend detection methods-Mann-Kendall, modified Mann-Kendall, and Sen's slope estimation methods-were employed with change-point detection methods-Pettitt, Buishand, Standard Normal Homogeneity, Pruned Exact Linear Time, and Wild Binary Segmentation. Further, continuous wavelet analysis was used to analyse the multi-scale resolution features of precipitation. Our results suggested three basin-wide distinct periods with the specific spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation and extreme indices among the sub-periods. The characteristics of the variability of precipitation and extreme indices for the sub-periods were discussed. The outcomes from this study could be useful to decision makers for sustainable water management and mitigate unfavourable impacts of flood and drought threats in one of the most vulnerable and sensitive basins to the impacts of climate change of the country.

Urban floods generate important hydrodynamic loads on building and this work proposes a first systematic study on the actions generated by floods with different characteristics (depth, velocity and incidence angle) on masonry buildings. The study is carried out with experimental tests reproducing a masonry bay with scale 1:10, while the effect of the flow hitting the building has been obtained by moving the building in the water at rest. The pressure generated by the fluid at the four walls of the building was recorded using pressure transducers. It has been found that the overpressure acting on the building depends on the flow characteristics in different manner for the frontal, lateral and rear walls. Further, the incidence angle plays a major role in the generation of a pressure gradient along the impacted wall, and significantly affects both peak frequency and spectral energy. Use of theoretical models suggests that (i) the drag coefficient of the building decreases with the Froude number, and only slightly depends on the incidence angle, and (ii) the blocking effect largely affects the hydrodynamics around the structure.

We present an approach using multiple species distribution models (SDMs) for floodplain macrophytes, based on empirical relationships with flood duration. 27 indicator species were identified for four floodplain classes in a seasonally pulsed distributary of the Okavango Delta, based on data from a field survey of 30 floodplain sites. Spatial hydrological history was constructed using a combination of Landsat and MODIS imagery, and ground-truthing. Relationships between duration and occurrence were used to construct general linear probability models (GLMs) of species along the hydroperiod gradient. The GLM parameters were then used to construct SDMs driven by a spatial hydrological model, which generates annual assessments of inundation duration in months in each 1km(2) cell across the Delta. The modelled distribution fits were mostly robust (18 GLMs had p < 0.05). Tests of model performance against a validation set of five floodplain sites showed an average of 87% correct predictions of presence. The strong performance of the models and the ability to produce map-based and quantitative output indicate good potential for use in assessment of basin development scenarios.

To this end, factors associated with topographic, hydrologic and human characteristics were used to develop indices for flood mapping and assessment. These indices and their components were weighed for flood hazard zoning using two methods: (i) a multi-criterion decision-making model in fuzzy logic and (ii) entropy weight. After preparing the flood hazard map by using the above indices and methods, the characteristics of the change-point were used to assess the role of the check dams in reducing flood risk. The method was used in the Ilanlu catchment, located in the northwest of Hamadan province, Iran, where it is prone to frequent flood events. The results showed that the area of 'very low', 'low' and 'moderate' flood hazard zones increased from about 2.2% to 7.3%, 8.6% to 19.6% and 22.7% to 31.2% after the construction of check dams, respectively. Moreover, the area of 'high' and 'very high' flood hazard zones decreased from 39.8% to 29.6%, and 26.7% to 12.2%, respectively.

It uses the outputs from a high spatial (0.11 & DEG;) and temporal (1-h) resolution single model initial-condition large ensemble (SMILE) and a hydrological model to compute extreme rainfall and streamflow for durations ranging from 1 to 72 h and for return periods of between 2 and 300 years. Increases in extreme precipitation are observed across all durations and return periods. The projected in-creases are strongly related to duration, frequency, and catchment size, with the shortest durations, longest return periods, and smaller catchments witnessing the largest relative rainfall increases. These increases can be quite significant, with the 100-yr rainfall becoming up to 20 times more frequent over the smaller catchments. A similar duration-frequency-size pattern of increases is also observed for future extreme streamflow, but with even larger relative increases. These results imply that future increases in extreme rainfall will disproportionately impact smaller catchments, and particularly so for impervious urban catchments which are typically small, and whose stormwater drainage infrastructures are designed for long-return-period flows, both being conditions for which the amplification of future flow will be maximized.

Mostly due to climate change effects, the frequency of occurrence of these events has quickly grown in recent years, with a consequent increase in related damage, both in terms of loss of human life and effects on the involved infrastructures. Therefore, implementing properly actions to mitigate consequences from slope instability is fundamental to reduce their impact on society. Satellite systems, thanks to the advantages offered by their global view and sampling repetition capability, have proven to be valid tools to be used for these activities in addition to traditional techniques based on in situ measurements. In this work, we propose an advanced multitemporal technique aimed at identifying and mapping landslides using satellite-derived land cover information. Data acquired by the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensor aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-2 platforms were used to investigate a landslide affecting Pomarico city (southern Italy) in January 2019. Results achieved indicate the capability of the proposed methodology in identifying, with a good trade-off between reliability and sensitivity, the area affected by the landslide not just immediately after the event, but also a few months later.

Therefore, rainfall in this region greatly influences plant growth in regional hydrological processes that affect droughts or floods. It is of practical interest to assess how changes in rainfall patterns occur to anticipate hydrological dynamics. However, this is not easy as climate change reshapes global hydrology. Thus, assertive forecasting has become rare and imputed estimates of a reasonable degree of uncertainty. The objective of this work was to verify from the mixture of exponential, gamma, beta, log-normal, Weibull, normal, log-logistic, and exponentiated log-logistic distributions, which best fits the monthly rainfall of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. The data used came from 133 monthly rainfall series (1950 to 2012) distributed over the state of Pernambuco. The Maximum Likelihood Method estimated all parameters. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov adherence test was applied at 5% probability to assess the adjustments. The least rejected distributions in the adherence test were Weibull, gamma, and beta; October presented the smallest number of distributions considered adequate to model monthly rainfall. More than 99% of the rain gauge stations had some adequate probabilistic distribution to model monthly rainfall in March. For most months, except for March, the Weibull distribution was the most suitable for modeling the monthly rainfall in the vast majority of rain gauge stations of Pernambuco.

The aim of the study was to identify fish traits that were positively related to eutrophication and ongoing warming. The research was conducted for 19 years in the Dnipro River channel and floodplain water system of the "Dnipro-Orylskiy" Nature Reserve. Both categorical and continuous fish traits were considered. The study area is characterized by a more intense warming trend than the average for Europe, which reflects an increase in the maximum summer air temperature. At the same time, the concentration of chlorophyll-a had a monotonic tendency to decrease during the study period. Phytophilic, limnophilic, and freshwater fish species are increasing in abundance, while rheophilic and lithophilic fish are decreasing due to global warming. Fish species with greater vulnerability and resilience have selective advantages in terms of global warming. Pelagic fish species are the most resistant to eutrophication, while benthopelagic and phytolithophilic fish species are the most sensitive. Brackish-water demersal self-settled species of marine origin have a competitive advantage over other native freshwater species in the face of increasing symptoms of eutrophication and a warming climate.

The trend of EREs in the state of Himachal Pradesh shows an increasing trend, so in this study, an attempt is being made for quantifying the climatological feature of these EREs in the state of Himachal Pradesh in the western Himalayan mountain region. Multi-source observed datasets for the long-term period, i.e., 1901 to 2020, are considered for the analysis. The climatology analysis indicates that northern and southern parts of Himachal Pradesh receive comparatively more rainfall, and the state witnessed a decreasing trend of the rainfall in the current decade. The classifications of these EREs in terms of monsoon and non-monsoon with a different threshold of daily rainfall are being analyzed, and it is found that almost 90% of extreme events are observed in the monsoon season. The zone centered around 32.5 degrees N and 76.25 degrees E seems to be the hotspot for the frequent EREs in the mountainous state. The spatial analysis of the ERE trend also indicated that almost 40% of the state witnesses the heavy rainfall throughout the years. This observational study will surely help in understanding the dynamics of these EREs in the higher altitude regions and can be used for hydro-meteorological disaster management and mitigation.

On top of that, situations such as the new pandemic of Covid-19 pose the grid under new scenarios of large load reduction where renewable energies gain importance and traditional sources are strongly curtailed. On this basis, the resilience of the electrical grid turns into a key feature to be analysed and strongly enhanced. Thus, the power grid is being analysed by researchers in recent years to assess such hazards along with what measures or resources are effective against them, such as distributed energy resources based on renewable energies. Based on these studies, this paper aims to explore which power grid resilience KPIs fit more to describe the scenarios of the disruptive events for the consequent discussion of the installation of renewable sources to prioritize investments in order to minimize impacts. Furthermore, a geographic information system based model is developed to analyse a static study case of flooding in the city of Barcelona. Results show that the city's power grid is vulnerable to the scenario, but it has the potential of renewable energies to mitigate its consequences. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

LCMAP products were used to quantify the timing and degree of interannual disturbance and to gain a better understanding of how land cover change affects the water balance of disturbed watersheds. In this paper, we present how LCMAP science products can be used to improve knowledge for hydrologic modeling, climate research, and forest management. Anthropogenic influences (e.g., dams and irrigation diversions) often minimize the impacts of land cover change on water balance dynamics when compared to interannual fluctuations of hydroclimatic events (e.g., drought and flooding). Our findings show that each watershed exhibits a complex suite of influences involving climate variables and other factors that affect each of their water balances differently when land cover change occurs. In this study, forests within arid to semi-arid climates experience greater water balance effects from land cover change than watersheds where water is less limited.

We quantify the northward migration, that we attribute to True Polar Wander (TPW), of its axis of symmetry, between 400 and 150 Ma, from southern latitudes to the equatorial zone. The spatial stabilizing within the equatorial zone of the axis of symmetry in a fixed position with respect to the lower mantle was marked by alternating clockwise and counterclockwise oscillations between 250 and 100 Ma that we relate to tectonic events. A subduction girdle is predicted to set up lateral temperature gradients from the relatively warm sub-Pangean mantle to a cooler sub-oceanic mantle. Over time, this effect acts to destabilize the Pangea landmass and its associated subduction girdle. Quantitatively, a scaling theory for the stability of the subduction girdle against the mantle overturn constrains the maximum magnitude of sub-Pangean warming before breakup to be order 100 degrees C, consistent with constraints on the Pacific-Atlantic oceanic crustal thickness differences. Our predictions are in line with the recent analyses of the Jurassic-Cretaceous climate change and with the existing models for potential driving forces for a TPW oscillation of Pangea across the equator. The timing and intensity of the predicted sub-Pangean warming potentially contributed to the enigmatically large Siberian Traps and CAMP flood basalts at 250 Ma and 201 Ma, respectively.

This disaster underlined the high vulnerability of the local population and raised questions regarding the resilience of Kashmiris to future floods. Although the magnitude of the 2014 flood has been considered unprecedented within the context of existing measurements, we argue that the short flow series may lead to spurious misinterpretation of the probability of such extreme events. Here we use a millenniumlong record of past floods in Kashmir based on historical and tree-ring records to assess the probability of 2014-like flood events in the region. Our flood chronology (635 CE-nowadays) provides key insights into the recurrence of flood disasters and propels understanding of flood variability in this region over the lastmillennium, showing enhanced activity during the Little Ice Age. We find that high-impact floods have frequently disrupted the Kashmir valley in the past. Thus, the inclusion of historical records reveals large flood hazard levels in the region. The newly gained information also underlines the critical need to take immediate action in the region, so as to reduce the exposure of local populations and to increase their resilience, despite existing constraints in watershed management related to the Indus Water Treaty.

In this methodology, exposed elements are organized as nodes on a graph, which is used to propagate impacts from directly affected nodes to other nodes across graph links. Compared to traditional approaches, the main advantage of the adopted methodology lies in the possibility of identifying and understanding indirect impacts and cascading effects. The application case concerns floods numerically reconstructed in Mexico City in response to rainfall events of increasing return periods. The hazard reconstruction was carried out by using a simplified hydrological/hydraulic model of the urban drainage system, implemented in EPASWMM, the Storm Water Management Model developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The paper shows how the impacts are propagated along different orders of the impact chain for each return period and compares the risk curves between direct and indirect impact. It also highlights the extent to which the reduction in demand of services from consumers and the loss of services from suppliers are respectively contributing to the final indirect impacts. Finally, it illustrates how different impact mitigation measures can be formulated based on systemic information provided by the analysis of graph properties and taking into account indirect impacts.

Economic assessment for urban drainage planning and decision making often focuses on flood criteria. This study presents an economic assessment of GI based on a conventional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) that includes several benefits related to urban drainage (floods, combined sewer overflows and waste water treatment), environmental impacts (receiving water bodies) and additional societal and environmental benefits associated with GI (air quality improvements, aesthetic values, etc.). Benefits from flood damage reduction are monetized based on the widely used concept of Expected Annual Damage (EAD) that was calculated using a 1D/2D urban drainage model together with design storms and a damage model based on tailored flood depth-damage curves. Benefits from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) damage reduction were monetized using a 1D urban drainage model with continuous rainfall simulations and prices per cubic meter of spilled combined sewage water estimated from literature; other societal benefits were estimated using unit prices also estimated from literature. This economic assessment was applied to two different case studies: the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Badalona. The results are useful for decision making and also underline the relevancy of including not only flood damages in CBA of GI.

Future challenges of coastal landfills exacerbated by sea level rise	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal landfill; Sea-level rise; Erosion; Flooding; Shoreline management plans; Remediation		In England and Wales, there are at least 1700 coastal landfills in the coastal flood plain and at least 60 threatened by erosion, illustrating a global problem. These landfills are a major issue in shoreline management planning (SMP) which aims to manage the risks associated with flooding and coastal erosion. Where landfills exist, "hold the line" (requiring the building or upgrading of artificial defences to maintain the current shoreline) is often selected as the preferred SMP option, although government funding is not available at present. To investigate these issues in detail, three case-study landfills are used to examine the risks of future flooding and erosion together with potential mitigation options. These cases represent a contrasting range of coastal landfill settings. The study includes consideration of sea-level rise and climate change which exacerbates risks of erosion and flooding of landfills. It is fundamental to recognise that the release of solid waste in coastal zones is a problem with a geological timescale and these problems will not go away if ignored. Future erosion and release of solid waste is found to be more of a threat than flooding and leachate release from landfills. However, while leachate release can be assessed, there is presently a lack of methods to assess the risks from the release of solid waste. Hence, a lack of science constrains the design of remediation options. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Beaven, R. P.; Stringfellow, A. M.; Nicholls, R. J.; Kebede, A.

Assessing the Role of Alluvial Geomorphology for Late-Holocene Settlement Strategies (Po Plain - N Italy) Through Point Pattern Analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Point pattern analysis; settlement strategies; Po plain; alluvial geomorphology; human resilience; landscape archaeology	LAST 2 MILLENNIA; FLOOD RISK; BRONZE-AGE; MANAGEMENT; VARIABILITY; VALLEY; GEOARCHAEOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTS; TEMPERATURE; ARCHAEOLOGY	Fluvial environments represent complex human-water systems, as floodplains have always been among the most suitable environments for human subsistence. In this paper, we present one of the first attempts to investigate human adaptation to fluvial environments in the past using spatial statistics (Point Pattern Analysis). In particular, the paper addresses the influence of alluvial geomorphology on the settlement strategies in the Po plain (Northern Italy) during the Roman and the Medieval Period. The transition from Roman to the Middle Ages represented a crucial phase for the reorganisation of human settlement strategies in the Po Valley. The collapse of Roman hydrological systems in association with a cooling climate phase triggered waterlogging process in a large portion of the farmland: swamps became the typical features of the Medieval landscape. This paper aims to assess if the different water management strategies in the Roman and Medieval periods influenced the spatial distribution of sites, and to evaluate the relative importance of agricultural suitability over flood risks in the two historical phases. This research contributes to quantifying how the socio-political factors of past societies played a key role in human resilience to geomorphological hazards related to alluvial contexts and exceptional floods triggered by climate changes.

Although a highly effective long-term measure, the planned relocation of individuals from areas at risk is rarely considered as an adaptive response. We evaluate how financial recovery schemes are actually linked to planned relocation option in two study sites in Austria. In both areas, more than 500 households were offered a voluntary planned relocation directly after extreme flood events. We conducted a semi-structured qualitative approach with 16 key respondents in order to identify how current financial recovery schemes are linked to ongoing and past relocation processes. The results show that there exists a missing link between disaster-aid payments and compensation for planned relocation. Participants gained from the programmes and used disaster-aid compensation schemes to increase the economic value of their houses. In addition, the financial schemes were not used to encourage further sustainability transition processes at local level. These data demonstrate the uneven distribution of payments with strong socio-economic implications for those who take part in planned relocation process. We recommend a better link between financial disaster-aid compensation and voluntary payout programmes, especially to reduce the uneven socio-economic distribution during the recovery phase.

The watershed covers more than one third of this area. However, how the ancient river developed is still not so clear. In this study, a sandpit along the ancient river terrace at Bam Som, Tha Chang subdistrict, Chaloem Phra Kiat district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand is investigated with respect to the stratigraphy and sedimentology. The physical features of the sediment (particle size, sphericity, and sorted level) at different depths are analyzed and described. The layers composing the stratigraphic profile are classified based on the sedimentary profiles. Twenty two sampling layers classified into 3 members are recognized over 14 m depth. Three distinct river development cycles along the vertical section are identified along the vertical section. The stratigraphic stages correspond to the sedimentary members are suggested with the substances fining upwards. Generally, the stage at the bottom is shallow lake or flood plain deposit, the middle section represents a stage which is channel river deposit, and the upper section represents a stage which is dry land to aeolian deposit. Pollen records match well with fluvial development. The ancient river dynamics reconstruction is an approach to analysis the palaeoenvironment and will provide more information.

J	Thomson, LAJ; Braglia, L				Thomson, Lex A. J.; Braglia, Luca			Review of Fiji <i>Hibiscus</i> (Malvaceae-Malvoideae) Species in Section <i>Lilibiscus</i>	PACIFIC SCIENCE			English	Review								The taxonomy of Hibiscus species in section Lilibiscus in Fiji is reappraised in the light of recent field and morphological studies. Six pre-European contact species are recognized. These comprise four Fiji endemic species, three of which are new and described: H. bennettii L. Thoms. and Braglia from Mt. Delaikoro, Vanua Levu; H. bragliae L. Thoms. from Ovalau; and H. macverryi L. Thoms. and Braglia from Macuata Province, Vanua Levu and Taveuni. The fourth Fiji endemic, Hibiscus storckii Seem., was first collected on Taveuni in 1860 and is here reinstated. Hibiscus cooperi Hort. Ex Lemaire, a species generally associated with the South Pacific region, has been confused in recent times with H. storckii. Hibiscus cooperi is lectotypified and reinstated. Hibiscus cooperi and H. rosa-sinensis L. are both considered ancient, pre-European introductions into the Pacific Islands. The Fiji archipelago is recognized as a secondary center of diversity and speciation in sect. Lilibiscus in the South Pacific. A botanical key is provided for the six Lilibiscus species that were present in the South Pacific Islands prior to European contact. All four Fiji endemic Lilibiscus species fall into the IUCN Critically Endangered (CR) Red List category and are highly threatened in the wild from climate change and associated extreme events including tropical cyclones, flooding, and landslides, as well as displacement by environmentally invasive species and through hybridization with introduced Hibiscus species. They are in urgent need of more intensive field survey followed by complementary in situ and ex situ conservation actions.	[Thomson, Lex A.

We used Principal of Maximum Entropy (POME) to compute entropy measures and Value of Monitoring (VOM) with Thiessen polygons, and Adjacent Station Groups (ASGs).New hydrological insights for the region: The results showed that the Marginal Entropy (ME) values lie between 0.039 and 0.048. The maximum values of ME are in the northeast area of the study region, exhibiting larger complexity and variability in the environmental conditions typical for northeast Bihar. The VOM was in the range of - 1 to + 1 suggesting strategic placement of additional 12 rain gauge stations to improve the existing monitoring network. The new locations were in the south mountainous area, the east, and the northwest, enhancing network coverage and addressing spatial and temporal precipitation variability. These findings support the design of a more effective monitoring network and have significant implications in hydrological modelling, flood prediction, and water resources management.

In this Review, we outline the characteristics of GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from paddy soils, focusing on climate change effects and mitigation strategies. Global mean annual area-scaled and yield-scaled GHG emissions are similar to 7,870 kg CO(2)e ha(-1) and 0.9 kg CO(2)e kg(-1), respectively, with 94% from CH4. However, emissions vary markedly, primarily reflecting the impact of management practices. In particular, organic matter additions and continuous flooding of paddies both stimulate CH4 emissions, whereas fertilizer N application rate is the most important driver of N2O emissions. Although contemporary changes in emissions are uncertain, future elevated [CO2] and warming are projected to increase CH4 emissions by 4-40% and 15-23%, respectively. Yet, integrated agronomic management strategies - including cultivar, organic matter, water, tillage and nitrogen management - offer GHG mitigation potential. In particular, new rice variety selection, non-continuous flooding and straw removal strategies reduce GHG emissions by 24%, 44% and 46% on average, respectively. However, approaches need to be optimized on the basis of seasonal CH4 emission patterns, necessitating improved quantification and reduced uncertainty in regional and global GHG estimates, especially in low latitudes.

The deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) were modified by incorporating the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) method to improve hourly runoff predictions at multiple scales, ranging from 100 to over 6,000 km(2 )in the Seybouse Basin, Algeria. The atmospheric reanalysis data set, ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) with a 31-km resolution, climate variability indices, and in situ runoff observations were used. The most relevant atmospheric and soil moisture predictors from the reanalysis grids covering the study area were used to represent spatial variability. The prediction performance of the original CNN and modified CNN-ICA and CNN-GWO models were evaluated. The CNN-GWO model outperformed CNN-ICA and the original model in predicting runoff and improved the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency score up to 0.99. Results across multiple scales disclose that the models with climate indices as inputs showed higher performance than the models with only atmospheric data as inputs, especially in predicting extreme runoff values in basins with elevations above 670 m, suggesting that climate variability indices need to be considered in flood predictions and infrastructure design in mountainous areas with increasing climate change uncertainties.

J	Azad, MJ; Pritchard, B				Azad, Md Javed; Pritchard, Bill			Bonding, bridging, linking social capital as mutually reinforcing elements in adaptive capacity development to flood hazard: Insights from rural Bangladesh	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bonding -bridging -linking social capital; Interactions; Adaptive capacity; Flood; Qualitative methods	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; ADAPTATION; RECOVERY; HOUSEHOLDS; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; VULNERABILITY; LIVELIHOODS; ASSESSMENTS	The role of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital is a key factor in the adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters. But what roles do these three forms of social capital play, and how do they interact? This paper responds to this question using evidence from northern Bangladesh's highly flood-prone Sirajganj District. Qualitative data from 20 village-level Focus Group Dis-cussions accounted for the varying roles and importance of these three forms of social capital and their interactions at different moments in the hazard cycle. Testimonies from FGD participants revealed a narrative in which bonding social capital took priority during flood onset as a means to safeguard persons and property; bridging social capital came into play more prominently during the flood crisis as affected villagers sought coping assistance from friends, neighbours and rela-tives elsewhere, and linking social capital emerged as a vital contributor to adaptive capacity in flood survival and recovery phases, albeit in interaction with bridging and bonding modes. These findings demonstrate how different forms of social capital mutually reinforce one another over the duration of the hazard cycle, contributing to recent research that has sought to understand better the contribution of social capital to the adaptive capacity in an increasingly climate -stressed world.

J	Fang, W; Yang, DX; Williams, PN; Yang, Y				Fang, Wen; Yang, Danxing; Williams, Paul N.; Yang, Yi			Distinct response of arsenic speciation and bioavailability to different exogenous organic matter in paddy soil	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Arsenic; Rice straw; Humic substances; Speciation; Bioavailability	REDOX CHANGES; PLANT UPTAKE; HUMIC-ACID; RICE; IRON; METHYLATION; RELEASE; ACCUMULATION; RHIZOSPHERE; METABOLISM	Land application of organic waste has been increasingly encouraged since it could sequester carbon to mitigate climate change. Considering the susceptibility of arsenic (As) bioavailability in soils to organic matter, understanding the influence of different exogenous organic matter on As biogeochemical behavior in rice-soil system is crucial to reasonably recycle organic waste on soils and ensure the food safety. In this study, impacts of two typical organic matter amendments, rice straw and humic substance, on the As speciation and bioavailability in paddy soil were investigated. Results showed that addition of both rice straw and humic substance could increase the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in soil solution by 16.4%-34.4% and 21.7%-53.2%, respectively, but the response of As speciation and bioavailability was quite different, showing the decoupling between As release and DOC. Rice straw addition increased As release to porewater by 28.0%-28.4%, particularly at the initial 0-18 days after the soil was flooded, but humic substance presented the opposite effect, decreasing As release by 27.4%-43.1% which was mainly attributable to the AsIII immobilization. This study suggests that the organic matter with high contents of labile heteroaliphatic/aliphatic carbon, being easily to be biodegraded, should not be applied on As contaminated soils.

However, different hydromorphological factors along riparian gradients, as well as land use, can influence the distribution and concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of SOC in catenas of riparian soils and to characterize soil organic matter (SOM) at the micromorphological level in three riparian ecosystems of Iztaccihuatl volcano (grasslands, forests, and agricultural zone). At each site, disturbed and undisturbed samples were collected in soil profiles along a catenary perpendicular to the stream. In the laboratory, COS was determined in the fine soil fraction and soil organic matter (SOM) micromorphology was described in thin sections. COS varied according to vegetation and land use (grassland 38.95 kg m(-2) > forest 34.40 kg m(-2) > agricultural zone 17.77 kg m(-2)). The highest values in COS occur in soils closer to the stream up to 68.92 kg m(-2). SOM presents different organic residues and stages of decomposition and with higher abundance in the riparian subsoil where hydromorphism conditions limit its mineralization. Riparian soils have a greater potential to accumulate carbon (halophytic and autochthonous) than adjacent uplands. Likewise, degradation of these ecosystems has an impact on carbon storage and their role in climate change mitigation.

A relevant example is the Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage site, one of the key sites of Britain's industrial revolution of the 18th century and located along the Derwent River Valley. Individual susceptibility scenarios of natural hazards in the area like collapsible deposits, compressible ground, debris flow, landslide, running sands, shrink-swell, soluble rock and flooding (both riverine and groundwater) are available, but a comprehensive product able to support disaster mitigation measurement and land planning still does not exist. On this basis, a multi-hazard susceptibility analysis was completed with the added benefit of reducing the complexity and providing a methodological framework for multi-hazard estimation. The analysis was completed in a GIS environment through an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) multicriteria decision-making process. Since the AHP method is affected by a user selection bias, a quantitative Relative significance index was derived to rank the AHP factors during the susceptibility estimation. This index suggests that flooding is the principal natural hazard for the Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage site. The multi-hazard susceptibility map also indicates that most of the areas where the mills are located are subject to significant susceptibility to natural hazards.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Storbjörk, S; Hjerpe, M				Storbjork, Sofie; Hjerpe, Mattias			Stuck in experimentation: exploring practical experiences and challenges of using floating housing to climate-proof waterfront urban development in Sweden	JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Climate-proofing; Cities; Waterfront development; Urban climate experimentation; Floating housing	ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; CITY; INNOVATION; IMPACTS; CITIES; DESIGN; ENERGY	With climate change already underway, cities are looking for ways to deal with its effects. To balance urban waterfront development and climate adaptation, floating housing is presented as a promising solution-however it has not been studied sufficiently. This paper explores floating housing as urban climate experimentation, targeting vision/motivation, practice and upscaling in a national context where support mechanisms and traditions are absent. Interviews with innovation entrepreneurs and municipal planners involved with planning and building floating districts show that, with one exception, the Swedish initiatives are at odds with the theoretical assumptions behind urban climate experimentation. Initiatives are neither challenge-led in terms of climate risk nor inclusive and community-based. Rather, the small-scale private entrepreneurs are pioneers in offering unique living on water as one-off innovations. While allowing experimentation, municipal planners are less convinced by the effectiveness and appropriateness of upscaling. Floating housing may contribute to local identity building and place marketing, but are riddled with implementation challenges regarding shoreline protection, privatization/accessibility, limited market interest and urban development fit. While the floating houses themselves withstand flooding, thus safeguarding individual house owners, they do not protect the land-based city with its vulnerable waterfront development patterns. Results thus suggest the limitation of floating houses in shifting development pathways and strengthening urban climate proofing.

J	Winter, AK; Karvonen, A				Winter, Amanda K.; Karvonen, Andrew			Climate governance at the fringes: Peri-urban flooding drivers and responses	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Flood governance; Adaptive governance; Land-use change; Peri-urban; Climate adaptation	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; AUTONOMOUS ADAPTATION; RISK-MANAGEMENT; URBANIZATION; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITIES; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; IMPACT; POLICY	There is a large body of scientific evidence on the climate crisis and flooding in urban areas. Extreme weather events are producing extensive property damage and loss of life and require new modes of flood governance. However, the climate crisis does not stop at the city limits: peri-urban areas have related but distinct flood challenges due to land use change, regulation, perceptions, and capacity to develop collective responses. The aim of the literature review is to synthesize peri-urban flood governance drivers and responses with a particular emphasis on empirical findings from the past decade. The literature review draws on findings from 26 empirical case studies with respect to how and where research is conducted on peri-urban flood governance, the drivers of peri-urban flooding, and the responses by peri-urban stakeholders to address flood risks. A common governance approach involves autonomous adaptation that results in maladaptation - both of which are critiqued as inadequate to address flood risks. The findings reveal a host of specific peri-urban challenges in addressing flooding but also point towards opportunities for new modes of adaptive governance. The article concludes by reflecting on the promise of developing an adaptive governance approach to peri-urban flooding to acknowledge the social and ecological complexities of climate change while opening up possibilities for emergent modes and innovative approaches of collaborative problem-solving.

For a cascade reservoir catchment, the discharge from the upstream reservoir contributes to an important part of the streamflow over the downstream areas, which makes it tremendously hard to explore the added value of meteorological forecasts. Here, we integrate meteorological forecasts, land surface hydrological model simulations and machine learning to forecast hourly streamflow over the Yantan catchment, where the streamflow is influenced by both the upstream reservoir water release and the rainfall-runoff processes within the catchment. Evaluation of the hourly streamflow hindcasts during the rainy seasons of 2013-2017 shows that the hydrometeorological ensemble forecast approach reduces probabilistic and deterministic forecast errors by 6 % compared with the traditional ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) approach during the first 7 d. The deterministic forecast error can be further reduced by 6 % in the first 72 h when combining the hydrometeorological forecasts with the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning method. However, the forecast skill for LSTM using only historical observations drops sharply after the first 24 h. This study implies the potential of improving flood forecasts over a cascade reservoir catchment by integrating meteorological forecasts, hydrological modeling and machine learning.

The foremost important requirement in civil engineering is to design all of the members related to a building such as slabs, beams, columns and footings. The residential building is situated in Malappuram district of Kerala state. Flooding and its adverse effects on the structure has been a cause of concern affecting the safety of humans for a major cause of time. This paves way for the sustainability constraint and the concerns over climatic change and the worry of environmental causes are also taken as a major concern in people's minds. Flood resistant buildings must comply with all major health and safety constraints and must begin from the primary planning and must continue in each of the upcoming stages. Structural analysis and designing of the building is done according to the relevant IS codes and STAAD.Pro software. There are higher chances and risks embarking greater polls for the structure to fail due to waterlogging or the pressure imbibed due to the movement of course of water thus paving out the environmental constraint. Proper height must be allowed for the retaining walls, taking into account the future floods of greater magnitude and higher flow. Manufacturability constraint accounts to improper design of structural elements. Taking into account all these constraints proper designing must be done as per IS 456:2000 and modelling using REVIT Architecture.	[Singh, Atul Kumar; Sharma, Prerna; Krishnaraj, L.; Kumar, V. R.

To address these, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) is investigated as a future infrastructure because of its lower cost of implementation and maintenance as well as its provision of different additional ecosystem services. Studies have proposed at least two types of Eco-DRR functions: inhibition, which reduces the potential occurrence of hazards, and mitigation, which reduces a hazard's damage in its aftermath. This study evaluated the latter type for paddy fields in the inland regions of central Japan. Using separate longterm statistical records of urban and agricultural inundated areas, we tested the relations between these areas and their land-use conditions. We predicted that paddy fields having a large area and that are low-lying are effective for flood mitigation. The results showed that local areas with paddy fields that potentially store large amounts of surface water, namely, latter pattern namely low-lying paddy fields, tend to reduce urban area inundation. Interestingly, the total paddy field area did not reduce inundation; nevertheless, the condition of the paddy field location is essential. This result suggests that such specifically located paddy fields could effectively lessen residential area inundation. This type of seminatural land-use could be used as a green infrastructure (GI) for Eco-DRR.

J	Memon, MH; Ali, M; Khalil, S				Memon, Manzoor H.; Ali, Muhammad; Khalil, Samina			Determinants of income diversification in flood-prone rural Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Floods; Rural Pakistan; Income diversification; Sustainability; Dadu; Disaster; Livelihood	FARM HOUSEHOLDS; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; RISK	Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. The households in rural Pakistan predominantly rely on the agriculture sector which is why their livelihood is threatened by floods. Considering income diversification as a risk-spreading livelihood strategy, this study examines the determinants of income diversification in the flood-prone district Dadu in Sindh province of Pakistan. The analysis is based on the data from a primary survey of 350 randomly selected households. The list of determinants is taken from the literature and the Ordinary Least Squares method is used for estimation of the regression coefficients. The results show that households with a relatively higher number of earning members and those headed by male or educated members are more likely to have a diversified income portfolio. The moderation analysis shows that households headed by educated male members and educated older members are more likely to diversify than the uneducated ones. Contradicting the findings of the literature, poverty is not a significant determinant of income diversification in Dadu which suggests that lack of economic opportunities and awareness might be more important determinants of diversification than wealth in Dadu and requires further research. The development policy in rural Pakistan should focus on increasing access to economic opportunities, creating awareness about income diversification strategies, and investing in the human capital of the rural population to improve the sustainability of their livelihood.

Does the topology of the river network influence the delivery of riverine ecosystem services?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						landscape ecology; physical processes; river basin; river network topology; riverine ecosystem services	LAND-USE; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; ANASTOMOSING RIVER; WATER; STREAM; FRAMEWORK; CONSERVATION; CLIMATE; DENITRIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY	Riverine ecosystems provide important ecosystem services reflecting their unique forms and functions. While the effects of stressors such as land cover change, climate change and growing economies on riverine ecosystem services (RES) have been well researched, the effect of the structure of the river network itself is less understood. This paper compares the capacity of different river network topologies in the delivery of selected RES. For three contrasting synthetic river network topologies (Long Trellis Narrow; Coastal Dendritic; Inland Dendritic), we applied simple functional equations to model six RES: water supply, hydropower generation, sediment retention, nutrient uptake, flood attenuation and aquatic habitat provision. Results showed that the synthetic topologies deliver different levels of RES, driven by their differences in physical structure. For example, the Inland Dendritic network removed more nitrate and better attenuated flooding due to its relatively longer lower reaches but offered poorer prospects for water supply because the longer reaches were more susceptible to transmission losses (e.g., due to bed seepage). This study provides a valuable first step in understanding the effect of river network topology on RES delivery, and the relative strengths among network types. Understanding these effects can aid decision makers in the conservation and restoration of degraded river basins to preserve RES for future generations.

We assume that the need for NFA arises from well understood deterministic mechanisms of change. A common assumption in NFA, questioned here, is that more accurate estimators of hydrologic statistics result when more realistic, complex and sophisticated models are employed. By considering the mean annual flood (drought or other hydrologic event), general conditions are derived when the sample mean (SM) is a more efficient (lower mean square error, MSE) estimator than a regression estimate of the mean (RM). We introduce an optimal fractional mean estimator, FM * , which is simply the SM of the most recent period of record nf*, where f * is the optimal fraction of the full sample n , which leads to minimum MSE among all possible values of f . Interestingly, FM * is generally preferred over RM for attained significance levels associated with the fitted regression model in excess of about 0.05. Given the considerable attention and uncertainty surrounding potential nonstationary conditions, we demonstrate that a parsimonious estimator which exploits an optimal recent subset of the historical record may be more attractive than many of the more complex nonstationary approaches commonly advocated.

Different dune types were mapped as well as dune toe position and fragmentation, which favors dune sensitivity to storms' impacts, and human occupation and evolution from 1977 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2016. Within a GIS (Geographic Information System) project, 53 dune systems were mapped that summed a total length of ca. 106 km in 1977, differentiating three dune environments: (i) Embryo and mobile dunes (Type I), (ii) grass-fixed dunes (Type II) and (iii) stabilized dunes (Type III). A general decrease in dunes' surfaces was recorded in the 1977-2001 period (-7.5 x 10(6)m(2)), especially in Malaga and Almeria provinces, and linked to dunes' fragmentation and the increase of anthropic occupation (+2.3 x 10(6)m(2)). During the 2001-2016 period, smaller changes in the level of fragmentation and in dunes' surfaces were observed. An increase of dunes' surfaces was only observed on stable or accreting beaches, both in natural and anthropic areas (usually updrift of ports).

WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Land rights; Extreme weather events; Farmers' decisions; Climate adaptation; Rice farming	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FARMERS ADAPTATION; INVESTMENT INCENTIVES; LAND RIGHTS; TENURE; STRATEGIES; HOUSEHOLD; SECURITY; IMPACTS; DROUGHT	Improving land rights in China is often considered as an important factor that facilitates farmers' investments in agriculture. However, whether securing land rights is important for farmers' adaptation to changing climate or not has not been addressed in the literature, particularly with respect to management decisions. This paper examines the relationship between land tenure types and farmer adaptation through management decisions in response to extreme weather events in Guangdong Province in China. Based on a household survey of rice farmers, our results show that compared to a normal year with minor weather events farmers with contracted land are more likely to implement adaptation measures in response to extreme weather events than those who have rented their land from the collective and from other farmers. The results suggest that farmers' adaptive behaviour in response to extreme weather events is significantly different from their day-to-day adaptation to ongoing changes in climate. Farmers' adaptive capacity is also positively influenced by age, the public provision of information, by the presence of social capital, and by plot quality. The results of this study highlight the importance of properly defined land rights for the likelihood of adaptation, and thereby increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security in the context of a changing climate.

This review was undertaken to comprehensively evaluate the performance of ratoon rice in comparison with other rice cropping systems regarding the grain yield, grain quality, economics, and sustainability. In addition, the morphology and physiological bases associated with the performance of ratoon rice was also reviewed. With good crop management, ratoon rice gives a yield equivalent to 60% that of the main crop but with a 50% reduction in resources and labor input. Moreover, rice ratooning improves the grain quality, increases the profits for farmers, and decreases greenhouse gas emissions. Several agronomic practices for tiller-bud regeneration, such as nutrient and water management at the harvest of the main crop, establishment of the main crop, stubble cutting height and the variety selection and integrated technologies for the control of diseases and insects, were suggested to strongly affect the performance of ratoon rice. However, constraints, including low and unstable yield of ratoon crop, lodging, and lack of suitable cultivars and specialized rice harvester for the ratoon rice system, have limited the wide scale adoption of ratoon rice. Meanwhile, the mechanisms underlying the specific management strategies for ratoon rice need to be deeply studied.

AltEx: An open source web application and toolkit for accessing and exploring altimetry datasets	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Satellite altimetry; Tethys platform; Online web application; Water level; Global applications	SATELLITE RADAR ALTIMETRY; RIVER-BASIN; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MEKONG; LAKES; FLOOD; PERFORMANCE; STREAMFLOW	Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrologic variables, such as streamflow, is important for sustainable development, especially with global population growth and climate variations. Typical monitoring of streamflow is conducted using in situ gauging stations; however, stations are costly to setup and maintain, leading to data gaps in regions that cannot afford gauges. Satellite data, including altimetry data, are used to supplement in situ observations and in some cases supply information where they are lacking. This study introduces an open-source web application to access and explore altimetry datasets for use in water level monitoring, named the Altimetry Explorer (AltEx). This web application, along with its relevant REST API, facilitates access to altimetry data for analysis, visualization, and impact. The data provided through AltEx is validated using thirteen gauges in the Amazon Basin from 2008 to 2018 with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient and root mean square error of 0.78 and 1.2 m, respectively. Access to global water level data should be particularly helpful for water resource practitioners and researchers seeking to understand the long-term trends and dynamics of global water level and availability. This work provides an initial framework for a more robust and comprehensive platform to access future altimetry datasets and support research related to global water resources.

In interaction with anthropogenic activities (flow regulation, channel restoration and catchment land-use) this will both increase flooding and drought across the world. Like in many other ecosystems facing changed environmental conditions, it remains difficult to predict the rate and trajectory of vegetation responses to changed conditions. Given that critical ecosystem services (e.g. bank stabilization, carbon subsidies to aquatic communities or water purification) depend on riparian vegetation composition, it is important to understand how and how fast riparian vegetation responds to changing flooding regimes. We studied vegetation changes over 19 growing seasons in turfs that were transplanted in a full-factorial design between three riparian elevations with different flooding frequencies. We found that (a) some transplanted communities may have developed into an alternative stable state and were still different from the target community, and (b) pathways of vegetation change were highly directional but alternative trajectories did occur, (c) changes were rather linear but faster when flooding frequencies increased than when they decreased, and (d) we observed fastest changes in turfs when proxies for mortality and colonization were highest. These results provide rare examples of alternative transient trajectories and stable states under field conditions, which is an important step towards understanding their drivers and their frequency in a changing world.

Therefore, flood resilience is seen as a supplementation to these approaches, putting a larger emphasis on flood acceptance and minimising consequences. An (emergent) group contributing towards flood resilience is civil society. This paper examines how civil society contributions can be furthered and guided in the Netherlands as well as exploring potential limitations in doing so. To achieve this, England is used as a good practice example due to a more developed and defined role for civil society being present here. Data were collected on both actual (England and the Netherlands) and potential (The Netherlands) civil society contributions. These were compared to identify potential avenues for Dutch civil society contributions to flood resilience that can be further investigated. The research shows that the most promising avenues are improving advocacy from citizens, improving local flood awareness and developing relationships between FRM authorities and existing citizen groups that can be harnessed and mobilised to support flood resilience. Additionally, the research also provides insights into potential limitations for transferring resilience approaches from one context to another beyond the cases discussed in this publication.

The effects of a voluntary property buyout and acquisition program on coastal housing markets: Evidence from New York	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Acquisitions; Buyouts; Managed retreat; Housing markets; Climate change adaptation	FLOOD RISK; SALIENCE; DISASTER; VALUES	The magnitude and direction of the economic effects of removing or retrofitting housing in hazard-prone coastal locations is an open empirical question. Using data from a voluntary buyout and acquisition program in the U.S. state of New York, we recover hedonic estimates of the property value impacts of government-acquired properties in the state's coastal counties. Both a repeat sales difference-in-differences approach and an event study addressing treatment effect heterogeneity suggest that buyouts and acquisitions have sizable negative effects on prices (-20 to-10 percent) for homes sold adjacent (<= 100 m) to participating properties. The spatial scale of the impacts differs across policy types, with negative effects attenuating after 100 m for buyouts but persisting for acquisitions up to 1200 m. These impacts are shown to approach zero four years after policy initiation, and the effect of buyouts may turn positive after five years. A disaggregated county-level analysis suggests spatial heterogeneity in price impacts, with positive effects in one county where most participating properties were buyouts and negative effects in counties where most properties were acquired and redeveloped. Our findings demonstrate coastal housing market implications of different policy outcomes that can inform government action in response to increased flood risk.

J	Michelini, S; Sedová, B; Schewe, J; Frieler, K				Michelini, Sidney; Sedova, Barbora; Schewe, Jacob; Frieler, Katja			Extreme weather impacts do not improve conflict predictions in Africa	HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; FORECASTS; DATABASE; DECADE	Quantitative climate and conflict research has thus far considered the role of biophysical extreme weather impacts in conflict dynamics only to a limited extent. We do not fully understand if and if so how, extreme weather impacts can improve conflict predictions. Addressing this gap, we use the Generalized Random Forest (GRF) algorithm to evaluate whether detailed information on extreme weather impacts improves conflict forecasts made with well known conflict predictors such as socio-economic, governance, and history of conflict indicators. We integrate data on biophysical extreme weather impacts such as droughts, floods, crop production shocks, and tropical cyclones from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project 2a (ISIMIP2a) project into predictive models of conflict in mainland Africa between 1994 and 2012. While we find that while extreme weather impacts alone predict violent conflicts modestly well, socio-economic and conflict history indicators remain the strongest individual predictors of conflicts. Finally, fully specified forecast models including conflict history, governance, and socio-economic variables are not improved by adding extreme weather impacts information. Some part of this can be explained by spatial correlations between extreme weather impacts and other socioeconomic and governance conditions. We conclude that extreme weather impacts do not contain any unique information for forecasting annual conflict incidence in Africa, which calls into question its usefulness for early warning.

Nature-Based Solutions are progressively replacing traditional engineering solutions as an alternative since they are more eco-friendly. By re-activating the urban hydrological cycle processes, NBS intends to increase the natural water storage capacity to help decrease urban flooding. The work described here outlines a framework for optimising the efficacy of NBS for flood risk reduction and its co-benefits, as well as defining the trade-offs among these co-benefits. The framework integrates 1D hydrodynamic models with multi-objective optimisation techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework and its methods it has been used in Sint Maarten, which is an island located in the Caribbean Sea. Four NBS measure were identified as having good potential to be applied in the case study, namely: green roof, permeable pavement, bio-retention pond, and open detention basin. The results showed that the developed framework has the ability to represent the link between benefits and costs when evaluating various NBS, hence aiding the decision-making process to select and implement NBS.

In this study, a spatiotemporally comparable assessment of social vulnerability and its drivers was conducted in Portugal, at the civil parish level, for three census frames. The first challenging step consisted of the selection of meaningful and consistent variables over time. Data were normalized using the Adjusted Mazziotta-Pareto Index (AMPI) to obtain comparable adimensional-normalized values. A joint principal component analysis (PCA) was applied, resulting in a robust set of variables, interpretable from the point of view of their self-grouping around vulnerability drivers. A separate PCA for each census was also conducted, which proved to be useful in analyzing changes in the composition and type of drivers, although only the joint PCA allows the monitoring of spatiotemporal changes in social vulnerability scores and drivers from 1991 to 2011. A general improvement in social vulnerability was observed for Portugal. The two main drivers are the economic condition (PC1), and aging and depopulation (PC2). The remaining drivers highlighted are uprooting and internal mobility, and daily commuting. Census data proved their value in the territorial, social, and demographic characterization of the country, to support medium- and long-term disaster risk reduction measures.

To evaluate the river strength, flaw stress and its effects on channel morphology, Landsat 7 and 8 images, topographic maps, geology, and hydrological and field data were used. According to the results of the calculation of hydrological indicators, in terms of 15, the index, a significant difference is seen among upstream and downstream stations. Therefore, it can be found that the presence of the Givi Dam has created a good platform for intensifying the hydrological and morphological changes of the river plan. The particular strength of the river in all parts of the fourth interval and the ninth, 12th, eighth (second interval) levels causes the erosion threshold to soar. The highest amount of shear stress was observed in the second interval at 12, 13, and 9, respectively. Generally, the changes of the Givi River Plan include expansion of existing meanders, displacement of paths, increase of curvature and formation of small meanders and formation of channel pattern and dynamics, affected by discharge provision, sediment discharge due to dam construction, lithological resistance of the riverbed and human interference.

In order to reduce disaster risk, effective tools and relevant land cover (LC) data are needed. This work aimed to generate a high-resolution LC map of flood-prone rural villages in southwest Niger using multispectral drone imagery. The LC was focused on highly thematically detailed classes. Two photogrammetric flights of fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) using RGB and NIR optical sensors were realized. The LC input dataset was generated using structure from motion (SfM) standard workflow, resulting in two orthomosaics and a digital surface model (DSM). The LC system is composed of nine classes, which are relevant for estimating flood-induced potential damages, such as houses and production areas. The LC was generated through object-oriented supervised classification using a random forest (RF) classifier. Textural and elevation features were computed to overcome the mapping difficulties due to the high spectral homogeneity of cover types. The training-test dataset was manually defined. The segmentation resulted in an F1_score of 0.70 and a median Jaccard index of 0.88. The RF model performed with an overall accuracy of 0.94, with the grasslands and the rocky clustered areas classes the least performant.

With temperatures and inland flooding in many locations worldwide expected to rise as a result of global climate change, understanding of population structure can help to inform management of P. capsici in the field and prevent devastating epidemics. Thus, we investigated the effect of host crop, geographical origin, fungicide sensitivity, and mating type on shaping the population structure of P. capsici in the eastern United States. Our fungicide in vitro assays identified the emergence of insensitive isolates for fluopicolide and mefenoxam. A set of 12 microsatellite markers proved informative to assign 157 P. capsici isolates to five distinct genetic clusters. Implementation of Bayesian structure, population differentiation, genetic diversity statistics, and index of association analysis, allowed us to identify population structure by host with some correspondence with genetic clusters for cucumber and squash isolates. We found weak population structure by state for geographically close isolates. In this study, we discovered that North Carolina populations stratify by fluopicolide sensitivity with insensitive isolates experiencing nonrandom mating. Our findings highlight the need for careful monitoring of local field populations, improved selection of relevant isolates for breeding efforts, and hypervigilant surveillance of resistance to different fungicides.

CRANTZ; WHEAT; TOLERANCE; OXYGEN; CROP; STRESS; YIELD; MECHANISMS	Waterlogging is a serious threat to agriculture that is expected to become more common due to climate change. It is well established that many plants are susceptible to waterlogging, including crops such as rapeseed. To investigate the responses and tolerance to waterlogging of the re-emerging oilseed crop camelina (Camelina sativa), camelina lines of different geographical origins were subjected to waterlogging. Camelina was very sensitive to waterlogging at vegetative growth stages, with a relatively short treatment of 4 days proving lethal for the plants. A treatment duration of 2 days resulted in growth inhibition and lower yields and was used to study the response of 8 different camelina lines to waterlogging at two different vegetative growth stages before bolting. Generally, younger plants (7-9 leaves) were more sensitive than older plants (15-16 leaves). In addition to morphological and agronomic traits, plants were phenotyped for physiological parameters such as chlorophyll content index and total antioxidant capacity of the leaves, which showed significant age-dependent changes due to waterlogging. These results underpin that waterlogging during the vegetative phase is a serious threat to camelina, which needs to be addressed by identifying and establishing tolerance to excess water to harness camelina's potential as a climate-smart crop.

Both avalanches formed the disaster chains and damaged many bridges and roads. Both avalanches on high mountain slope at an elevation of 6000 m asl above sea level triggered long-runout disaster chains, including debris flow, river blocking and flood. In this study, the disaster characteristics and dynamic process were analyzed by multitemporal satellite imagery. The results show that both of the initial sliding bodies were composed of rock and ice. Due to the large elevation difference, the initial sliding bodies rapidly descended into valley floor and immediately transformed into a debris flow after impact and fragmentation. And then, this study divided the disaster chain into four zones by satellite images and field observation, including source zone, dynamic erosion zone, deposition and damming zone, and flash flood zone. This study also carried out the numerical simulation of the disaster by RAMMS. The numerical results reproduced the dynamical process of the debris flow. Furthermore, the potential causes of disaster, evolution process, and the geohazard tendency are discussed.

Among the various types of public infrastructure, sewerage systems are one of the most cost-intensive facilities to manage. Sewerage systems are considered highly difficult to manage due to the undetermined level of service needed, different standards of user satisfaction, and the large gap of service understanding between experts and users. To address these issues, this study aims to define the appropriate target level of service improvement by combining consumers' expected level of service and complaint data. In this study, the case of the inland flood management project in South Korea is investigated because of the global trend of increasing flood damage. The complaint data represent the frequency of flood damage in the area. Using the contingent valuation method, we found that people want to use 25% of their current monthly sewage bill on the management project. In addition, the results of this study demonstrate that people prefer to deal with the problems caused by old service infrastructure when it can be handled at a lower cost during early stages.

Generating accurate predictions on where hydrometeorological disasters have greater chances to occur, may facilitate preparedness and adaption to such disasters, thus helping to reduce their high human and economic costs. We estimate the probabilities of hydrometeorological disasters at country levels using Bayesian sampling techniques. We decompose the probability of country disaster into the effects of country-specific factors, such as climatological and socio-demographic factors, and factors associated with world climate, which we denote global probability of disaster (GPOD). Finally, we subject these GPOD time paths to a cointegration analysis with CO2 concentration and provide projections to the year 2040 of the GPOD conditional on nine Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios. We detect a stable long-term relation between CO2 accumulation and the GPOD that allows us to determine projections of the latter process conditional on the former. We conclude that readily available statistical data on global atmospheric concentrations of CO2 can be used as a conceptually meaningful, statistically valid and policy useful predictor of the probability of occurrence of hydrometeorological disasters.

Accurate, finely detailed cartographic representations of hydrologic streamlines are critically important in various scientific domains, such as assessing the quantity and quality of present and future water resources, modeling climate changes, evaluating agricultural suitability, mapping flood inundation, and monitoring environmental changes. Conventional approaches to detecting such streamlines cannot adequately incorporate information from the complex three-dimensional (3D) environment of streams and land surface features. Such information is vital to accurately delineate streamlines. In recent years, high accuracy lidar data has become increasingly available for deriving both 3D information and terrestrial surface reflectance. This study develops an attention U-net model to take advantage of high-accuracy lidar data for finely detailed streamline detection and evaluates model results against a baseline of multiple traditional machine learning methods. The evaluation shows that the attention Unet model outperforms the best baseline machine learning method by an average F1 score of 11.25% and achieves significantly better smoothness and connectivity between classified streamline channels. These findings suggest that our deep learning approach can harness high-accuracy lidar data for fine-scale hydrologic streamline detection, and in turn produce desirable benefits for many scientific domains.

Due to climate change and human activities, that wetland has degraded to a successional gradient from the original flooded wetland to dry shrub vegetation and a forest area with lower ground water level, which may result in changes in soil microbiologic structure and functions. The present study investigated the microbial diversity and community structure in relation to soil properties along that successional gradient. The soil physico-chemical properties changed significantly with degradation stage. The Shannon diversity index of both soil bacteria (5.90-6.42) and fungi (1.7-4.19) varied significantly with successional stage (both p < .05). The community structures of soil bacteria and fungi in the early successional stages (i.e., the wetland) were significantly determined by water content, total nitrogen, and available nitrogen concentrations in soils, while those in the later successional stages (i.e., forests) were significantly structured by soil organic carbon, soil pH, and available phosphorus concentrations. These results suggest that the soil microbial structure is mainly determined by soil properties rather than by plant community such as plant species composition along successional stages.

Resilient health systems can minimize health risks by improving EWE preparedness, response, and recovery. However, how health systems demonstrate resilience is less understood in the emerging resilience literature. The objective of this scoping review was to describe how peer-reviewed and grey literature has operationalized health system resilience to EWEs in Asia-Pacific. Included sources were available in English, published from 2000 to 2019, and focused on health system activity in Asia-Pacific for EWE risk management. The World Health Organization's climate-resilient health system framework and building block model guided analysis of 49 sources. Health system activity was categorized by system building blocks. Assets and/or gaps to resilience were identified based on whether building blocks facilitated or impeded EWE risk management. Sources mostly focused on the Philippines (29%), India (16%) and Thailand (14%), with lower income economies and Pacific Island countries underrepresented. Floods (47%), typhoons (27%), and cyclones (16%) were frequently discussed while no sources mentioned droughts. Financing was the least mentioned building block (27%) and often described as a gap to resilience (24%). Overall, this review highlights opportunities for future research to develop EWE resilient health systems in Asia-Pacific and beyond.

Although there are several studies on Danube Delta cyanobacteria, little is known about their spatial-temporal patterns and the potential predictive role they can offer. We therefore analyzed the distribution of cyanobacteria in 19 lakes belonging to three lake complexes and tested whether their seasonal dynamics are in line with the predictions of the PEG model. Furthermore, we investigated to which extent cyanobacteria diversity and abundance were related to lake hydrogeomorphological characteristics such as surface, water level, connectivity, water retention, flood risk, and transparency. Although lakes had different seasonal cyanobacterial assemblages, the biovolume and genus richness had a geographical pattern, decreasing from south-east (lakes forming the fluvial delta) towards north-west (lakes forming the maritime delta). Cyanobacteria biovolume reflected largely the PEG model peaking in summer (the fluvial delta) and autumn (the maritime delta). Genus richness followed the same pattern. Cyanobacteria distribution was predicted by various abiotic (e.g., risk of flooding, connectivity) and biotic factors (e.g., submersed macrophytes, phytoplankton diversity, peat deposits). Our study contributes to the understanding of cyanobacteria diversity and distribution in shallow interconnected lakes by revealing the complexity of predictors for geographical and seasonal patterns.

Institutional and private sector actors often focus on issues relating to the technological innovation journey, such as 'pathways' to implementation or 'barriers' to market uptake, rather than whether adaptive technologies are the most appropriate resilience solution. These discourses frame urban resilience from the perspective of an innovation journey where technologies are perceived to succeed if there is high uptake. However, given the multi-perspective and multi-scale nature of urban resilience, the idea of 'success' inevitably has complex spatial, temporal and scalar dimensions. The paper uses the case of property level flood resilience (PFR) technologies in the United Kingdom to introduce the notion of 'contingent resilience' as a means to understand the trade-offs that are part of assessing and evaluating climate resilient technologies. We reveal that there are fundamental contradictions in what is deemed as a 'success' depending on who is framing the problem, when the judgement is made, or where the scale of analysis lies. Above all, the paper highlights the importance of illuminating the struggles that do not just define success, but that spatially and temporally redistribute climate resilience in a hidden manner.

Plants face oxygen deprivation under water and start low oxygen dependent metabolic activity for proper utilization of carbohydrates with the activity of fermentative enzymes. In this study, leaf tissue of nine rice genotypes includingaus-type submergence tolerant variety FR13A and high yielding submergence sensitive line IR42 were used to establish a relationship between carbohydrate level and anaerobic enzyme activities. Three test sets for each accession were submerged for 7, 14 and 21 days for quantitative estimation of soluble and insoluble sugar content along with differential expression of three enzymes [Pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc1), Alcohol dehydrogenase (adh1) and sucrose synthase (susy1)] involved in carbohydrate metabolism in plants. From the findings it was observed that under submergence, FR13A showed higher insoluble sugar and lower soluble sugar along with higher expression ofpdc1andadh1.Among the elongating categories var. Kumrogarh showed the highest level of soluble and insoluble sugars with lower level ofpdc1,and higher level ofadh1andsusy1. This promotes var. Kumrogarh to lower down the accumulation of cellular toxic acetaldehyde via ethanol production and increased amount of sucrose. Keeping all in view, var. Kumrogarh can be selected as submergence tolerant deep water line for lowland rice fields.

However, records showing millennial-scale trophic status variability in these water bodies are rare. Two radiocarbon-dated sedimentary profiles from former (now destroyed by brown coal mining) Lake Komoany (Central Europe, Czech Republic) served for a multi-proxy study of biological remains (diatoms, chironomids, pollen) supplemented by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and loss-on-ignition (LOI). The age-depth model and palynostratigraphy confirm a continuous Late-Glacial to Early-Holocene record. The results suggest consistent in-lake conditions with high nutrient availability since the lake origin in the Late-Glacial period. A distinct shift at the Late-Glacial/Holocene boundary evidenced by an enhancement in diatom valve concentration and a lithological interface was foregone by a qualitative change in diatom and chironomid assemblages along with rise in LOI. It suggests that a major transformation occurred before the onset of the Holocene. As this qualitative change was characterized by a decrease in relative abundance of nutrient-demanding species, we propose an indirect climatic control by means of nutrient availability as the main driver of the aquatic species composition.

Rising Sea Levels: Helping Decision-Makers Confront the Inevitable	COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coastal risk management; extreme water levels; managing uncertainty; regiona; local sea-level rise scenarios; risk-based approach	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISE; SCIENCE; COPRODUCTION; ANTARCTICA; POLICY	Sea-level rise (SLR) is not just a future trend; it is occurring now in most coastal regions across the globe. It thus impacts not only long-range planning in coastal environments, but also emergency preparedness. Its inevitability and irreversibility on long time scales, in addition to its spatial non-uniformity, uncertain magnitude and timing, and capacity to drive non-stationarity in coastal flooding on planning and engineering timescales, create unique challenges for coastal risk-management decision processes. This review assesses past United States federal efforts to synthesize evolving SLR science in support of coastal risk management. In particular, it outlines the: (1) evolution in global SLR scenarios to those using a risk-based perspective that also considers low-probability but high-consequence outcomes, (2) regionalization of the global scenarios, and (3) use of probabilistic approaches. It also describes efforts to further contextualize regional scenarios by combining local mean sea-level changes with extreme water level projections. Finally, it offers perspectives on key issues relevant to the future uptake, interpretation, and application of sea-level change scenarios in decision-making. These perspectives have utility for efforts to craft standards and guidance for preparedness and resilience measures to reduce the risk of coastal flooding and other impacts related to SLR.

However, the well-documented "levee effect" of increased floodplain use following levee construction or enhancement often results in increased problems, especially when levees fail or are compromised by big flood events. Herein, we argue that there are also unintended socio-economic and ecological consequences of traditional engineering solutions that need to be better considered, communicated and weighed against alternative solutions. Socio-economic consequences include reduced aesthetic and recreational values as well as increased downstream flooding risk and reduced ecosystem services. Ecological consequences include hydraulic decoupling, loss of biodiversity and increased risk of contamination during flooding. In addition, beyond river losses of connectivity and natural riparian vegetation created by levees, changes in groundwater levels and increased greenhouse gas emissions are likely. Because flood protection requires huge financial investments and results in major and persistent changes to the landscape, more balanced decisions that involve all stake-holders and policymakers should be made in the future. This requires a transdisciplinary approach that considers alternative solutions such as green infrastructure and places emphasis on integrated flood management rather than on reliance on technical protection measures.

While the magnitude of projected changes in extremes varies considerably among future emission scenarios, a large part of this uncertainty is driven by the choice of scenario, rather than by the climate response to a particular emission scenario. A growing body of research has identified robust linear relationships between climate changes and cumulative carbon emissions; for global average temperature change, this relationship is known as the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE). Extensions of the TCRE framework to other variables, such as regional and seasonal temperature and precipitation changes, have also shown to be effective, raising the possibility that changes in weather extremes could be linked to cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Here, we estimate changes in historical and projected trends in one-day (Rx1day) and five-day maximum precipitation (Rx5day) events as a function of cumulative carbon emissions across a range of future emission scenarios and global climate models. Our results show that median Rx1day and Rx5day generally increases linearly with increasing cumulative emissions, consistent with studies that have previously employed the TCRE framework to estimate changes in precipitation extremes, as well as other climate indicators. Overall, we show that a linear response to cumulative CO2 emissions is a good approximation for both historical and future trends in precipitation extremes. [Traduit par la redaction] La frequence et l'intensite des phenomenes meteorologiques extremes devraient augmenter en raison de la hausse des temperatures mondiales, ce qui accroit l'exposition de la societe a ces phenomenes. Si l'ampleur des changements projetes en matiere d'extremes varie considerablement selon les scenarios d'emissions futures, une grande partie de cette incertitude est attribuable au choix du scenario, plutot qu'a la reaction du climat a un scenario d'emissions particulier. Un nombre croissant de recherches a permis de determiner des relations lineaires solides entre les changements climatiques et les emissions cumulees de carbone; pour le changement de la temperature moyenne mondiale, cette relation est connue sous le nom de reponse climatique transitoire aux emissions cumulees de carbone (RCTE). L'extension du cadre RCTE a d'autres variables, telles que les changements regionaux et saisonniers de temperature et de precipitations, s'est egalement averee efficace, ce qui souleve la possibilite que les changements dans les extremes meteorologiques puissent etre lies aux emissions cumulees de dioxyde de carbone (CO2). Nous estimons ici les changements dans les tendances historiques et projetees des precipitations maximales sur un jour (Rx1jour) et sur cinq jours (Rx5jour) en fonction des emissions de carbone cumulees a travers une gamme de scenarios d'emissions futures et de modeles climatiques globaux. Nos resultats montrent que les Rx1jour et Rx5jour medians augmentent generalement de facon lineaire avec la hausse des emissions cumulees, ce qui est coherent avec les etudes qui ont precedemment utilise le cadre RCTE pour estimer les changements dans les precipitations extremes, ainsi que d'autres indicateurs climatiques. Dans l'ensemble, nous montrons qu'une reponse lineaire aux emissions cumulees de CO2 est une bonne approximation des tendances historiques et futures des precipitations extremes.

This leads to short-term orientation, predictable planning outcomes, and decisions being taken by a small group of humans. Alternatively, a symbiotic human-nature relationship could be a prelude to a balanced future in which sustaining all living organisms prevails. In this article, a novel approach to designing such an urban landscape is presented: the Eco-cathedric City. In this proposition, the design process thrives on high complexity, deep uncertainty, contingent nature-human relations, slow urbanism, and imaginability. It is concluded that three mechanisms should be core to this approach: (eco-)cathedral thinking, considering the impact of current decisions on seven future generations; (eco-)acupuncturist design, which plans for the process by igniting a single small intervention; and (eco-)cracy, in which a variety of actors, human and non-human organisms, co-decide. In a practical sense, the Eco-cathedric City finds its foundation in understanding local ecosystems and using this knowledge to design a self-organizing ecosystem in which regenerative resource management is prioritized, after which social constructs are formed to support this design and to fit human uses within the boundaries of this framework to conclude with an evolving belief system in which reciprocity and symbiocity are the core values.

The regional mean Anthropogenic heat release flux in Southwest China grew quickly from 0.06 Wm(-2) in 1992 to a peak of 0.37 Wm(-2) in 2019. This study examines the climatic effects and feedbacks of Anthropogenic heat release due to energy consumption in Southwest China during the boreal summer using simulations from the Community Earth System Model. The modeling results show that Anthropogenic heat release impacts on the lower-troposphere stability and affects large-scale atmospheric circulation in Southwest China, which transports more water vapor and consequently increases the humidity and low cloud cover in Southwest China. This effect impacts the energy balance at the surface by reducing the amount of incoming shortwave radiation that reaches the ground. Anthropogenic heat release decreases the average 2-m air temperature in Southwest China by 0.10 +/- 0.01 K (1 sigma uncertainty) and also decreases the minimum and maximum air temperatures in Southwest China as well. Anthropogenic heat release contributes to cooler and wetter summers in Southwest China.

The stormwater management philosophy of low-impact development (LID) has been applied in urban construction to alleviate these problems. The selection and placement of LID designs are the most important tasks. In this study, LID experiments were performed to calibrate the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Then, a multi-objective optimization model, which adopted the minimum surface runoff coefficient, surcharge time, and investment cost as objectives, was established by coupling the SWMM and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Hydrological simulations were performed with the SWMM, and optimal calculations were conducted with NSGA-II. Real-coded optimal variables containing detailed size and location information of multiple LID measures were generated, and a decision space for LID design selection was obtained. The optimization designs reduced the surface runoff coefficient from 0.7 to approximately 0.5, the conduit surcharge duration was reduced from 1.62 h to 0.04-0.47 h, and the total investment cost only ranged from 395,000-872,000 yen . Thus, the optimization model could achieve synchronous optimization of all objectives. This study could provide valuable information for LID design with the aim of urban flooding and waterlogging control.

Here, we report on a follow-on study whereby stretches of the newly vegetated bank were stripped back to clean rip-rap to assess whether presence/ absence of rip-rap was the major factor affecting non-gobiid, tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris and round goby abundance. Our results confirmed rip-rap as a major factor increasing round goby abundance, and hence invasion success, on European rivers, while vegetated banks saw an increase in the abundance and diversity of non-gobiid species. While tubenose gobies showed no preference for habitat type, their numbers were significantly reduced in rip-rap colonised by larger and more aggressive round gobies. We discuss our results in light of recent artificial bank restoration measures undertaken on the Danube and Rhine and the potential role of round goby as a flagship species for cost-effective, large scale river bank restoration projects with multiple ecosystem benefits.

In this study, the evolution of the runoff-sediment relationship was investigated through tests for tendencies and abrupt changes in the Xiliu Valley, a typical hyperconcentrated tributary of the Upper Yellow River on the Northern Loess Plateau, China. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to simulate runoff and sediment loads as smooth functions of significant physical covariates including reservoir indices. In comparison with the existing reservoir index (RI) and its additional version (ARI), a sediment-associated reservoir index (SARI) was developed to highlight the advantages of more information on reservoir capacities for both flood control and sediment deposition. The results showed significant downward trends in both annual runoff and sediment series. Alterations in runoff-sediment relationships appeared in approximately 1990, and were mostly dominated by the factors of short-duration storm floods and check dams. GAMs including the SARI exerted more negative effects on sediment yield than on runoff and outperformed the models embracing the RI or ARI. Accordingly, incorporation of the SARI could be advocated under changing environments that are mainly influenced by check dams.

The purpose of this work is to pose the key role of Integrated Water Resource Management for a city's sustainable development, aiming to improve social, economic, and environ-mental conditions. To reach this goal, the Greater Rio de Janeiro (GRJ), in Brazil, will be used as an exploratory case study to support the discussion about proposing a cause-consequence framework. The GRJ has 13.1 million inhabitants and suffers from uneven distribution of goods, services, and infrastructure throughout its territory. The method includes 1. Apply the City Blueprint Approach (CBA) to assess the current IWRM of the GRJ; 2. Compare the results with the sanitation main findings identified in the Strategic Integrated Urban Development Plan (PEDUI) of the GRJ; 3. Given the similarity of the CBA outcomes and the PEDUI sanitation diagnosis, the City Blueprint Framework is subsequently applied to assess the behavior of GRJ in 2040. By comparing the current and future GRJ's IWRM status, a cause-consequence framework is built, highlighting the potentials and opportunities of a sanitation improvement cycle that intends to balance social inequalities towards a better quality of life in developing cities.

Assessing Multi-Hazard Vulnerability and Dynamic Coastal Flood Risk in the Mississippi Delta: The Global Delta Risk Index as a Social-Ecological Systems Approach	WATER			English	Article						vulnerability; disaster; census tract; GDRI; environmental hazard; storm surge; drought; hurricane; future risk	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HURRICANE-KATRINA; SUSTAINABILITY; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES; ADAPTATION; INDICATORS; LOUISIANA; FRAMEWORK; DISASTER	The tight coupling of the social-ecological system (SES) of the Mississippi Delta calls for balanced natural hazard vulnerability and risk assessments. Most existing assessments have approached these components in isolation. To address this, we apply the Global Delta Risk Index (GDRI) in the Mississippi Delta at high-resolution census tract level. We assess SES spatial patterns of drought, hurricane-force wind, and coastal flood vulnerability and integrate hazard and exposure data for the assessment of coastal flood risk. Moreover, we compare current coastal flood risk to future risk in 2025 based on the modelled effects of flood depth, exposure, and changes in ecosystem area in the context of ongoing efforts under the 2017 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan. Results show that the Master Plan will lead to decreases in risk scores by 2025, but the tracts that are currently the most vulnerable benefit less from risk reduction efforts. Along with our index output, we discuss the need for further advancements in SES methodology and the potential for catastrophic hazard events beyond the model parameters, such as extreme rainfall events and very strong hurricanes. Assessing SES risk components can lead to more targeted policy recommendations, demonstrated by the need for Master Plan projects to consider their unequal spatial effects on vulnerability and risk reduction.

However, land subsidence caused by significant oil, gas and brine extraction, as well as sediment compaction, could exacerbate the flooding effects of sea-level rise and storm surge. In order to evaluate the coastal dam vulnerability, we combined unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with small baseline subsets (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results to generate an accurate coastal dam digital elevation model (DEM) over the next 10, 30 and 80 years. Sea-level simulation was derived from the relative sea-level rise scenarios published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and local long-term tide gauge records. Assuming that the current rate of dam vertical deformation and sea-level rise are linear, we then generated different inundation scenarios by the superposition of DEMs and sea-levels at different periods by way of a bathtub model. We found that the overtopping event would likely occur around Year 2050, and the northern part of the dam would lose its protective capability almost entirely by the end of this century. This article provides an alternative cost-effective method for the detection, extraction and monitoring of coastal artificial infrastructure.

J	Lashford, C; Charlesworth, S; Warwick, F; Blackett, M				Lashford, Craig; Charlesworth, Susanne; Warwick, Frank; Blackett, Matthew			Modelling the Role of SuDS Management Trains in Minimising Flood Risk, Using MicroDrainage	WATER			English	Article						detention basins; green roofs; MicroDrainage; porous pavement; runoff reduction; swales	SUSTAINABLE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS; URBAN DRAINAGE; WATER QUANTITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; FRAMEWORK; SWALES; DESIGN	This novel research models the impact that commonly used sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) have on runoff, and compare this to their land take. As land take is consistently cited as a key barrier to the wider implementation of SuDS, it is essential to understand the possible runoff reduction in relation to the area they take up. SuDS management trains consisting of different combinations of detention basins, green roofs, porous pavement and swales were designed in MicroDrainage. In this study, this is modelled against the 1% Annual Exceedance Potential storm (over 30, 60, 90, 120, 360 and 720 min, under different infiltration scenarios), to determine the possible runoff reduction of each device. Detention basins were consistently the most effective regarding maximum runoff reduction for the land they take (0.419 L/s/m(2)), with porous pavement the second most effective, achieving 0.145 L/s/m(2). As both green roofs (20.34%) and porous pavement (6.76%) account for land that would traditionally be impermeable, there is no net-loss of land compared to a traditional drainage approach. Consequently, although the modelled SuDS management train accounts for 34.86% of the total site, just 7.76% of the land is lost to SuDS, whilst managing flooding for all modelled rainfall and infiltration scenarios.

In Yunnan Province of south-eastern China major lakes and their catchments such as Dian Lake basin in the vicinity of the Provincial capital Kunming were also preferred for early settlements. Here we reconstructed hydrological conditions of the lake and parts of its catchment in combination with early human occupation during the last 6 cal. ka BP and focused on the Dian culture (Bronze Age) and succeeding Han Dynasty. We mainly used sediment composition in the lake and on land to infer transportation processes related to climate controlled hydrological variations and combined them with past human occupation in response to groundwater fluctuations and resulting settlements and land use. Our results show that Dian Lake experienced several low lake level stages between 4.5 and 1.0 cal. ka BP (negative hydrological balance) due to deteriorated monsoon climate impact, but also indicate high-frequency flood-drought events. Lowered groundwater levels enabled human cultures to settle at low-terrain sites during the late Neolithic, Bronze Age (Dian culture), and early Chinese empires. Different from other regions in eastern Asia the local cultures adapted to climate deterioration and made use of extended arable land and intensified harvest of aquatic gastropods.

In addition to socio-economic impacts, many previous studies have shown that important coastal ecosystems like mangroves are shaped by severe storms. However, little is known about how the cumulative effects of storms over entire hurricane seasons affect mangroves across large regions. We used satellite imagery from the entire Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico region to show that 2017 resulted in disproportionate mangrove damage compared to baseline responses over the previous 8 years. Specifically, we observed 30 times more mangrove damage, via a reduction in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), during 2017 compared to any of the eight previous hurricane seasons, and most (72%) of this damage persisted throughout the 7 month post-hurricane season period as indicated by no NDVI recovery. Furthermore, wind speed, rainfall, and canopy height data showed that mangrove damage primarily resulted from high maximum wind speeds, but flooding (cumulative rainfall), previous storm history, and mangrove structure (canopy height) were also important predictors of damage. While mangroves are known to be resilient to hurricane impacts, our results suggest that increasingly frequent mega-hurricane seasons in the Caribbean region will dramatically alter mangrove disturbance dynamics.

The paper investigated the changing patterns of groundwater depth, and further explored the linear and nonlinear relationships between groundwater depth and four potential influencing factors using grey relational analysis and wavelet coherence during 2000-2017. The multiple linear regression and Random Forest (RF) models were proposed to predict the groundwater depth Taking Xingtai city on the North China Plain as an example, the results indicate that: (1) The groundwater depth in a shallow aquifer has deepened significantly after 2006, and decreased from northwest to southeast. A clear upward trend was detected in the southeast region of the study area. (2) The change of groundwater depth is related to the consumption during agricultural irrigation period and the supply of heavy rainfall during flood season, and the deepest groundwater depth was detected in June. (3) The cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that main influencing factors of groundwater depth are precipitation and temperature. (4) The comparison between actual value and prediction value indicated that the RF model has better accuracy in predicting the groundwater depth than the multiple linear regression model.	[Cao, R.

However, current flood classification methods are either not transferable across locations or do not provide event-based information. We therefore developed a location-independent, event-based flood classification methodology that is applicable in different climates and returns a classification of all flood events, including extreme ones. We use precipitation time series and very simply modelled soil moisture and snowmelt as inputs for a decision tree. A total of 113,635 events in 4155 catchments worldwide were classified into one of five hydro-climatological flood generating processes: short rain, long rain, excess rainfall, snowmelt and a combination of rain and snow. The new classification was tested for its robustness and evaluated with available information; these two tests are often lacking in current flood classification approaches. According to the evaluation, the classification is mostly successful and indicates excess rainfall as the most common dominant process. However, the dominant process is not very informative in most catchments, as there is a high at-site variability in flood generating processes. This is particularly relevant for the estimation of extreme floods which diverge from their usual flood generation pattern, especially in the United Kingdom, Northern France, Southeastern United States, and India.

The sequence of palaeoflood events was established through field observation and grain size analysis with chronological supports from Optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates and from archaeologically-constrained age frameworks. The paleoflood peak water level and peak discharge were reconstructed using the "pinch-out elevation method" and the "thickness-sediment content relationship." The results show that three large-scale paleoflood events occurred during a period of 3200-3000 yr BP in the Baoji-Tianshui Gorge, upper Weihe River. The peak water levels varied between 660.48 and 661.40 m and the peak discharge varied between 23,200 and 25,200 m(3)/s among the three large-scale paleoflood events. The same methodology was used to calculate the modern flood peak discharges that yielded a deviation of only 3.6% between the reconstructed and measured peak discharges, further verifying the acceptance of this method for the reconstruction of paleoflood peak discharges. This studyexpanded the database of the palaeoflood hydrology research in the Weihe River and the expanded database may be useful in providing important information for projects such as water conservancy, hydropower, engineering construction, flood control, and disaster mitigation.

Coastal exposure assessment on Bonassola bay	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal exposure; Runup; XBeach; Gravel beach; Storms	SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; REGIONAL-SCALE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RUN-UP; BEACHES; HAZARDS; SYSTEM; IMPACT; EROSION	This paper illustrates a novel coastal exposure assessment approach. The approach is based on the employment of the model chain WavewatchIII + XBeach, which is first used to draw a map showing the extent of the populated areas that are likely to be interested by flooding, and subsequently to establish the exposure of the area to specific events. The model chain is calibrated by comparing the simulated runup values of a storm with those obtained by processing on-field images recorded by a camera system. The approach herein presented allows to take into account the local coastal geomorphology features and hydrodynamics of the area so as to obtain locally accurate results. The information collected is usable by local beach managers in coastal management planning. The method is applied on Bonassola beach, which is a pocket beach located on the NW Mediterranean along the Eastern coast of Liguria, Italy. Weather and offshore waves data collected during the last 16 years were used. The application of this method has allowed to draw a map of the areas that are subject to flooding during storms. and has correctly stated that three of the seven biggest storms in the last 16 years would eventually result into flooding of populated area. The study has also shown that the exposure of the study area to the storms is sensitive to the period and the direction of the waves.

Macroplastic deposition and flushing in the Meuse river following the July 2021 European floods	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						plastic pollution; freshwater; riverbank; hydrology; extreme event; climate change; disaster		Rivers play an important role in the macroplastics transport and retention dynamics in the environment. Therefore, gaining an understanding of these processes is vital in order to help determine the fate of macroplastic in the environment. During flood events the transport of floating macroplastic is known to increase. We compared plastic accumulation and flushing on sixteen riverbanks along the Dutch Meuse river during the period that includes the July 2021 extreme flood to plastic accumulation on the same riverbanks as during normal discharge conditions between 2018 and 2021. Here we show that following the flood small macroplastic categories ( <2.5 cm) were flushed from the riverbanks, while larger soft plastic fragments (2.5-50 cm) and wet tissues were deposited. We found that for all plastic categories and for all riverbanks averaged, the plastic accumulation rate during the July 2021 flood was higher than that which would be expected for that time of year. However, the average accumulation rate for all locations during the period that included the flood was lower than the average accumulation rate over the Dutch winter (Oct/Nov-Feb/Mar). Our results show that litter category composition following the July 2021 flood differed from normal conditions. This indicates that plastic deposition and remobilization processes on riverbanks differ between extreme flood and annually average conditions. These observations contribute to a better understanding of the fate of macroplastic in the environment in terms of the drivers of both its transport and deposition.	[Hauk, Rahel; van Emmerik, Tim H.

In addition to that, this study also recommends two different methodologies in order to mitigate flood impacts, namely by dimensioning a detention basin and adjusting the riverbed roughness coefficient. Regarding the study on the flood propensity, it was necessary to resort to geomorphological data, which were obtained when characterizing the watershed; these data were crucial to determining the expected peak flow rate, according to the Gumbel distribution methodology and considering a 100-year return period, and to perform necessary tasks in the SIG ArcGIS 10.5 software. Lastly, the drainage capacity of this drainage basin's river mouth was also analyzed in order to conclude whether it would have the capacity to drain the total volume of rainwater if an extreme flood event were to happen. Indeed, the main results show that this watershed's river mouth does not have the necessary drainage capacity to cope with an extreme event for the return period that was considered. As a consequence, the two aforementioned mitigation measures were developed considering the Tabua (Ribeira Brava) drainage basin's specific features. The size of the detention basin was estimated through the Dutch method and the simplified triangular hydrograph method, while the adjustment of the roughness coefficient was considered a valid solution to enhance the drainage capacity of this river mouth.

However, understanding the lake sedimentation state to link catchment pressures and biogenic regime shifts remains challenging. To address this, research was conducted on the lake sedimentation state, including the dynamics, catchment drivers, effects on biogenic regimes, and responses to typical historical events using nine sediment cores from Dongting Lake, China, a typical global priority ecoregion. Three transitions of lake sedimentation state were distinguished over the century (1937, 1968, and 1993), whereby hydrologic dynamics and land-use changes in the watershed were the direct drivers with relative contributions of 16.30% and 14.56%, respectively. Lake sedimentation state and organic matter inputs not only preceded sediment biogenic elements at the shift time but also exhibited nonlinear trigger effects on biogenic element contents (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.01), which promoted an increase in sediment biogenic element burial rates. Rate of change analysis indicated that intensive human activities altered the relationship between the sedimentation state and biogenic regime shift, thus revealing the response to anthropogenic events in the catchment. Pathways quantified by the partial least squares path model established the link between watershed attributes and lake biogenic properties via the lake sedimentation state. Our findings revealed a cascading linkage among catchment eco-surroundings, lake sedimentation states, and biogenic regime shifts. The research further provided insights into driver-response relationships in lake-catchment systems.

Here we conduct a brief assessment of changes in tidal variability around Australia. We then apply a simple attribution framework to quantify the separate and joint effects of tidal range changes and increasing relative mean sea level on nuisance flood frequency at the location with the largest relative changes in tidal range, Lakes Entrance, Victoria. To understand how these changes in variability affect flood hazards, we consider a nuisance flood threshold based on recent coastal flood impact surveys. Results show that increases in the heights of high tides over recent years have exerted a large influence on coastal flood frequencies. These recent changes are potentially linked to changes in channel dredging regimes. We show that 93% of nuisance flood days since 2009 would not have occurred without these tidal range changes or the coincident increases in the mean sea level. We demonstrate the importance of considering tidal processes in estuarine coastal flood hazard assessments for future planning, even if these processes do not represent a substantial flood threat today. We discuss the implications of this study for future work on estuarine flood hazards and the benefits of considering impact-based thresholds in the assessment of such hazards.	[Hague, Ben S.

The TVGM-USWM model, a new urban hydrological model considering the nonlinear rainfall-runoff relationship and the flow routing in an urban drainage system, was developed in this study. We employed this model in the Huangtaiqiao drainage basin of Jinan City, China, and examined the impact of land cover changes due to urbanization on rainfall-runoff processes. Two urbanization scenarios were set up in the TVGM-USWM model during the design rainfall events with different return periods. Results showed that (1) the TVGM-USWM model demonstrated good applicability in the study area, and the R-NS values of the flood events are all greater than 0.75 in both calibration and validation periods; (2) the proportion of impervious areas increased from 44.65% in 1990 to 71.00% in 2020, and urbanization played a leading role in the process of land cover change and manifested itself as a circular extensional expansion; and (3) urbanization showed a significant amplifying effect on the design flood processes, particularly for relatively big floods with small frequency, and the impact of urbanization on the time-to-peak of the design flood gradually decreased as the frequency of the design rainfall decreased. The results of this study can provide technical support for flood mitigation and the construction of a sponge city in Jinan City.

Nested hydrological modeling for flood prediction using CMIP6 inputs around Lake Tana, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES			English	Article						Climate Projection; GCMs-CMIP6; WFlow_sbm model; Flood prediction; Lake Tana Basin; Ethiopia	BLUE NILE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; ENSEMBLE; RAINFALL; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; CATCHMENT; VERSION; RUNOFF	Study region: Tana basin is the origin of the Blue Nile Basin located in Ethiopia. The Lake Tana's mean annual precipitation is approximately 1400 mm/yr and its outflow drains an area of about 15,096 km2. There is limited effort to apply nested hydrological models for flood prediction due to being poorly gauged for validation.Study focus: The objective of this study is to show how climate simulations can be used to generate reliable local predictions of flood and runoff for the Blue Nile in the Ethiopian highlands.In this study, outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were used to initialize a nested hydrological model to reveal long-term trends of runoff in flood-prone areas of the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. Available satellite and reanalysis datasets were used for selection of CMIP6 products and the five models with best validation were used to force a nested hydrological model: Known as Wflow_sbm. A model-independent multi-algorithm optimization estimation tool was implemented for calibration of Wflow with insitu observations.New hydrological insights for the region: In terms of simulating runoff and flood events, application of Wflow_sbm to the Lake Tana basin gave promising results. This study serves as a major step towards the development and implementation of global model-driven nested hydrological as-sessments of flood risk in future projections for Lake Tana basin.

Flood Mitigation Performance of Permeable Pavements in an Urbanised Catchment in Melbourne, Australia (Elizabeth Street Catchment): Case Study	WATER			English	Article						permeable pavements; flood mitigation; rainfall intensity; MUSIC; catchment scale	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; DESIGN	Permeable pavement (PP) systems have been shown to provide onsite stormwater management as well as contaminant removal benefits. Therefore, significant research has taken place in recent years to analyse the performance of these structures in terms of the volume of stormwater harvested and the water quality improvements at small scales. However, there is limited understanding of their performance for reducing stormwater runoff volume to prevent natural disasters, such as catchment-scale flooding. With larger flooding events projected to occur more frequently as a result of urbanisation and climate change, PP systems have the potential to mitigate loss by reducing peak flows and runoff volumes. Therefore, this research investigates the performance of PP at the catchment scale under a range of design rainfall and land-use scenarios. Results indicate that the integration of permeable pavements in urban settings is effective in mitigating surface flooding in an urbanised catchment in Melbourne, Australia by reducing the peak flows by 7-16%. However, in practice, flood reduction ability can markedly decrease with time due to the clogging of pavements. Our results provide preliminary data to show that the integration of permeable pavements into the existing urban landscape can reduce the risk of flooding by providing areas for water to infiltrate if maintained properly. These results are envisioned to assist councils and stormwater managers with the option evaluation of the water-sensitive urban design systems and selecting the appropriate stormwater management measures.

At a time of global climate change, rapid pore-water pressure changes in soil masses are frequently induced by extreme rainfall, storm surges, waves, flash floods and so on. Under such complex cyclic hydraulic conditions, the soil erodibility, hydraulic conductivity and subsequent stress-strain behaviour may differ from those under the monotonic seepage condition, and are still poorly understood. In this study, preliminary laboratory tests have been conducted to investigate the development of internal erosion and changes in hydraulic conductivity under one-way cyclic seepage, and the post-erosion stress-strain behaviour. Representative internally stable and unstable soils were tested. The effects of mean hydraulic gradient and cyclic gradient amplitude were investigated in detail. Results show that the erosion development is significantly influenced by both the initial grain size distribution and the pattern of imposed cyclic hydraulic gradient. The cyclic seepage promotes the loss of fine particles and leads to larger hydraulic conductivity. For the internally unstable soil, the eroded soil mass and hydraulic conductivity increased significantly with increasing cyclic gradient amplitude. Nevertheless, the internally stable soil experienced a small amount of particle loss, even under large cyclic gradients. For both types of soil, a larger cyclic gradient amplitude corresponds to a stronger post-erosion contractive shearing behaviour and a smaller critical friction angle.

Most meta-analyses have insufficiently elaborated the effects of BC on soil N transformation so the prac-tical importance of BC could not be assessed. In this study, a 15N tracing study was conducted to investigate the effects of BC amendment on soil gross N transformations in acidic soils with different land-use types. The results show that the BC amendment accelerated the soil gross mineralization rate of labile organic N to NH4+ (MNlab) (3 %-128 %) which was associated with an increase in total nitrogen. BC mitigated NH3 volatilization (VNH3) (52 %-99 %) in upland and forest soils due to NH4+/NH3 adsorption, while it caused higher gaseous N losses (NH3 and N2O) in flooded paddy soils. An important function was the effect of BC addition on NH4+ oxidation (ONH4). While ONH4 increased (4 %-19 %) in upland soils, it was inhibited (34 %-71 %) in paddy soils and did not show a response in forest soils. Overall, the BC amendment reduced the potential risk of N loss (PRL), especially in forest soils (82 %-98 %). This study also shows that the BC effect on soil N cycling is land-use specific. The suitability of practices including BC hinges on the effects on gaseous N losses.

Vinod			Probable maximum tropical cyclone parameters for east and west coast of India	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						PMTC; EVA; Storm surge; Least square fit method; Lieblein technique; Order statistics approach	HURRICANE INTENSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BAY	Storm surge simulation models require certain parameters for evaluating the worst possible event that could occur at a site with respect to a certain return period. The most significant probable maximum tropical cyclone parameters are pressure deficiency at the centre (delta P) and maximum wind speed (V-max) during the cyclone. In this study, the probable maximum tropical cyclone parameters that would yield the maximum probable storm surge along the Indian coasts of Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are estimated. Datasets are created based on various existing data archives for each basin. The datasets are subjected to extreme value analysis for determining the delta P and V-max parameters. The data are fitted to various probability distributions (Gumbel, Frechet, Weibull and Log-normal) whose parameters (scale, shape, and location parameters) are estimated using graphical (least square fit) and numerical (order statistics approach) methods. A mean recurrence interval of 1000 and 10,000 years is considered for strategic structures. The best fit distribution and its parameters are obtained based on goodness of fit criteria. The resulting delta P and V-max are compared with theoretical maximum cyclone parameter values of each basin and revised till an optimal set of values are reached. The analysis shows that delta P and V-max values for Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are best represented by Weibull distribution. The estimated parameters are useful input to a storm surge model to determine the design basis flood level for the strategic coastal sites.	[Kumar, D. Satish; Kumar, A.

They also support emergency response and recovery following disasters and extreme weather events. Although food pantries are often placed in close proximity to communities with the highest rates of poverty and risk of food insecurity, access to these facilities can be disrupted during and after extreme events. Decreased access to food pantries following disasters can be particularly problematic as the need for these services is also likely to grow after such events. Despite the vast body of research on food retail access and food environments, relatively little research has utilized spatial analysis to understand food pantry access, particularly after extreme events. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we characterize changes in access to food pantries following flooding events in Harris County, Texas-a highly populated and flood prone region with high levels of food insecurity and poverty. Specifically, our study models disruptions in road networks due to flooding and assesses the impacts of these disruptions on proximity to food pantries. The results reveal that much of Harris County sees only small increases in travel distance to food pantries due to extreme flooding, but some areas may be unable to access food pantries at all. This research highlights the potential and some of the limits of private food assistance networks to support emergency response efforts.

In a future warmer climate, it remains largely unclear how such features change, relative to the current climate. Global Climate Models at coarse resolution cannot resolve convective-scale storms which is one of the major weather systems causing devastating floods in the US. Alternatively, coupled, high-resolution and continental-scale climate and flood simulations can advance our understanding. In this study, we couple a 4-km convection-permitting climate simulation model with a 1-km hydrologic model to simulate the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall and flooding over the contiguous US. In particular, changes in rainfall and flood frequency, spatial scale, and seasonality are explored in major climate divisions. We found: (a) an overall increase in flood frequency (+101.7%) and spatial extent (+44.9%), mainly attributed to more extreme rainfall and variability in the future; (b) weakening rainfall and flood seasonality, resulting in more random and unpredictable events throughout the year; (c) earlier flooding season onsets in the West and snow-dominated regions while delayed onsets in the East driven by drier antecedent soil moisture; (d) correlation between extreme rainfall and flood onsets is becoming stronger in the West yet weaker in the East in the future. Findings in this study can potentially serve as a basis for future flood exposure and risk assessments, as well as more scientific understanding of changing flood-generating mechanisms across the CONUS.

Hence, this paper develops a novel evaluation methodology to find the weak links and capacity gaps of urban flood resilience. Firstly, according to the three periods of flood, the urban flood resilience evaluation indicator system is divided into the predictive capacity subsystem before the flood, the absorptive and coping capacity subsystem and the recovery capacity subsystem during the flood, and the adaptive capacity subsystem after the flood. This indicator system also creatively introduces the density of hydrological and meteorological station networks into the predictive capacity subsystem, and divides the adaptive capacity more meticulously into learning capacity at the governmental and individual-society levels. Secondly, a novel three-reference-point (T-R-P) based group ELECTRE III method is proposed to rank the flood resilience of different cities. This method integrates subjective and objective information to obtain more reasonable expert weights, and then sets thresholds with T-R-P to obtain more comprehensive and objective evaluation results. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applied to six flood-prone cities in China, and its practicality and availability are verified through comparative analysis with other three evaluation methods and sensitivity analysis of the indicator weights. Finally, based on the results, targeted suggestions are made to enhance the flood resilience of the six cities.

Exploring linkages between households' intended adaptations to climate-induced floods	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						adaptation; behavior; flood; household; links; perception; risk	RISK; RESIDENTS; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR	As climate change increases the probability and severity of natural hazards, the need for coordinated adaptation at all levels of society intensifies. Governmental-level adaptation measures are essential, but insufficient in the face of growing risks, necessitating complementary action from households. Apprehending the drivers of household adaptation is critical if governments are to stimulate protective behavior effectively. While past work has focused on the behavioral drivers of household adaptation, little attention has been paid to understanding the relationships between adaptation measures themselves-both previously undergone and additionally (planned) intended adaptation(s). Using survey data (N = 4,688) from four countries-the United States, China, Indonesia, and the Netherlands-we utilize protection motivation theory to account for the behavioral drivers of household adaptation to the most devastating climate-driven hazard: flooding. We analyze how past and additionally intended adaptations involving structural modification to one's home affect household behavior. We find that both prior adaptations and additionally intended adaptation have a positive effect on intending a specific adaptation. Further, we note that once links between adaptations are accounted for, the effect that worry has on motivating specific actions, substantially lessens. This suggests that while threat appraisal is important in initially determining if households intend to adapt, it is households' adaptive capacity that determines how. Our analysis reveals that household structural modifications may be nonmarginal. This could indicate that past action and intention to pursue one action trigger intentions for other adaptations, a finding with implications for estimating the speed and scope of household adaptation diffusion.

In this study, we aim to examine the future variation of terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and associated flood potential in one of the most flood-prone regions, the Yangtze River basin in China. Using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, we perform bias correction for seven general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 under three Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios: SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585. The spatiotemporal characteristics of changes in future Flood Potential Index are projected and compared between the near (2031-2060) and far (2071-2100) future with reference to the historical period (1985-2014). The results show that GCMs-simulated TWSA generally agrees well with the GRACE results after downscaling and bias correction with the average correlation coefficient of 0.86, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.73 and the root mean square error of 21.68 mm. We found that the total variance of projected TWSA is mainly sourced from the internal variability and model uncertainties, while the uncertainties in scenarios contribute relatively less. Moreover, the flood potential is projected to decline during the near future under various scenarios and even lower during the far future under SSP585 scenario. Our findings provide implications for flood control and management under climate change over high flood risk regions worldwide.

For example, declining rainfall in the southeast of Australia has led to a prolonged period of drought, with serious impacts on agriculture, the environment, and water supply to urban and rural towns. Here, using the continental wide Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape model (AWRA-L), we evaluate historical trends from 1960 to 2017 in rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff to explain changing drought and flooding. Northern parts of Australia have experienced increasing annual rainfall totals, resulting in increased water availability in the tropics with increased soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff, particularly during the hot, wet monsoon season. In contrast, the southwest and southeast coast of Australia have experienced declines in rainfall, particularly in the colder months, corresponding with decreasing evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and runoff. Trends in flooding are aligned with runoff trends, and closely follow trends in rainfall, with changes in soil moisture of secondary influence. Streamflow droughts, measured by the standardised runoff index, are increasing across large parts of Australia, with these increases more widespread than changes in rainfall alone. Increases in rainfall in the tropics of northern Australia appear to be related to decreasing drought occurrence and extent, but this trend is not universal, suggesting changes in rainfall alone are not an indicator of changing drought conditions.

The aspect of determinants affecting the farmer's preference of measure in adaptation procedure investigated in limited studies of literature. This study focused this research gap in scenario of Pakistan and investigated rural households' decision-making adaptation strategies process regarding landslides and flash floods hazards. The research work used household survey data of 398 purposively selected farmers of district Shangla from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. This study used manifold-portfolio structure, assumes as farmers have several preferences of adaptation strategies all together explained adaptation options are symbiotic. Multivariate probit models were employed in this paper for the empirical estimation of the study. Variegation of crops, crop-type diversifications, cropping pattern changing, crop protection and implementation management are primary adaptation measures used by respondent households. Inadequate information regarding landslides and flash floods, lack of technical equipments and machinery, insufficient money and limited support from local government were considered foremost limits in this study region. The study conclusion indicated as farmers' perceptions, farming descriptions, farmers' socioeconomic characteristics, and institutional conditions strongly affects farmers' adaptation assessment about landslides and flash floods. In future policies, it is more appropriate as major involvement of these causative factors to make possible appropriate adopting adaptation strategies for inhabitants of local areas.

While progress has been made to mitigate and adapt to natural hazards, much of the existing research lacks interdisciplinary approaches that equally consider both natural and social processes. More importantly, this lack of integration between approaches remains a major challenge in developing disaster risk management plans for communities. In this study, we made a first attempt to develop a conceptual model of a coupled human-landscape system in Swiss Alpine communities. The conceptual model contains a system dynamics (e.g. interaction, feedbacks) component to reproduce community level, socio-economic developments and shocks that include economic crises leading to unemployment, depopulation and diminished community revenue. Additionally, the conceptual model contains climate, hydrology, and geomorphic components that are sources of natural hazards such as floods and debris flows. Feedbacks between the socio-economic and biophysical systems permit adaptation to flood and debris flow risks by implementing spatially explicit mitigation options including flood defenses and land cover changes. Here we justify the components, scales, and feedbacks present in the conceptual model and provide guidance on how to operationalize the conceptual model to assess risk and community resilience as well as determine which shocks overcome the buffering capacity of Swiss Alpine communities.

The determinants of subnational public spending allocation for adaptive disaster risk reduction in Bangladesh	WORLD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Subnational public spending; Natural disasters; Risk reduction; Adaptation; Asia; Bangladesh	SOCIAL SAFETY NETS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION FINANCE; NATURAL DISASTERS; SATKHIRA DISTRICT; AID ALLOCATION; FOOD AID; ECONOMY; COUNTRIES; FLOOD	We examine the directly observable determinants of sub-national (central to local) public spending allocations for disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation in Bangladesh, a country with a very high exposure to weather risk. We use a comprehensive dataset for the 483 sub-districts (Upazilas) in Bangladesh, tracking disaster risk reduction and adaptation funding provided to each sub-district by the central government during fiscal years' 2010-11 to 2013-14, disaggregated by the various types of social protection programs. We assess to what extent the primary determinants of such funding flows such as current hazard risk, socio-economic vulnerability, and political economy considerations contribute to these funding allocation decisions. We find that flood hazard risk and socio-economic vulnerability are both positively correlated with the sub-district fiscal allocations. We find that political factors do not seem to significantly correlate with these allocations and neither does proximity to the centres of Dhaka and Chittagong. Public spending for adaptive disaster risk reduction, as investigated here, can be a useful complementary intervention tool to other DRR programs, such as insurance or broader social transfers, provided that it is allocated rationally. Broadly, this appears to be the case in Bangladesh. We leave the measuring of the relative efficacy and efficiency of each financing tool for future work. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Francini, A; Sebastiani, L				Francini, Alessandra; Sebastiani, Luca			Abiotic Stress Effects on Performance of Horticultural Crops	HORTICULTURAE			English	Editorial Material						agronomic tools; dormancy; drought; ornamental; salinity		The yield and quality of horticultural crops mainly depend on genotype, environmental conditions, and cultivation management. Abiotic stresses, such as adverse environmental conditions, can strongly reduce crop performance, with crop yield losses ranging from 50% to 70%. The most common abiotic stresses are represented by cold, heat, drought, flooding, salinity, nutrient deficiency, and high and low light intensities, including ultraviolet radiation. These abiotic stresses affect multiple physiological and biochemical processes in plants. The ability of plants to face these stresses depends on their adaptation aptitude, and tolerant plants may express different strategies to adapt to or avoid the negative effects of abiotic stresses. At the physiological level, photosynthetic activity and light-use efficiency of plants may be modulated to enhance tolerance against the stress. At the biochemical level, several antioxidant systems can be activated, and many enzymes may produce stress-related metabolites to help avoid cellular damage, including such compounds as proline, glycine betaine, amino acids, etc. This special issue gathers eight papers; three are reviews and five are research papers. Two reviews are focused on the application of appropriate agronomic strategies for counteracting the negative effects of abiotic stresses. The third review is based on ornamental plant production under drought stress conditions and the effect on their ornamental quality. The research papers report the effect of climate change on crop development, yield, and quality. Abiotic stresses have been proven to reduce crop performance and yield. Research studies are essential for understanding the key adaptation strategies of plants that can be exploited for improving the crop stress tolerance.

In this study, we present a small-scale conceptual approach using HEC-RAS multi-scenario methodology based on remote sensing (RS), LiDAR data, and 2D hydraulic modeling for the urban and peri-urban area of Bacu City (Bistria River, NE Romania). In order to test the flood mitigation capacity of Bacu 1 reservoir (rB1) and Bacu 2 reservoir (rB2), four 2D streamflow hydraulic scenarios (s1-s4) based on average discharge and calculated discharge (s1-s4) data for rB1 spillway gate (Sw1) and for its hydro-power plant (H-pp) were computed. Compared with the large-scale flood hazard data provided by regional authorities, the 2D HEC-RAS multi-scenario provided a more realistic perspective about the possible flood threats in the study area and has shown to be a valuable asset in the improvement process of the official flood hazard maps.

Understanding the hydrological connectivity and its dynamics in the TSR, including its floodplain, is therefore important to support activities that aim to maintain ecological services in the TSR-TSL system. Thus, the main objective of this study is to examine the hydrological connectivity of the TSR and its floodplain by a modelling approach that integrates inundation patterns and sediment dynamics. The Caesar-Lisflood model was applied to describe inundation, sediment erosion, transport, and deposition in the TSR for the period of 2003-2013. The inundation areas connected to the TSR ranged from 140 to 2,327 km(2), whereas the isolated inundation areas from the TSR ranged from 0.27 to 504 km(2). Sediment dynamics showed its influence on inundation patterns and hydrological connectivity and could alter the yearly inundation ratio (defined as a normalized inundation frequency with a value ranging from 0 to 1) up to 0.8. Our approach provides a quantitative way to determine key factors (e.g., total inundation areas, seasonality, and connectivity of inundation patterns) for further investigation of ecological processes in relation to the inundation patterns and sediment dynamics in the TSR and TSL.

Possible causes for this amplified warming signal include a poleward Hadley cell expansion as well as tropospheric lapse-rate changes. In this work, regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by three different global climate models (GCMs) are performed, representing the RCP8.5 emission scenario. For every downscaled GCM, the climate change signal over Europe is separated into five contributions by modifying the lateral boundary conditions of the RCM. This simulation strategy is related to the pseudo-global warming method. The results show that a poleward expansion of the Hadley cell is of minor importance for the Mediterranean amplification. During summer, the simulated Hadley circulation is weak, and projections show no distinct expansion in the European sector. The north-south contrast in lapse-rate changes is suggested as the most important factor causing the Mediterranean amplification. Lapse-rate changes are projected throughout Europe, but are weaker over the Mediterranean than over northern Europe (around 0.15 vs 0.3 K km(-1) by the end of the century). The weaker lapse-rate changes result in a strong near-surface summer warming over the Mediterranean, since the upper-tropospheric warming is of similar magnitude throughout Europe. The differing lapse-rate changes can be understood as a thermodynamic response to lower-tropospheric humidity contrasts.

LATE QUATERNARY FLUVIAL ENVIRONMENTS AT ABO ARROYO, NEW MEXICO, USA: RESPONSE TO MILLENNIAL-SCALE CLIMATE CHANGE	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH			English	Article							SOUTHWESTERN UNITED-STATES; STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES; YOUNGER DRYAS; RIVER-BASIN; RIO-GRANDE; ICE CORE; HOLOCENE; COLORADO; PLATEAU; RECORD	Abo Arroyo is a tributary of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico. Its alluvial sequence is made up of four informal units, their age defined by 44 AMS radiocarbon dates from 12.8 ka to 0.85 ka. The earliest, unit 1, is terminal Pleistocene to early Holocene (12.8 ka to 9.0 ka), including the Scholle wet meadow (12.3 ka to 11.1 ka) related to the Younger Dryas. After an erosional gap in the record from 9 ka to 6 ka, coarse gravel (unit 2) was deposited in the channel (5.8 ka and 4.3 ka) during the middle Holocene period of aridity. Subsequently, the late Holocene wet period is characterized by fine-textured alluvium (unit 3) (3.5 ka to 0.945 ka) with shells of an aquatic snail, indicating persistent stream flow. An upper 2-m zone of dark-colored clayey silt beds with high amounts of organic carbon and carbonate accumulated from 1.7 ka to 0.945 ka. A record of C4 signatures, previously interpreted to indicate dry conditions 1.4 ka to 0.945 ka, is reinterpreted as an interval of exceptionally wet floodplain conditions with C-4 grasses and sedges. Abo Arroyo and other studies indicate three major episodes of late-Quaternary channel entrenchment: 1) from the full-glacial to late glacial-Bolling/Allerod (6.1 ky), 2) during the middle Holocene (2.5 ky), and 3) during the late Holocene Medieval Warm Period (0.4 ky), each erosional event less severe and shorter duration than the preceding one, and all three represent a significant change from wet to dry climate. During the Medieval Warm Period (A.D. 900 to 1300), a shallow channel formed in unit 3 alluvium, bracketed by AMS dates A.D. 1005 in unit 3 alluvium and A. D. 1100 in unit 4 channel fill. The channel cutting occurred with the shift from wet to dry climate, although the downcutting event was preceded by 100 years of landscape adjustment to the long drought. The canyon fill was entrenched again, deep and wide, by arroyo cutting in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The regional 83-year second-century drought (A.D. 100 to A.D. 182), documented by tree rings, shows up in the stable-carbon-isotope record from Abo Arroyo alluvium. The drought was more severe than the 400-year warm period but had little effect on the preserved alluvial record. The less severe but longer-duration Medieval Warm Period resulted in channel cutting at Abo Arroyo and elsewhere in the broad region at that time, but the secondcentury drought did not. Finally, the similarity of Abo Arroyo and Rio Grande late Holocene alluvial records with parallel stratigraphy, sedimentology, and geochronology illustrates that tributaries and main valleys respond alike and in concert to climate and climate change.

However, the computation time of the predictive model calculation greatly hinders further development of MPC in this field. In this study, we propose two surrogate models, namely the water tank-water balance model 1 (TWBM1) and the water tank-water balance model 2 (TWBM2), to replace the storm water management model (SWMM) as the prediction model for MPC, thus improving MPC computational efficiency. Both surrogate models can obtain the total outflow process at the downstream outfall of the study area and the corresponding overflow process. In comparison with TWBM1, TWBM2 requires 26 % fewer calibration parameters, and its structure is simpler. These results have been verified in the real-time optimal scheduling of a rainwater drainage system in the Doumen area of Fuzhou City, China. The results show that TWBM1 and TWBM2 have shorter computation time compared to SWMM, which improves the efficiency of MPC computation. Additionally, in comparison with the existing scheduling results, MPC has better performance in terms of economy, security and computational efficiency.

This study aims to explore the impact of extreme precipitation index changes and provide decision-making suggestions for flood early warning and agricultural development in the Huaihe River Basin. The study utilizes the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate model dataset and daily value dataset (V3.0) from China's national surface weather stations to investigate temporal and spatial changes in the extreme precipitation indices from 1960 to 2014 and future projections. At the same time, this study adopts the RclimDex model, Taylor diagram, and Sen+Mann-Kendall trend analysis research methods to analyze the data. The results reveal a slight increase in extreme precipitation indices from the northwest to southeast within the basin, except for the CDD, which shows a decreasing trend. Regarding the spatial variation, the future increase in extreme precipitation in the Huaihe River Basin shows a spatial variation characteristic that decreases from the northwest to southeast. These findings suggest that extreme precipitation events are intensifying in the region. Understanding these trends and their implications is vital for adaptation strategy planning and mitigating the risks associated with extreme precipitation events in the Huaihe River Basin.

The city has an extensive network of canalised urban streams, some of which are closed, flowing into the City's sewage system and into the Sava River. However, some of these open watercourses are not fully utilised due to the inadequate management of blue infrastructure. Climate change adds pressure to conventional approaches, creating an urgent need for flexible solutions. This paper analyses different locations to assess the possibilities for safeguarding, revitalising, and developing blue and green infrastructure. Based on a thorough analysis, the synthesis of previous urban practice examples for the city area, and the research of the experiences and theoretical knowledge on the issue, this paper proposes sustainable solutions for Medvescak and Crnomerec streams in Zagreb, such as water storage and purification. The proposed solutions hold significant potential to address issues related to water supply, protection, and nature preservation in a more flexible and adaptable manner. This paper proposes solutions that provide a practical framework for the future implementation of nature-based solutions and development in other urban regions.

Although porous pavement is an important environmentally friendly alternative pavement structure for roads, it has many disadvantages and is not yet widely used. Therefore, this paper reported the use of stone columns in the soil subgrade of porous pavement to improve the performance of roads. Soil property tests were conducted to evaluate the permeability of subgrade soil in a field area at different depths. Stone columns with different heights and various aggregate sizes were installed in the soil subgrade in the laboratory and the field, with the concrete footing on top of the stone columns as the bedding course of the pavement. Quantitative comparisons of the permeability of stone columns in the laboratory and the field were undertaken. In addition, the temperature changes in the stone columns and concrete footings before and after watering were tested to investigate the influence of the stone columns on the thermal behavior of roads. The test results showed that stone columns improved the water drainage in porous pavement and contributed to temperature reductions in urban roads. Therefore, the use of stone columns is recommended in porous pavement to improve water drainage and mitigate urban heat islands.

Urban flood risk assessment is important for urban flood control, disaster reduction, and risk management. In this study, a novel approach for assessing urban flood risk was proposed based on the dynamic population distribution, improved entropy weight method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, and the principle of maximum membership, and the spatial distribution of flood risk in four different sessions or daily time segments (TS1-TS4) in the northern part of the Shenzhen River Basin (China) was assessed using geographic information system technology. Results indicated that risk levels varied with population movement. The areas of highest risk were largest in TS1 and TS3, accounting for 7.03% and 7.07% of the total area, respectively. The areas of higher risk were largest in TS2 and TS4, accounting for 4.54% and 4.64% of the total area, respectively. The findings of this study could provide a theoretical basis for assessing urban flood risk management measures in Shenzhen (and even throughout China), and a scientific basis for development of disaster prevention and reduction strategies by flood control departments.

Using survey data from 300 households from three highly disaster-prone areas of the lower Teesta River basin in Bangladesh, this study explores households' risk perception of drought, earthquake, and flood at the local level. The ordered probit regression model was applied to identify the factors influencing household disaster risk perception. Most of the respondents perceived the likelihood of occurring drought, earthquake, and flood hazards on a large scale in the selected areas which cause negative impacts on their quality of life and financial losses. They have lack knowledge on mitigation actions which makes them unable to control the devastating impacts of disasters. Econometric results show that households' age, gender, education, and income-generating sources had significantly influenced the respondent's drought, earthquake, and flood risk perception. Female participants have less knowledge on mitigations actions and are less capable of controlling the hazards than their counterparts making them more vulnerable to the impacts of hazards. Urgent action is required to improve their socio-economic conditions, and to reduce the knowledge gap between males and females as well as to improve the household's understanding of mitigation and preparedness for disaster risk.

This study quantitatively estimated the relative sea level rise (SLR) in the Pearl River Estuary and investigated the potential upper and lower bounds of the maximum inundation depths in Macau City induced by Typhoon Mangkhut (2018). Extreme tidal levels are assumed to be coincident with the pre-landfall hour of Mangkhut during its movement towards the coast. Under both SLR scenarios, inundations caused by astronomical tides indicate a significantly shortened return period of flood events with a rising sea level. The tidal barrier with a crest elevation designed according to Typhoon Hato (2017) can effectively protect the Inner Harbor region from flooding by astronomical tides or Mangkhut-like typhoons occurring at low tides; however this effectiveness is lost under high tides. The results indicate the dominant role of tidal timing at inundation depths, which is also influenced by modulated surge heights owing to nonlinear tide-wave-surge and SLR-surge interactions. In spite of decreased surges affected by SLR around Macau, proper engineering countermeasures should be planned to cope with severe inundation by compounding unfavorable factors.

However, despite the increasing occurrence and severity of natural hazards in the Iasi metropolitan area (of north-eastern Romania), there is a lack of knowledge of local stakeholders on how to encourage the population regarding safety actions. For this reason, we interviewed 118 local stakeholders to determine their risk awareness and preparedness capacities over a set of natural hazards, in order to understand where deficiencies in knowledge, action, and trust are greatest. Results reveal substantial distinctions between different threats and among stakeholders based on their cognitive and behavioural roles in the communities. The roles of responsibility and trust are important driving factors shaping their perception and preparedness. Preparedness levels are low, and, for many, learning and preparatory actions are needed to build resilience to the negative occurrences of natural hazards. As the stakeholders' role is to direct interventions in affected areas by managing communication initiatives with the entire population of the community, there is a need to create stakeholders' networks, empowering local actors and serving as a bridge between authorities' decisions and local people, making effective risk management plans, and securing more lives and economies.

A new glacial varve chronology along the southern Laurentide Ice Sheet that spans the Younger Dryas-Holocene boundary	GEOLOGY			English	Article							LAKE AGASSIZ; CLIMATE; DEGLACIATION; EXAMPLES; MAXIMUM; RECORDS	Glacial varves can detail ice-margin positions and provide a proxy for meltwater discharge at resolutions comparable to those of the Greenland ice core archives, and thus they can be critical paleorecords for assessing the response of both ancient and modern ice sheets to climate change. Here we provide an similar to 1500 yr varve chronology straddling the Younger Dryas (YD)-Holocene boundary (11.65 cal. kyr B.P.), the first such chronology in North America. The varves are from glacial Lake Agassiz (central North America). The chronology is pinned on accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon-dated terrestrial macrofossils at the base of a widespread red-clay bed deposited during flooding from the Lake Superior basin. We illustrate the utility of this record by examining ice-margin retreat and melting through the late Younger Dryas and across the Holocene boundary. The ice margin receded at a constant rate, not only during the late YD, but for at least 300 yr after the onset of the Holocene. In contrast, varve thicknesses increased at the boundary, and a moraine formed over a 50 yr period, perhaps in response to the warming climate. Our expectation is that this time series will continue to be developed, expanded, and refined because it promises to be the longest and most geographically extensive glacial varve data set in North America.

Year-to-year ecosystem services supply in conservation contexts in north-eastern Madagascar: Trade-offs between global demands and local needs	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES			English	Article						Shifting cultivation; Climate change mitigation; Protected areas; InVEST; Bequest value; Food security		Tropical mountain forest frontier landscapes are increasingly target of protected areas (PAs) implementation, in many cases to secure the supply of globally demanded ecosystem services (ES). However, whether PAs manage to achieve their objectives is not always clear, nor are the implications of PA establishment for the supply of ES relevant for local populations. To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the year-to-year supply of six stakeholder-relevant ES across ES categories in two forest frontier, mountainous landscapes in the periphery of PAs in north-eastern Madagascar. As ES most relevant to local populations, we assess food crops production, flood control and bequest value. As globally-demanded ES, we evaluate export cash crops production, global climate regulation and existence value. Our results suggest that PA implementation managed to stem on-going losses of global climate regulation and existence value, but at the expense of also driving decreases in food crops production and bequest value supply to local populations. While our findings are encouraging for global conservation objectives, they also highlight the stark costs local populations might incur under PA establishment, and thus the need to assure that local livelihoods and well-being, including cultural dimensions, are not undermined by conservation interventions.

Strategic disposal of flood debris via CO<sub>2</sub>-assisted catalytic pyrolysis	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Flood debris; Debris disposal; Waste-to-energy; Pyrolysis; CO2 utilization	AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS PAHS; THERMAL-DEGRADATION; BIOMASS PYROLYSIS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; FOSSIL-FUEL; CHALLENGES; COMBUSTION; MECHANISMS; MICROALGAE; BIOCHAR	Recent abnormal climate changes resulted in the dramatic alternation of rainfall and flood patterns in many countries. The massive generation of flood debris, a mixture of soil (sediment), biomass, plastic, metal, and various hazardous materials, poses various environmental and public health problems. This study suggests a sustainable technical platform to convert the hazardous materials into value-added products. CO2-assisted pyrolysis was used to thermally convert flood debris into syngas (H-2 and CO). CO2 enhanced the syngas production due to gas phase homogeneous reactions (HRs) between CO2 and volatile hydrocarbons evolved from pyrolysis of flood debris. For improvement of HRs in line with enhancement of syngas production, additional thermal energy and earth abundant catalyst were used. In particular, Ni/SiO2 catalyst increased more than one order of magnitude higher syngas production, comparing to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Synergistic effect of CO2 and Ni catalyst showed nearly 50% more production of syngas in reference to catalytic pyrolysis under N-2. During flood debris pyrolysis, compositional matrix of flood debris was also determined by detecting index chemicals of waste materials that cannot be identified by naked eyes. Thus, this study confirmed that CO2 -assisted pyrolysis is a useful tool for conversion of flood debris into value-added chemicals.

These events can affect regions located far from rivers that have never been affected before. As warning times are short, there are hardly any effective emergency measures to mitigate the severe damage caused by pluvial floods. Therefore, long-term mitigation measures are necessary for sustainable urban flood management. However, people first need to realise their personal risk in order to become active and take private precautionary measures. To get a better understanding of the processes underlying public risk perception of pluvial floods, a questionnaire-based telephone survey was conducted analysing two case studies in western Germany. Key findings reveal that risk perceptions need to be distinguished between personal and global perception. Personal risk perception was low among the participants, while their global risk perception was far higher. The determinants of global and personal risk perception on pluvial flooding were identified. The study also showed that mitigation behaviour is influenced by personal risk perception, knowledge, education, and housing conditions. These determinants should receive attention when future risk communication and flood management strategies are developed.

This study uses a unique and comparable panel dataset of about 4000 rural households collected in three years (2010, 2013, and 2016) from Northeast Thailand and Central Vietnam to examine and compare the welfare effects of floods, droughts, and storms reported to be experienced by rural households. Our results show that these weather shocks have significant effects on household income, consumption, and poverty in both countries, though the levels of severity are different. Drought is the common extreme weather event in these two countries with significant and negative effects on household income, consumption and poverty. In Thailand, floods have higher impacts on rural households in terms of income and poverty than storms do. Compared to Thailand, Vietnam is more exposed and significantly affected by storms. In addition to weather shocks, the welfare of rural households is significantly affected by other factors representing their livelihood platforms. Promoting farm mechanization and rural education should be given high priority in both countries. In Thailand, the accumulation of farmland should also be encouraged. In Vietnam, accelerating internet access and supporting livestock production would contribute to increasing household income and consumption and consequently decreasing poverty.

The potential for natural flood management to maintain free discharge at urban drainage outfalls	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						flood hazard; land management; natural flood management; surface drainage; water-level management	SPACE-TIME VARIABILITY; DYNAMIC TOPMODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL; IMPACTS; NETWORK; RISK; URBANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATION	This study examines whether catchment-scale natural flood management (NFM) interventions could help to manage water levels in downstream urban watercourses and promote free discharge from surface drainage outfalls. A coupled modelling approach consisting of Dynamic TOPMODEL, HEC-RAS, and Infoworks ICM models is used to characterise the response from a small Cambridgeshire catchment. Four different NFM scenarios (consisting of in-channel woody debris and wider catchment afforestation) are defined. The attenuation of catchment response created by these measures is evaluated for an historic event and six different design storms. The consequent moderation of water depths at two downstream drainage outfalls is investigated with respect to maintaining free discharge from a surface drainage system. The case study results show that greatest reductions in the time of outfall inundation from NFM occur during frequent storm events (e.g., up to 5.75 hr during a 5-year event). These reductions diminish with increasing storm severity but, by slightly desynchronising rural and urban responses, upstream interventions continue to have modest benefit for downstream drainage performance (e.g., preventing system capacity being exceeded during a 100-year event). These results may interest water companies (increasingly involved in catchment-scale NFM projects) looking to improve performance of surface water drainage.

Multi-model Hydroclimate Projections for the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin in the Southeastern United States	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROBABLE MAXIMUM FLOOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; QUANTIFYING UNCERTAINTY; LAND-COVER; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; STREAMFLOW; ENSEMBLE; INTENSIFICATION; PROPAGATION	This study uses a high-resolution, process-based modeling framework to assess the impacts of changing climate on water resources for the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin in the southeastern United States. A 33-member ensemble of hydrologic projections was generated using 3 distributed hydrologic models (Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System, Variable Infiltration Capacity, and Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model) of different complexity. These hydrologic models were driven by dynamically downscaled and bias-corrected future climate simulations from 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 global climate models under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emission scenario, with 40 years each in baseline (1966-2005) and future (2011-2050) periods. The hydroclimate response, in general, projects an increase in mean seasonal precipitation, runoff, and streamflow. The high and low flows are projected to increase and decrease, respectively, in general, suggesting increased likelihood of extreme rainfall events and intensification of the hydrologic cycle. The uncertainty associated with the ensemble hydroclimate response, analyzed through an analysis of variance technique, suggests that the choice of climate model is more critical than the choice of hydrologic model for the studied region. This study provides in-depth insights of hydroclimate response and associated uncertainties to support informed decisions by water resource managers.

Historical flash floods in England: New regional chronologies and database	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						extreme events; flash flood; flood chronologies; historical hydrology	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; RAINFALL; STATIONARITY; PALEOFLOOD; BRITAIN; EVENTS; EUROPE; NORTH	There is increasing interest in past occurrences of flooding from intense rainfall, commonly referred to as "flash flooding," and the associated socioeconomic consequences. Historical information can help us to place recent events in context and to understand the effect of low frequency climate variability on changing flash flood frequencies. Previous studies have focussed on fluvial flooding to reconstruct the temporal and spatial patterns of past events. Here, we provide an online flood chronology for the north and south-west of England for flash floods, including both surface water and fluvial flooding, with coverage from similar to 1700 to similar to 2013 (). The primary source of documentary material is local newspaper reports, which often give detailed descriptions of impacts. This provides a new resource to inform communities and first responders of flood risks, especially those from rapid rise in water level whose severity may be greater than those of accompanying peak flow. Examples are provided of historical flash floods that exemplify how the chronologies can help to place recent floods in the context of the preinstrumental record for: (a) more robust estimates of event return period, (b) identification of catchment or settlement susceptibility to flash flood events, and (c) characterisation of events in ungauged catchments.

Exploratory scenario analysis for disaster risk reduction: Considering alternative pathways in disaster risk assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster risk; Scenarios; Stakeholder engagement; Simulation modelling; Risk assessment	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; FLOOD RISK; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; GLOBAL SCENARIOS; FUTURE; FRAMEWORK; MITIGATION	Disaster risk is a combination of natural hazards, along with society's exposure and vulnerability to them. Therefore, to ensure effective, long-term disaster risk reduction we must consider the dynamics of each of these components and how they change over extended periods due to population, economic and climatic drivers, as well as policy and individual decisions. This paper provides a methodology to capture these factors within exploratory scenarios designed to test the effectiveness of policy responses to reduce disaster losses. The scenarios developed and subsequent analysis of them combine knowledge and insight from stakeholders and experts, and make use of simulation modelling to enable scenarios with qualitative and quantitative elements to be integrated within risk assessment processes and contribute to strategic risk treatments. The methodology was applied to a case-study in Greater Adelaide, Australia, and used to assess how disaster risk for earthquakes, bushfire and coastal inundation changes from 2016 to 2050 under five exploratory scenarios for the future of the region. This analysis can be applied more broadly to consider how future risks impact on regional viability, and suitability for investment related to the need to gain a better understanding of governmental and organisational exposure to physical risks.

In snow-dominated regions where a large percentage of flood events are caused by snowmelt and rain-on-snow events, the PREC-IDF design approach can lead to substantial underestimation or overestimation of design floods and associated infrastructure. In this study, next-generation IDF (NG-IDF) curves, which characterize the actual water reaching the land surface, are introduced into the design process to improve hydrologic design. The authors compared peak design flood estimates from the National Resource Conservation Service TR-55 hydrologic model driven by NG-IDF and PREC-IDF curves at 399 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western United States, all of which had at least 30 years of high-quality records. They found that about 70% of the stations in the western United States showed the potential for underdesign, for which the PREC-IDF curves underestimated peak design floods by as much as 324%. These results demonstrated the need to update the use of PREC-IDF curves to the use of NG-IDF curves for hydrologic design in snow-dominated regions.

This occurs in parallel with the degradation of crop fields, and triggers the occurrence of pluvial floods and droughts on the same field. Consequently, irrigation must be adapted to the changing soil properties. Detailed spatial and temporal measurements of changes in infiltration are required. This study aimed to quantify changes in infiltration for a subhumid irrigated cropland with various soil types (Phaeozem, Solonetz, Chernozem) and field conditions (seedbed and stubble) by simulating rainfall. As the soil structure determines hydrology, the aggregate stability/surface roughness was tested as a proxy of infiltration through photogrammetry. The soil losses caused by precipitation did not exhibit connections to changes in the surface roughness, and lower aggregate stability did not necessarily cause lower infiltration intensities, suggesting that sedimentation could only partly seal drainage pores. The final infiltration intensities varied within a wide range (0.2-28.4 mm h(-1)). Seedbed preparation did not increase the volume of micropores (<10 mu m), which resulted in higher infiltration under stubble. Photogrammetry was found to be a potentially useful tool for measuring aggregate stability, however, further investigations on in situ soil surfaces are required for technical improvement.

The catchment area of the Klimkowka reservoir on the Ropa River, a tributary of the Wisloka River, located within the Polish Carpathians was selected for the study. The analysis carried out, using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modelling among other techniques, showed an increase in the importance of low-flow outflow from the upper Ropa catchment and a negative balance of inflow to the reservoir (Q < 2 m(3) (s-1)), manifested by a prolonged duration of low flows and an increase in outflow deficit during the year. The duration of flood flows and the runoff excess during these periods show a constant or decreasing tendency, while the length and excess of runoff increase during large floods. Thus, in the upper Ropa catchment, an increase in the intensity of extreme hydrological phenomena is observed. The prepared forecasts indicate an increase in annual runoff from the catchment in the decades 2021-2030 and 2031-2040 and a marked decrease in the decade 2041-2050. In the annual cycle, the projected changes in the coming decades will take different directions. In December only, throughout the entire period 2021-2050, the outflow will increase, whereas in May it will systematically decrease.

The main objective of this study was to examine the determinants of rural households' intensity of flood adaptation in the Fogera rice plain, Ethiopia. A three-stage stratified sampling technique was employed to select 337 sample household heads. Primary data was collected through a structured household survey. Data analysis was accompanied by a descriptive and generalised Poisson regression (GP) model. The descriptive analysis showed that households adopted an average of three (3) flood adaptation strategies. The generalised Poisson regression further revealed that family size, availability of off-farm income, previous flood experience, access to credit, access to extension services, and an early warning information system statistically significantly increase flood adaptation strategies' average number (intensity). However, the age of the household head negatively and significantly influences the intensity of flood adaptation. More specifically, households with off-farm income, previous flood experience, access to credit, access to extension, and an early warning information system were 20%, 94%, 13%, 30%, and 29% more likely to adopt more flood adaptation strategies, respectively. The findings call for immediate response and coordination among stakeholders to design strategies that enhance households' livelihood, access to credit, access to extension services, and early warning information systems for effective flood adaptation in the study area.

Machine learning models are increasingly used for flood forecasting, however, they are limited in their ability to extract effective features from rainfall data and capture dynamic runoff processes. This study proposes an attention mechanism-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, named as ALSTM-DW, which uses double time sliding windows (DTSW), and a weighted mean square error (WMSE) loss function. The ALSTM-DW model was applied to three urban flooding hotspots in Shenzhen, China, and its effectiveness was verified through a series of comparative experiments. The results obtained show that: 1) the proposed model performs well, with a coefficient of determination larger than 0.85, peak flow error smaller than 0.015 m, and time to peak error smaller than 2 min on average in testing periods; 2) the use of DTSW helps extract effective rainfall features and mitigate excessive fluctuations in forecasted hydrographs caused by overresponse to rainfall; 3) adding the attention mechanism to the LSTM network helps consider the varying contribution of each input factor over time; and 4) the WMSE improves the ability of the network to predict flood peaks, with an average decrease of 88% and 54% in peak flow error and time to peak error, respectively. Therefore, the ALSTM-DW model shows promising potential for providing accurate flood forecasting, which can support effective flood emergency operations.

The use of geospatial information and technology has been recognized as a valuable tool to help farmers reduce the adverse impacts of natural disasters on agriculture. Remote sensing and GIS are gaining traction as ways to improve agricultural disaster response due to recent advancements in spatial resolution, accessibility, and affordability. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the FAIR agricultural disaster services. It holistically introduces the current status, case studies, technologies, and challenges, and it provides a big picture of exploring geospatial applications for agricultural disaster "from farm to space". The review begins with an overview of the governments and organizations worldwide. We present the major international and national initiatives relevant to the agricultural disaster context. The second part of this review illustrates recent research on remote sensing-based agricultural disaster monitoring, with a special focus on drought and flood events. Traditional, integrative, and machine learning-based methods are highlighted in this section. We then examine the role of spatial data infrastructure and research on agricultural disaster services and systems. The generic lifecycle of agricultural disasters is briefly introduced. Eventually, we discuss the grand challenges and emerging opportunities that range from analysis-ready data to decision-ready services, providing guidance on the foreseeable future.

While the rates of SLR accelerate, many channels simultaneously experience channel deepening for navigation. With globally decreasing sediment supplies, most channels are at risk of becoming deeper when the rate of SLR accelerates and sedimentation cannot keep pace with SLR. These factors potentially favor amplification of the tides and thereby increase flood risk, but the extent to which they will do so is unknown. Here, we introduce and use a validated model for an artificially deepened multi-branch delta to get a mechanistic understanding of non-linear SLR-effects on peak water levels. Results show that, when the current deepened bed level will be maintained, peak water levels do not rise on par with mean sea-level. Thus flood risk increases less than what can be expected from the predictions of the mean sea-level increase. The reason is that SLR causes a proportional reduction in convergence of channel area. This mechanism reduces tidal amplification. Nevertheless, SLR effects extend far beyond the range of present-day seasonal variations, with future low water levels being equal to present-day high water levels, while the tidal range slightly reduces. This will have consequences not only for flood risk, but also for freshwater availability, navigation and ecology.	[Leuven, Jasper R. F. W.; Niesten, Iris; Hoitink, A. J. F.

We conducted a bibliometric analysis of vulnerability assessment method of transportation networks research from 1978 to 2021 to see the trend of publications in this study area. To perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of worldwide vulnerability assessment method, research knowledge that exhibit research trends, growth, collaborations and hotspots, quantitative and qualitative data from bibliometrics were used. According to the findings of the study, the number of studies on vulnerability assessment methods have increased to a considerable degree since 2004. Researchers on the topic are predominantly from Europe, with the majority based in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, and China. The contribution of developing countries was relatively minimal, with China being the one notable exception. Based on the analysis of the keywords and the review, simulations using computer software, statistical and mathematical approach are the most used methods in the vulnerability assessment of transportation networks. The results also indicated that research on traffic control and accident prevention on roadways is still the most prevalent. In addition, this study meticulously outlined the hotspots in this topic (floods and seismic hazards). However, the vulnerability assessment of transportation network studies concerning the aspects of climate change during disasters is less explored. Lastly, the findings are expected to provide a reference that is both helpful and relevant for academics and practitioners who are interested in the future paths of this study.

Local adaptation is a balance between selection pressure and gene flow and provides species with fitness benefits under current conditions. Management strategies to respond to predicted shifts in climate may be able to leverage local adaptation to assist with species persistence. In this study we examine the genomic diversity, gene flow and associations between genomic and environmental variation in Taxandria linearifolia across its distribution in the Warren River Catchment. Gene flow was restricted between populations in the drier hotter upper catchment compared to those residing in the cooler wetter regions of the catchment, potentially limiting the flow of genes adapted to predicted future climates. Using two separate methods to search for candidate loci, we found the highest number of correlations between loci and the environmental variable of mean moisture content of the coldest quarter, supporting the hy-pothesis that floodplain species are linked with water availability. These research findings indi-cate that species restricted to wet environments and having traits facilitating high gene flow, can show signals of adaptation when gene flow is disrupted, and populations are isolated. This development of adaptation in isolated populations makes assisted migration of dry adapted ge-notypes to other populations an effective strategy for facilitating long term persistence under changing climates.

It is still unclear to what extent trend or event effects alter biodiversity and functioning in river ecosystems, adding considerable uncertainty to predictions of their future dynamics. Using a comprehensive database of 71 published studies, we show that event - but not trend - effects associated with extreme changes in water flow and temperature substantially reduce species richness. Furthermore, event effects - particularly those affecting hydrological dynamics - on biodiversity and primary productivity were twice as high as impacts due to gradual changes. The synthesis of the available evidence reveals that event effects induce regime shifts in river ecosystems, particularly affecting organisms such as invertebrates. Among extreme weather events, dryness associated with flow interruption caused the largest effects on biota and ecosystem functions in rivers. Effects on ecosystem functions (primary production, organic matter decomposition and respiration) were asymmetric, with only primary production exhibiting a negative response to extreme weather events. Our meta-analysis highlights the disproportionate impact of event effects on river biodiversity and ecosystem functions, with implications for the long-term conservation and management of river ecosystems. However, few studies were available from tropical areas, and our conclusions therefore remain largely limited to temperate river systems. Further efforts need to be directed to assemble evidence of extreme events on river biodiversity and functioning.

Field-Scale Modeling of CO<sub>2</sub> Mineral Trapping in Reactive Rocks: A Vertically Integrated Approach	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						geological carbon storage; carbon mineralization; vertical equilibrium; reactive transport; basalt; mineral trapping	IN-SITU MINERALIZATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; GEOCHEMICAL TRANSPORT; GRAVITY CURRENTS; HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBFIX SITE; SEQUESTRATION; BASALT; INJECTION	Unlike sedimentary formations, flood basalts have the potential for relatively rapid mineral trapping when used as an injection target for CO2 storage. However, there are still open questions surrounding the implementation of CO2 storage in basalt at a large scale. These include how the porosity of the target formation will be altered by the geochemical activity, as well as whether a large-scale CO2 storage project can expect the same fast mineralization rates observed during small-scale pilot injections. Field-scale numerical modeling studies can play a role in answering these questions, by improving our understanding of the way in which details such as mineralogy, temperature or injection strategy affect the timing and spatial location of geochemical processes. Simulations of reactive transport processes in the subsurface often rely on computationally demanding methods. Although these methods provide comprehensive simulation capabilities, they may not provide the efficiency needed for wide exploration of parameter spaces or for simulations over long time scales. The present work combines a vertically integrated model of two-phase flow in porous media with a fully customizable geochemical model to create an efficient vertically integrated method for field-scale simulation of CO2 mineral trapping in basalt. The proposed method provides a platform for extensive field-scale modeling studies that can help address some of the remaining barriers to large-scale implementation of CO2 storage in basalt formations.

The results show that the SWAT model is applicable in the Tahe River Basin; forestlands, shrublands, wetlands, and grasslands are the main land-use types in this basin, and the transfers among them from 1980-2015 have impacted runoff by less than 5%. Under extreme land use-change scenarios, the simulated runoff decreased from grasslands, to wetlands, shrublands, and finally, forestlands. The conversion of extreme land-use scenarios produces different hydrological effects. When forestland is converted to grassland, runoff increases by 25.32%, when forestland is converted to wetland, runoff increases by 13.34%, and the conversion of shrubland to forestland reduces runoff by 13.25%. In addition, the sensitivity of runoff to different land-use changes was much greater during flood seasons than in dry seasons. Compared to the reference year of 2015, the annual simulated runoff under the two future land-use scenarios (shrublands to forestlands and shrublands to wetland) was less. Also, both future land-use scenarios showed effects to decrease flooding and increased dryness, This study provided important insight into the integrated management of land use and water resources in the Tahe River Basin and the permafrost region of northeastern China.

The artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is generally used for stochastic forecasting rainfall which is not capable to simulate unseen extreme rainfall events which become common due to climate change. A new model is developed in this study for prediction of daily rainfall for different lead times based on sea level pressure (SLP) which is physically related to rainfall on land and thus able to predict unseen rainfall events. Daily rainfall of east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (PM) was predicted using SLP data over the climate domain. Five advanced AI algorithms such as extreme learning machine (ELM), Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNNs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), extreme gradient boosting (xgBoost), and hybrid neural fuzzy inference system (HNFIS) were used considering the complex relationship of rainfall with sea level pressure. Principle components of SLP domain correlated with daily rainfall were used as predictors. The results revealed that the efficacy of AI models is predicting daily rainfall one day before. The relative performance of the models revealed the higher performance of BRNN with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.678 compared with HNFIS (NRMSE = 0.708), BART (NRMSE = 0.784), xgBoost (NRMSE = 0.803), and ELM (NRMSE = 0.915). Visual inspection of predicted rainfall during model validation using density-scatter plot and other novel ways of visual comparison revealed the ability of BRNN to predict daily rainfall one day before reliably.

LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Conservation practices; Environmental policy; Climate adaptation; Soil conservation; Agri-environmental governance	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT	Cover crops represent a potential win-win opportunity to promote climate resilience by helping farmers adapt to climate risks while simultaneously mitigating multiple environmental impacts from agriculture. However, cover crop adoption rates are increasing slowly and cover less than 5% of U.S. croplands. In contrast, several Indiana counties in the southern Wabash River Basin have cover crops on more than 20 % of farmland. This qualitative study draws on 33 semi-structured interviews with farmers to understand whether climate risks are driving the above-average rates of adoption in this area. Our purposive sample of farmers was guided by whether they farmed flood-prone areas along the White and Wabash Rivers, thus making them especially sensitive to increasing flood risks from climate change. We found that while climate risks, particularly intensifying rainfall events, were a factor in some cases, most adoption was a longstanding effort to control wind-erosion on hilly areas with sandy soils. We also found that farmers experienced challenges with adoption following successful establishment of cover crops tied to climate-driven ecosystem responses. Greater spring precipitation delayed cash crop planting because of moisture retention and intensified pest pressures from increased habitat has caused replanting of cash crop seeds. Responses indicate that climate risks have mixed effects that may either discourage or encourage cover crop adoption depending on whether future outreach and policy interventions can help farmers overcome the adoption challenges they encounter.

Carrying out the assessment is beneficial to the sustainability of the development of society and the economy. For this purpose, Jiangsu province in China is taken as the study area to explore the social vulnerability assessment at a city level. A framework has been constructed from three dimensions of demographics, economics, and social security. In our study, a new approach based on the maximizing deviation method and TODIM model is proposed to evaluate social vulnerability in Jiangsu province. For the sake of analysis, we divide 13 cities of Jiangsu province into three parts, namely the southern part, central part, and northern part, according to the geographical location. As a result, the north part performance of social vulnerability is the worst among the three regions. The average of the northern part has always obviously exceeded the others of Jiangsu province from 2012 to 2017, which indicates that the north part is the most vulnerable to natural hazards. In addition, the performance of the southern part is relatively better than that of the central region. Especially, Suqian has always been at the bottom from 2012 to 2017, which reveals the ability to withstand natural disasters is the most insufficient. Our findings also imply that social vulnerability is related to local economic development to some extent.

Alley cropping as an alternative under changing climate and risk scenarios: A Monte-Carlo simulation approach	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agroforestry; Climate change; Economic returns; Forestry; Risk; Stochastic modeling	SOIL CARBON; GROWTH; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS	Alley cropping is an agroforestry system in which annual crops are grown in alleys between rows of woody perennials for timber or other products, which can provide ecosystem services and help farmers diversify outputs. But is alley cropping a financially viable alternative to monocropping? To answer this question, a Monte Carlo model of financial risk and returns was used to understand how this diversification of outputs might help farmers in the southeast United States adapt to future scenarios in which agriculture or forestry may become more risky due to a changing climate or other factors. Traditional monocropping had the highest mean returns in the base scenario (based on current risk conditions), but the highest risk. Pine plantations had the lowest returns and lowest risk, and alley cropping was intermediate (mean soil expectation values of $5513 for monocropping, $3955 for alley cropping, and $2693 for pine plantations). The model results showed that traditional monocropping does not stochastically dominate alley cropping in any of the risk scenarios, meaning that alley cropping may have a place for risk-averse farmers. Furthermore, in the scenario in which the downside risk of annual crop production is increased - perhaps due to increased frequency of floods, droughts, etc. - alley cropping mean returns are higher and risk lower than traditional monocropping (mean soil expectation values of $2951 and $2911, respectively, and pine plantations at $2688), meaning any risk averse farmer might prefer alley cropping to monocropping.

The present article studies the past, current, and future water balance progression of realistic scenarios from 2005 to 2050 in the Mezquital Valley, the receptor of Mexico City untreated sewage since 1886, allowing for agriculture irrigation under unsustainable conditions. The Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) was used to estimate water demand and supply, and validation was performed by comparing results with outflow data from the Tula River. Simulated scenarios were (1st) steady-state based on inertial growth rates (2nd) transient scenario concerning the influence of forecasted climate change perturbations in surface water and hydric stress for 2050; and (3rd) the previous scenario appending scheduled actions, such as 36% reduction in imported wastewater and the startup of a massive Wastewater Treatment Plant, allowing for drip and sprinkler irrigation from the year 2030. The main results are as follows: (a) in the period 2005-2017, 59% of the agriculture depended on flood irrigation with megacity sewage; (b) the outcomes of water balance scenarios up to 2050 are presented, with disaggregated sectorial supply of ground and superficial water; (c) drip irrigation would reduce agriculture demands by 42% but still does not guarantee the downflow hydroelectric requirements, aggravated by the lack of wastewater supply from 2030. This research highlights how present policies compromise future Valley demands.

Increasing drivers such as habitat destruction, expanding horticulture and aquaculture industries, and global pet and food trade have created pathways for exotic species to be introduced leading to severe impacts on recipient ecosystems. Although relatively less studied than terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems are highly susceptible to biological invasions. In India, there has been a noticeable increase in the introduction of alien fish species in freshwater environments. In the current study, we aimed to understand how climate change can affect the dynamics of the biological invasion of invasive alien fishes in India. We also evaluated the river-linking project's impact on the homogenization of biota in Indian freshwater bodies. We used species occurrence records with selected environmental variables to assess vulnerable locations for current and future biological invasion using species distribution models. Our study has identified and mapped the vulnerable regions to invasion in India. Our research indicates that the interlinking of rivers connects susceptible regions housing endangered fish species with invasive hotspots. Invasive alien fishes from the source basin may invade vulnerable basins and compete with the native species.

How natural foreshores offer flood protection during dike breaches: An explorative flume study	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Nature -based flood protection; Hybrid flood defences; Non -erodible foreshores; Flood damage; Flood impact reduction; Ecosystem restoration	SALT MARSHES; HURRICANE-KATRINA; WAVE ATTENUATION; COASTAL DEFENSE; LIFE	In this paper we describe one aspect of nature-based flood protection by foreshores in hybrid flood defences and discuss how foreshore ecosystem restoration can contribute to flood protection. Flood protection consists of flood prevention, by grey, green or hybrid defences, and flood impact reduction, by spatial planning to limit damage and crisis management to limit exposure. Reduction of flood impact is increasingly important because no flood defence system can provide 100% safety, especially with climate change and sea level rise. In this study we aim to understand and visualize the effect of foreshore characteristics (i.e., width, elevation and erodibility) on flooding impact in the hinterland of hybrid flood defences. As it is difficult to research real dike breaches, we do an explorative flume study to analyse the impact of a mimicked dike breach in the hinterland. Our physical scale model showed the presence of a non-erodible foreshore reduces flood damage in the hinterland. With regards to foreshore characteristics, mainly foreshore elevation and erodibility are important, while differing foreshore width has little additional influence. Already a narrow foreshore reduced flood impact in the flume hinterland. Our findings strengthen the appeal to integrate Nature-based flood protection by foreshores in hybrid flood defences. Grey flood defences can be turned into hybrid flood defences even if there is limited space for foreshore ecosystem restoration, for instance by managed realignment.

The most detrimental effects of waterlogging in plants are hypoxia, decreased nutrient uptake, photosynthesis inhibition, energy crisis, and microbiome alterations, all of which result in plant death. Although significant advancement has been made in mitigating waterlogging stress, it remains largely enigmatic how plants perceive flood signals and translate them for their adaptive responses at a molecular level. With the advent of multiomics, there has been significant progress in understanding and decoding the intricacy of how plants respond to different stressors which have paved the way towards the development of climate-resistant smart crops. In this review, we have provided the overview of the effect of waterlogging in plants, signaling (calcium, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, hormones), and adaptive responses. Secondly, we discussed an insight into past, present, and future prospects of waterlogging tolerance focusing on conventional breeding, transgenic, multiomics, and gene-editing approaches. In addition, we have also highlighted the importance of panomics for developing waterlogging-tolerant cultivars. Furthermore, we have discussed the role of high-throughput phenotyping in the screening of complex waterlogging-tolerant traits. Finally, we addressed the current challenges and future perspectives of waterlogging signal perception and transduction in plants, which warrants future investigation.

The information collected by the author in the database of technological and natural-technological accidents and emergency situations (NTES) occurred in the Russian Federation from 1991 to 2020 is analyzed. The concept of emergency situation is used to collect data. The majority of accidents are caused by debris flows of rain origin. The classification of NTES due to debris flows is proposed based on the type of the infrastructure disrupted and cascading accidents. Eight types of NTES are revealed. Linear structures are most exposed and vulnerable to these impacts. The most affected are facilities of the transport infrastructure, as well as power lines, pipelines, lines of communication, and other lifelines. An average annual frequency of occurrences of these accidents and disruptions was estimated; areas most at risk were identified; seasonal variation of events was investigated. These accidents occur most frequently (once every 2-6 years) in Sakhalin and the North Caucasus debris flow provinces. The proportion of accidents triggered by debris flows in the total number of NTES is relatively small (about 2%); however, they cause the large damage and social problems creating emergency situations not only in the disaster areas but also in other areas connected by damaged linear structures. The majority of accidents occur during the warm season: from May to August in the North Caucasus and from June to October in the Pacific and Eastern regions.

As a result of climate change and global warming, floods are becoming more frequent and unpredictable. Even well-designed bridges are vulnerable to extreme flooding, as recent flood events have demonstrated. Flood fragility curves are developed for an existing RC rail over bridge considering various loading scenarios such as flood level up to the top of the pier, flood level up to the top of the girder, the impact due to log and debris, the effect of providing shear key and the effect due to scouring. The threshold mean flood velocities for the initiation of serviceability limit state for the above flood scenarios are found out. When there is no shear key, the exceedance probability for the deck displacement is found to increase with the flood water level. This increase is found to be about 92% at a particular mean flood velocity of 8.6 m/s, when the floodwater level increases from 3/4th the height of the girder to the full height of the girder. Typical log impact and debris impact increase the vulnerability of the bridge by about 45% and 80%, respectively, for a particular flood velocity of 6.8 m/s and when the flood level is up to the full height of the girder. The fragility of the bridge increases by about 80% for a scour depth of about 1.5 m at a mean flood velocity of 8.6 m/s.

One way to overcome these low-oxygen stresses is via modifying the plant root system to improve internal aeration. Here, we used a comparative RNA-seq based transcriptomic approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of waterlogging-triggered root plasticity in mungbean (Vigna radiata), a major grain legume cultivated in Asia. Two mungbean varieties with contrasting waterlogging tolerance due to the plasticity of the root system architecture were subjected to short-term and long-term waterlogging. Then, RNA-seq was performed. Genes highly expressed in both genotypes under short-term waterlogging are related to glycolysis and fermentation. Under long-term waterlogging, the expression of these genes was less induced in the tolerant variety, suggesting it had effectively adapted to waterlogging via enhancing root plasticity. Remarkably, under short-term waterlogging, the expression of several transcription factors that serve as integrators for ethylene and jasmonic acid signals controlling root stem cell development was highly upregulated only in the tolerant variety. Sequentially, root development-related genes were more expressed in the tolerant variety under long-term waterlogging. Our findings suggest that ethylene and jasmonic acids may contribute to waterlogging-triggered root plasticity by relaying environmental signals to reprogram root regeneration. This research provides the basis for the breeding and genetic engineering of waterlogging-tolerant crops in the future.

As such, paraglacial transition zones in catchments with rapidly retreating glaciers and abundant sediments are key elements in high alpine river systems and promise to be revealing, yet challenging, areas of investigation for the quantification of current and future sediment transport. In this study, we explore the potential of semi-automatic image analysis to detect the extent of the inundation area and corresponding inundation frequency in a proglacial outwash plain (Jamtal valley, Austria) from terrestrial time-lapse imagery. We cumulated all available records of the inundated area from 2018-2020 and analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of flood flows. The approach presented here allows semi-automated monitoring of fundamental hydrological/hydraulic processes in an environment of scarce data. Runoff events and their intensity were quantified and attributed to either pronounced ablation, heavy precipitation, or a combination of both. We detected an increasing degree of channel concentration within the observation period. The maximum inundation from one event alone took up 35% of the analyzed area. About 10% of the observed area presented inundation in 60-70% of the analyzed images. In contrast, 60-70% of the observed area was inundated in less than 10% of the analyzed period. Despite some limitations in terms of image classification, prevailing weather conditions and illumination, the derived inundation frequency maps provide novel insights into the evolution of the proglacial channel network.

Yet, changes in climate are rarely accounted for when selecting hydrological models, which compromises their ability to robustly represent future changes in catchment hydrology. In this paper, we test a simple framework for selecting an ensemble of calibrated hydrological model structures in catchments where contrasting climatic conditions have been observed. We start by considering 78 model structures produced with the FUSE modular modelling framework and rely on a Pareto scheme to select model structures maximizing model efficiency in both wet and dry periods. The application of this approach in three case study basins in Peru enables the identification of structures with good robustness, but also good performance according to hydrological signatures not used for model selection. We also highlight that some model structures that perform well according to traditional efficiency metrics have low performance in contrasting climates or suspicious internal states and fluxes. Importantly, the model selection approach followed here helps to reduce the spread in precipitation elasticities and temperature sensitivities, providing a clearer picture of future hydrological changes. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of using contrasting climatic conditions in a multi-objective framework to produce robust and credible simulations, and to constrain structural uncertainties in hydrological projections.

In recent years, nature-based solutions (NBS) have been proposed to retain storm runoff temporarily and mitigate flood damages. These practices may help rural farm and forest lands to store runoff and reduce flooding on farms and downstream communities and could be incorporated into a conservation program to provide payments for these efforts, which would supplement traditional farm incomes. Despite their potential, there have been very few methodical assessments and detailed summaries of NBS to date. We identified and summarized potential flood reduction practices for the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. These include agricultural practices of (1) cover cropping/no-till farming; (2) hardpan breakup; (3) pine or (4) hardwood afforestation, and (5) agroforestry; establishing the wetland and stream practices of (6) grass and sedge wetlands and earthen retention structures, (7) forest wetland banks, and (8) stream channel restoration; and establishing new structural solutions of (9) dry dams and berms (water farming) and (10) tile drainage and water retention. These practices offer different water holding and storage capacities and costs. A mixture of practices at the farm and landscape level can be implemented for floodwater retention and attenuation and damage reduction, as well as for providing additional farm and forest ecosystem services.

After 2 weeks of its impact, this study conducted a household survey in the central part of Bhubaneswar city (comprising of different wards), where smart-city projects were implemented and ongoing. Survey questions categorized into Social & Human, Financial, Physical, and Smart-city factors and their corresponding indicators were chosen through literature review and some modified based on local conditions. A total of 22 vulnerability and 40 capacity indicators were used to calculate the vulnerability and capacity index. The result indicates that overall capacity overweighs the overall vulnerability in the central part of the city during the Fani cyclone. Specifically, the city was more vulnerable based on Financial factors, whereas more capable and smartly prepared for the cyclone in the context of Social & Human factors, Physical factors, and Smart-city factors. The study indicates the mitigating impact of the smart-city project in the central Bhubaneswar city area and applauds the step taken by the government for preparation during such an extreme event. The realizations of these results will help the government to further improve its disaster management plan with important infrastructural modification highlighted in this study.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of flood events recorded between 1994 and 2018 in the bed elevation changes documented on the major tributaries of Trotu. River (Eastern Carpathians). To this purpose, the data from fifteen gauging stations was used, based on which the evolution trends of channel bed levels were determined for the investigated channel reaches. The role of geomorphic threshold was assigned to stream power. The daily maximum and total values of this parameter were used to explain the bed elevation shifts. The average channel bed deepening rate was 2.2 cm/yr. Depending on the variation trend of channel bed levels, three evolution patterns could be distinguished in relation to the reference year: (i) a category where channel degradation was nearly continuous; (ii) another one where initial aggradation of the channel bed occurred, ensued by continuous degradation, without reverting to the initial state, and (iii) a group with oscillating aggradation-degradation evolution resulting in the eventual recovery of the initial state. The recovery time for changes triggered by major flood events ranged between one and nearly 10 years, whereas in the case of shifts generated by high frequency, low magnitude events, the recovery time was maximum one year. Over short term flood events drive the direction and intensity of channel bed elevation adjustments.

We present a set of simplified indices representative of the characteristics of rainfall-run-off process for evaluating pluvial flood hazard using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The highly urbanised Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in southern China is studied as an example of mapping the regional pluvial flood hazard and assessing the socio-economic exposure at risk. The developed hazard map captures the broad patterns of high flood hazard zones when compared with reported surface water flooding hotspots and the PRD riverine flood map from the 2015 Global Assessment Report. Further analysis on the regional socio-economic profiles suggests that most PRD cities are faced with large flood loss potential, with estimates of approximate 23 million people and 2.4 trillion RMB gross domestic product exposed to high flood hazard. Mega cities Guangzhou and Shenzhen top the ranking with over 20-40% of their dense urban settlements in the high flood hazard zone. This highlights the impact of human activities on the natural surface run-off process, and the need for robust flood hazard assessment for better understanding and design of holistic solutions towards more adequate flood mitigation systems for continuous urbanisation and future climate conditions.

J	Kim, HI; Han, KY				Kim, Hyun Il; Han, Kun Yeun			Linking Hydraulic Modeling with a Machine Learning Approach for Extreme Flood Prediction and Response	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						extreme flooding; DAMBRK; random forest; flood prediction; flood risk estimation	DAM	An emergency action plan (EAP) for reservoirs and urban areas downstream of dams can alleviate damage caused by extreme flooding. An EAP is a disaster action plan that can designate evacuation paths for vulnerable districts. Generally, calculation of dam-break discharge in accordance with dam inflow conditions, calculation of maximum water surface elevation as per hydraulic channel routing, and flood map generation using topographical data are prepared for the purposes of creating an EAP. However, rainfall and flood patterns exhibited in the context of climate change can be extremely diverse. In order to prepare an efficient flood response, techniques should be considered that are capable of generating flood maps promptly while taking dam inflow conditions into account. Therefore, this study aims to propose methodology that is capable of generating flood maps rapidly for any dam inflow conditions. The proposed methodology was performed by linking a dynamic numerical analysis model (DAMBRK) with a random forest regression technique. The previous standard method of drawing flood maps often requires a significant amount of time depending on accuracy and personnel availability; however, the technique proposed here is capable of generating a flood map within one minute. Through use of this methodology, the time taken to prepare flood maps in large-scale water-disaster situations can be reduced. Moreover, methodology for estimating flood risk via use of flood mapping has been proposed. This study would provide assistance in establishing disaster countermeasures that take various flood scenarios into account by promptly providing flood inundation information to disaster-related agencies.

In China, the Grain to Green Program (GTGP) and the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) have had a substantial impact on LULC. We investigate the effect of these conservation efforts on flood peak discharge in two mountainous catchments. We used a series of Landsat images ranging from 1990 to 2016/2017 to evaluate the LULC changes. Further to this, the hydrological responses at the basin and sub-basin scale were generated by the Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) under four LULC scenarios. Between 1990 and 2016/2017, both catchments experienced an increase in forest and urban land by 18% and 2% in Yanhe and by 16% and 8% in Guangyuan, respectively. In contrast, the agricultural land decreased by approximately 30% in Yanhe and 24% in Guangyuan, respectively. The changes in land cover resulted in decrease in flood peak discharge ranging from 14% in Yanhe to 6% in Guangyuan. These findings provide a better understanding on the impact of reforestation induced LULC change on spatial patterns of typical hydrological responses of mountainous catchment and could help to mitigate flash flood hazards in other mountainous regions.

J	Giordano, PF; Prendergast, LJ; Limongelli, MP				Giordano, Pier Francesco; Prendergast, Luke J.; Limongelli, Maria Pina			A framework for assessing the value of information for health monitoring of scoured bridges	JOURNAL OF CIVIL STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING			English	Article						Scour; Structural Health Monitoring; Value of Information; Decision making; Bridge management	FOUNDATION; RADAR	It is generally accepted that climate change is leading to increased frequency of extreme weather events worldwide, and this is placing heavier demands on an already aging infrastructure-network. Bridges are particularly vulnerable infrastructure assets that are prone to damage or failure from climate-related actions. In particular, bridges over waterways can be adversely affected by flooding, specifically the washing away of foundation soils, a mechanism known as scour erosion. Scour is the leading cause of failure for bridges with foundations in water as it can rapidly compromise foundation stiffness often resulting in unacceptable movements or even collapse. There is growing interest among asset managers in applying health monitoring approaches to assess the real-time performance of bridges under damaging actions, including scour. Sensor-based approaches involve the acquisition of data such as dynamic measurements, which can be used to infer the existence of scour or other damage without the laborious requirements of undertaking visual inspections. In this paper, a framework is proposed to assess the benefit obtained from health monitoring systems as compared to the scenario where no monitoring system is employed on a bridge, to ascertain how useful these systems are at assisting decision-making. Decisions typically relate to the implementation of traffic restrictions or even partial or complete bridge closure in the event of damage being detected, which has associated consequences for a network. A case study is presented to demonstrate the approach postulated in this paper.

An ensemble approach was then implemented to predict hazard probabilities using the best machine learning algorithms (boosted regression tree, multivariate adaptive regression spline, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model) based on a receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) assessment. The algorithms were all trained and tested on 92 randomly selected points, information from a flood inundation survey, and geospatial predictor variables (precipitation, land use, elevation, slope percent, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, and depth to groundwater). The ensemble model had 0.925 and 0.892 accuracy for training and testing data, respectively. We then created a vulnerability map from data on building density, building age, population density, and socio-economic conditions and assessed risk as a product of hazard and vulnerability. The results indicated that distance to channel, land use, and runoff generation were the most important factors associated with flood hazard, while population density and building density were the most important factors determining vulnerability. Areas of highest and lowest flood risks were identified, leading to recommendations on where to implement flood risk reduction measures to guide flood governance in Amol city.

Connor			The decision game: a serious game approach to understanding environmental risk management decisions	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						Flood risk; household decision making; serious games	FLOOD INSURANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DETERMINANTS; WILLINGNESS; PREFERENCES; SIMULATION; MITIGATION; BEHAVIOR; DEMAND	Here we describe the implementation of an experimental research tool called the Decision Game that we used to collect data on household flood risk management decisions. Participants using this tool play an interactive game that involves making household decisions about place of residence and a variety of household expenditures, including spending on flood insurance and private flood risk mitigation. Participants also answer survey questions before and after playing the game; the pre-game survey collected demographic information, and the post-game survey collected information about participant experiences with flooding and flood mitigation. Online and face-to-face participants showed similar engagement with the experiment, and most participants appeared to have made deliberate and considered decisions about risk mitigation. Online study participants had similar responses to those who participated in person, although face-to-face participants seemed slightly more likely to mitigate against risk. Overall, participants in this research were younger, more educated and more likely to rent a home than the average Canadian. Serious games may be useful for augmenting existing data gathering strategies used in understanding environmental decision making, particularly for rare catastrophic events for which stated preference surveys may be less informative. Serious games allow for sharing a mixture of information with study participants, including maps, video clips, text and even immersive 3D experiences, and can be administered online to increase participation levels. Future research will consider longer duration online experiments and more immersive interaction frameworks.	[Yiannakoulias, Niko; Gordon, Julien N.; Darlington, J.

Integrating different approaches in the analyses of structure and diversity in these forests can provide complementary information on non-spatial, spatial and functional diversity patterns. The study aimed at evaluating the spatio-temporal dynamics in forest structure and diversity in a semi-natural mixed oak-hornbeam floodplain forest. All standing trees were mapped and inventoried in 1995, 2005 and 2016 in three 1-ha mixed forest stands, with different soil moisture regime (xeric, mesic, moist conditions). Traditional, non-spatial structure and diversity measures were coupled with spatially-explicit and functional diversity measures. Results indicated that the three stands showed limited variation in stand structure and similar non-spatial diversity attributes, despite the different species composition. Only the extension to spatial and functional analyses was able to reveal more pronounced differences of diversity patterns, as higher complexity, species mingling, and functional tree complementarity was observed in the moister stand. These findings support use of spatially-explicit measurements in traditional inventory measurement protocols to allow more refined analysis of diversity patterns. On the other hand, functional diversity can be easily implemented in diversity analyses, as it requires species abundance information (which is traditionally collected in forest inventory) and species-specific tree traits which can be inferred from literature.

This creates a challenge for effective communication, which must consider how people perceive that uncertainty. Thus, we conducted twenty-five mental model interviews in Aotearoa New Zealand with participants ranging from scientists to policy writers and emergency managers, and through to the public. The interviews included three phases: an initial elicitation of free thoughts about uncertainty, a mental model mapping activity, and a semi-structured interview protocol to explore further questions about scientific processes and their personal philosophy of science. Qualitative analysis led to the construction of key themes, including: (a) understanding that, in addition to data sources, the 'actors' involved can also be sources of uncertainty; (b) acknowledging that factors such as governance and funding decisions partly determine uncertainty; (c) the influence of assumptions about expected human behaviours contributing to "known unknowns'; and (d) the difficulty of defining what uncertainty actually is. Participants additionally highlighted the positive role of uncertainty for promoting debate and as a catalyst for further inquiry. They also demonstrated a level of comfort with uncertainty and advocated for 'sitting with uncertainty' for transparent reporting in advice. Additional influences included: an individual's understanding of societal factors; the role of emotions; using outcomes as a scaffold for interpretation; and the complex and noisy communications landscape. Each of these require further investigation to enhance the communication of scientific uncertainty.	[Doyle, Emma E.

J	van der Sleen, P; Rams, M				van der Sleen, Peter; Rams, Maartje			Flood pulses and fish species coexistence in tropical rivers - a theoretical food web model	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Floodplains; Tropical rivers; Freshwater fish diversity; Competitive exclusion; Species coexistence	NICHE BREADTH; AMAZON; ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY; PREDATION; FAUNA; PREY; BIODIVERSITY; CANNIBALISM; MAINTENANCE	Freshwater fish diversity reaches its zenith in large tropical rivers. Although the origins of this diversity have been relatively well studied, the mechanisms that maintain high fish diversity in tropical rivers remain largely unknown. It has been hypothesized that the annual flood pulse, a perennial feature of many lowland rivers in the tropics, reduces competitive exclusion and consequently promotes species coexistence. During the high-water season, superabundant allochthonous resources and relatively low fish density may reduce intra- and interspecific competition. During the low-water season on the other hand, resource availability is low and predation pressure high, offsetting competitive differences between species and controlling fish population sizes. Here, we tested the potential role of these mechanisms for species coexistence using a food web model where fish species exhibit strong differences in competition strength and compete for finite resources. We simulated fish interactions when a regular flood pulse was either present or absent. We found that extinction rates in the simulations without an annual flood pulse were consistently higher when compared to those with a flood pulse, indicating more species could coexist when a regular annual flood pulse is present. If the flood pulse is a relevant mechanism for fish species coexistence, as our model results suggest, then flood pulse changes could result in species extinctions and lower fish diversity. Deforestation, climate change, and the construction of large hydropower dams are current drivers of hydrological change across the tropics, increasing the urgency to understand the role of natural flooding regimes for the maintenance of tropical freshwater fish diversity.

Monitoring large-scale and long-term river extent dynamics provides fundamental insights relevant to the impact of climatic factors and anthropogenic activities on fluvial geomorphology. This study analyzed the two most populous rivers, Ganga and Mekong, to understand the river extent dynamics using 32 years of Landsat satellite data (1990-2022) in a cloud computing platform. This study categorizes river dynamics and transitions using the combination of pixel-wise water frequency and temporal trends. This approach can demarcate the river channel stability, areas affected by erosion and sedimentation, and the seasonal transitions in the river. The results illustrate that the Ganga river channel is found to be relatively unstable and very prone to meandering and migration as almost 40 % of the river channel has been altered in the past 32 years. The seasonal transitions, such as lost seasonal and seasonal to permanent changes are more prominent in the Ganga river, and the dominance of meandering and sedimentation in the lower course is also illustrated. In contrast, the Mekong river has a more stable course with erosion and sedimentation observed at sparse locations in the lower course. However, the lost seasonal and seasonal to permanent changes are also dominant in the Mekong river. Since 1990, Ganga and Mekong rivers have lost approximately 13.3 % and 4.7 % of their seasonal water respectively, as compared to the other transitions and categories. Factors such as climate change, floods, and man-made reservoirs could all be critical in triggering these morphological changes.
