Large interannual variability in precipitation extremes have led to city-wide flooding in numerous occasions, threatening the population and city infrastructure. A special steering committee was appointed to coordinate an integrated coastal management plan within the three levels of government (federal, state and municipal) and to review the legal framework for water management. The municipal administration designed the blueprint for the project and an associated environmental education campaign. A pluvial drainage system was built to separate pluvial from domestic wastewater. Moreover, the wastewater drainage system was strengthened, and the city water treatment plants improved. As a result, water quality in the coastal zone improved and the city of San Francisco de Campeche was able to build its plan for adaptation to extreme rain events, which are increasingly frequent due to climate change.

Given the continuous nature of this variable, the aim of this paper was to introduce functional regression for the air-stream temperature relation, being capable to model an entire seasonal or annual curve of temperatures as one entity, rather than multiple daily or weekly values in classical models. Three types of functional models were explored in the study and compared to two classical models (Generalized Additive Model and Logistic Model) for six rivers from the United States The results show the functional models have the best performance for all the considered rivers. When comparing functional models between them, one variant of the historical functional model performs better than the two other models and is the most parsimonious. Functional regression leads to encouraging results to model the complete annual stream temperature curve as one entity compared to other classical approaches.

With the purpose of understanding what factors determine flash flood risk perception, a questionnaire entitled Flash Flood Hazard Perception in Cape Verde was applied to 199 subjects. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to identify the primary factors associated with the perception of flash flood risk. Differences between different groups under the same impact factor were also compared. The results indicated that certain socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents (gender, level of education, and type of housing) and prior experience correlated with flash flood risk perception. The study also shows statistical differences between the groups. In general, males and the respondents with a high level of education, homeowners, and people with prior experience have better perception of the flash flood risk. These findings can help decision makers to improve effective flash flood risk communication policies and flood risk reduction strategies.

Unfortunately, the UHC of Pakistani cities does not remain eco-friendly. Pakistan lies within the influential area of the world's largest monsoon weather system. Cities like Lahore are simultaneously vulnerable to urban flooding and water scarcity due to extreme climate change events. Therefore, Pakistan's urban areas require Urban Water Infrastructural Transformation (UWIT), which can be achieved by identifying suitable Rainwater and Stormwater Harvesting Potential Sites (RSHPS). In this study, we conducted the spatial analysis to identify these RSHPS within Lahore city for 2020, utilizing the World View Water Index (WV-WI). The results show that there are 85.54 km(2) areas for RSRHPS in Lahore. Therefore, this study will serve as a snapshot for policymakers to simultaneously control the menace of water shortage and urban flooding.

However, whether climate warming will amplify or diminish the impact of extreme flooding on wetland ecosystems is unknown. Here, we show that climate warming significantly reduced wetland resistance and resilience to a severe flooding event via a 6-year warming experiment. We first found that warming rapidly altered plant community structure by increasing the dominance of low-canopy species. Then, we showed that warming reduced the resistance and resilience of vegetation productivity to a 72-cm flooding event. Last, we detected slower post-flooding carbon processes, such as gross ecosystem productivity, soil respiration, and soil methane emission, under the warming treatment. Our results demonstrate how severe flooding can destabilize wetland vegetation structure and ecosystem function under climate warming. These findings indicate an enhanced footprint of extreme hydrological events in wetland ecosystems in a warmer climate.

The changes, however, often differ from the theorized expectation of increases in water-holding capacity of the atmosphere in the warmer conditions, especially when water availability is limited. Here, the relationships of changes in extreme precipitation and flood intensities for the end of the twenty-first century with spatial and seasonal water availability are quantified. Results show an intensification of extreme precipitation and flood events over all climate regions which increases as water availability increases from wet to dry regions. Similarly, there is an increase in the intensification of extreme precipitation and flood with the seasonal cycle of water availability. The connection between extreme precipitation and flood intensity changes and spatial and seasonal water availability becomes stronger as events become less extreme.

Closure of flooded roads causes employee absences and delays, creating cascading impacts to communities. We integrate a traffic model with flood maps that represent potential combinations of storm surges, tides, seasonal cycles, interannual anomalies driven by large-scale climate variability such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, and sea level rise. When identifying inundated roads, we propose corrections for potential biases arising from model integration. Our results for the San Francisco Bay Area show that employee absences are limited to the homes and workplaces within the areas of inundation, while delays propagate far inland. Communities with limited availability of alternate roads experience long delays irrespective of their proximity to the areas of inundation. We show that metric reach, a measure of road network density, is a better proxy for delays than flood exposure.

A Finite Volume Community Ocean Model implementation for the South China Sea and the Pearl River Delta is used to understand how future SLR, tides, and typhoon storm surges will interact and affect coastal inundation. The SLR signal and extreme surge levels provide the major contributions to flooding; however, amplification of tides could exceed 0.5 m for 2.1 m SLR and should be considered when planning future coastal defences. On the other hand, if typhoons like Hato or Mangkhut, the latest and strongest ones hitting the area, were to happen in the future, a surge level reduction up to 0.5 m could be expected in coastal areas.

The gaming application is integrated into the Iowa Watershed Decision Support System (IoWaDSS) designed to serve as a comprehensive multi-sectoral data repository along with the simulation results of process modeling to educate and inform communities on the status of their watersheds during extreme conditions. The interactive serious gaming application was devised to encourage public engagement, facilitate communication and positive relationship between watershed communities, and make the decision process more attractive and transparent for the stakeholders.

Extreme waves are assessed from a wave reanalysis that are propagated from deep waters to the beach considering the hydrodynamic processes and taking into account the interaction between waves and the coastal elevation within the study area. First, we consider present sea level, storm surges and waves affecting the area. Next, we analyze the effect of sea level rise according to a moderate (RCP4.5) climate change scenario for the 21st century (years 2025, 2050, 2075, and 2100). The most pessimistic scenario (year 2100) yields a percentage of flooded area of 97.2%, thus revealing the major threat that represents sea level rise for coastal areas in the Caribbean Sea.

The apparent increased frequency and magnitudes of such events led us to question whether this is just coincidence or whether we are witnessing a regime shift in tropical cyclone flooding and associated ecosystem impacts. Examination of continuous rainfall records for coastal NC since 1898 reveals a period of unprecedentedly high precipitation since the late-1990's, and a trend toward increasingly high precipitation associated with tropical cyclones over the last 120 years. We posit that this trend, which is consistent with observations elsewhere, represents a recent regime shift with major ramifications for hydrology, carbon and nutrient cycling, water and habitat quality and resourcefulness of Mid-Atlantic and possibly other USA coastal regions.

The nonlinear artificial intelligence can be reasonably applied in the analysis of the simulations, because the human-brain mimicking algorithm can show the practicable results. Basically, the quantifications in the study results are based on the randomly generated numbers where the Monte Carlo methods are applied. The Boolean numbers are generated in the variable constructions. Furthermore, there are multiplications in population which are decided by the expert judgments. The causes loops for CO2 and temperature are obtained. In addition, there is the result of variable albedo vs. normalised temperature with dimensionless values. Global collaboration can prepare and control the global warming as the geological scale aspect as well as the collaborated idea utilisation that can develop the carbon minimising technology and green energy development.

Prolonged flooding and droughts, driven by erratic weather patterns, have significantly elevated the risk of food scarcity. Floods, in particular, have been responsible for severe crop losses, raising concerns about increasing import costs if this issue is not mitigated. Africa is actively working to mitigate the impacts of flooding and enhance food security, although progress has been gradual. Developing flood-resilient varieties is a promising strategy to address this challenge. We explored various flood types common in the region and observed a scarcity of research on flood-resilient varieties, particularly those adapted for anaerobic germination and stagnant flooding. Conversely, varieties bred for flash flooding, such as FARO 66 and FARO 67, have seen limited distribution, primarily confined to a few West African countries, falling short of the intended impact. In contrast, deepwater tolerance research dates back to the early 1900s, but commercialization of the varieties remains limited, with scarce information regarding their cultivation, coverage, and performance. Newly developed varieties, such as Kolondieba 2 and Kadia 24, have received less attention, leaving many farmers dependent on locally adapted cultivars specific to particular areas. Remarkably, despite the limited information, both released and local stress-tolerant cultivars exhibit substantial survival rates and yield advantages. For instance, FARO 66 and FARO 67 have demonstrated 1-3 t/ha yield advantages over recurrent parents under flooding stress. Nonetheless, further efforts are required to address various forms of flooding. To this end, AfricaRice collaborates with National Rice Development Strategies, IRRI, and other partners to promote research and development. While improved flood-tolerant varieties remain limited in scope across Africa, the financial gains for farmers are significant when compared to susceptible cultivars. As the continent's population continues to grow rapidly, there is untapped potential in African germplasms, making ongoing research and breeding strategies essential. Therefore, this review highlights the importance of intensifying efforts in screening and identifying flood-tolerant rice. Furthermore, it underscores the value of utilizing traditional flood-resilient cultivars in breeding to enhance the productivity of widely distributed and cultivated varieties.

It is, however, often limited by a lack of long record of observational data to provide a basis for understanding the long-term behavior of the climate system. Integrating reconstructed data and (global climate and hydrological) model simulations will help us to better understand the variability of climate and hydrology over timescales ranging from decades to centuries. In this study, we proposed an integrated approach to study flood variability in the upper reach of the Yangtze River over the last millennium to the end of the 21st century. To accomplish this, we first drove hydrological models using the precipitation and temperature from four Global Climate Models (GCM), BCC-CSM1.1, MIROC, MRI-CGCM3, and CCSM4, to simulate daily discharge for the upper reach of the Yangtze River during the period of the last millennium (850-1849), historical period (1850-2005), and a future period (2006-2099). Then, we evaluated whether the modeled precipitation, temperature, and extreme discharge had statistical properties similar to those shown in the documented dry-wet periods, temperature anomalies, and paleoflood records. Finally, we explored the extreme discharge variability using model simulations. The results indicate that: (1) The MIROC-ESM model, differing from the other three GCM models, revealed positive temperature changes from the warm period (Medieval Climate Anomaly; MCA) to the cold period (Little Ice Age; LIA), while the temperature variability of the other models was similar to the records. (2) The BCC-CSM1.1 model performed better than the others regarding correlations between modeled precipitation and documented dry-wet periods. (3) Over most of the subbasins in the upper Yangtze River, the magnitude of extreme discharge in the BCC-CSM1.1 model results showed that there was a decrease from the MCA to the LIA period and an increase in the historical period relative to the cold period, while a future increase was projected by the four GCMs under the influence of climate change.

Dynamic disequilibrium: Recent widespread increases in vegetation cover on subarctic floodplains of Interior Alaska	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Alaska; boreal forest; climate change; disturbance; floodplain; riparian zone; subarctic; succession	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; SHRUB EXPANSION; HEADWATER STREAMS; RIVER DISCHARGE; TANANA RIVER; BOREAL; TUNDRA; WATER; TEMPERATURE	Boreal forest and tundra ecosystems are undergoing rapid climatic and environmental changes with consequences for ecosystem structure, function, and services. Although riparian zones occupy a small footprint within subarctic landscapes, they have disproportionately high value as foci of hydrological processes, biogeochemical cycling, ecological disturbance, biodiversity, and wildlife activity. Recent observations of increased winter discharge, reduced peak flows, and increased connectivity between catchments, streams, and groundwater in subarctic riparian zones have prompted predictions of altered riverine disturbance regimes, increased channelization, and a decline in the extent of active floodplains. However, few observational data exist concerning the spatiotemporal dynamics of subarctic floodplain vegetation, which can serve as a bioindicator to corroborate such predictions. We analyzed the distribution and extent of riparian ecotypes across a network of streams in 12 Interior Alaska watersheds using high-resolution image pairs from circa 1981-2010. All stream reaches encompassed pronounced elevational gradients and included elevational forest-tundra ecotones. We classified riparian ecotypes using an image-based point-intercept sampling approach, calculated the probability of ecotype transitions, and evaluated relationships between ecotype transitions and environmental covariates. Our results reveal widespread increases in the stature, density, and extent of riparian vegetation spanning gradients of elevation, floodplain morphology, and climate. Ecotype transitions occurred at > 20% of sample points, and there was a strong imbalance toward forward successional transitions (16.5%) versus backward transitions (4.0%). That is, we observed a strong tendency toward increasing cover, stature, and density of vegetation communities across our extensive sampling domain across our approximately 30-year sample period. This relatively rapid riparian "greening " signal tended to be most pronounced in our glaciated watersheds. Although the streams we studied displayed high local variability in ecotype transitions, our results support hypotheses of increasing channelization and reduced extent of unvegetated surfaces on subarctic floodplains. They also likely reflect a trend toward more rapid and extensive plant recruitment and growth due to processes associated with conspicuous warming in northern ecosystems, consistent with greening documented in other subarctic landscape segments along gradients of elevation and latitude.

Assessment of compound flooding through seamless linkage of coastal hydrodynamic and inland catchment models	JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Compound flooding; Resiliency visualisation platform; Storm surge; Pluvial flooding; Community flood resiliency	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; STORM-SURGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; LAND-USE; IMPACT; RESILIENCE; URBANIZATION; RISK; INUNDATION	Compound flooding refers to the complex interactions among oceanographic, inland (catchment) hydrological, and meteorological processes with anthropogenic factors such as land use changes due to urbanization. To-wit, the impact of higher tide levels, storm surge, and high intensity rainfall events over the inland catchment collectively may result in more extensive flooding than the individual processes acting separately. In the context of climate change and more frequent extreme weather events, coastal cities, particularly those in the ASEAN region, are increasingly vulnerable to compound flooding, yet there is no convenient and user-friendly modelling approach available that would enable the planning community and decision-makers to envision compound flooding as part of resiliency-oriented urban plan development. We addressed this gap by developing the3D Resiliency Visualisation Platform (3DRVP), within which linked features are established using Python scripts to seamless integrate a 2D mixed land use fluvial/pluvial catchment model (PCSWMM) with a 2D/3D coastal hydrodynamic model (Delft3D) to simulate the dynamics of compound floods for the assessment of coastal inundation. This platform aims to assist planners, urban design professionals, and engineers with a realistic visualization tool to picture the urban infrastructure planning alternatives as well as to facilitate the real-time operational decision-making and evacuation activation with flood control strategies. The integrated platform theory is developed first and the platform then is trialled for a developing coastal area in south Bangkok, Thailand. Similar to many cities of the global south, data availability to calibrate models is limited and as such we used a mixed methods approach to explore model accuracy. The Delft3D model was calibrated successfully using water level data from a nearby gauge in the Gulf of Thailand for Typhoon Linda. The catchment model (PCSWMM) was validated using observed flood areas as reported by the local municipality. A 100-year design rainstorm was subsequently modelled and linked with the Typhoon Linda surge levels with results indicating the combination of rainfall flooding and storm surge would increase the flooded area by 25.6% over the system components modelled individually.

Impact of floods on undernutrition among children under five years of age in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Review						Flood; Climate change; Undernutrition; Nutrition; Stunting; Wasting; Underweight; Micronutrient deficiency	WORLD-HEALTH-ORGANIZATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; COMMUNITY; GROWTH; MALNUTRITION; BANGLADESH; INFANTS; DHAKA	Background Weather and climate-related disasters, including floods, impact undernutrition through multiple pathways, including food security, inadequate child care practices, and water and sanitation. This review aimed to provide systematic evidence of the impact of floods on undernutrition in children under five years of age in Low and Middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Scopus for peer-reviewed articles. Popline, WHO Library database (WHOLIS), the International Disaster database (EM-DAT), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), UNICEF and Eldis were searched for grey literature articles. Database searches were first conducted in 2016 and updated in 2020. We included English language articles that reported the effect of floods on undernutrition outcomes in children under 5 years of age in LMICs, without limitation to study design and year of publication. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results Of the 5701 articles identified, 14 met our inclusion criteria. The review noted stunting as the most frequently reported significant form of undernutrition in flood-affected areas. Severe and recurrent floods showed the greatest impact on undernutrition. Due to weak and limited evidence, the study is inconclusive on the most significant forms within the short-term and intermediate periods following floods. On the other hand, stunting was noted as the most frequently reported significant form of undernutrition in the long-term period following floods. There was generally little evidence of the effect of floods on micronutrient deficiencies. Factors associated with child undernutrition in the flood-affected areas included age, gender, diarrhoea, maternal and paternal education, maternal age, household size, land ownership and socioeconomic status. Overall, the quality of the evidence was fairly weak, with the main challenge lying in the inability of the studies to establish causal pathways for the observed effects. Conclusions The review suggests clear plans and strategies for preventing and reducing the long-term impact of floods on undernutrition in children under five years. Future research utilising long-term prospective data is indispensable to provide more robust evidence to guide better prevention measures, response decisions and interventions.

The Okavango Delta's waterbirds-Trends and threatening processes	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Africa; Botswana; Citizen science; Conservation	EGRET EGRETTA-VINACEIGULA; CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA; GREAT BLUE HERONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TOURISM DEVELOPMENT; RIVER; CONSERVATION; STORKS; ECOSYSTEM; IMPACTS	The Okavango Delta is renowned as an extraordinary ecosystem of high biodiversity, listed as both a Ramsar and World Heritage Site, with part protected in the Moremi Game Reserve. This extensive floodplain ecosystem has 444 recorded bird species, with just under a quarter of these waterbirds, including at least 16 breeding and 4 threatened (1 endangered, 3 vulnerable) species. Despite the global importance of this ecosystem, and its transboundary nature, there are surprisingly few long-term assessments of status of the ecosystem or waterbird communities, a key indicator of ecosystem health, with threats such as upstream water extraction, and climate change threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We compiled a comprehensive 53-year dataset comprised of citizen science and other datasets (1970-2019), on 36 waterbird species (Anhingidae, Ardeidae, Ciconiidae, Gruidae, Pelecanidae, Phalacrocoracidae, and Phoenicopteridae), including eight waterbird breeding colonies in the Okavango Delta. We investigated trends in waterbird biodiversity as well as responses to temperature, flow, flooding, and local rainfall. Waterbird breeding colonies were associated with relatively high areas of riparian woodland, and experienced moderate flooding frequencies (> 1 in 5 years). Total abundance of all 36 waterbird species was positively related to river flows. Despite increased citizen science effort over time, total abundance within the Okavango Delta significantly declined with declining average inundation. Four species led these declines (African darter Anhinga rufa, green-backed heron Butorides striata, slaty egret Egretta vinaceigula, squacco heron Ardeola ralloides) and one marabou stork Leptoptilos crumenifer, increasing (only sufficient data to analyse 15 species individually). Decreased inundation within the Delta and other internal factors (urbanisation, tourism, vegetation change) as well as external factors (habitat loss elsewhere) are likely driving these declines. Rigorous monitoring of waterbirds, including the eight breeding colonies across the Delta, is needed to explore these changes closely, providing baselines in the case of water resource developments on the rivers supplying the Okavango Delta. Long-term conservation of the magnificent Okavango Delta and its dependent biodiversity, including its waterbirds, is highly reliant on protection of river flows in three countries to ensure natural flooding regimes, alongside the conservation of neighbouring wetlands.

Vulnerability to sea-level rise and the potential for restoration to enhance blue carbon storage in salt marshes of an urban estuary	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Sea-level affecting marshes model; Tidal marsh; Carbon storage; Spartina maritima; Salt pan; South Africa	SEDIMENT DEPOSITION; SWARTKOPS ESTUARY; ACCRETION RATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL; WETLAND; VEGETATION; URBANIZATION; COMMUNITIES; RESILIENCE	Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to 'coastal squeeze' and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial.

J	Liu, WW; Sun, WW; Huang, JF; Wen, HY; Huang, R				Liu, Weiwei; Sun, Weiwei; Huang, Jingfeng; Wen, Huayang; Huang, Ran			Excessive Rainfall Is the Key Meteorological Limiting Factor for Winter Wheat Yield in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						extreme climate; extreme rainfall; winter wheat production	EXTREME HEAT; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; STRESS; FLOOD; US	In the era of global climate change, extreme weather events frequently occur. Many kinds of agro-meteorological disasters that are closely related to environmental conditions (such as sunshine hours, temperature, precipitation, etc.) are witnessed all over the word. However, which factor dominates winter wheat production in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River remains unresolved. Quantifying the key limiting meteorological factor could deepen our understanding of the impact of climate change on crops and then help us to formulate disaster prevention and mitigation measures. However, the relative role of precipitation, sunshine hours and maximum daily temperature in limiting winter wheat yield in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is not clear and difficult to decouple. In this study, we used statistical methods to quantify the effect of precipitation, maximum temperature and sunshine hours extremes on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield based on long time-series, county-level yield data and a daily meteorological dataset. According to the winter wheat growing season period (October of the sowing year to May of the following year), anomaly values of cumulative precipitation, average sunshine hours and average daily maximum temperature are calculated. With the range of -3 sigma to 3 sigma of anomaly and an interval of 0.5 sigma (sigma is the corresponding standard deviation of cumulative precipitation, mean maximum temperature and mean sunshine hours, respectively), the corresponding weighted yield loss ratio (WYLR) represents the impact of this kind of climate condition on yield. The results show that excessive rainfall is the key limiting meteorological factor that can reduce winter wheat yield to -18.4% in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, while it is only -0.24% in extreme dry conditions. Moreover, yield loss under extreme temperature and sunshine hours are negligible (-0.66% for extremely long sunshine hours and -8.29% for extreme cold). More detailed analysis results show that the impact of excessive rainfall on winter wheat yield varies regionally, as it causes severe yield reductions in the Huai River basin and the middle to southern part with low elevation and rainy areas of the study area, while for drier areas in the Hubei province, there is even an increase in yield. Our results disclosed with observational evidence that excessive precipitation is the key meteorological limiting factor leading to the reduction in winter wheat yield in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The knowledge of the possible impact of climate change on winter wheat yield in the study area allows policy-makers, agronomists and economists to better forecast a plan that differs from the past. In addition, our results emphasized the need for better understanding and further process-based model simulation of the excessive rainfall impact on crop yield.

Flood disturbance mediates the strength of stream trophic cascades caused by trout	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS			English	Article							TOP-DOWN; FOOD-WEB; IMPACTS; INVERTEBRATES; BIODIVERSITY; TERRESTRIAL; FISH	Trophic cascades are important features of aquatic ecosystems, but much variation in their strength remains unexplained. Disturbance could restrict cascade occurrence by limiting predator distribution, and increase cascade strength by lowering defended herbivore abundance. These possibilities were investigated in 20 New Zealand rivers varying both in flooding disturbance (measured by bed movement) and presence of nonnative predatory trout. Trout were often, but not always, associated with indirectly increasing algal abundance compared to similar rivers with native galaxiid fishes. Floods explained variation in cascades by (1) resetting algal abundance such that algal minima were related to bed movement; (2) preventing occurrence by restricting trout abundance in the most disturbed rivers; and (3) increasing potential cascade strength by removing defended herbivores. These observations indicate strong nonlinear influences of disturbance on both trophic cascade occurrence and maximum strength which will be important to consider as climate change alters disturbance regimes.

Today, we are living in a period of great upheaval marked by climate change, armed conflicts, massive population displacement, and a pandemic that radically exacerbates existing disparities and inequalities. The Petite Auto Rouge series uses as a common thread a little red car - a symbol of our presence on earth, of our guilty conscience and our powerlessness in the face of the forces that we have unleashed, in particular the harmful disruptions that we have caused to our environment over the last 50 years. The little red car is placed at the foot of a raging forest fire, on a seaside road threatened by destructive storms, under a huge tree toppled over by violent winds, partially submerged on a flooded highway that a mother has to cross carrying her daughter, under the rubble of a city half destroyed by war, and on an empty street of a large city that seems to be asleep, owing to the pandemic.											0	0	0	0	0	QUEENS QUARTERLY	KINGSTON	QUEENS UNIV, KINGSTON, ON K7L 3N6, CANADA	0033-6041			QUEENS QUART	Queens Q.

However, these effects have not previously been studied in the context of the specific characteristics of fast-growing urban areas in developing countries, which are generally unregulated. This study quantifies the effects of urban development on runoff, including: a) runoff volumes, b) base flow volumes and c) flood peaks from eight South African catchments using the Mann-Kendall test and Kendall's tau. Both total runoff and base flow volumes are found to increase with increased development levels and possible reasons for this are discussed. The flood peak analysis finds statistically insignificant trends in most catchments. However, there is an increasing trend in the catchment with the highest proportion of informal development. Recommendations are made for further investigation into reasons for the findings.

These areas, as the meeting points of land and sea, face significant risks of flooding due to the ongoing rise in sea levels caused by climate change. Additionally, they are susceptible to extreme events like king tides and large waves in the future. This paper introduces a framework for estimating the extreme total water level (TWL) by considering the effects of regional sea level rise (RSLR) resulting from a warming climate under RCP 8.5. It also incorporates the contributions of high tides, 100-year storm surge, and 100-year wave setup and run-up. The proposed framework is utilized to evaluate the occurrence of extreme coastal flooding along the Persian Gulf coast of Iran, an area that is home to significant industries in the country. The results offer an estimated increase of RSLR by 0.23 m from 2020 to 2050 considering an ensemble of climate model projections. Extreme wave setup values are estimated to range between 0.19 and 0.66 m, while storm surge is projected to vary from 0.4 to 1.44 m across the studied coastline. These together yield in a projected extreme TWL along the coastline within the range of 3.18 and 3.90 m above the current sea level. This significant increase in sea level could lead to the inundation of approximately 513 km2 of low-lying coastal land, which accounts for about 16% of the studied domain and could pose serious flooding threat to the people and their assets in this region. Finally, relative ranking of flooded zones (i.e., 6 zones) helps determine the areas with higher chance of flood exposure, at which investment in flood mitigation measures should be prioritized.

The expansion of these lakes under the influence of global warming further poses a grievous risk of natural disasters in the form of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) that necessitates regular monitoring to reduce and mitigate its implications. This research focuses on the regional scale distribution and evolution of glacial lakes in the Himalayan mountain range with their causes. We used Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and operational land imager (OLI) images, Google Earth imageries, Shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model, and Aphrodite climatic data to study lake evolution and its controlling parameters. A total of the 5,409 glacial lakes was taken for the size expansion analysis, which excludes supraglacial lakes. An expansion rate of 2.98%/yr and 1.01%/yr in glacial lakes number and size was found from 1990 to 2020, respectively. The glacial lakes are distributed mainly in Langtang, Bhutan, Sikkim and Everest region; while, new lakes are forming at higher elevations continuously. The highest lake size expansion was noted in 2015-2020 (36.51%) followed by 2000-2010 (21.72%) and 2010-2015 (10.65%), while 1990-2000 (3.36%) showed a lowest expansion rate. The highest expansion rate was noticed near an elevation band of 5000-5500 m. Moreover, lakes in the central and eastern Himalaya are highly decrease by climatic change, i.e., increase in temperature a decrease precipitation. The feature selection algorithm was used to identify the importance of various controlling parameters, which showed temperature change rate, glacier fed lake, glacier snout steepness, proximal distance, glacier calving frontal width, precipitation change rate and lake type gave higher weightage towards lake size change.

Back to the surface - Daylighting urban streams in a Global North-South comparison	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Review						buried rivers; decision support system; ecology; restoration; urban planning and design	FLOOD RISK PERCEPTION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; RESTORATION; TERRESTRIAL; MANAGEMENT; HYDROLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; SEWERS	Many urban streams have vanished from the surface as a collateral effect of urban growth. Often, these buried streams have been forgotten, and only street names remind us of their existence. Reasons for stream burial include the gain of space for road or house construction or the use of stream water to transport wastewater. Today, restoration efforts to bring back fully canalized streams to the surface and to restore their stream bed (so-called daylighting) are being increasingly integrated into urban blue-green space planning, recognizing the high ecological and social value of urban streams, especially to support resilience against climate change impacts in cities. In this paper, we briefly revise the impacts of stream burial, present a series of case studies of daylighting from Europe (France, Switzerland, and Germany), and compare them with case studies from Asia (China, India, Taiwan). We found that high real estate prices, limited buffer riparian zone and resistance by the inhabitants were the greatest obstacles to stream daylighting projects. In contrast, economic gains from separating wastewater from rainwater and revival of cultural linkages with water were the strongest drivers to restore these streams. We then present methods on how to identify buried streams as candidates for daylighting and deliver criteria to select the most promising candidates. Acknowledging that each restoration project requires to be adapted to the local biophysical and local setting, we deliver a preliminary decision support system and a guideline for identifying the best candidate streams for daylighting projects, including the arguments in favor of restoration, the caveats, the social processes of decision-making, and perspectives for the integration of stream daylighting into urban climate change mitigation and adaptation concepts, in a Global North-South comparison.

Measuring community flood resilience and associated factors in rural Malawi	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; disaster policy; flooding; Malawi; resilience; resilience measurement	DISASTER RESILIENCE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; WATER; RISK; COEFFICIENT; RELIABILITY	With global estimates showing an increasing trend in flooding and its adverse effects on communities and population health, resilience is presented as a concept with potential to help integrate disaster risk management, sustainable development, and climate change adaptation concerns. Resilience research and practice have conceptual and empirical challenges of how to understand, characterize and measure resilience, particularly at community level. Using a multidimensional framework, this paper takes a systems approach to understanding, characterizing, and measuring community flood resilience. Through cluster analysis, bivariate methods and multivariable-adjusted binary logistic regression modeling, we developed a context and hazard specific construct of community flood resilience and investigated its predictor variables. The factors defining the community flood resilience construct captured the community needs to withstand disasters through purpose-built infrastructure, early warning systems for preparedness and utilization of local human capacity for adaptation. These results strengthen the previous arguments for utilizing a comprehensive multidimensional framework for resilience analysis. Access to services for improved health and psychosocial well-being was significantly associated with the three-item measure of being more flood resilient. Additionally, a strong sense of place and resistance to relocation were presented as key elements of resilience, maintaining community system function, and preserving livelihoods. The study further found that these key factors would not be adequate to guarantee community flood resilience outside the transformative capacity of a well-resourced village civil protection committee that can prepare and mobilize stakeholders in response to flood emergencies. Our results suggest that, in the context where policymakers seek to strengthen resilience of communities without relocating them, a focus on public health and on strengthening and utilizing local capacities as adaptation, are key in disaster risk management policymaking and implementation. For the international research community, this study demonstrated the importance of utilizing context and hazard specific measures for defining, characterizing, and measuring resilience to inform policy.

Coastal natural habitats, such as dunes or saltmarshes, can reduce exposure of coastlines to these events and help to reduce the impacts and the potential damage to coastal property. The goal of our study was to evaluate the current vulnerability of the Portuguese northern coast to erosion and flooding caused by extreme events and to assess the contribution of natural habitats in reducing both vulnerability and property damages considering SLR scenarios. The Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) Coastal Vulnerability model was used to produce an Exposure Index (EI) for the northern Portuguese coastline, for the current situation, and for future International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, considering the presence and absence of coastal habitats. Results showed an increase in exposure with rising sea levels and expansion of high vulnerability areas. Coastal habitats contributed to a 28% reduction of high exposed segments for the Current scenario, corresponding to a potential reduction of coastal property damage of 105 Meuro during extreme events. For the SLR scenarios, coastal habitats could potentially reduce the amount of property damage by 190 Meuro in 2050 and 285 Meuro in 2100, considering RCP8.5 projections. This study highlighted the importance of natural habitats in protecting vulnerable coastlines and reducing the potential damages to properties from flooding. Such results can be incorporated in management plans and support decision-making toward implementing an ecosystem-based approach to increase the resilience of coastal communities to cope with future environmental changes.</p>	[Cunha, Jacinto; Bio, Ana; Ramos, Sandra] Univ Porto, CIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, CIIMAR, Matosinhos, Portugal; [Cunha, Jacinto] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CITAB Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, Vila Real, Portugal; [Cardona, Fabio Santos] ENA Energy & Environm Agcy Arrabida, Setubal, Portugal; [Cardona, Fabio Santos] MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Lisbon, Portugal	Universidade do Porto; University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro	Cunha, J (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, CIIMAR, Matosinhos, Portugal.; Cunha, J (corresponding author), Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CITAB Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol Sci, Vila Real, Portugal.	jcunha@ciimar.up.pt	Ramos, Sandra/I-4359-2013; Bio, Ana/HOH-9439-2023	Ramos, Sandra/0000-0002-4065-7651; Bio, Ana/0000-0003-4501-9410; Cunha, Jacinto/0000-0001-9546-2774; Cardona, Fabio/0000-0003-4244-5748	Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (NORTE 2020), through Portugal 2020 [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000064]; Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER) [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000064]; FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04423/2020, UIDP/04423/2020]; FCT (FSE through Programa Operacional Regional Norte) [PD/BD/150359/2019]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PD/BD/150359/2019] Funding Source: FCT	Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (NORTE 2020), through Portugal 2020; Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER)(European Union (EU)); FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FCT (FSE through Programa Operacional Regional Norte); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))	This research was partially supported by the project OCEAN3RReduce pressures, restore and regenerate the NW-Portuguese ocean and waters, com a referencia NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000064, co-funded by Programa Operacional Regional do Norte (NORTE 2020), through Portugal 2020 and Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER), by national funds through FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology within the scope of UIDB/04423/2020 and UIDP/04423/2020; and by JC Ph.D. fellowship from FCT (ref.

The reproductive resilience of minnows facing climatic variability, using a wetland inhabiting species Amblypharyngodon mola (Mola carplets) in lower Indo-Gangetic floodplains, was validated. Results revealed that spawning decision in females (threshold gonadosomatic index >= 5 units) is neither cued by water temperature nor rainfall. They can maintain pre-spawning fitness (condition factor 1.12-1.25 units) within a broad temperature (22-33 degrees C) and rainfall (0-800 mm) window by active feeding, thus no risk of skipped spawning decisions while facing future climatic variabilities. Present breeding phenology (May-December) might have prolonged in the recent decade, especially the tail-end, concomitant with increasingly hot and rainy monsoon (May-August) and warmer post-monsoon months (September-December). Minnows are expected to prosper in a future climatic scenario, contributing to ecosystem balance (algal grazers) and regional food security. Female first maturity (female puberty) was encountered at 4.7-5.1 cm total length, hinting at a probable increase in the recent decade. Climate-favored prolonged recruitment window, in absence of extreme fishing pressure (currently), might have led to such pattern. However, this state might be temporary and labile. Minnows may soon get altered to earlier puberty (=warning sign of stock collapse) if fishing pressure intensifies under a reproductively favoring climate progression. Threshold body girth for spawning females was estimated at 3.2-3.4 cm (+17% than non-breeding ones). Fishing nets having mesh sizes (=total circumference) at least > 32-34 mm will most likely be the key to minnows' endurance or survival in the coming decades.

J	Jamali, A				Jamali, Ali			Land use land cover mapping using advanced machine learning classifiers: A case study of Shiraz city, Iran	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS			English	Article						LULC; Machine learning; Image classification; Multilayer perceptron; Support vector machine; Decision tree	RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; AREAS; IMAGE; TREE	Due to the recent climate changes and their consequences such as flash floods and droughts, there is a need for Land Use Land Cover mapping to monitor environmental changes which have effects on ecology, policy management, health, and disaster management. It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by climate change, and on the other hand, population growth has increased the rate of urbanization in Iran, where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for LULC mapping as well. The FDMLP classifier has outperformed the other two well-known algorithms of the SVM and the CTree for the classification of the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery and the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m in terms of the overall accuracy and index of kappa. Based on the test data, the DNN classifier for the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m with values of 91.28 and 88.57 percent for the OA and Kappa index has outperformed the other supervised classifiers. The worst results of classification are for the DNN algorithm for the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery.

To do this, this study evaluated changing trends and detected transition years for both streamflow and sediment discharge using long-term historical records at seven hydrological stations in the Ganjiang River basin over the past 50 years. The double mass curve (DMC) method was used to quantify the effects of both climate change and human activities on hydrological regime shifts. The results showed that the distributions of precipitation, streamflow, and sediment discharge within a year are extremely uneven and mainly concentrated in the flood season of Jiangxi Province. None of the stations showed significant trends over time for either annual precipitation or streamflow, while the annual sediment discharge at most stations decreased significantly over time. The estimation of sediment discharge via DMC indicated that after the transition years, there were rapid reductions in sediment discharge at all hydrological stations, and the average decline degree of midstream and downstream were much larger than that of upstream. Human activities, especially the increase of vegetation cover and construction of large and medium-sized reservoirs, provided a significantly greater contribution to the reduction of sediment discharge than did precipitation changes. As a case study of river evolution under global change environment, this study could provide scientific basis for the control of soil erosion and the management of water resources in Ganjiang River, as well as for the related research of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River basin of China.

Limited resources will be in ever greater demand and the environmental stress from prolonged droughts, record-breaking heat waves, and destructive floods will increase. Existing long-term trends and behaviors will not be sustainable. That is our current trajectory, but we can still change course. Significant advances in information communication technologies and big data, combined with new frameworks for thinking about urban places as social-ecological-technical systems, and an increasing movement towards transdisciplinary scholarship and practice sets the foundation and framework for a metropolitan observatory. Yet, more is required than an infrastructure for data. Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable will require that data become actionable knowledge that change policy and practice. Research and development of urban sustainability and resilience knowledge is burgeoning, yet the uptake to policy has been slow. An integrative and holistic approach is necessary to develop effective sustainability science that synthesizes different sources of knowledge, relevant disciplines, multi-sectoral alliances, and connections to policy-makers and the public. To address these challenges and opportunities, we developed a conceptual framework for a metropolitan observatory to generate standardized long-term, large-scale datasets about social, ecological, and technical dimensions of metropolitan systems. We apply this conceptual model in Texas, known as the Texas Metro Observatory, to advance strategic research and decision-making at the intersection of urbanization and climate change. The Texas Metro Observatory project is part of Planet Texas 2050, a University of Texas Austin grand challenge initiative.	[Bixler, R.

These events are already profoundly affecting human health in the United States and globally, challenging the ability of communities to prepare, respond, and recover. The purpose of this research was to examine the peer-reviewed literature on community resilience initiatives in one of the most densely populated and economically important regions, the Northeastern United States, and to identify evidence-based interventions and metrics that had been field-tested and evaluated. This paper addresses two critical gaps in the literature: (1) what strategies or interventions have been implemented to build or enhance community resilience against climate change-related natural disasters; and (2) what metrics were used to measure community resilience as an outcome of those strategies or interventions? This review provides a succinct list of effective interventions with specific health outcomes. Community or state-level health officials can use the results to prioritize public health interventions. This review used existing database search tools to discover 205 studies related to community resilience and health outcomes. Methods set criteria to assess if interventions were able to measure and change levels of community resilience to the health impacts associated with a changing climate. Criteria included: (a) alignment with the United States' National Preparedness Goal for reducing risks to human health and for recovering quickly from disasters; (b) derived from publicly available data sources; (c) developed for use by communities at a local scale; and (d) accessible to modestly resourced municipalities and county health agencies. Five (5) peer-reviewed, evidence-based studies met all of the selection criteria. Three of these articles described intervention frameworks and two reported on the use of standardized tools. Health-related outcomes included mental health impacts (PTSD/depression), mental stress, emergency preparedness knowledge, social capital skills, and emergency planning skills. The paper recommends the COAST project, COPEWELL Rubric for self-assessment, and Ready CDC intervention as examples of strategies that could be adapted by any community engaged in building community resilience.

Here, we used a synergic map-ping framework to characterize summer floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain and the effects on croplands in 2020, from both flood extent and intensity perspectives. We found that the total flood extent was 4936 km(2) from July to August, and for flood intensity, 1658, 1382, and 1896 km(2) of areas experienced triple, double, and single floods. A total of 2282 km(2) croplands (46% of the flooded area) were inundated mainly from Poyang and Dongting Lake Basins, containing a high ratio of moderate damage croplands (47%). The newly increased flooding extent in 2020 was 29% larger than the maximum ever-flooded extent in 2015-2019. This study is expected to provide a reference for rapid regional flood disaster assessment and serving mitigation.

The aim of this work is to use uncertainty quantification tools to describe the flooding behaviour in Morocco based on deaths numbers using the Interpolation-based Approximations (Collocation) method in Hilbert Space in order to find the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) and using derivation by Dirac's approximations to determine the Probability Density Function (PDF), with the aim of describing the mortality of the disaster over regions and finally detecting the areas more sensitive to this disaster. The use of uncertainty quantification models for flooding goes beyond the ordinary application for data analysis, but it constitutes a decision-making tool for governments and organizations in the field of disaster management especially for disaster prediction.

One of the main reasons for fatality during flood events is walking through floodwaters. Although authorities strongly advise against walking in flood waters, evacuations or the accessing of flooded areas by emergency services might be necessary. This research proposes a novel approach to increasing resilience by retrofitting existing infrastructures to enhance evacuation and access routes by reducing flood hazard rate based on flood and pedestrian characteristics. The methodology was applied to flash floods in two case studies in the UK, namely Boscastle and Borth, highlighting that retrofitting small regions of the existing roads and pathways to reduce flood hazard can enhance people's safety during the evacuation, and hence provides a solution to improve the resilience of the existing environment.

Here, our results show that the solar and lunar periodic motions (SLPMs) have substantial impact on the runoff of the world's large rivers. We estimate that SLPMs can produce a change of the world's large rivers runoff by as much as 6.7%. Although climate models suggest that the increased frequency of extreme events is attributed to anthropogenic activities, it is out of our expectation that as much as 73% and 85% of the extreme flood and drought events (based on runoff discharged to the ocean) appear in resonance with SLPMs, respectively. A reevaluation of impacts of SLPMs on changes in the world's river runoff is urgently needed, especially when extreme drought and flood events are on the rise.

J	Craig, RK				Craig, Robin Kundis			Coastal adaptation, government-subsidized insurance, and perverse incentives to stay	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Coastal adaptation; Coastal retreat; Insurance; Perverse incentives; Buyouts; Hurricane; Flood		The law should be a critical tool in promoting and directing climate change adaptation in the USA. This should be particularly true in the nation's extensive coastal zone, much of which is subject to increasing rates of sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing numbers of increasingly powerful storms, and saltwater intrusion. However, significant coastal infrastructure hampers many coastal adaptation strategies by making retreat both expensive and politically unpalatable. This article examines the specific role of insurance and other financing programs in coastal adaptation strategies. Insurance operates primarily to mitigate risk. The article focuses specifically on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now driven by coastal catastrophes and is close to bankruptcy; Florida's decision to provide state-financed insurance to coastal property owners in the wake of the 2004-2005 hurricane season; and, conversely, the decisions of other states to use state and federal financing instead to facilitate coastal adaptation, including buyouts of transitioning coastal properties.

This article presents the verifying method of the dam overtopping risk under conditions of enlarged volumetric flood flow rates inflowing the storage reservoir. Values of the flow rate peaks were determined on the hydrological observations basis. The course of the hypothetical flood wave hydrograph was determined on the normalization and averaging basis of the 6 historical flood wave hydrographs. The flood routing analysis through the reservoir was numerically performed, with the assumptions of Puls's method, for 6 scenarios with 2 flood flow rates and for 3 initial water levels in the reservoir. On the obtained results basis the dam overtopping hazard level was determined, and the necessity for reservoir water management changes was pointed out.

This study integrates a hybrid erosion model with rainfall data from high-resolution weather radar to simulate soil erosion during 22 high-intensity flash-flood generating rainstorms in a Mediterranean watershed (69 km2). We examine erosion over individual hillslopes and their spatial average over the watershed, representing intrawatershed and watershed-scale erosion, respectively. Our objectives are to: (a) determine how intra-watershed erosion corresponds to various physiographic factors (rainfall, land-use, topography); (b) determine which of these factors contributes to intra-watershed erosion the most; (c) quantify the effect of temporal variations in rainfall intensities on storm-scale erosion in relation to land-use type. We use for the first time a hybrid erosion model (K2-RHEM-DWEPP) based on the watershed-scale KINEROS2 model, that integrates the hillslope-scale Dynamic WEPP (DWEPP) and RHEM models, which were individually developed to represent erosion processes in croplands and rangelands, respectively. Watershed-scale storm erosion is best correlated with spatiallyaveraged 10-minutes maximum intensities (R2 = 0.58), and the correlation decreases for longer durations (R2 & LE; 0.54). When the spatially-averaged 10-minutes maximum intensity is multiplied by the area that contributes sediment, a better correlation with watershed-scale erosion is observed (R2 = 0.75). Hillslope erosion rates are higher when both rainfall intensities and topographic slopes are high, while land-use has a second-order effect. Higher storms maximal intensities result in higher hillslope erosion rates, especially over croplands. Our conclusions are useful to target locations for conservation practices and to better understand the effects of climate change on soil erosion.

The trends and pressures framework identifies five major indicators reflecting 'concern' for Seville's urban water management: heat island effect, urban drainage flooding, river peak discharges, unemployment rate and economic pressure. The results indicate increased daytime and night-time temperatures and increased urban flooding due to sealed soil, and river rise from regional precipitation under climate change. The financial pressures are driven by the high unemployment rate and the low per capita income compared to other cities assessed. The city blueprint framework identifies three categories reflecting 'poor' performance for the urban water management of Seville: water infrastructure, solid waste and climate adaptation. An aging sewer network, low operational cost recovery and combined-sewer overflow systems dominate. Solid waste management is characterized by high waste generation, low recycling rate and minimal energy recovery. The percentage of green space is low, but growing. The Governance Capacity Framework identifies five conditions reflecting 'limited' governance of water scarcity: awareness, useful knowledge, continuous learning, agents of change and financial viability. The assessment of water governance reflects a low citizens' sense of urgency. Integrating citizens and stakeholders in a more participative governance will result in increased awareness of economic efforts required to face water scarcity, renewal of water infrastructure and climate adaptation. The blue city index (BCI) of Seville is 5.8/10, placing it highly among other Mediterranean cities, and in the top 20% of 125 cities assessed worldwide. Application of the CBA to the urban water resources of cities allows clear definition of water and resource management challenges and is the first step to becoming a 'water smart' city.

However, over the recent decades, dam construction has had increasingly profound effects on hydrological processes and aquatic, particularly riparian, ecosystems. Understanding these impacts is critical for the foundation of sustainable runoff surface management. In this study, different methods, based on both graphical and statistical techniques, were applied to assess the effects of the dams on annual, seasonal and monthly runoff and to detect hydroclimatic trends in the Upper Mekong Basin during the period 1960-2020. The results reveal two change points with respect to seasonal and annual flow regimes; that is, 2003 for the flood season and annual flows and 2013 for the dry season flow. The duration of the flood season and the volume of annual discharges have both significantly decreased since 2003 and the dry season discharge has significantly increased since 2013 (with both p-values <.05). The quantitative assessment suggests that, due to the effect of dams, the monthly discharges increased by 10-450 m(3)/s during the dry season (December-May), while the flood season's monthly flows decreased significantly, by 1,028-2,150 m(3)/s, from July to October at Chiang Saen station. The study of hydrological changes in the Mekong watershed is expected to be a significant contribution towards a better understanding of large watersheds in which the hydrological effects are influenced not only by climate change at large spatial and temporal scales but also by changes in the physical environment due to the construction of dams.

Precisely, the Koshi River basin (KRB) is often impacted by floods over time. However, studies on estimating and predicting floods are still scarce in this basin. This study aims at developing a flood probability map using machine learning algorithms (MLAs): Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM) with multiple kernel functions including Pearson VII function kernel (PUK), polynomial, normalized poly kernel, and radial basis kernel function (RBF). Historical flood locations from available (topography, hydrogeology, and environmental) datasets were further considered to build a flood probability model. Two datasets were carefully chosen to measure the feasibility and robustness of MLAs: the training dataset (flood locations between 2010 and 2019) and the testing dataset (flood locations of 2020) with thirteen flood influencing factors. Validation of the MLAs was performed with statistical indices such as the coefficient of determination (r(2): 0.546 -.995), mean absolute error (MAE: 0.009 -373), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.051-0.466), relative absolute error (RAE: 1.81-8.55%), and root-relative square error (RRSE: 10.19-91.00%). Results showed that the SVM-Pearson VII kernel (PUK) yielded better prediction than other algorithms. The resultant map from SVM-PUK revealed that 27.99% area with low, 39.91% area with medium, 31.00% with high, and 1.10% area with very high probabilities of flooding in the study area. The flood probability map, derived in this study, could add great value to the effort of flood risk mitigation and planning processes in KRB.

Changes in floodplain regimes over Canada due to climate change impacts: Observations from CMIP6 models	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						CMIP6; Flood hazards; Floodplain regimes; Flood risk management; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways	MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES; RISK; GENERATION; MAP	With the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), water experts and flood modellers are curious to explore the efficacy of the new and upgraded climate models in representing flood inundation dynamics and how they will be impacted in the future by climate change. In this study, for the first time, we consider the latest group of General Circulation Models (GCMs) from CMIP6 to examine the probable changes in floodplain regimes over Canada. A set of 17 GCMs from Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 4.5 (medium forcing) and 8.5 (high end forcing) common to historical (1980 to 2019), near-future (2021 to 2060), and far-future (2061 to 2100) time-periods are selected. A comprehensive framework consisting of hydrodynamic flood modelling, and statistical experiments are put forward to derive high-resolution Canada-wide floodplain maps for 100 and 200-yr return periods. The changes in floodplain regimes for the future periods are analyzed over drainage basin scale in terms of (i) changes in flood inundation extents, (ii) changes in flood hazards (high and very high classes), and (iii) changes in flood frequency. Our results show a significant rise (>30%) in flood inundation extents in the future periods; particularly intense over western and eastern regions. The flood hazards are expected to cover-16% more geographical area of Canada. We also find that large areas in northern and western Canada and a few spots in the eastern parts of Canada will be getting flooded more frequently compared to the historical period. The observations derived from this study are vital for enhancing flood preparedness, optimal land-use planning, and refurbishing both structural and non-structural flood control options for improved resilience. The study instills new knowledge on revamping the existing flood management approaches and adaptation strategies for future protection. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Late Quaternary evolution and stratigraphic framework influence on coastal systems along the north-central Gulf of Mexico, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						MIS 2; Holocene; Geomorphology; Sequence stratigraphy; Petit Bois Island; Dauphin Island; Geomorphology; Coastal geology; Geophysical; Inner shelf	MISSISSIPPI BARRIER ISLANDS; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SAND RIDGES; INNER-SHELF; TEXAS COAST; SEISMIC GEOMORPHOLOGY; EUSTATIC CYCLE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALABAMA; DELTA	Coastal systems in the Gulf of Mexico are threatened by reduced sediment supply, storm impacts and relative sea-level rise (RSLR). The geologic record provides insight into geomorphic evolution thresholds to these forcing mechanisms to help predict future barrier evolution in response to climate change. This study synthesizes similar to 2100 km of geophysical data, 700 + sediment cores, and 62 radiocarbon dates to regionally map two lowstand sequence boundaries, multiple ravinement surfaces and fourteen depositional fades demonstrating stratigraphic and antecedent topographic influences on coastal evolution. The Mississippi-Alabama (MSAL) barriers are anchored by a marine isotope stage (MIS) Se section of Dauphin Island coupled with an MIS 2 surface gradient change. Sand for the modern MSAL barriers were largely sourced through Holocene transgressive ravinement of relict valley fill deposits, providing up to 300 x 10(6) m(3) of sand. Mud-filled MIS 2 tributaries correspond to areas of repeated storm breaching or tidal inlets. A Holocene geomorphic evolutionary model was created for Petit Bois and Dauphin Islands, highlighting RSLR rates, changes in sediment supply and the antecedent geologic framework. As the MIS 2 surface was flooded, tidal/wave scour supplied sand to migrating marine shoals. These transgressing shoals converted drowned paleovalleys to estuaries similar to 9ka BP. Islands formed in their modern positions similar to 6ka BP, when sediment supply was high and RSLR rates were 2 mm/yr. Between similar to 4ka-1750 CE, islands prograded from reduced RSLR rates of 1-0.4 mm/yr and sufficient sand supply from alongshore/inner shelf sources. Currently, the islands experience 3.74 mm/yr of RSLR and reduced sediment supply, resulting in barrier degradation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Source of Nile sediments in the floodplain at Saqqara inferred from mineralogical, geochemical, and pollen data, and their palaeoclimatic and geoarchaeological significance	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EGU Session on GM6.2/SSS3.10 on Geoarchaeology - Human Adaptation to Landscape Changes, Landscape Resilience to Human Impact and Integrating Palaeoevnironmental and Archaeological Records	2016	Vienna, AUSTRIA	EGU		Geoarchaeology; Nile floodplain; Saqqara; Pollen; Geochemistry; Palaeoclimate	HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES; CLIMATIC CHANGES; HEAVY MINERALS; LAKE TURKANA; NORTH-AFRICA; HOLOCENE; DELTA; QUATERNARY; EAST; MONSOON	We present results of mineralogical (light, heavy and clay minerals), geochemical and palynological investigations of floodplain sediments at Saqqara. Our investigations provide new insights into our understanding of the source of the Holocene Nile sediments, local palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment of the floodplain at Saqqara as well as the Holocene palaeoclimatic variations at the Nile headwaters. We also investigate the relationship between Nile floods and global climate changes and the impact of changing flood conditions on episodes of societal and central governmental collapse at the end of the Egyptian Old Kingdom. The Holocene sequences recorded in two shallow drill cores (SAQA 21 and 22) were investigated and subdivided into six sedimentary units, from underlying Late Pleistocene sand and gravels (unit I) to overlying modern soil (unit VIII). Early Holocene sediments were essentially missing in the studied cores, probably due to intensive erosion during the well-known 8.2 kyr cal BP arid event. Middle Holocene sediments are represented by unit II, which reflect high Nile floods of Equatorial African origin with less contribution from Ethiopian sources. The Old Kingdom sediments (unit III), seems to be mainly of White Nile sources with frequent contributions from the Blue Nile. Late Holocene sediments (unit IV-VII) show an increased contribution from Blue Nile River sources. Low Nile flow episodes were recorded at 5.2 (between units II and III), 4.2 (between units III and IV), 3.5 (within unit IV) and 2.7 kyr cal BP (between units V and VI). The second event corresponds to the First Intermediate Period (FIP) and the third probably coincides with the Second Intermediate Period (2nd IP), periods of disorder in Egypt.

J	Lourenco, M; Woodborne, S				Lourenco, Mauro; Woodborne, Stephan			Defining the Angolan Highlands Water Tower, a 40 plus-year precipitation budget of the headwater catchments of the Okavango Delta	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Okavango Delta; Peatlands; Remote sensing; Google Earth Engine; Flood	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTENT; VULNERABILITY; BOTSWANA; FLOOD	Angola is a source of many major rivers in southern Africa and is referred to as the "water tower" of the region. The lack of a defined area delineating the Angolan Highlands water tower (AHWT) limits the conservation of this important freshwater source. This study hydrologically defines the boundary of the AHWT as areas > 1274 m above mean sea level within the Central Bie Plateau of Angola. Using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data, this study provides a 41-year precipitation budget of the AHWT and surrounding basins. Between 1981 and 2021, the average annual precipitation over the AHWT was 1112 mm and the gross annual average precipitation volume was approximately 423 km(3) over an area of 380,382 km(2). The AHWT is the southern source of the Congo Basin, the western source of the Zambezi Basin, and the sole water source of the endorheic Okavango Basin and Okavango Delta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On average, approximately 133 km(3) (92.36%) of the gross annual precipitation volume for the headwater Cuito and Cubango catchments of the Okavango River is lost before reaching the Okavango Delta. Estimates of the annual flooding of the Okavango Delta during a 35-year period (1985-2019) were correlated to precipitation in the headwater catchments. Correlation coefficients are stronger for the entire rainfall season (0.76) and early rainfall season (0.62) for the combined Cuito-Cubango catchment in comparison to late rainfall season (0.50), which suggests that the antecedent conditions (first and second flood pulse) during the early rainfall season allows for greater Okavango Delta flood inundation. The correlation coefficients between the Cubango (0.72) and Cuito (0.78) Rivers and annual flood inundation are not significantly different (P > 0.05); however, these rivers have fundamental hydrological differences that influence the functioning of the Okavango Delta. The Cubango River, described as a flushing system, has much steeper gradient, more compact and shallow soils and flows faster with significant rapids, whereas the peatland rich, absorbent, seepage-driven baseflow of the Cuito River sustains the Okavango Delta during the dry season. The dynamics of seasonal precipitation, hydrology and climate change in the AHWT have important repercussions on water budgets, food security and biodiversity throughout southern Africa, requiring continued collaboration between countries to ensure that future development is sustainable.

Increased rice flooding during winter explains the recent increase in the Pacific Flyway White-fronted Goose<i>Anser albifrons frontalis</i>population in North America	IBIS			English	Article						dead encounter; fecundity; harvest; integrative modelling; land use; mortality	GREATER SNOW GEESE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURVIVAL; CALIFORNIA; HABITAT; MANAGEMENT; WATERFOWL	Despite declines in numerous migratory bird populations due to global climate and landscape changes, the Pacific Flyway population of Greater White-fronted GeeseAnser albifrons frontalisin North America has flourished over recent decades. However, the demographic foundations of the population increase remain unclear, largely due to sparse data. In this study, we used a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) to maximize information from multiple data sources including coordinated population survey, ring-recovery and hunter-harvested goose tail data. We estimated demographic parameters and assessed the role of several possible drivers of the observed population increase, including density-dependent processes, agricultural land use change and climate conditions in both the wintering and the breeding season, while also accounting for the impacts of harvest. Non-harvest survival of all geese was 0.83 (95% credible interval (CRI): 0.70-0.96) before legislation restricted post-harvest rice field burning, and 0.98 (95% CRI: 0.94-1.0) afterwards. We detected a negative effect of density-dependent processes and a positive effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on non-harvest survival with high certainty. Kill rates were 0.11 (95% CRI: 0.09-0.12) for adults (after hatch year) and 0.26 (95% CRI 0.21-0.31) for juveniles (hatch year), resulting in annual survival rates of 0.81 (95% CRI: 0.69-0.89) for adults and 0.67 (95% CRI: 0.56-0.76) for juveniles. The ratio of juvenile birds to adults in the population was on average 0.36 (95% CRI: 0.29-0.45) and was driven by negative density-dependent processes with high certainty. Our results suggest that the ban on rice field burning and subsequent high frequency of flooding as an alternative rice decomposition practice was the primary driver of the Pacific white-fronted Goose population increase. The effects of climate change and density dependence were not strong enough to suppress the benefit of flooded rice. Given sparse demographic data for Pacific white-fronted Geese, we were only able to uncover drivers of demography using IPMs. We encourage practitioners with sparse data similarly to consider forming IPMs to determine the drivers and mechanisms for population change and to prioritize future data collection.

This lake is characterized by a phenomenon of ebb and flow of the Mekong River according to the rainy season. Its size varies from one to five, and it is the place where rice is cultivated. Rice is the main agricultural activity of the country and the main food of its population. The study of this agro-ecosystem, carried out through surveys in six rice-growing villages, shows a complexity in the understanding of these ecosystem services. Some are positive, others are negative. Some are positive up to a certain level but become negative afterwards. Some are co-produced by rice cultivation, which over time has shaped the ecosystem. We also show, from an analysis of agrarian systems, that production systems are more or less compatible with maintaining these services.

As climate change and urbanization advance, an increasing number of people are at risk of flash floods. The application of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies in the study of flash floods has increased significantly over the last 20 years. In this paper, more than 200 articles published in the last 20 years are summarized and analyzed. First, a visualization analysis of the literature is performed, including a keyword co-occurrence analysis, time zone chart analysis, keyword burst analysis, and literature co-citation analysis. Then, the application of remote sensing and GIS technologies to flash flood disasters is analyzed in terms of aspects such as flash flood forecasting, flash flood disaster impact assessments, flash flood susceptibility analyses, flash flood risk assessments, and the identification of flash flood disaster risk areas. Finally, the current research status is summarized, and the orientation of future research is also discussed.

Prioritising resilience policies to reduce welfare losses from natural disasters: A case study for coastal Bangladesh	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Resilience; Disaster risk reduction; Bangladesh; Sustainable development	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK REDUCTION; POVERTY; COSTS; VULNERABILITY; MODEL; BAY; SUSTAINABILITY; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK	Quantified flood risk assessments focus on asset losses, neglecting longer-term impacts to household welfare via income and consumption losses. The extent of welfare losses depends upon resilience - the ability to anticipate, resist, cope, recover and learn from a shock. Here, we use a novel welfare loss modelling framework and perform a high-resolution spatial analysis in coastal Bangladesh to quantify welfare losses from a tropical cyclone under present and future climatic and socio-economic conditions. We further test various adaptation options that are intended to enhance resilience. Results show that poor households experience, on average, 7% of the asset losses, but 42% of the welfare losses. Combining dike heightening, post-disaster support and stronger housing can reduce welfare losses by up to 70%, and foster sustainable development by benefitting the poor, increasing resilience and demonstrating robustness under socio-economic and climatic uncertainties. Thus, a welfare orientated perspective helps to identify adaptation options that enhance resilience and leave no-one behind.	[Verschuur, J.; Koks, E. E.; Hall, J.

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) system in gully is a flexible practice that alleviate complex environmental problems. In the Kulusitai watershed of Xinjiang, China, our study presented a decision-making system using GIS combined with multi-criteria analysis and a field survey to identify suitability of gully for RWH. The results showed that nearly 40% of rangeland belonged to high runoff potential area, and gullies as the runoff collection channel became the potential site of RWH. The selection of RWH systems depended on catchment environment and gully characteristics. Therefore, based on the unique natural conditions of Xinjiang and successful RWH cases in other regions, we discussed some suitable low-cost RWH techniques to restore degraded grassland and promote community development. Our study will provide some suggestions for ecological restoration and pasture management in arid regions of Central Asia.

The core, dated by C-14 and OSL, shows variations in the abundance, diversity, and preservation of sponge spicules and phytoliths through time, consistent with changing aquatic environments. In the late Pleistocene, Lake Negra was influenced by a strong monsoon and fluvial depositional processes, whereas in the Holocene, there was a drier interval where the lake was more isolated on the floodplain. Hiatuses in the stratigraphy resulted from both wet and dry conditions, through fluvial channel scour or subaerial exposure of the lake floor, respectively. Data suggest that floodplain lakes in the Pantanal wetlands and similar riverine wetlands respond in a complex and, at times, indirect manner to climate change, and the dynamics of the adjacent fluvial system must be accounted for when interpreting paleohydrology and vegetation patterns.

Chasing the fitness optimum: temporal variation in the genetic and environmental expression of life-history traits for a perennial plant	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						Life history; quantitative genetics; fitness; phenology; fitness landscape; climate change; Geum triflorum; alvar habitat; prairie habitat; common garden	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; LOCAL ADAPTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLORAL TRAITS; FLUCTUATING SELECTION; NATURAL-SELECTION; FLOWERING-TIME; EVOLUTION; HERITABILITY; GRASSLAND	Background and Aims The ability of plants to track shifting fitness optima is crucial within the context of global change, where increasing environmental extremes may have dramatic consequences for life history, fitness, and ultimately population persistence. However, tracking changing conditions relies on the relationship between genetic and environmental variance, where selection may favour plasticity, the evolution of genetic differences, or both depending on the spatial and temporal scale of environmental heterogeneity. Methods Over three years, we compared the genetic and environmental components of phenological and life-history variation in a common environment for the spring perennial Geum triflorum. Populations were sourced from alvar habitats that exhibit extreme but predictable annual flood-desiccation cycles and prairie habitats that exhibit similar but less predictable variation in water availability. Key Results Heritability was generally higher for early life-history (emergence probability) relative to later life-history traits (total seed mass), indicating that traits associated with establishment are under stronger genetic control relative to later life-history fitness expressions, where plasticity may play a larger role. This pattern was particularly notable in seeds sourced from environmentally extreme but predictable alvar habitats relative to less predictable prairie environments. Fitness landscapes based on seed source origin, largely characterized by varying water availability and flower production, described selection as the degree of maladaptation of seed source environment relative to the prairie common garden environment. Plants from alvar populations were consistently closer to the fitness optimum across all years. Annually, the breadth of the fitness optimum expanded primarily along a moisture gradient, with inclusion of more populations onto the expanding optimum. Conclusions These results highlight the importance of temporally and spatially varying selection in life-history evolution, indicating plasticity may become a primary mechanism needed to track fitness for later life-history events within perennial systems.

J	Hoque, M				Hoque, Morshadul			The impact of floods on the livelihood of rural women farmers and their adaptation strategies: insights from Bangladesh	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Flood; Adaptation strategies; Local knowledge; Livelihood; Rural Bangladeshi women	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; COASTAL; VULNERABILITY; DETERMINANTS; AGRICULTURE; LIVESTOCK; ISLAND	This study examines the impact of floods on the livelihood of rural Bangladeshi women farmers, such as agriculture, livestock, energy, and water resources, and their adaptation strategies. This research utilizes qualitative and quantitative approaches, focusing more on the qualitative data. Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire with a series of close-ended questions. Key informant interviews and focus group discussions were mainly used to collect qualitative data. A total of 120 samples were drawn by applying snowball sampling from two flood-prone remote villages in Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. The sample units were rural women exclusively engaged in farming, different rural income-generating activities, and traditional household responsibilities. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics were mainly used to analyze qualitative and quantitative data. The study's findings reveal that floods devastate the four sectors of rural women farmers in Bangladesh. However, they apply different adaptation strategies to mitigate the detrimental impact of floods. Empirical evidence also discloses that local knowledge is the primary source among women farmers for developing different adaptation strategies in four sectors such as 60% in agriculture, 70% in livestock, 65% in energy, and 55% in water resource management. According to data, 54% of women respondents reveal that community practice is their primary source of adaptation for crop diversification; in contrast, 47% of participants disclose that family practice is their main adaptation source in gathering animal feed. 7% of interviewees report that their own experience is their major adaptation source in collecting dry leaves and branches of trees for cooking. At the same time, an equal percentage of women disclose that interaction with nature is their key adaptation source in making portable stoves for cooking food during floods. The result further shows that community and family practices are the most common and dominant local knowledge sources among women farmers. This study is expected to help the policy-making community in Bangladesh to incorporate local knowledge in significant climate change-related policy documents.

However, the potential changes in SFHE characteristics and the global population exposure to SFHE under anthropogenic warming remain unclear. Here, we present a globalscale evaluation of the projected changes and uncertainties in SFHE characteristics (frequency, intensity, duration, land exposure) and population exposure under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 6.0 scenarios, based on the multi-model ensembles (five global water models forced by four global climate models) within the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project 2b framework. The results reveal that, relative to the 1970-1999 baseline period, the SFHE frequency is projected to increase nearly globally by the end of this century, especially in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (>20 events/30-year) and the tropical regions (e.g., northern South America, central Africa, and southeastern Asia, >15 events/30-year). The projected higher SFHE frequency is generally accompanied by a larger model uncertainty. By the end of this century, the SFHE land exposure is expected to increase by 12 % (20 %) under RCP2.6 (RCP6.0), and the intervals between flood and heatwave in SFHE tend to decrease by up to 3 days under both RCPs, implying the more intermittent SFHE occurrence under future warming. The SFHE events will lead to the higher population exposure in the Indian Peninsula and central Africa (<10 million person-days) and eastern Asia (<5 million person-days) due to the higher population density and the longer SFHE duration. Partial correlation analysis indicates that the contribution of flood to the SFHE frequency is greater than that of heatwave for most global regions, but the SFHE frequency is dominated by the heatwave in northern North America and northern Asia.

The effect of temperature change on the dryness and wetness variation was explored by comparing the trends of SPEI and standardized precipitation index (SPI) at multiple-time scales and different SSPs scenarios. The results indicate that the frequency of drought events may increase by 1.1 similar to 3.8% than the historical period in the three scenarios, and they may be higher than that of wetness events in the future of this century. Cumulative months of drought events are higher in most decades than the wetness events, and especially in the 2090s. A total of 43 months may suffer drought events in the 2090s under the SSP585 scenario, which is more than twice the wetness events. With the enhanced concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, both the frequency of droughts and the proportion of extreme droughts show a significant increasing trend at 99% confidence in PLB. The spatial distribution of net precipitation is generally in the southwest-northeast pattern, yet it is still in different values in most scenarios; thus, the uncertainty of dryness/wetness spatial conditions should be considered. The SPI detects more wetness events and a more intensive wetting trend, while the SPEI shows the opposite. The difference between SPI and SPEI gradually increases with GHG emission concentration, and may even lead to contrary conclusion in the last two decades at a 48-month scale under the SSP245 and 585 scenarios, indicating the unneglectable impact of increasing temperature and evapotranspiration on the dryness/wetness conditions in the future. The research results can help to predict the evolution pattern of dry and wet occurrence in the PLB in the future and promote flood/drought control and disaster mitigation.

Since 1980, the policies implemented by the Chinese government exert some effects on the livelihood activities of farmers and herdsmen households but seemed not enough. In this article, we construct a research framework of "Disaster vulnerability assessment -contribution of disaster vulnerability factors -driving mechanism of disaster vulnerability - sus-tainable development model". A questionnaire survey and key person interviews were carried out in villages/ gachas of Darhan Muminggan United Banner, Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China, and 967 data were collected from farmers and herdsmen households. On this basis, we constructed an indicators system and a model for the vulnerability assessment of farmers and herdsmen households to arid climate disasters. Then the main influ-encing factors of the vulnerability of farmers and herdsmen households were identified by the factor contribution model. The main research results are as follows: (i) The vulnerability of farmers and herdsmen households was high to arid climate disasters. The vulnerability can be ranked as herdsmen households > combined occupation households > farmers households. (ii) The vulnerability of farmers households was affected by farmland area and income source, drought intensity and household saving, drought frequency and labor capacity are the main influencing factors. (iii) The vulnerability of herdsmen households was affected by arid climate disasters, and induced by the less effective traditional adaptation mode and the lack of new adaptation mode. (iv) The model of mixed livelihood of government and farmers and herdsmen was suggested to improve active and planned adaptation behavior. This study promotes the cross-application of behavioral psychology, social capital, policy externality and other theories in the study of drought disaster vulnerability and the interaction mechanism of farm and pastoral households. It provides reference for the study of disaster vulnerability associated with climate change in similar regions around the world.

Limited attention has been given to these zones' food security assessment. Therefore, this study aims to assess the status of food security and its determinants among different groups of Bangladeshi coastal households. It also identifies their livelihood risks and coping strategies during stressed situations. Data were collected from 1350 households from coastal districts through a questionnaire survey. Food security was calculated and compared with the recommended average (2400 kcal/capita/day). A binary logit model was used to identify the determinants of food security among rural coastal households. Livelihood risks and coping mechanisms were recorded through open-ended questions. The findings of this study revealed that although on average, sampled households were food secure (2753 kcal/capita/day), 81% of landless households and 72% of marginal landholders within the sample appeared food insecure. Among various food items, rice supplied the greatest total daily calorie intake (1841.47 kcal), second was the edible oil (172.27 kcal). The regression model revealed that farm size, farm income, off-farm income, and crop production had positive impacts on households' food security. Floods, salinity, heavy rainfall, and reduction of land productivity were high risks to the large farm households, while heavy rainfall, floods, and salinity were high risks to the landless farm households. To cope with these risks, the majority of large farm households used their savings and sold livestock and poultry as coping strategies. The landless and marginal farmers were mostly helped by nongovernmental and government-run organizations, moved elsewhere to find work, sold their labor, and were involved in fishing. It was concluded that different groups of farmers face different challenges. Our findings indicate that in order to protect landless and marginal farmers, government should implement policies aimed at increasing crop production by means of prioritizing saline-tolerant crop varieties and the creation of more job opportunities.

The Yangtze River basin is one of the world's largest basins, and understanding the future precipitation changes should be vital to flood control, water resources supply, and hydropower electricity generation in this basin. In this study, projected future characteristics of precipitation are analyzed in the upper Yangtze river basin (UYRB). To this end, based on the observed data from national meteorological stations, the bias correction spatial downscaling (BCSD) of five models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) is carried out. Then, based on the results of multi model ensemble (MME), we find that, relative to the historical period (1988-2014), the mean annual precipitation in the whole UYRB during 2015-2064 increases by 4.23%, 1.11%, 1.24% under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5, respectively, and it increases more in the long term (2040-2064) than that in the near term (2015-2039). Under SSP1-2.6, the precipitation will increase more significantly, which means lower emission of aerosols and greenhouse gases may increase the risk of flood disaster in the future over the UYRB. Interdecadal precipitation variability is more intense than interannual precipitation variability. Future precipitation changes in four seasons are spatially heterogeneous under three scenarios. Three extreme precipitation indices, including R95p, Rx1day and R10 mm, generally increase in the UYRB. R95p and Rx1day increase more in the WR and YBYCR basins with relatively high mean annual precipitation than that in other three sub-basins. R10 mm changes slightly in all sub-basins. The results reveal that the lower region of the UYRB may face greater risk of extreme precipitation. This study provides a timely updated finding about future changes in precipitation in the UYRB based on more accurate climate projections and ground-based observation.

J	Arfanuzzaman, M; Hassan, SMT; Abu Syed, M				Arfanuzzaman, Md; Hassan, S. M. Tanvir; Abu Syed, Md			Cost-benefit of promising adaptations for resilient development in climate hotspots: evidence from lower Teesta basin in Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change adaptation; cost-benefit analysis; Hindu Kush Himalayan; lower Teesta basin; socio-economic resilience; weather extremes		It is very likely that climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods, flash floods, storms, heat and cold waves, riverbank erosion, and drought in the river basin of Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This could mean detrimental impacts to the poor and marginal people in the lower Teesta basin (LTB) in Bangladesh. Though adaptation involves financial costs, the farmers' practicing adaptation in LTB experience diminished crop loss and damage. This study was aimed at assessing the promising adaptation practices, their economic return, and social welfare in the LTB through an extended cost-benefit analysis. The study suggests that among the adaptations, shallow tube-well (STW) based irrigation practice in both sandy and loamy soil has the highest marginal adaptation cost (MAC) but the lowest benefit-cost ratio (BCR). The deep tube-well (DTW) based irrigation practice generates superior benefits to the farmers compared to the STW based farming due to initial establishment by the government which is very expensive. Maize farming as an alternate and less resource consumptive cropping produces nearly five times higher economic benefits than the costs which can be acknowledged as the most profitable and resilient adaptation option in the LTB. Though MAC is relatively low for the short-duration variety (SDV) rice among the promising adaptations, its economic profitability is 62% lower than that of the maize cultivation. However, having higher BCR the maize cultivation generates US$86 higher welfare to the farmers than the SDV rice which may strengthen the farmer's preference of maize cultivation over the SDV rice. It can be stated with high confidence that strategic adaptation planning, soft credit, technological advancement, and subsidized agricultural inputs will encourage the farmers to carry out adaptation options which may reduce climate-induced loss and damages for the farmers and build socio-economic resilience in the LTB and other similar areas of South Asia.

J	Tran, DD; Huu, LH; Hoang, LP; Pham, TD; Nguyen, AH				Dung Duc Tran; Loc Ho Huu; Long Phi Hoang; Tien Duy Pham; Au Hai Nguyen			Sustainability of rice-based livelihoods in the upper floodplains of Vietnamese Mekong Delta: Prospects and challenges	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water management; Flood; Rice; Livelihood; Sustainability; Mekong	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; AGRICULTURE; ADAPTATION; PROVINCE; SYSTEMS	Rapidly changing hydrological conditions under climate change, upstream developments, and local water infrastructures require transformative changes in water management strategies for the agriculture sector in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). For more than three decades, the agricultural policies in Vietnam have emphasized the intensification of rice production. In recent years, however, the Vietnamese government has started to pay more attention to longer-term sustainability considerations. Recent regional plans and high-level policies, including the Mekong Delta Plan and the Resolution 120 emphasize the development of high-value, sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture and food production. This shift has its challenges. One of them relates to changes in the government-mandated flood-control strategy. The increased awareness of the agricultural and environmental benefits of seasonal floods including soil fertility maintenance and pest management has resulted in new government regulations that require farmers to adopt a so-called 3-3-2 cropping cycle which means that every three years, farmers protected by high dikes should allow their rice fields to get flooded during the third rice season. Some of the farmers, however, have been reluctant to shift their farming cycle away from the triple-rice cropping system because of livelihood security-related concerns. Our study examines rice farmers' livelihood sustainability in the upper delta by applying a sustainable livelihood framework to systematically identify prospects and challenges for more sustainable flood-based livelihoods. We interviewed 160 rice farmers and conducted two focus group discussions in two communes in An Giang province. Our results show that appreciation of the benefits of the 3-3-2 cycle has increased while the results of the livelihood capital index calculations show relatively good status of livelihood sustainability of farming households, indicated by the overall 5-capital scores of over 0.4. The study also identifies other constraints to sustainable farm-based livelihoods including unstable rice markets and shortage of labor. A key finding, however, is that unless more supportive policies and enhanced viability of flood-based crops are developed, farmers will not be sufficiently motivated to change their farming practices.

In this study, microbial nitrogen processes were analyzed through intact core incubations and N-15-isotope addition at three sites in the eutrophic Sacca di Goro lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea) both under high discharge (spring) and after prolonged low discharge (late-summer) of the main freshwater inputs. Under high discharge/nitrate load, denitrification was the leading process and there was no internal recycling. The site located at the mouth of the main freshwater input and characterized by low salinity exhibited the highest denitrification rate (up to 1150 +/- 81 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)), mostly sustained by nitrification stimulated by burrowing macrofauna. In contrast, we recorded high internal recycling under low discharge, when denitrification dropped at all sites due to low nitrate concentrations, reduced bioturbation and nitrification. The highest recycling was measured at the sites close to the sea entrance and characterized by high salinity and particularly at the clams cultivated area (up to 1003 +/- 70 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). At this site, internal recycling was sustained by ammonification of biodeposits, bivalve excretion and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which represented 30% of nitrate reduction. Flash floods and high nitrate loads may overwhelm the denitrification capacity of the lagoon due to the reduced residence time and to the saturation of microbial enzymatic activity, resulting in high transport of nitrate to the sea. Prolonged dry periods favor large internal recycling, due to a combination of high temperatures, low oxygen solubility and low bioturbation, which may prolong the extent of algal blooms with negative effects on lagoon biogeochemical services. We condude that hydrological extremes, which are expected to become more frequent under climate change scenarios, strongly alter N cycling in coastal sediments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments were conducted using the litter bag method for representative plants, Carex lasiocarpa and Calamagrostis angustifolia, in both non-flooded and flooded areas between November 2011 and November 2013. Heterogeneous effects of the freeze season and its interaction with hydrological regimes on the decomposition of the litter of various species and organs were observed. The litter decomposition occurred during the freeze season and made a significant contribution to the loss throughout the year. The two-year mass-loss of C. lasiocarpa and C. angustifolia and their organs re ordered differently between the freeze season and the freeze-free season. The proportion of litter mass-loss during the freeze season accounting for the whole year in the flooded area were greater than that in the non-flooded area, except for the C. angustifolia root litter. The litter mass-losses of entire C. lasiocarpa and C. angustifolia during the freeze season were greater than those during the freeze-free season in the flooded area, while the pattern was opposite in the non-flooded area. The effect of environmental factors on litter decomposition might override the effects of litter substrate quality. The total N and P of the litter of the entire C. lasiocarpa and entire C. angustifolia increased significantly relative to the initial values after two years and tended to enrich more in the litter under flooded conditions than under non-flooded conditions.

These risks include contamination of water, food, and the environment, often causing outbreaks of diarrheal disease. Evidence regarding the effects of flooding on individual diarrhea-causing pathogens is limited, but is urgently needed in order to plan and implement interventions and prioritize resources before climate-related disasters strike. This study applied a causal inference approach to data from a multisite study that deployed broadly inclusive diagnostics for numerous high-burden common enteropathogens. Relative risks (RRs) of infection with each pathogen during a flooding disaster that occurred at one of the sites-Loreto, Peru-were calculated from generalized linear models using a comparative interrupted time series framework with the other sites as a comparison group and adjusting for background seasonality. During the early period of the flood, increased risk of heat-stable enterotoxigenic E. coli (ST-ETEC) was identified (RR = 1.73 [1.10, 2.71]) along with a decreased risk of enteric adenovirus (RR = 0.36 [0.23, 0.58]). During the later period of the flood, sharp increases in the risk of rotavirus (RR = 5.30 [2.70, 10.40]) and sapovirus (RR = 2.47 [1.79, 3.41]) were observed, in addition to increases in transmission of Shigella spp. (RR = 2.86 [1.81, 4.52]) and Campylobacter spp. (RR = 1.41 (1.01, 1.07). Genotype-specific exploratory analysis reveals that the rise in rotavirus transmission during the flood was likely due to the introduction of a locally atypical, non-vaccine (G2P[4]) strain of the virus. Policy-makers should target interventions towards these pathogens-including vaccines as they become available-in settings where vulnerability to flooding is high as part of disaster preparedness strategies, while investments in radical, transformative, community-wide, and locally-tailored water and sanitation interventions are also needed.

A set of twenty Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations within the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) following the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 emission scenario is used. Annual and seasonal changes are computed between climate simulations under 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming, with respect to 0.5 degrees C warming, compared to pre-industrial levels. The results show that annual precipitation is likely to decrease under both magnitudes of warming; this decrease is also found during the main rainy season (July, August, September) only and is more pronounced under 2 degrees C warming. All reference evapotranspiration calculations, from Penman, Hamon, and Hargreaves formulations, show an increase in the future under the two GWLs, except annual Penman evapotranspiration under the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario. Furthermore, seasonal and annual water balances (P-ET) generally exhibit a water deficit. This water deficit (up to 180 mm) is more substantial with Penman and Hamon under 2 degrees C. In addition, analyses of changes in extreme precipitation reveal an increase in dry spells and a decrease in the number of wet days. However, Senegal may face a slight increase in very wet days (95th percentile), extremely wet days (99th), and rainfall intensity in the coming decades. Therefore, in the future, Senegal may experience a decline in precipitation, an increase of evapotranspiration, and a slight increase in heavy rainfall. Such changes could have serious consequences (e.g., drought, flood, etc.) for socioeconomic activities. Thus, strong governmental politics are needed to restrict the global mean temperature to avoid irreversible negative climate change impacts over the country. The findings of this study have contributed to a better understanding of local patterns of the Senegal hydroclimate under the two considered global warming scenarios.

Therefore, it is essential to optimize proper irrigation management to improve the grain yield, crop water productivity (WPc), economic crop water productivity (EWPc), and lower global warming potential (GWP) and GWP Intensity (GWPI). The effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on GHG emissions remains largely unknown, even though this knowledge is essential to optimize the irrigation management. To address this knowledge gap, a field experiment was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) for three winter wheat seasons to measure the influence of different irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling on WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI. Irrigation scheduling including 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity (FC) were kept in the main plots and irrigation methods, including sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation methods in the sub-plots. The results revealed that relative to sprinkler irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC significantly (p < 0.05) improved the yield 4.89-7.52%, WPc 1.0-5.4%, EWPc 1.1-5.49%, lower GWP 7.47-9.34%, and GWPI 10.92-15.23%. Compared with flood irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.34-6.81%, WPc 5.65-15.1%, EWPc 5.73-15.12%, lower GWP 10.36-15.16%, and GWPI 16.22-19.40%. Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) presented that compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling, drip irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling provides the best results for improved the yield, WPc, and EWPc, and optimal balance in GWP and GWPI. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling of 60% FC combined with drip irrigation is suggested for sustained wheat yield, improved WPc and EWPc, and mitigated GWP in the NCP.

Tectonic framework of geomorphic evolution of the Deccan Volcanic Province, India	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Morphotectonics; Deccan Volcanic Province; India; Structural and lithological controls on; landscape evolution	LOWER NARMADA VALLEY; WESTERN INDIA; CONTINENTAL-MARGIN; PENINSULAR INDIA; BASALT PROVINCE; PANVEL-FLEXURE; FLUVIAL SYSTEMS; MONSOON FLOODS; MANTLE PLUMES; RIVER-BASINS	The geomorphology of the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) has its foundation in the eruption of flood basalts that covered nearly half of the Indian Peninsula during the Cretaceous - Paleogene transition and the asymmetric eastward tilt of the Peninsula. The northward trajectory of the Indian plate through the tropics leading to its collision with the Asian plate and the emergence of the Himalayan ranges are known to have resulted in sig-nificant climate changes through the Cenozoic. The DVP terrain preserves an imperfect, patchy record of these events and their impact on Cenozoic landscape evolution within an emergent continental block. The subhorizontal disposition of the stacks of lava flows in the DVP was interpreted to manifest the post-eruptive tectonic stability of this terrain. Earlier interpretations of the geomorphic characters of this terrain, with its step-like slope-profiles were consequently attributed to dominant climatic control. We review the regional topographic framework with additional inputs from the structural framework of the Deccan flood ba -salts, characters of the major rivers draining the province largely based on their high scale longitudinal profiles and Quaternary hinterland sedimentary basins within the DVP. It is evident that the erstwhile interpretation of the DVP as a singular morphotectonic unit where the antecedent drainage responded to Cenozoic tropical climate change with subsidiary tectonic controls requires re-examination. The component blocks of the DVP have differing morphotectonic characters because of the subtle diversity in their relative uplift / sag trajectories and structural characters. The influence of the monsoon climate (with alternating stronger and weaker phases) on landscape evolution in the subprovinces of the DVP is likely to be less significant than was earlier believed. The Deccan landscape reflects the Cenozoic reactivation of ancient tectonic zones that bound the constituent blocks of the province. Its landscape is carved by an antecedent tropical drainage, that was modified by Paleogene and Neogene intracontinental block movements driven by far-field stresses derived from the ridge-push of the Indian Ocean in the south and slab-pull of the subducting Indian Plate in the north. The Deccan landscape provides an example of how lithological and climatic controls on drainage evolution are overprinted by weak midcontinental tectonics.

Therefore, a good preservation of various observed rainfall characteristics including rainfall time-series statistics and rainfall event characteristics at individual stations and the inter-site correlations of these rainfall characteristics is very crucial. To achieve this purpose, this study aims to develop a multi-site stochastic daily rainfall model by coupling a univariate Markov chain with a multi-site rainfall event model (MSDRM-MCREM), based on our previously-developed single-site SDRM-MCREM. The univariate Markov chain model in MSDRM-MCREM is used to generate spatially-correlated multi-site rainfall occurrence time series and extract simulated rainfall events for individual stations based on continuous wet days. The multi-site rainfall event model is then constructed using Vine copulas to simulate spatially-correlated rainfall event characteristics of those simulated rainfall events that occur simultaneously at multiple stations, including rainfall durations, rainfall depths and temporal patterns. Subsequently, this model was applied to the Changshangang River basin in Zhejiang Province, East China and its performance in reproducing rainfall characteristics and spatial correlations was evaluated for three cases, i.e. simulations for two, three and four stations. Results show that except for overestimation of light rainfall, MSDRM-MCREM can simultaneously well preserve rainfall time-series statistics (i.e. different rainfall percentiles, mean monthly rainfall, standard deviations and probabilities and mean values of wet days), extreme rainfall (i.e. exceedance probabilities of annual maximum 1-day, 3-day and 5-day rainfall) and rainfall event characteristics (i.e. cumulative probabilities of wet spell, dry spell and rainfall depth, temporal patterns and occurrence probabilities of rainfall types for different depth-based event classes) at individual stations. In addition, the spatial correlations of rainfall characteristics have also been well maintained, including rainfall occurrence time series and rainfall event characteristics in different groups, with the inter-site correlations of rainfall time series being slightly underestimated.

While close attention has typically been paid to infrastructural and environmental outcomes of flood events, the potential adverse human health consequences associated with post-event consumption from private groundwater sources have received minimal attention, leading to a poor understanding of private well users' preparedness and the drivers of positive behavioural adoption. The current study sought to quantify the capacity of private well users to cope with flood-triggered contamination risks and identify the social psychological determinants of proactive attitudes in the Republic of Ireland, using a cross-sectional questionnaire incorporating two distinct models of health behaviour, the Health Belief Model and Risk-Attitude-Norms-Ability-Self Regulation model. Adoption of healthy behaviours prior to flooding was evaluated with respect to respondents' risk exposure, risk experience and risk perception, in addition to systematic supply stewardship under normal conditions. Associations between adoption of protective behaviours and perception, experience and socio-demographic factors were evaluated through multinomial and multiple logistic regressions, while a multi-model inferential approach was employed with the predictors of health behaviour models. Findings suggest that floods are not considered likely to occur, nor were respondents worried about their occurrence, with 72.5% of respondents who reported previous flooding experience failing to adopt protective actions. Prior experience of well water contamination increased adoption of proactive attitudes when flooding occurred (+47%), with a failure to adopt healthy behaviours higher among rural non-agricultural residents (136%). Low levels of preparedness to deal with flood-related contamination risks are a side-effect of the general lack of appropriate well stewardship under normal conditions; just 10.1% of respondents adopted both water treatment and frequent testing, in concurrence with limited risk perception and poor awareness of the nexus between risk factors (e.g. floods, contamination sources) and groundwater quality. Perceived risk, personal norms and social norms were the best predictors of protective behaviour adoption and should be considered when developing future awareness campaigns.

Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the presence of possible trends in the annual, seasonal, maximum, and minimum flow of Yangtze River at Cuntan and Zhutuo stations in China for the period 1980 to 2015. The assessment was carried out using the Mann-Kendall trend test, and the innovative trend analysis, while Sen's slope is used to estimate the magnitude of the changes. The results of the study revealed that there were increasing and decreasing trends at Cuntan and Zhutuo stations in different months. The mean annual flow was found to decrease at a rate of -26.76 m(3)/s and -17.37 m(3)/s at both stations. The minimum flow was found to significantly increase at a rate of 30.57 m(3)/s and 16.37 m(3)/s, at a 95% level of confidence. Maximum annual flows showed an increasing trend in both regions of the Yangtze River. On the seasonal scale, the results showed that stations are more sensitive to seasonal flow variability suggesting a probable flooding aggravation. The winter season showed an increasing flow trend, while summer showed a decreasing trend. The spring flow was found to have an increasing trend by the Mann-Kendall test at both stations, but in the Zhutuo Station, a decreasing trend was found by way of the innovative trend analysis method. However, the autumn flow indicated a decreasing trend over the region by the Mann-Kendall (MK) test at both stations while it had an increasing trend in Cuntan by the innovative trend analysis method. The result showed nonstationary increasing and decreasing flow trends over the region. Innovative trend analysis method has the advantage of detecting the sub-trends in the flow time series because of its ability to present the results in graphical format. The results of the study indicate that decreasing trends may create water scarcity if proper adaptation measures are not taken.

Several studies have been developed on the assessment of trends in the occurrence of extreme events. However, most of these studies used traditional models, such as Poisson or negative binomial models. Thus, the main objective of this study is to use a space-time data counting approach in the modeling of the number of days with extreme precipitation as an alternative to the commonly used statistical methods. The study area is the Northeast Brazil region, and the analysis was carried out for the period between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 2010, by assessing the frequency of extreme precipitation represented by the R10 mm, R20 mm and R* indices.

Nanjing, China, has suffered from the frequent urban flood in recent years, which has hindered its sustainable development. This study assessed urban flood resilience in Nanjing based on the resilience dimensions of social, economic, natural, physical, human, political and institutional resilience. Results revealed that urban flood resilience and subdomain resilience showed the increasing trend from 1990 to 2017. Natural, social, natural, physical and political resilience influenced urban flood resilience a lot before 2006, while economic institutional, human and physical resilience made significant contributions after 2006. Economic, political and physical resilience showed the significant direct effect on urban flood resilience and political resilience had the mediating effect in economic and physical resilience.

Discount Rate Selection for Investments in Climate Change Adaptation and Flood Risk Reduction Projects	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NATURAL DISASTERS; STOCK RETURNS; IMPACT; BONDS	The selection of an appropriate discount rate is a critical yet often neglected aspect of valuing flood protection and climate adaptation projects. We examine current discounting practices in flood risk management and climate adaptation literature and compare these practices with a proposed fair market value (FMV) discounting approach, in which we discount project cash flows based on their levels of systematic market risk, consistent with practice in the private sector. Using publicly available data, we demonstrate minimal correlation between flood risk-related cash flows and overall market returns, suggesting flooding-related cash flows are most appropriately discounted near the risk-free rate. We consider the example of a proposed storm surge barrier in Boston Harbor and compare prevailing public-sector discounting approaches with this FMV approach. Our results suggest prevailing discounting approaches systematically undervalue flood risk reduction benefits and climate adaptation investments relative to the private-sector valuation implied via the FMV approach.

Now researchers believe nearly every rainfed almond tree on the island will be dead within as few as five years. The introduced bacteria Xylella fastidiosa, enabled by its spittle-bug vector, and emboldened by climate change, has flooded the xylem of these rainfed trees, impeding the flow of fluid and nutrients to the point where the tree can no longer survive. This article enrolls feminist theorizations of care and agential realism to broaden the political scope and stakes of a plant epidemic. I argue that by attending to the care relations underlying pathogenicity we can shift from narratives of landscape purification toward a more-than-human politics of care.

Nonstationary weather and water extremes: a review of methods for their detection, attribution, and management	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Review							HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL TIME-SERIES; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; LAND-COVER CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-ATLANTIC; NON-STATIONARITY; TREND ANALYSIS; WIND-SPEED; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES	Hydroclimatic extremes such as intense rainfall, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and wind or storms have devastating effects each year. One of the key challenges for society is understanding how these extremes are evolving and likely to unfold beyond their historical distributions under the influence of multiple drivers such as changes in climate, land cover, and other human factors. Methods for analysing hydroclimatic extremes have advanced considerably in recent decades. Here we provide a review of the drivers, metrics, and methods for the detection, attribution, management, and projection of nonstationary hydroclimatic extremes. We discuss issues and uncertainty associated with these approaches (e.g. arising from insufficient record length, spurious nonstationarities, or incomplete representation of nonstationary sources in modelling frameworks), examine empirical and simulation-based frameworks for analysis of nonstationary extremes, and identify gaps for future research.

Towards reliable global allowances for sea level rise	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article						Extreme sea level parameters; GESLA-2 tide gauge data set; Tide-surge-ocean modelling; Coastal flood protection	NORTH-ATLANTIC	Tide gauge data and information from tide, surge and ocean models have been used to calculate and validate the Gumbel scale parameters of extreme sea level distributions along the world coastline. The inclusion of ocean model information is found to result in significantly improved correspondence between observed and modelled scale parameters to that obtained using tide and surge model information alone. The scale parameters so obtained are shown to be consistent with findings reported previously, such as in assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, the considerably improved provision of scale parameters along the coast means that coastal planners, and others concerned with impacts of sea level rise, can now undertake more complete investigations of the likely increase in sea level exceedance frequencies. In addition, coastal engineers will have access to more reliable estimates of the 'sea level allowances' needed to design defences for protecting coastal populations.

Archaeological investigation of the Sasanian landscape in the Mughan Steppe, Iranian Azerbaijan, contributes to a growing body of data documenting the urban collapse affected by environmental factors during Late Antiquity. Using results from surveys and excavations at Ultan Qalasi, we focus on the possible correlation between flooding and settlement collapse during the Sasanian era in the Mughan Steppe. In addition, we draw on available CORONA imagery. The results from archaeological investigations indicate that almost all of the Sasanian settlements and irrigation systems were abandoned after a period of intense activity. We argue that the flooding and further riverbed incisions of the Aras River was one of the causes of the abandonment.

J	Raudkivi, P; Vanamölder, K; Plath, U				Raudkivi, Priit; Vanamolder, Kaarel; Plath, Ulrike			CAUSE AND EFFECT: HISTORICAL CLIMATOLOGY AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE	ACTA HISTORICA TALLINNENSIA			English	Article								Although the modern notion that climate has historically been in a state of constant change has become part of common knowledge, this has not always been the case. The problem of climate change was first brought to the attention of the scientific community by the Baltic-German geographer and climatologist Eduard Bruckner in a public lecture at the University of Tartu in 1888. From then on, the notion that climate has historically undergone many changes gathered momentum and over time became dominant. However, in order to cope with climate change, now and in the future, it is necessary to have knowledge of the past. Historical climate studies are now being carried out all over the world. Human-climate interaction has not always been approached in a dynamic way: climate determinologists, for example, have seen climate as taking precedence over society, and have treated humans as objects rather than subjects. The notion that human beings react to the climate and try to find solutions in order to emerge from its plagues with as little damage as possible became established as a scientific research problem in the second half of the zoth century, yet there are several ways to explain the interaction between man and climate. Climate change can be understood, for example, by relying on data stored in nature's own archives. There are many possibilities, and palaeoclimatology, as a science concerned with the analysis of data from nature, has today developed into a science using very specific research methods. By building on palaeo data to explain climate variability, a framework can be created to explain the environmental factors that have influenced social life. Since the invention of the means of recording weather conditions (thermometers, barometers, etc.), man has begun to observe weather and climate. These data have already made it possible to monitor climate dynamics in more concrete terms. However, the data in question are of late origin (sporadic data began to accumulate in the second half of the 17th century) and do not directly reflect the relationship between society and climate. A third possibility is to use weather and climate records compiled by man. This line of research is known as historical climatology and it developed into its current state within the last half century. The emancipation of historical climatology has been a longprocess. The societal impact of sudden natural events (volcanic activity, floods, etc.) is being studied as is the societal impact caused by prolonged deviations from normal conditions. A logical framework for monitoring the interaction between climate and society has been developed starting with the identification of changes in the natural environment, from where it is possible to observe the societal developments to which this has led. Such research is deeply interdisciplinary, involving the social sciences. However, convincing research results require the availability of source material and so increasing attention is being paid to the creation of datasets with a global reach as well as to linking them. The present collection of three articles is the first attempt in the Estonian scientific community to introduce historical climatology as a discipline in its own right, to show its potential for making sense of historical processes, and thus to stimulate research in this field in Estonia too.

J	Snelling, R; Rismanchi, B; Holzer, D				Snelling, Robert; Rismanchi, Behzad; Holzer, Dominik			Integrating asset-specific flood vulnerability assessments with value-based preservation processes to develop the Heritage Building Flood Robustness Toolkit	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE			English	Article						Heritage buildings conservation; Adaptation; Vulnerability assessments; Flooding; Values-based decision-making	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES; RESILIENCE; RESOURCES; RISK	Climate change is posing a growing threat to cultural heritage buildings, and many cities lack the capacity to manage these risks. One significant challenge is flooding, which can cause significant damage to heritage buildings. A literature review identified gaps in current research on heritage adaptation, including: a lack of tools for assessing the vulnerability of asset-specific cultural heritage buildings to flooding and providing recommendations for adaptation; limited examples of successful architectural adaptation of cultural heritage buildings to flooding impacts; and insufficient consideration of values, such as aesthetic, in adaptation tools. In response to these gaps, we developed a Heritage Building Flood Robustness Toolkit that incorporates both architectural and engineering considerations. The Toolkit is designed as a decision support tool to assist asset owners and key stakeholders, such as community groups, to make more quantified and informed decisions on heritage adaptation. The Toolkit includes three key advancements: an enhanced component-based methodology for individual cultural heritage building flood vulnerability assessments; improved recommendation of adaptation strategies aided by component-based risk assessments; and integration of user values, including aesthetic implications, into adaptation recommendations through adopting a Structured Decision-Making process. The Toolkit was tested on two buildings in Cockatoo Island, Sydney (Australia) with different materials and construction techniques. The results highlight the Toolkit's ability to support decision-making through more precisely assessed adaptation strategies based on asset-specific flood damage assessments and its sensitivity to user preferences, particularly aesthetic impacts from adaptation implementation. The Toolkit can be used as an instrument by planners, designers, and councils to enhance the protection of cultural heritage against flooding in the future.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Under the influence of climate change, rising temperatures and glacier shrinkage in arid regions have increased the spring river supply to lakes. However, intense evaporation in summer and seasonal fluctuations in lake water levels alter the magnitude and direction of carbon emissions. Yet, the mechanisms of temperature and groundwater level factors on arid zone lake wetlands remain unclear. This study, through field monitoring, found that during soil freezing periods, Phragmites reduced emissions by 95.21% and increased emissions by 3.91% during thawing periods. Tamarix Chinensis and bare land exhibited a decrease in carbon uptake of 42.77% and 85.25% during soil freezing periods, and a decrease in carbon uptake of 41.98% and 2.17% during thawing periods. By constructing a freeze-thaw simulation device, we simulated CO2 emissions characteristics under different water level conditions during freeze-thaw processes, including water injection at 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm (corresponding to water levels 40 cm, 30 cm, 20 cm, 10 cm below the soil surface), as well as scenarios of anhydrous and flooding periods. The results showed that under freeze-thaw conditions, Phragmites exhibited the strongest carbon uptake when water was injected at 20 cm, transitioning from emissions during the anhydrous period to carbon uptake. Tamarix Chinensis exhibited the strongest carbon uptake during freeze-thaw cycles when water was injected at 10 cm, showing a 93.69% increase compared to the anhydrous period. Meanwhile, the bare land exhibited the strongest carbon uptake during freeze-thaw cycles in the no water period. Lower temperatures and higher water levels favor increased carbon uptake in lake wetlands. This study identifies optimal water levels for carbon uptake in lake wetlands during freeze-thaw, and the important role of water level and temperature conditions on carbon emissions, providing valuable insights for assessing the carbon feedback mechanisms in lake wetlands under future climate change.

In this study we used optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and grain size and sedimentary facies analysis of four borehole cores, combined with an analysis of landform morphology, to reconstruct the history of the ancient abandoned YRD. The results indicate that after the delta was abandoned due to the reduced sediment supply by the Yellow River in 893 AD, a sandy coast developed under the influence of wave erosion, and offshore shell ridges were formed beyond the coastline. During the interval from the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) to the Little Ice Age (LIA), driven by climate change and storm surges, the shell ridges migrated laterally, widened and rose, while sediment accumulation in the landward-side interfluvial floodplains was relatively weak. This configuration subsequently constituted a coastal highland - plain depression system. After 1077 AD, this system, together with the abandoned delta, was eroded by the Daqing River estuary. After 1855 AD, the abandoned delta landform system was completely buried by Yellow River sediments, and the wave-controlled sandy coast was transformed to a tide-controlled silt-mud coast. We summarize these findings in the form of a geomorphic model of the evolution of the abandoned delta from the MWP to the LIA. Overall, our results highlight the geomorphic effects of the sediment-laden river delta and the response of the abandoned delta geomorphic system on the millennial timescale, and they provide a theoretical foundation for predicting the geomorphic evolution of a major river delta on different timescales, against the background of global change.

In this study, a random forest (RF) model was used to investigate the changes of the relationship between water level and discharge of the Yangtze River and local tributaries in Poyang Lake, China, based on daily hydrological data from 1980 to 2018. The results indicated that RF exhibited robust capability for water level prediction in Poyang Lake, with average R-2 of 0.95, 0.88, 0.92, and 0.94 for the dry, rising, wet, and recession seasons, respectively. Predictor importance analysis showed that the discharge of the Yangtze River had greater influence on the water level than the discharge of local tributaries except for the dry season in Poyang Lake, where the influence on the water level was evident with discharge less than 5,000 m(3)/s. The influence of the Yangtze River also showed a clear attenuation pattern as the distance from the outlet of the lake increased, where the water level was constantly regulated by the Yangtze River. In addition, the partial dependence plots also indicated that the Yangtze River discharge changes after the TGD operation have resulted in remarkable water level decreases in the wet and recession seasons, especially for the recession period. Meanwhile, a slight increase in water level was predicted under identical discharge of local catchment in the dry season, which was only concentrated in the outlet of the lake.

The high sensitivity of the mountain cryosphere to climate change highlights the importance of evaluating cryospheric changes and any cascading effects if we are to achieve regional sustainable development goals (SDGs). The southern Altai Mountains (SAM), which are located in the arid to semi-arid region of central Asia, are vulnerable to ecological and environmental changes as well as to developing economic activities in northern Xinjiang, China. Furthermore, cryospheric melting in the SAM serves as a major water resource for northeastern Kazakhstan. Here, we systematically investigate historical cryospheric changes and possible trends in the SAM and also discover the opportunities and challenges on regional water resources management arising from these changes. The warming climate and increased solid precipitation have led to inconsistent trends in the mountain cryosphere. For example, mountain glaciers, seasonally frozen ground (SFG), and river ice have followed significant shrinkage trends as evidenced by the accelerated glacier melt, shallowed freezing depth of SFG, and thinned river ice with shorter durations, respectively. In contrast, snow accumulation has increased during the cold season, but the duration of snow cover has remained stable because of the earlier onset of spring melting. The consequently earlier melt has changed the timing of surface runoff and water availability. Greater interannual fluctuations in snow cover have led to more frequent transitions between snow cover hazards (snowstorm and snowmelt flooding) and snow droughts, which pose challenges to hydropower, agriculture, aquatic life, the tail-end lake environment, fisheries, and transboundary water resource management. Increasing the reservoir capacity to regulate interannual water availability and decrease the risk associated with hydrological hazards related to extreme snowmelt may be an important supplement to the regulation and supply of cryospheric functions in a warmer climate.

J	Nemri, S; Kinnard, C				Nemri, Saida; Kinnard, Christophe			Comparing calibration strategies of a conceptual snow hydrology model and their impact on model performance and parameter identifiability	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological model calibration; Equifinality; Temperature sensitivity; Snowmelt; GR4J; Spring floods	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; MULTIPLE-OBJECTIVE CALIBRATION; SPRING HEAVY FLOODS; SWAT MODEL; STREAMFLOW SIMULATION; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; UNCERTAINTY SOURCES; ACCOUNTING ROUTINE; SOUTHERN QUEBEC	Having a realistic estimation of snow cover by conceptual hydrological models continues to challenge hydrologists. The calibration of the free model parameters is an unavoidable step and the uncertainties resulting from the use of this optimal set remains a source of concern, especially in forecasting applications and climate changes impact assessments. This study seeks to improve the calibration of the conceptual hydrological model GR4J coupled with the Cemaneige snow model, in order to obtain a more realistic simulation of the snow water equivalent (SWE) and to reduce the uncertainty of the free parameters. The performance of the two models was tested over twelve snow-dominated basins in southern Quebec, Canada. Four calibration strategies were adopted and compared. In the first two strategies, the parameters were calibrated against observed streamflow alone using a local and a global algorithm. In the third and fourth strategies the calibration of snow and hydrological parameters was performed against observed streamflow and snow water equivalent (SWE) measured at snow course transects, first separately, and then with a multiobjective approach. An ensemble of equifinal parameters was used to compare the capacity of the global and multiobjective algorithms to improve the parameters identifiability and to assess the impact of parameter equifinality on the temperature sensitivity of spring peak streamflow. The large number of equifinal parameters found during calibration underscores the importance of structural non-identifiability of the coupled GR4J-Cemaneige model. The inclusion of snow observations within a multiobjective calibration improved the simulation of SWE, the identifiability of the parameters and their correlation with basins characteristics. Parameter equifinality caused a small but non negligible uncertainty in the simulated response of spring peak flow to warming temperatures. Parameter equifinality should be considered in climate impact studies in snow-dominated basins where poorly constrained snow parameters can affect the temperature sensitivity of streamflow.

Application of luminescence age models to heterogeneously bleached quartz grains from flood deposits in Tamilnadu, southern India: Reconstruction of past flooding	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Palaeoflood; Holocene climate change; Luminescence dating; OSL dating	OPTICALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE; JINMIUM ROCK SHELTER; SEA-LEVEL CHANGES; FACIES ANALYSIS; FLUVIAL QUARTZ; SINGLE GRAINS; RIVER-BASIN; HOLOCENE; SEDIMENTS; MONSOON	High magnitude floods are generally associated with wet periods or shift in climate. Recent events of increased flooding in southern India raises the question of these to be either associated with human impact or a general climate shift. Due to lack of instrumental/historical records beyond a certain period, one need to look for fluvial records e.g. slack water deposit, levees deposit and signature of high discharge events. Luminescence dating dates the last daylight exposure of sediments. Therefore, dating of young extreme fluvial events may be challenging due to presence of significant remnant geological luminescence resulting in overestimation of ages. The present work examines this in a variety of fluvial deposits e.g. channel sediment, overbank deposit and flood plain deposits of ephemeral system of rivers in southern India to reconstruct past flooding events. The study demonstrated successful application of various age models often used in optical dating i.e. Common Age model (CAM), Minimum Age Model (MAM) and least 5% on the calculated equivalent doses obtained in heterogeneously bleached sediment and suggests that optical dating of fluvial sediments with heterogeneous bleaching can give dependable outcomes when proper age models are utilized. Results suggests duration of the extreme floods occurred during 50-60, 100-120, 180-200, 280-300 and 750-800 years ago. The gap indicates effect of Little Ice Ages (LIA) and several flooding events at 750-800 years ago indicate the end of Medieval Warm Period (MWP). The results indicate that the flooding events increase at the boundary of major climatic changes probably because these changes are associated with an increase in the depressions and cyclonic activity. The recent increase in flooding events which are associated with depressions and cyclonic activity could be an early warning of either a major climate shift or human impact.

The interacting processes of climate change, land change, and unprecedented social and technological change pose significant obstacles to these aspirations. The pace, intensity, and scale of these sizeable risks and vulnerabilities affect the central issues in sustainable development: how and where people live and work, access to essential resources and ecosystem services needed to sustain people in given locations, and the social and economic means to improve human wellbeing in the face of disruptions. This paper addresses the question: What are the characteristics of transformational adaptation and development in the context of profound changes in land and climate? To explore this question, this paper contains four case studies: managing storm water runoff related to the conversion of rural land to urban land in Indonesia; using a basket of interventions to manage social impacts of flooding in Nepal; combining a national glacier protection law with water rights management in Argentina; and community-based relocation in response to permafrost thaw and coastal erosion in Alaska. These case studies contribute to understanding characteristics of adaptation which is commensurate to sizeable risks and vulnerabilities to society in changing climate and land systems. Transformational adaptation is often perceived as a major large-scale intervention. In practice, the case studies in this article reveal that transformational adaptation is more likely to involve a bundle of adaptation interventions that are aimed at flexibly adjusting to change rather than reinforcing the status quo in ways of doing things. As a global mosaic, transformational change at a grand scale will occur through an inestimable number of smaller steps to adjust the central elements of human systems proportionate to the changes in climate and land systems. Understanding the characteristics of transformational adaptation will be essential to design and implement adaptation that keeps society in step with reconfiguring climate and land systems as they depart from current states.

Understanding the variations and trends of climate characteristics is a step toward mitigating climate-related disasters. This study investigates the annual and seasonal spatial-temporal variability of UNEP and De Martonne climate indices from 10 synoptic stations distributed homogeneously over the Chungcheong Provinces in Korea from 1974 to 2019. The spatial assessment of the variability of climate indices was conducted using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method. The annual and sea-sonal trends were assessed using innovative trend analysis (ITA), while a further trend assessment on a seasonal scale was conducted using innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA) to reveal periodic features and trend transitions. The results of the ITA were compared to the classical Mann-Kendall (MK) and Modified Mann -Kendall (MMK) trend methods. The findings revealed that the Chungcheong Provinces is a wet climate domi-nance on an annual scale, with a high occurrence frequency of humid to extreme humid climates. However, there are variations in the climatic classes of UNEP and De Martonne indices on the seasonal timescale and across the stations. The spatial assessment indicated the dominance of moderate climatic conditions, while the heavy cli-matic condition is consistent at the far-end northeast. The ITA shows significant (95% confidence level) upward trends on an annual scale at 50 and 60% of the stations in UNEP and De Martonne indices, respectively. Moreover, an increasingly significant trend dominated the summer and autumn, while spring and winter seasons exhibited significant decreasing trends. The IPTA shows a dominant transition from the increasing area in autumn to decreasing area in winter, while summer consistently transited in the increasing region at almost all the stations. Both climate indices demonstrate homogeneous and isotropic behaviors and nearly stable condi-tions. Furthermore, ITA and MK trend statistics indicate a good positive correlation (r > 0.50). The findings of this study are important for the ongoing climate-change-related policy in the agricultural sector in Korea.

J	Bhowmik, J; Irfanullah, HM; Selim, SA				Bhowmik, Joy; Irfanullah, Haseeb Md; Selim, Samiya Ahmed			Empirical evidence from Bangladesh of assessing climate hazard-related loss and damage and state of adaptive capacity to address them	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Coping strategies; Climate extreme event; Loss and damage	NONECONOMIC LOSS; ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; JUSTICE; CHALLENGES; MIGRATION; DROUGHT; EVENTS; RISKS	Under changing climate, more frequent and severe extreme climate events have been causing both economic and non-economic losses and damages to local communities living in disaster-prone areas. Based on 14 focused group discussions, 20 in-depth interviews, and eight key informant interviews, this study sought to understand the losses and damages experienced by rural communities in three locations of Bangladesh, which are vulnerable to riverine and flash floods or cyclones, associated surges & coastal flooding, and salinity intrusion. This paper first captured people's perception about different extreme climate events and other climatic stressors affecting their lives and livelihoods. Considering the latest extreme climate events, the study estimated the economic loss and damage of individual households - in housing, agriculture, and health sectors - ranging from US$ 568 to US$ 1054 per household per event. These losses and damages were highest in the south-western coast than the two flood-prone areas in the north and north-east, since multiple hazards were causing relatively longer impacts on the coast. As non-economic losses and damages, change in productive land, stressed mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing, sacrificing celebrations, temporary migration, and permanent change in profession were common in all three locations. The study also found that increased adaptive capacity enabled households to address their extreme climate event-related impacts. Households of the study locations, who got exposed to information and communication technology, as participants of a grassroots development project, have improved their coping and adaptation strategies by using the accessed information, technologies, and training. They improved their income by changing agricultural practices and diversifying livelihood options. They also developed leadership, entrepreneurial skills, and connectivity with different social and institutional networks. Building on this evidence, this paper proposed a conceptual framework showcasing the relationships of adaptive capacity with anticipated higher loss and damage scenarios under changing climate. This research concluded that more investment on raising adaptive capacity of households living in climate vulnerable locations is highly required to minimize loss and damage in the projected climate change scenarios.

A spatially explicit analysis of wheat and maize yield sensitivity to changing groundwater levels in Hungary, 1961-2010	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sinking water table; Climatic stress; Root depth; Food production; Ecosystem services; Drought mitigation	NORTH CHINA PLAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-TABLE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SANJIANG PLAIN; SURFACE-WATER; AQUIFER; IMPACT; DEPTH; RECHARGE	Groundwater (GW) in many regions is essential for agricultural productivity, especially during drought periods. The shrinking of GW is an important but rarely documented component of the recent global environmental crisis and may threaten food security. The problem cannot be put in proper perspective, because we rarely have datasets long and detailed enough to scrutinise the unfolding effects at regional scales. To address this knowledge gap, we used a 50-y long (1961-2010) and spatially extensive (283 GW wells) dataset from Hungary to examine the GW trends and the sensitivity of the yields of two important crops to GW fluctuations. During 1986-2010, GW levels were significantly (0.21-0.60 m) lower than during 1961-1985 in every region of Hungary and every month of the year. The decrease was 2.24 cm y(-1) at the country level. Linear and bootstrap resampling tests indicated weak relationship between GW levels and wheat yields but decreasing GW levels accounted for 18-38% of maize yield variability during the 'climate change affected' period of 1986-2010. Calculating the impact of GW on potential food production, a 100 mm higher GW levels would have increased annual maize yields by 023 t ha(-1) on the Hungarian Plain. However, the registered GW decrease caused an estimated maize yield loss of 0.65 t ha(-1), i.e. 11.6% of the average annual yield during 1986-2010. GW level fluctuations on the plain showed a significant correlation with August-October soil moisture gridded data over much of the agricultural landscapes of Central and Western Europe, indicating a similar situation in a wider European context To mitigate the cumulative negative impact of GW decrease and the rising temperature, GW recharge via infiltration of retained water would be an adequate solution. Areas of former floodplains with low agroecological suitability, amounting to almost a quarter of the Hungarian Plain could serve as such water retention areas. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Organisms may respond to such changes through habitat selection, favouring those areas less affected by ECEs; however, documenting habitat selection in response to ECEs is difficult in the wild due to the rarity of such events and the long-term biological data required. Sea level rise and changing weather patterns over the past decades have led to an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding events, with serious consequences for ground nesting shorebirds. Shorebirds therefore present a useful natural study system to understand habitat selection as a response to ECEs. We used a 32-year study of the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) to investigate whether habitat selection can lead to an increase in nest elevation and minimize the impacts of coastal flooding. The mean nest elevation of H. ostralegus has increased during the last three decades. We hypothesized that this change has been driven by changes in H. ostralegus territory settlement patterns over time. We compared various possible habitat selection cues to understand what information H. ostralegus might use to inform territory settlement. There was a clear relationship between elevation and territory settlement in H. ostralegus. In early years, settlements were more likely at low elevations but in more recent years the likelihood of settlement was similar between high and low elevation areas. Territory settlement was associated with conspecific fledgling output and conspecific density. Settlement was more likely in areas of high density and areas with high fledgling output. This study shows that habitat selection can minimize the effects of increasingly frequent ECEs. However, it seems unlikely that the changes we observe will fully alleviate the consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Rates of nest elevation increase were insufficient to track current increases in maximum high tide (0.5 vs. 0.8 cm/year). Furthermore, habitat selection cues that rely on information from previous breeding seasons (e.g. conspecific fledgling output) may become ineffective as ECEs become more frequent and environmental predictability is diminished.

J	Meresa, HK				Meresa, Hadush Kidane			River flow characteristics and changes under the influence of varying climate conditions	NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING			English	Article						climate change; flood; hydrological extreme; Poland; water management	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; FLOODS; PROJECTIONS; EUROPE; UNCERTAINTY; INDEXES; RISK	This study aims at the spatial-temporal evaluation of projected hydrological flow characteristics under varying climate projections driven by RCP 4.5 scenario for 10 selected catchments in Poland using deterministic and stochastic concepts: to assess dependency characteristics of flow variables; to classify flood type regimes using flood duration and magnitude; and to assess and evaluate the changes in hydrological characteristics in the near and far future periods. The results show a stronger correlation between the hydrological flow variables in the mountainous catchments than lowland located catchments. While flood volume and number of events have moderate dependency due to the role of groundwater plays a major role on the water balance of the catchment. Both, peak flow and flood duration are occurred more frequent and prolonged in most of the selected catchments in Poland but were relatively small in Guber and Narewka catchments. Quantiles of peak flow and duration were estimated and associated uncertainty was identified for each catchment, which is crucial for hydraulic infrastructure design and flood adaptation and protection. Recommendations for water resource managers and the scientific community It is important to correct raw climate model outputs using distributed quantile mapping technique and its use to simulate projected river flow to minimize the climate model uncertainty. Always it is better to compare the flow quantiles derived from a peak over the threshold and annual maximum time series for hydraulic structure design and infrastructure development in specific catchment. A changing climate leads to accelerated flood occurrence, intensity, duration, volume, number of events, and magnitude, which can affect the stability of infrastructure and economic development of the area. The results obtained presented some reference information which can serve as grounds for basing the hydrological modeling, extreme management, and water resources design and planning. It can be concluded that the assortment of changes is mainly related to river flow dynamics and regimes in the catchments. The extracted variables together with design hydrological flow variable should be used to assess future climate change impact risk management and adaptation, management using flow recurrence probability, thereby reducing the risk of failure in the future. & x2713;& x2713;& x2713;& x2713;& x2713;	[Meresa, Hadush Kidane] Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Hydrol & Water Resource, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Meresa, Hadush Kidane] Ethiopian Construct Design Supervis Work Corp, Hydroinformat, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS	Meresa, HK (corresponding author), Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, POB 1962, Beijing, Peoples R China.	kidane.hadush@gmail.com		Meresa, Hadush/0000-0003-1826-8761					46	10	10	0	9	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0890-8575	1939-7445		NAT RESOUR MODEL	Nat.

Closure disrupted the supply chains of agricultural and manufacturing industries. This research quantified the economic loss experienced by the region's economy due to the disruption of waterway transportation services. We used a multi-regional input-output model to analyze impacts for the state's congressional districts. The study found expected losses in employment of 63 to 750 jobs, $14.5 million to $165 million in output, and $5.7 million to $68.7 million in value-added to the economy, depending on the expected duration of closure and on assumptions regarding the sourcing of intermediate goods and services. Economic impacts were disproportionately experienced in different congressional districts and across economic sectors, depending on how tightly integrated those districts were to the manufacturing or agricultural sectors.

In this paper, we present a new land simulator called the Integrated Land Simulator (ILS). The ILS consists of multiple models that represent processes related to land (hereafter, referred to as "land models"). They are coupled by a general-purpose coupler, Jcup, and executed using the Multiple Program Multiple Data approach. Currently, ILS includes a physical land surface model, the Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff model, and a hydrodynamic model, the Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain model, and the inclusion of additional land models is planned. We conducted several test simulations to evaluate the computational speed and scalability and the basic physical performance of the ILS. The results will become a benchmark for further development.

Restoring degraded riparian forest ecosystems of the Western Ghats for ecological sustainability	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						diversity; flood; forest; management; river	RESTORATION	The riparian ecosystems of the Western Ghats are highly diversified tropical forest ecosystems. The synergic effect of various threats may adversely affect and reduce the capacity of these riparian ecosystems to resilience, even though they have specific adaptations for living in extreme conditions. These diversity-rich riparian ecosystems provide critical ecological services such as influencing environmental processes, acting as habitats for both terrestrial and aquatic biota, and supporting the livelihood of the surrounding community. Hence the restoration of such damaged ecosystems is highly significant. This article presents a scheme for sustainable restoration of the disturbed riparian ecosystems with the involvement of multi-stakeholders. The three-stage scheme ensures the support and livelihood of the local community, along with the ecological restoration of riparian ecosystems using nature-based solutions with a scientific approach. The restoration will enhance the ecosystem services, climate change adaptations, and resilience, as well as the carbon sequestration capacity of the tropical region.

Community-planned interventions to build resilience to floods following climate shocks and stresses play a role in major global development programmes but evidence on their costs and benefits is limited. This paper presents a way of combining evidence from participatory methods to understand changes that have occurred with more formal economic modelling and can be widely used for community-planned interventions to tackle flooding. We consider projects in flood-affected communities in Myanmar implemented as part of the Department for International Development-funded Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters programme and find estimated economic benefits over a 10-year period (based on 12-18 months of postintervention data) are significantly greater than estimated costs. The highest returns accrue to relatively small-scale infrastructure investments planned with communities and local government, drawing on donor finance with community contributions of labour.

While extreme hydrologic events such as flooding and drought have been shown to control bloom onset and success, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these relationships are still unclear for mesotrophic reservoirs. In this study, the relationships between hydrologic events and phytoplankton in Lake Allatoona and Lake Lanier, Georgia, United States, were characterized using historical and satellite datasets from 2008 to 2017 and statistical modeling. Results showed that the impact of stormflow and rainstorm events varied systematically from riverine to lacustrine reaches of the two reservoirs on weekly and monthly scales. Precipitation duration and stormflow were the most significant and best-fitting predictors of algal bloom biomass in deeper reaches of the two reservoirs, suggesting that algal blooms in more lacustrine environments may be better equipped for wet and stormy regimes than has been previously hypothesized.

Art-geoscience encounters and entanglements in the watery realm	JOURNAL OF MAPS			English	Article						Art-geoscience; geomorphology; printmaking; flooding; climate change	VALLEY; FLOOD; LIDAR	This paper critically explores a 40-year collaboration between a geomorphologist and a relief printmaker from the perspective of the emerging art-science paradigm in the geosciences. Drawing on the authors' work and practice worldwide, 'standard art-science' (the artist as communicator and observer) and emerging 'transdisciplinary/paradisciplinary' practices are explored in the watery realm. While standard art-science 'encounters' were viewed favourably from the viewpoint of community engagement, especially by commissioning bodies, they did not measurably improve the explanation of science to the public nor offer new avenues for creative investigation. In light of this, the authors undertook a series of explicitly interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary 'entanglements' by co-conceiving projects, carrying out joint fieldwork and 'data' collection and, most importantly, working together in the studio and laboratory.

Effective delivery of actions to reduce the adverse impact of flooding are dependent on a collaborative approach by Responsible Authorities and a common understanding of flood hazard and risk. Over the last few decades, flood hazard maps have established a prominent role as essential tools in supporting effective flood risk management. They have developed as a result of improved national datasets and advances in computer processing. Improvements in modelling confidence and in the spatial representation of hazard and risk-inform confident actions set out in Flood Risk Management Strategies that coordinate actions supporting adaptation to future hazard conditions. The continued development of the accurate spatial representation of flood hazard and risk is an essential component of enhancing resilience in the face of future climate change.

Flood insurance in Scotland: a cause for serious concern	SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Floods; insurance; tenancy; low incomes	RISK-MANAGEMENT; UK; VULNERABILITY	The availability of flood insurance to compensate victims for the financial losses they incur from flooding is fundamental to flood risk management in UK in underpinning government risk management measures. Yet in Scotland, insurance penetration rates in the population are low for those in the lower deciles of gross weekly income, and for those living in rented accommodation. The subsidised affordable policies available under Flood Re are not available to this fraction of the population, as they do not insure now and therefore are not eligible. The rented segment of the housing market is expanding, leaving an increasingly large number of people likely not to insure against flood damage although many will hopefully have damage to the structure of their houses covered by landlords? insurance policies. The vulnerability to flooding of Scottish households with low incomes in rented accommodation is a most unsatisfactory situation, particularly as climate change appears to have greatest impact in increasing flood severity in such deprived and disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

We draw on a unique dataset of 2,164 press releases related to the occurrence of 206 natural disasters (hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, and wildfires) over a 10-year period (2005-2014) to analyze how firm responses are shaped by the type of disaster it faces. Firms play an increasingly important role in disaster response. We find that firms engage in more anticipatory responses when the type of disaster a firm faces exhibits even impact dispersion and high expected recurrence, and provides substantial warning. Our study draws a relationship between physical geography, disaster type, and more anticipatory firm responses which can improve how firms and communities respond to the risks posed by different types of natural disasters. The article concludes by outlining an agenda for future research on firm responses to natural disasters.

Finding a reliable energy source is one of the most difficult tasks of the 21st century. Natural gas, coal and other conventional energy sources have hastened the industrialization and modernization of several countries. However, there is widespread concern that the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from these traditional sources is the leading cause of climate change. Increased pollution, flooding, drought, rising sea levels, high temperatures and other effects of climate change have a significant impact on the environment. As a result, current research is focusing on renewable and sustainable energy sources. Hydro energy is a low-cost and environmentally friendly way to generate electricity. Even still, the vast majority of hydroelectric energy remains underutilized. Hydrostatic and hydrodynamic methods are the two most common approaches for extracting energy from water. The gravitational vortex hydropower (GVHP) with hydro rotor is one such renewable turbine. By routing the water into a GVHP basin, which generates a water vortex on its inside surface while it runs, the mechanical energy of free-flowing water is converted to kinetic energy in this GVHP. The major goal of this study is to investigate the flow field characteristics of a GVHP numerically for various geometrical variables such as basin diameter, cone angle and notch angle. CATIA is used to create several geometric models, which are then simulated using a commercial computational fluid dynamics application. Different geometric factors of conical basin design were studied using computational hydrodynamic analysis, and their impacts on vortex generation and tangential velocity in the study region are recorded. The maximum tangential velocity derived from different basin geometry can be used to forecast the performance of the GVHP. Finally, the optimized GVHP along with its dimensions, such as a cone angle of 14 degrees, a notch angle of 13 degrees and a basin diameter of 1000 mm, are found out and suggested for real-time applications.

In this study, the results obtained from CMIP5 and CMIP6 based on the Canadian earth system models in calculating the amount of precipitation were compared, and the effect of these two reports on the amount of runoff was investigated. For this purpose, two models of CanESM2 and CanESM5 were used. The Flood Fre-quency Analysis (FFA) results indicated that the average Return Periods (RPs) calculated by the Annual Mean Discharge (AMD) for all distributions based on the CanESM5 are higher than those calculated by CanESM2. Besides, the average RPs by APD for all distributions except Log-Pearson3 calculated based on the CanESM5 are higher than those calculated by the CanESM2. For Monthly Mean Discharge (MMD), the average MMD calculated by CanESM5 is 2% higher than those for CanESM2. The Seasonality Mean Discharge (SMD) for CanESM2 in both summer (i.e., 0.37%) and spring (i.e., 6.8%) are larger than the CanESM5 values. The SMD for CanESM5 in both winter (i.e., 7.48%) and autumn (i.e., 4.72%) are larger than the CanESM2 values. For Monthly Peak Discharge (MPD) and Seasonality Peak Discharge (SPD), the difference between the flow discharges in CanESM2 and CanESM5 is significantly different based on the month or season as well as the station. The general comparison of the CanESM2 and CanESM5 indicates that the average MPD and average SPD related to the CanESM5 are 10% and 5% higher than those for CanESM2.

The work is based on a before-after-control-impact approach, a space-time framework that allowed the stating of four hypotheses distinguishing the effects of the considered dam from other pressures. We first examined the potential reduction to the flow regime (QL) and bedload transport (QS) from these pressures, then assessed planimetric changes (1942-2019), vertical evolution (1922-2014), and sediment size within the channel. The results show the river completed adjustments related to post-LIA climate change and catchment afforestation at the beginning of the study period, with channel narrowing affecting the whole study reach and ranging from 0.6% to 1.2% yr- 1. Upstream dams and catchment afforestation reduced both the frequency and magnitude of peak flows and sediment supply, resulting in an increase in the channel narrowing rate on the upstream sub-reach (-1.2% yr-1). However, downstream tributaries buffered these changes, and no downstream propagation was found. The effects of the Plan d'Arem started around 15 yr after its construction, with channel narrowing at a rate of 0.9% yr- 1 until the 2010s. The exceptional flood of June 2013 resulted in important channel widening followed by a new period of narrowing upstream of the Plan d'Arem dam, combined with channel stability downstream caused by a new dam management regime (flushing actions). We conclude that the before-after-control-impact approach is effective for isolating the effects of an RoR dam from those of other pressures, and that flushing actions mitigated the effects of the dam.

Predicting the phenomenon to protect downstream communities remains challenging around the globe. Surge-type glaciers are characterized by unsteady movements and frequent frontal advances, which cause natural hazards by obstructing river channels, forming ice-dammed lakes, which can cause GLOFs, posing threats downstream. The determination of the surge characteristics, timing and evolution of lakes and GLOFs is fundamental to flood control and disaster management. In this study, the case of the Khurdopin Glacier (Karakoram) is used to elucidate key behavioral characteristics of surging glaciers that usefully can be applied to understand the GLOF hazard from glaciers worldwide. Seven surge periodical cycles associated with the Khurdopin Glacier that occurred at intervals of 19-20 years between 1880 and 2020 were investigated using a GLOF dataset. The ice flow dynamics of three surge events that occurred between 1970 and 2020 were analyzed using high-resolution satellite imagery. The results indicate that the maximum and minimum surge velocities control the conduit development that drains lakes resulting in a number of GLOFs. A surge between 1998 and 2002 generated six GLOFs. A subglacial drainage model was developed to estimate the timing of the peak discharge in GLOF hydrographs. The results show that conduit melt enlargement becomes the dominant drainage process at one-third of the rising limb. These floods' high peak discharges and short durations are primarily due to the higher lake water temperature, which controls the conduit enlargement rate. Based on the current study results, the proposed model can be adopted worldwide for surge-type glaciers. The initiation of the main surge period, which leads to lake formation, can be anticipated, as the pre-surge period can be identified using remote-sensing analysis. The timing of ice-dammed lake formation and GLOFs can be estimated, providing residents and authorities time to take precautionary measures and thus limiting damage downstream.

The gathering storm: optimizing management of coastal ecosystems in the face of a climate-driven threat	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Review						Coastal erosion; flooding; hurricanes; kelp; mangrove; pine savannah; salt marsh; sand dunes; seagrass; sea-level rise; storm surge; wave attenuation	SALT-MARSH VEGETATION; SEA-LEVEL RISE; FRESH-WATER; SALINITY STRESS; BARRIER ISLANDS; REGIONAL-SCALE; GIANT-KELP; HURRICANE; SEAGRASS; PROTECTION	Background The combination of rising sea levels and increased likelihood of extreme storm events poses a major threat to our coastlines and as a result, many ecosystems recognized and valued for their important contribution to coastal defence face increased damage from erosion and flooding. Nevertheless, only recently have we begun to examine how plant species and communities, respond to, and recover from, the many disturbances associated with storm events. Scope We review how the threats posed by a combination of sea level rise and storms affects coastal sub-, inter- and supra-tidal plant communities. We consider ecophysiological impacts at the level of the individual plant, but also how ecological interactions at the community level, and responses at landscape scale, inform our understanding of how and why an increasing frequency and intensity of storm damage are vital to effective coastal management. While noting how research is centred on the impact of hurricanes in the US Gulf region, we take a global perspective and consider how ecosystems worldwide (e.g. seagrass, kelp forests, sand dunes, saltmarsh and mangroves) respond to storm damage and contribute to coastal defence. Conclusions The threats posed by storms to coastal plant communities are undoubtedly severe, but, beyond this obvious conclusion, we highlight four research priority areas. These call for studies focusing on (1) how storm disturbance affects plant reproduction and recruitment; (2) plant response to the multiple stressors associated with anthropogenic climate change and storm events; (3) the role of ecosystem-level interactions in dictating post-disturbance recovery; and (4) models and long-term monitoring to better predict where and how storms and other climate change-driven phenomena impact coastal ecosystems and services. In so doing, we argue how plant scientists must work with geomorphologists and environmental agencies to protect the unique biodiversity and pivotal contribution to coastal defence delivered by maritime plant communities.

Monthly, seasonal, annual, and decadal mean flows, calculated for the baseline (1975-2014), were compared with projections for future periods (2040s: 2021-2060 and 2080s: 2061-2100) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The spread of low flows (10th and 25th percentile of daily flows) and high flows (75th, 90th, and 100th percentiles) were analyzed for each period. The ensemble of GCMs indicates an increase in mean monthly (except in October and November), seasonal (except post-monsoon), annual, and decadal rainfalls and corresponding flows in the UARB. Future low flows are expected to have high variability while high flows are expected to have higher means than that of baseline. The density distribution analysis of baseline and future flows reveals that future periods are likely to experience an increase in the magnitude of mean flows but a decrease in variability. Rainfall extremes indicated by 1-day maximum rainfall, 5-day consecutive maximum rainfall, and the number of extreme rainfall days reveals frequent wetter extremes in the UARB under future climate conditions. Extreme floods, as estimated by the frequency analysis of daily flows, are also expected to become more frequent during the future periods. These changes in flows can be attributed solely to climate change since the analyses did not account impacts of possible land use change and water resources development in the UARB. This study is a good starting point to assess future flows, and further research is recommended to address the limitations of this study for improved understanding and assessments that will prove useful for planning purposes in the study area.

Impacts of variability and change in rainfall on gender of farmers in Anambra, Southeast Nigeria	HELIYON			English	Article						Agriculture; Sociology; Climate change	SMALL-SCALE FARMERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROUGHT; ZONES; STRATEGIES; PERCEPTION; HOUSEHOLDS; AFRICA	Men and women farmers experience different impacts of climate variability and change (CVC). Research on the differentiated impacts of variability and change in rainfall on gender is limited in the study area. This study examined perceptions and experience of men and women farmers on the impacts of CVC, using climate data and farmers' perception from a gender perspective. It examined the effect of CVC on annual and seasonal rainfall, number of rain days, onset and cessation of rainfall; perceived impacts of CVC on annual and seasonal rainfall and compared the measured (meteorological) impacts with the perceived impacts across gender. Mixed methods of qualitative and quantitative data collection and participatory rural approaches were used. Household survey of 50% men and 50% women each were conducted in six farming communities. Data analysis involved the use of annual rainfall trends, Annual Rainfall Anomaly (ARA), Standardized Annual Rainfall Anomaly (SARA), regression analysis percentages and chi-square. Results reveal the occurrences of more dry years than wet years (ARA and SARA < 0.00) in the three locations. There were wide variability and changes in inter-annual rainfall in Ogbaru (R-2 = 0.0003), Anambra East (R-2 = 0.0071) and Ayamelum (R-2 = 0.0014). Seasonal rainfall was unevenly distributed from 2007-2016. There were wide variations in dates of onset and cessation of rainy season (R-2 = 0.006) and number of rain days (R-2 = 0.009). Men and women responses revealed that there were statistically significant (p < 0.005) changes in the onset of rainy season, early cessation of annual rainfall; alteration of growing seasons; frequent flooding and frequent drought. Women felt more impact of food insecurity, water shortage and had more burden of migration due to changes in rainfall. This study concludes that respondents perceived and experienced impacts of CVC which varied across gender. Hence, it recommends the provision of sustainable water and irrigation system which should encourage women's participation in the construction, maintenance and management among others.

The aim of this study is to explore variations in plant functional trait distributions along a hydrological gradient spanning from recurrent drought events to recurrent floodingmimicking future precipitation patterns. Methods The experiment was conducted in a controlled grassland experiment over a period of 3 years. A novel and more extreme hydrological regime was achieved by manipulating the flow of a nearby stream thereby creating a continuous hydrological gradient from flooding during winter to drought during summer. Plant community responses were recorded along this hydrological gradient. Community-weighted trait distribution changes along the gradient were described using null models. Six functional traits were considered: seed mass, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA) and height. Important findings Over time, responses in plant functional traits changed at the community level. Over the study period consistent changes occurred in the mean trait value of several traits. Communities in relatively dry plots became dominated by species with water-conserving life strategies, represented by high seed mass and thick leaves. In contrast, disturbance-resistant species (high leaf dry matter content) became dominant in flooded plots, indicating that persistence to flooding was the most important factor controlling the functional structure in those communities. Furthermore, a high abundance of small-seeded species in flooded plots likely indicates higher frequency of species with higher dispersal ability through hydrochory. In conclusion, plant traits are useful for predicting responses to climate change, but abrupt and extreme climate event may cause unexpected responses because they have no analog to previously more stable conditions. We suggest that traits related to dispersal and resistance to disturbance are useful in describing responses to flooding and that these traits should be included in future investigations of plant community responses to extreme hydrological events.

The reasons are as follows: In addition to being affected by global climate change, the rapid urbanization of Zhengzhou in the last 40 years has caused tremendous changes in the city's water system, underlying surface, urban topography, vertical system, urban underground facilities, all of which will directly or indirectly become factors of urban floods. Then, in response to the increasing frequency of urban floods, it is proposed to develop an overall flood resilience strategy led by the urban stream network; to establish a "large sponge city system of watersheds" and a resilient city's disaster prevention concept; and to improve the urban flood emergency management system. This is done to adjust measures to local conditions and collaborate with various departments to improve the disaster response capacity of urban floods.

We review the evidence that implementing natural infrastructure in upstream agricultural landscapes could improve water quality and reduce flood risk for downstream communities. Based on our analysis, we identify a suite of natural infrastructure measures that provide the greatest benefits, and which could be prioritized for investment by downstream communities and regional leadership, with an emphasis on systems that minimize loss of productive agricultural land. Our results suggest that the restoration of wetlands and floodplains are likely to provide the greatest benefits for both water quality improvement and flood risk reduction.

Flood risk assessment of the European road network	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; DAMAGE; PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORT; IMPACTS; MODELS	River floods pose a significant threat to road transport infrastructure in Europe. This study presents a high-resolution object-based continental-scale assessment of direct flood risk of the European road network for the present climate, using high-resolution exposure data from OpenStreetMap. A new set of road-specific damage functions is developed. The expected annual direct damage from large river floods to road infrastructure in Europe is EUR230 million per year. Compared to grid-based approaches, the objectbased approach is more precise and provides more action perspective for road owners because it calculates damage directly for individual road segments while accounting for segment-specific attributes. This enables the identification of European hotspots, such as roads in the Alps and along the Sava River. A first comparison to a reference case shows that the new object-based method computes realistic damage estimates, paving the way for targeted risk reduction strategies.	[van Ginkel, Kees C.

Urban flood risk prediction management is pressing. The peak discharge and duration are important factors in urban flood management as well as the important characteristics of flood hygrograph. Mostly, hydrological model is used to obtain the upstream flood hygrograph to drive inundation model. However, lack of information on reservoirs, barrage structures and land use make it difficult to construct high-precision hydrological models, especially in upstream cities where data is lacking. In this study, therefore, we propose an approach to urban flood management based on measured flood data from urban hydrological stations in close proximity to derive flood hydrography for different return periods, and establish a high-precision urban-scale river flood risk management method by combining with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) survey data. This method can allow information on river construction and underlying surface change to be introduced into the flood hygrograph implicitly, thus avoiding the difficulty of establishing hydrological and hydrodynamic coupling of the whole basin. The applicability and accuracy of the methodology are explored in this article with reference to Chenxi City in the upper reaches of Yuanshui River. Comparison the flood process of the 10-year with the actual flood in 2016 indicates that the extent of inundation is strongly dependent on the instantaneous discharge, with the peak flow largely determining the maximum inundation extent and risk level. This illustrates the feasibility of risk assessment of urban flooding based on flood hygrograph with different period levels derived from measured flood processes at adjacent sites. Subsequently, the different return periods scenario is simulated and analyzed. This approach provides technical guidance for flood risk assessment in areas where data is lacking (e.g., upstream mountainous cities).

Understanding their impacts on water discharge and sediment transport is very important for sustainable development of watersheds, particularly in subtropical regions with high precipitation and high sediment loads. We here compared the long-term dynamics of water discharge and sediment transport in four large contiguous watersheds in subtropical China and explored the importance of the main influencing factors including climate, nature endowment such as geology, and human activities. Significant differences have been observed between watersheds in terms of sediment and water discharge (p < 0.001). Pairwise comparison among the four basins demonstrated significant differences in sediment modulus among 5 of the 6 pairs (p < 0.05). The sediment modulus in the Lishui Basin was significantly higher than those in other basins, mainly due to the substantial presence of steep slopes in the mountainous region, which is prone to soil erosion. Temporally, sediment transport in the four basins was well synchronized showing significant decreasing trends with abrupt change points (p < 0.001). In contrast, no trends and abrupt change points were detected in water discharge, mainly influenced by precipitation. Human activities played a predominant role to the reduction of sediment transport (80% to 102%) compared with those of climate (-2% to 19%) across the four basins. Additionally, our study also showed land cover had various basin-independent impacts on the change of sediment transport. Through crossbasin comparisons of the long-term changes in water discharge and sediment transport, our study revealed the similarities and differences in their driving mechanisms, providing valuable information for land use planning and water resource management in large subtropical basins.

The alteration of regional distributions of vegetation, crop types, and land-use patterns for construction has a significant impact on the runoff process and influences the water cycle in watersheds. Studies on runoff variations in the Hutuo River Basin have concentrated on climate change and the effect of human activities without adequate attention paid to land-use changes. In order to investigate the response of runoff to land-use changes in the upper Hutuo River Basin, a soil and water assessment model was used in this study to compare and analyze the changes in runoff under five land-use scenarios from 1980-2020. The results show that the area of farmland, forest land, and grassland in the watershed gradually decreased from 1980 to 2020, with a total decrease of 3.1%, while the area of urban construction land increased rapidly by 1.5 times. Corresponding with the trend of land-use change, the differences between the simulated and natural values for regional flood peak and annual runoff increased with time, which is in line with the changing land-use trends. From 1960-2020, the differences between the simulated and natural values for the flood peaks of the five land-use scenarios were -16.8, -6.7, -3.5, 4.6, and 9.3%, respectively, and the errors between the simulated and natural values for annual runoff were -6.7, -4.4, -2.0, -2.6, and 10.8%, respectively. Overall, the increase in urban construction land and decrease in farming, forest area, and grassland has caused the regional flood peak and annual runoff volume to increase in the upper Hutuo River Basin.

Natural infrastructure in dryland streams (NIDS) can establish regenerative wetland sinks that reverse desertification and strengthen climate resilience	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nature-based solutions; Ecosystem services; Carbon sequestration; Beaver dam analogs; Rock detention structures	SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION; UNITED-STATES; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; BEAVER DAMS; WATER; RESTORATION; MITIGATE; PATTERNS; STORAGE; FLOW	In this article we describe the natural hydrogeomorphological and biogeochemical cycles of dryland fluvial ecosystems that make them unique, yet vulnerable to land use activities and climate change. We introduce Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams (NIDS), which are structures naturally or anthropogenically created from earth, wood, debris, or rock that can restore implicit function of these systems. This manuscript further discusses the capability of and func-tional similarities between beaver dams and anthropogenic NIDS, documented by decades of scientific study. In addi-tion, we present the novel, evidence-based finding that NIDS can create wetlands in water-scarce riparian zones, with soil organic carbon stock as much as 200 to 1400 Mg C/ha in the top meter of soil. We identify the key restorative ac-tion of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects. Our synthesis portrays how restoration using NIDS can support adaptation to and protection from climate-related disturbances and stressors such as drought, water shortages, flooding, heatwaves, dust storms, wildfire, biodiversity losses, and food insecurity.

Endemic in Southeast Asia, its distribution and environmental factors such as climate controlling its dynamics remain poorly documented. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the current and future leptospirosis burden at a local scale in mainland Southeast Asia. We adjusted machine-learning models on incidence reports from the Thai surveillance system to identify environmental determinants of leptospirosis. The explanatory variables tested in ourmodels included climate, topographic, land cover and soil variables. The model performing the best in cross-validation was used to estimate the current incidence regionally in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. It then allowed to predict the spatial distribution of leptospirosis future burden from 2021 to 2100 based on an ensemble of CMIP6 climate model projections and 4 Shared Socio-economics Pathways ranging from the most optimistic to the no-climate policy outcomes (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). Leptospirosis incidence was best estimated by 10 environmental variables: four landscape-, four rainfall-, two temperature-related variables. Of all tested scenario, the worst-case scenario of climate change (SSP5-8.5) surprisingly appeared as the best-case scenario for the future of leptospirosis since it would induce a significant global decline in disease incidence in Southeast Asia mainly driven by the increasing temperatures. These global patterns are however contrasted regionally with some regions showing increased incidence in the future. Our work highlights climate and the environment as major drivers of leptospirosis incidence in Southeast Asia. Applying our model to regions where leptospirosis is not routinely monitored suggests an overlooked burden in the region. As our model focuses on leptospirosis responses to environmental drivers only, some other factors, such as poverty, lifestyle or behavioral changes, could further influence these estimated future patterns.

Sea-level rise in Denmark: paleo context, recent projections and policy implications	GEUS BULLETIN			English	Article						projection; Denmark; coast; sea level; climate scenario	ICE-SHEET; ANTARCTICA; COLLAPSE; THWAITES; SYSTEM	We present the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) sea-level projections for four Danish cities (Aarhus, Copenhagen, Esbjerg and Hirtshals) under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) family of climate scenarios. These sea-level changes pro-jected over the next century are up to an order of magnitude larger than those observed over the previous century. At these cities, year 2150 sea-level changes of between 29 and 55 cm are projected under the very low emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), whilst changes of between 99 and 123 cm are projected under the very high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5). These differences highlight the potentially significant impact of remaining opportunities for climate change mitigation. Due to this increase in mean sea level, the mean recurrence time between historically extreme events is expected to decrease. Under the very high emissions scenario, the historical 100-year storm flood event will become a 1-to 5-year event at most Danish harbours by 2100. There is considerable uncertainty associated with these sea-level projections, primarily driven by uncertainty in the future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet and future sterodynamic changes in ocean volume. The AR6 characterises collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet as a low-probability but high-impact event that could cause several metres of sea-level rise around Denmark by 2150. In climate adaptation policy, the scientific landscape is shifting fast. There has been a tremendous proliferation of diverse sea-level projections in recent years, with the most relevant planning target for Denmark increas-ing c. 50 cm in the past two decades. Translating sea-level rise projections into planning targets requires value judgments about acceptable sea-level risk that depend on local geography, planning timeline and climate pathway.

Shading in such environments can help regulate downstream flow over the course of a growing season, but our knowledge on how shadows impact the energy budget and consequently ecohydrology in montane ecosystems is very limited. We investigated the influence of horizon shade on the surface energy fluxes of a subalpine headwater wetland in the Canadian Rocky Mountains during the growing season. During the study, surface insolation decreased by 60% (32% due to evolving horizon shade and 28% from seasonality). The influence of shade on the energy budget varied between two distinct periods: (1) Stable Shade, when horizon shade was constant and reduced sunlight by 2 h per day; and (2) Dynamic Shade, when shade increased and reduced sunlight by 0.18 h more each day, equivalent to a 13% reduction in incoming shortwave radiation and 16% in net radiation. Latent heat flux, the dominant energy flux at our site, varied temporally because of changes in incoming radiation, atmospheric demand, soil moisture and shade. Horizon shade controlled soil moisture at our site by prolonging snowmelt and reducing evapotranspiration in the late growing season, resulting in increased water storage capacity compared to other mountain wetlands. With the mounting risk of climate-change-driven severe spring flooding and late season droughts downstream of mountain headwaters, shaded subalpine wetlands provide important ecohydrological and mitigation services that are worthy of further study and mapping. This will help us better understand and protect mountain and prairie water resources.

Changing climatic conditions seriously put an impact on these available ice and snow masses. These glaciers may affect downstream population by glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and surge events due to climatic variation. So, monitoring of these glaciers and available ice masses is important. This research delivers an approach for dynamics of major glaciers of the Hunza River Basin. We delineated 27 major glaciers of HRB and examined their status by using Landsat (OLI, ETM+, ETM, TM), digital elevation model (DEM) over the period of 1990-2018. In 1990, the total area covered by these glaciers is about 2589.75 +/- 86 km(2) and about 2565.12 +/- 68km(2) in 2018. Our results revealed that from 2009 to 2015, glacier coverage of HRB advanced with a mean annual advance rate of 2.22 +/- 0.1 km(2) a(-1). Conversely, from 1994 to 1999, the strongest reduction in glacier area with a mean rate of - 3.126 +/- 0.3 km(2) a(-1) is recorded. The glaciers of HRB are relatively stable compared to Hindukush, Himalayan, and Tibetan Plateau region of the world. The steep slope glacier's retreat rate is more than that of gentle slope glaciers, and the glaciers below an elevation of 5000 m above sea level change significantly. Based on climate data from 1995 to 2018, HRB shows a decreasing trend in temperature and increasing precipitation. The glacier area's overall retreat is due to an increase in summer temperature while the glacier advancement is induced possibly by winter and autumn precipitation.

Chennai extreme rainfall event of 2015 under future climate projections using the pseudo global warming dynamic downscaling method	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate change; extreme rainfall events; pseudo global warming method; weather research and forecasting	HEAVY-RAINFALL; PARAMETERIZATION SCHEMES; INCREASING TREND; MONSOON RAINFALL; WRF SENSITIVITY; INDIA; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION; IMPACT	Here we report results of a detailed numerical study on the effect of climate change on the characteristics of a very severe rainfall event that occurred in the coastal city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India in December 2015. The pseudo global warming (PGW) method was used to obtain the initial and boundary conditions of the future climate and projections were done for the far future, i.e. the year 2075 using the representative concentration pathway scenario of 8.5. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used for simulations with perturbed initial and boundary conditions by the PGW method in a dynamic downscaling framework. The sensitivities of Microphysics and cumulus parameterization schemes in WRF were first studied. The warm rain microphysics (Kessler) scheme and Kain-Fritsch (KF) cumulus scheme showed good agreement with the observed data. Once the best schemes were identified for such an extreme event and for the specific region under consideration, simulations were carried out for future and current climate conditions. Results show that the bulk Richardson number, energy helicity index, K-index, moisture convergence, vertical temperature and mixing ratio all increase significantly in future climate conditions, thereby leading to heavy precipitation. The precipitation in Chennai region increased by 17.37% on the peak rainy day (1 December 2015) in future compared to current. The key takeaway though is that on succeeding days, the amount of precipitation was seen to increase dramatically by 183.5%, 233.9% and 70.8%. This is bound to lead to severe flood events that are likely to continue for more days in the future, thereby posing further risk and potential for damage.

A 35-year time series of nitrate concentration and discharge, a 15-year time series of major elements and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were analysed from a yearly to a daily/ hourly basis during discharge recession after storm event periods, to determine the origin of elements, the time trends and the main controlling factors of the trends. A significant decrease over time of nitrate, base cations and other major anions was observed. These trends were controlled by agricultural practice changes (decrease of N -fertiliser input, grass-band set up) and discharge increase, especially in the last years of the period. On the other hand, K and DOC increased over the 15-year period. This increase might result from both 1) organic matter eroded from the soil surface by runoff during flood events and 2) an increase in mineralisation with increasing temperature. Seasonal variations and nycthemeral cycles indicated either calcite precipitation and nitrification processes and/or evapotranspiration, water and/or vegetation uptake during the day with increasing temperature. This paper highlights that the hydrochemical parameters measured at various time scales and frequencies can be used as powerful indicators of catchment internal processes, and of changes in agricultural management and climate change. Particularly, the multivariate high-resolution survey has shown its ability to evidence very tenuous processes not detectable by discrete sampling. The recent observed changes in hydrology argue for the need to continue the hydrochemical survey over decades.

The sediment consists of thin, alternating beds of evaporites (halite, gypsum), carbonates (calcite, aragonite) and detrital minerals (quartz, muscovite, chlorite). We interpret the data with respect to three main hydrologic conditions: (1) nearly complete desiccation of the lake, marked by frequent halite layers, (2) hypersaline conditions marked by gypsum abundance, (3) wet conditions, characterized by high river-borne terrigenous sediment input with high potassium content. Distinct flood layers indicate fluvial activity. From about 3800-2000 cal year BP, terrigenous sediment supply was high, with peaks at 3700-3650, 3500-3450, and 3400-3250 cal year BP. Evaporative conditions were not common. From ca. 2000 cal year BP to present, detrital minerals are less abundant, and the increase in gypsum abundance suggests drier climate with enhanced evaporation. Frequent desiccation events occurred from 1100 to 700 cal year BP. The late Holocene hydrology of Lake Maharlou corresponds well with records of dune formation and phases of river alluviation in Iran and the Arabian Peninsula, and with regional speleothem records. In addition to the influence of climate change on the lake hydrology, ancient humans modified water drainage in the catchment. Periods of subterranean tunnel (qanats) use correspond to dramatic shrinkage of the water body. We propose that climate changes drove long-term water shortages that were enhanced by anthropogenic activities, leading to more frequent desiccation of the lake during the last millennium.

This study provides a short-term (millennial to ten thousand years timescales) overview of the sedimentologic evolution in an inland basin located at a high altitude and characterized by fast sedimentation rates (Suwa Basin, central Japan). We employed a multi-disciplinary approach combining sedimentology, paleopedology, and high-resolution sequence stratigraphic analysis of the upper Pleistocene and Holocene succession to clarify the driving factors of the basin's sedimentologic evolution. The depositional systems and systems tracts were divided into meandering fluvial (lowstand systems tract; 26.7-16.5 cal kyr BP), pond/marsh (early transgressive systems tract; 16.5-13.9 cal kyr BP), lacustrine (transgressive systems tract; 13.9-5.8 cal kyr BP), and delta systems (highstand systems tract; 5.8 cal kyr BP-). The boundary between the meandering fluvial and pond/marsh systems corresponds to a transgressive surface appearing as a rising in the lake level (ca. 16.5 cal kyr BP). The boundary between the lacustrine and delta systems corresponds to a maximum flooding surface of the lake (ca. 5.8 cal kyr BP). The lake transgression occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the sediment supply, as suggested by a decrease in the sedimentation rate, the dense development of paleosols, and high TOC and TN showing a lower decomposition rate. The timing coincides with the intensification of chemical weath-ering, plant succession, and the ascending alpine tree line in the source region during the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation. The depositional sequence in the interior basin might have been easily controlled by changes in the sediment supply due to vegetation/soil cover successions during the glacial-interglacial cycle. Our findings imply that low-frequency depositional sequences observed in such inland basins in the East Asian coastal region may have also been forced by global ice volume changes.

Shifting Trade-offs: Finding the Sustainable Nexus of Hydropower and Environmental Flows in the San Joaquin River Watershed, California	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						environmental flows; environmental water; functional flows; hydropower; multiobjective reservoir; san joaquin river; water management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES; FUNCTIONAL FLOWS; SURFACE-WATER; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; RESERVOIR; HABITATS	Environmental flow management in watersheds with multi-objective reservoirs is often presented as an additional constraint to an already strained and over-allocated stream system. Nevertheless, environmental flow legislation and regulatory policies are increasingly being developed and implemented globally. In California, USA, recent legislative and regulatory policies place environmental flows at the forefront of the state's water management objectives; however, the increased reliance on hydropower to support climate change mitigation goals may complicate efforts on both issues. This study modelled alternative environmental flow strategies in the major tributaries to the San Joaquin River in California. Strategies included detailed water management rules for hydropower production, flood control, and water deliveries, and three methodological approaches to environmental flow releases: minimum instream flows ("baseline") year-round, 40% of full natural flow (FNF) during the spring runoff season and minimum releases the remainder of the year, and functional flows year-round. Results show that environmental flow strategies affect downstream flow releases in each of the San Joaquin's four sub-basins differently depending on infrastructure capacity, water management objectives, and hydrologic year types. While hydropower production was comparable or declined in the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced basins, functional flow and 40% FNF strategies increased hydropower production in the Upper San Joaquin basin by 11 %. Uncontrolled spill of high flow events decreased when high flow releases were based on hydrologic cues rather than exclusively on flood storage capacity. Water deliveries were reduced in all years regardless of environmental flow strategy. The 40% FNF and functional flow strategies both increased water released to the river relative to baseline, but in different ways. The functional flow strategy allocated water in a holistic approach that enhanced ecological functions in all years, but particularly in moderate and wet years. In contrast, the 40% FNF strategy provided increased flows relative to baseline and some ecological benefit in dry years, but less ecological benefit in other years. This study shows that alternative environmental flow strategies will have different and important trade-offs for integrated water management, and may mutually benefit seemingly conflicting objectives.

The models' capacity to characterise trends in annual maxima of 7 d streamflow at the continental and global scale is evaluated across 3666 river gauge locations over the period from 1971 to 2005, focusing on four aspects of trends: (i) mean, (ii) standard deviation, (iii) percentage of locations showing significant trends and (iv) spatial pattern. Compared to observed trends, simulated trends driven by observed climate forcing generally have a higher mean, lower spread and a similar percentage of locations showing significant trends. Models show a low to moderate capacity to simulate spatial patterns of historical trends, with approximately only from 12 % to 25 % of the spatial variance of observed trends across all gauge stations accounted for by the simulations. Interestingly, there are statistically significant differences between trends simulated by global hydrological models (GHMs) forced with observational climate and by those forced by bias-corrected climate model output during the historical period, suggesting the important role of the stochastic natural (decadal, inter-annual) climate variability. Significant differences were found in simulated flood trends when averaged only at gauged locations compared to those averaged across all simulated grid cells, highlighting the potential for bias toward well-observed regions in our understanding of changes in floods. Future climate projections (simulated under the RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 greenhouse gas concentration scenarios) suggest a potentially high level of change in individual regions, with up to 35 % of cells showing a statistically significant trend (increase or decrease; at 10 % significance level) and greater changes indicated for the higher concentration pathway. Importantly, the observed streamflow database under-samples the percentage of locations consistently projected with increased flood hazards under the RCP6.0 greenhouse gas concentration scenario by more than an order of magnitude (0.9 % compared to 11.7 %). This finding indicates a highly uncertain future for both flood-prone communities and decision makers in the context of climate change.

Sub-Daily Temperature Heterogeneity in a Side Channel and the Influence on Habitat Suitability of Freshwater Fish	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						thermal remote sensing; river management; restoration measures; unmanned airborne vehicle; species sensitivity distribution	THERMAL STRATIFICATION; RIVER; UAV; OXYGEN; RHINE; DIEL; SENSITIVITY; MANAGEMENT; CYPRINID; REFUGIA	Rising surface water temperatures in fluvial systems increasingly affect biodiversity negatively in riverine ecosystems, and a more frequent exceedance of thermal tolerance levels of species is expected to impoverish local species assemblages. Reliable prediction of the effect of increasing water temperature on habitat suitability requires detailed temperature measurements over time. We assessed (1) the accuracy of high-resolution images of water temperature of a side channel in a river floodplain acquired using a consumer-grade thermal camera mounted on an unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV), and (2) the associated habitat suitability for native and alien fish assemblages. Water surface temperatures were mapped four times throughout a hot summer day and calibrated with 24 in-situ temperature loggers in the water at 0.1 m below the surface using linear regression. The calibrated thermal imagery was used to calculate the potentially occurring fraction (POF) of freshwater fish using species sensitivity distributions. We found high temperatures (25-30 degrees C) in the side channel during mid-day resulting in reduced habitat suitability. The accuracy of water temperature estimates based on the RMSE was 0.53 degrees C over all flights (R-2 = 0.94). Average daily POF was 0.51 and 0.64 for native and alien fish species in the side channel. The error of the POF estimates is 76% lower when water temperature is estimated with thermal UAV imagery compared to temperatures measured at an upstream gauging station. Accurately quantifying water temperature and the heterogeneity thereof is a critical step in adaptation of riverine ecosystems to climate change. Our results show that measurements of surface water temperature can be made accurately and easily using thermal imagery from UAVs allowing for an improved habitat management, but coincident collection of long wave radiation is needed for a more physically-based prediction of water temperature. Because of climate change, management of riverine ecosystems should consider thermal pollution control and facilitate cold water refugia and connectivity between waterbodies in floodplains and the cooler main channel for fish migration during extremely hot summer periods.

We investigated how wood growth of adult trees of two species characteristic of floodplain forests in Central Germany (Fraxinus excelsior L., Quercus robur L.) and two less-typical species (Acer pseudoplatanus L., Carpinus betulus L.) responded to both maximum stream water level and climate, with a special focus on the effects of the extraordinary flood of the Saale River in June 2013 and the extreme drought in summer 1976. Tree-ring widths were measured on wood cores, and standardized ARSTAN tree-ring chronologies were produced. Using variance partitioning as well as linear mixed-effects models, we compared the effects of monthly values for maximum water level, temperature and precipitation sum on tree-ring width. Further, we calculated resistance, resilience and recovery of the tree species to the extreme events of flooding in 2013 and drought in 1976. Wood growth of all species studied, and particularly of F. excelsior, responded positively to the extraordinary flooding in June 2013. However, in the best models for the characteristic floodplain forest species (F. excelsior and Q. robur), mainly precipitation (F. excelsior) or a combination of precipitation and wood growth of the previous year (Q. robur) acted as drivers of wood growth of the current year. In contrast, growth of the less habitat-specific species (A. pseudoplatanus) mainly showed a significant response to the combination of temperature and wood growth of the previous year. C. betulus was the only species studied that benefited from the extreme drought in 1976. However, two years afterwards, only the wood growth of A. pseudoplatanus was still reduced, while F. excelsior and Q. robur fully recovered. In comparison to other regions in Central Europe, the moderate flood regime of the Saale River seems to have the potential to mitigate effects of summer drought in this region, which is one of the driest in Germany. Thus, increased flooding frequency might, to some degree, reduce drought effects brought about by climate change as well.

Nevertheless, the influence of freshwater on these systems has weakened in recent decades due to a marked decrease in precipitation. Here we evaluate potential influences of climate and land cover trends on the Puelo River (640 m(3)s(-1)), the main source of freshwater input of the Reloncavi Fjord (41.5 degrees S). Water quality was analyzed along the Puelo River basin (six sampling points) and at the discharge site in the Reloncav & iacute; Fjord (1, 8, and 25 m depth), through six field campaigns carried out under contrasting streamflow scenarios. We also used several indicators of hydrological alteration, and cross-wavelet transform and coherence analyses to evaluate the association between the Puelo River streamflow and precipitation (1950-2019). Lastly, using the WEAP hydrological model, land cover maps (2001-2016) and burned area reconstructions (1985-2019), we simulated future land cover impacts (2030) on the hydrological processes of the Puelo River. Total Nitrogen and total phosphorus, dissolved carbon, and dissolved iron concentrations measured in the river were 3-15 times lower than those in the fjord. Multivariate analyses showed that streamflow drives the carbon composition in the river. High streamflow conditions contribute with humic and colored materials, while low streamflow conditions corresponded to higher arrival of protein-like materials from the basin. The Puelo River streamflow showed significant trends in magnitude (lower streamflow in summer and autumn), duration (minimum annual streamflow), timing (more floods in spring), and frequency (fewer prolonged floods). The land cover change (LCC) analysis indicated that more than 90% of the basin area maintained its land cover, and that the main changes were attributed to recent large wildfires. Considering these land cover trends, the hydrological simulations project a slight increase in the Puelo River streamflow mainly due to a decrease in evapotranspiration. According to previous simulations, these projections present a direction opposite to the trends forced by climate change. The combined effect of reduction in freshwater input to fiords and potential decline in water quality highlights the need for more robust data and robust analysis of the influence of climate and LCC on this river-fjord complex of northwestern Patagonia.

A recent change in the hydroclimatic regime of the region, with increased rainfall in the northern portions of the basin, has produced record-breaking high water levels on the Amazon River mainstem. Yet, the implications for the magnitude and duration of floodplain inundation across the basin remain unknown. Here we leverage state-of-the-art hydrological models, supported by in-situ and remote sensing observations, to show that the maximum annual inundation extent along the central Amazon increased by 26% since 1980. We further reveal increased flood duration and greater connectivity among open water areas in multiple Amazon floodplain regions. These changes in the hydrological regime of the world's largest river system have major implications for ecology and biogeochemistry, and require rapid adaptation by vulnerable populations living along Amazonian rivers.

We examine the case of Japan, the third largest economy in the world. Japan faces dozens of earthquakes, floods, and typhoons each year, but some communities are more socially vulnerable in the face of disaster than others. Drawing on difference-indifferences models and matching experiments, we test the effect of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital on vulnerability. We find that controlling for cities' governance capacity, resource demand based on population, and damage from recent hazards, higher levels of bonding social capital in a community leads to lower levels of vulnerability. However, other types of social capital do not immediately lead to lower vulnerability, implying that greater government support is necessary in these cases.

Tracking down the drivers of those extreme events will help to understand their formation mechanisms and to improve forecasts. Here the synoptic patterns associated with summer extreme precipitation events over East China during 1961-2018 have been identified systematically and quantitatively using a circulation clustering method. The results show that regional events over East China are dominated by the Eastern Asian summer monsoon associated Meiyu front, landfalling tropical cyclones and low-pressure vortices. Most sub-regions have seen increasing trends of extreme rainfall events during the past 6 decades with comparable contributions from the two main drivers. There was a decreasing trend over the North China Plain driven by the low-level southeasterly winds.

India, being a tropical country, faces prolonged ART, particularly during the June month of Southwest monsoon season (June to September) which will be an indicative measure of the increased frequency of extreme weather events. Here we show a possible connection of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) to the recent (August 2018) Kerala heavy rains that resulted in severe floods and claimed more than 400 mortalities. Remarkable delay in residence times over India during June is shown to have an association with QRA evidenced by the higher magnitudes of amplitudes at the wavenumbers six and seven from the 19 global climate models of CMIP5 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

This paper applies a boundary discontinuity design to a residential sorting model to provide novel estimates of sorting across flood risk by race, ethnicity, and income. We find clear evidence that low income and minority residents are more likely to move into high risk flood zones. We then highlight the overall and distributional implications of proposed price and information reforms to the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program. While such reforms are likely welfare increasing overall, heterogeneous behavioral responses yield significant distributive effects that also alter the composition of residents in harm's way.

The occurrence of embankment overflow is deemed unlikely since the initial highest water level of the embankment is assumed to be fixed as a designed flood water level or a seasonal flood-limited water level when calculating the rainfall amount in the hydrological stability analysis. However, the possibility of overtopping can be assessed by employing copula functions. This approach takes into account the return frequency of overflow and the fluctuation of probable water levels due to climate change rather than relying on the fixed highest water levels of an embankment. This study examined the effect of tensile cracks leading to the shallow failure of embankment slopes during drawdown and placed an emphasis on the vulnerability of embankment slopes due to extreme rainfall events. Throughout the comprehensive numerical simulations, it was found that the critical period for embankment slope collapse was immediately after drawdown for the upstream slope and during the initial stages of overflow for the downstream slope.

What drives firms' heterogeneous responses to a climate disaster, and what could be the consequences for community resilience? To address these questions, we theorize how different aspects of sensemaking (sense of place, time, certitude, and loss) affect firm responses. Then, aided by an elaborate thought experiment - a narrative scenario of a future flood hitting the Dutch coast - we theorize how heterogeneity in firms' initial responses can trigger sensemaking-sensegiving cycles that spiral a community towards reconstruction or unplanned retreat. Our article advances understanding of firms' heterogenous disaster responses, the drivers of community resilience, and uncovers potential tensions between organizational and community resilience. We also contribute to sensemaking theory by relaxing the popular assumption that sensegiving requires deliberation. Finally, our article showcases how narrative scenarios of future events can expand the methodological toolkit of organization theory and points to new opportunities for future interdisciplinary work.

J	Deslatte, A; Chung, JW; Stokan, E				Deslatte, Aaron; Chung, Juwon; Stokan, Eric			Structural drivers of sustainability and resilience strategies in small(ish) cities: a text analysis of comprehensive planning in Indiana	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						sustainability; resilience; comprehensive planning; Institutional analysis; text analysis	GOVERNMENT; INEQUALITY	For decades, the world's largest and most globally significant cities have been pledging to tackle climate change, resilience, sustainable development and social injustices through a proliferating ecology of plans. Far less is understood about what is happening in smaller communities. This study employs an institutional lens and automated text analysis to examine the resilience and sustainability "shared strategies" embedded in local land-use plans, which are used in many countries to guide the spatial distribution of development in metropolitan regions. We find evidence that communities that are more highly educated and less racially diverse focus more on "quality of life" amenities within their plans, such as pedestrian resources and environmental amenities. By contrast, communities that are more racially diverse focus greater attention on green stormwater infrastructure to address flooding. Plan "quality" is negatively associated with an amenities' focus. Taken together, these findings suggest comprehensive land-use planning is both a means for reflecting exclusivity as well as pursuing community needs or goals related to specific resilience or sustainability themes.

The development of green infrastructures such as bioretention systems since the 1990s has often been reported as effective means of runoff mitigation with subsequent conveyed pollutant capture. Nevertheless, climate change involving more frequent extreme weather events as well as the variety of emerging pollutants in urban runoff have put an increasing strain on bioretention processes. Within this context, this mini-review deals with the opportunity of upgrading vegetated bioretention systems with active control technology to enhance their pollutant treatment capacity through proper control of critical bioretention operational variables and relying on improved ecological functioning and resilience. It is envisioned that such nature-based solutions hybridized with real-time control technology would help to improve stormwater reuse for more sustainable urban water management within the nexus of water-energy-food and greenhouse gases in future cities.

This urban transformation has often failed to consider the variable of flooding in its planning. Such a situation, combined with the current meteorological changes derived from climate change phenomena that increasingly cause less frequent but more extreme rainfall events in this part of the planet, has caused a sharp increase in the vulnerability of many urban areas against flooding. This research aims to analyze, from a spatiotemporal approach, in the case study of Murcia, a Mediterranean city in southeastern Spain, the existing spatial statistical correlation between urban planning patterns of growth of the city and the increase in risk due to its current vulnerability to flooding. Using GIS-based multivariate indicators and geostatistical analysis, the behavior patterns of said correlation will be numerically evaluated, and possible future trends and scenarios for this problem will be raised.

However, the long-term drivers of Miocene climate remain poorly understood. By using a new continuous climate-biogeochemical model (SCION), we can investigate the interaction between volcanism, climate and biogeochemical cycles through the Miocene. We identify high tectonic CO2 degassing rates and further emissions associated with the emplacement of the Columbia River Basalt Group as the primary driver of the background warmth and the MMCO respectively. We also find that enhanced weathering of the basaltic terrane and input of explosive volcanic ash to the oceans are not sufficient to drive the immediate cooling following the MMCO and suggest that another mechanism, perhaps the change in ocean chemistry due to massive evaporite deposition, was responsible.

Rapid and accurate flood mapping is essential for disaster monitoring and risk assessment. The normalized difference flood index (NDFI) is a change detection method with the characteristics of efficient processing and less manual intervention, which can quickly obtain flood information. However, the NDFI method would misclassify some permanent water bodies in lakes and rivers into floods. We presented a framework by combining NDFI calculated from synthetic aperture radar images and a summer permanent water bodies (SPWB) exclusion layer derived from optical remote sensing surface reflectance data, abbreviated as NDFI-SPWB. This framework was further verified by the flood event in the Yangtze river basin in July 2020. Results show that the NDFI-SPWB framework can increase the user accuracy by approximately 10% and the Kappa coefficient by approximately 0.08 compared with the original NDFI method, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

They disrupt the ecological balance, hamper the economic development, affect the social fabric of the society, create chaos, damage the infrastructure, put constraints on the movement of people and create displacement of millions of people. In 2014, Kashmir Valley witnessed the worst flood in the last 100 years. The impact of the flood is still felt in the Kashmir Valley, which has changed the perception of the people of the valley regarding floods. The flood had enormous impact on environment, economy, society, political set up and all the aspects of life. The present study analyses the impact of the 2014 flood in Kashmir valley and its aftermath. It analyses the physical and social vulnerability of different districts regarding floods and analyses the variability of the impact. The study is based on primary as well as secondary sources of data, and the data was analysed by statistical techniques like Z-score and composite Z-score and also remote sensing techniques and GIS.

The study area is the city of Leiria, in central Portugal, within the period 1958-2018 based on the historical record of floods and landslides disasters. The LULC analysis shows an accentuated increase in the artificial areas and a continuous decrease in the agricultural areas. With regard to hydro-geomorphologic disaster occurrences, a total of 124 occurrences were identified, having caused a set of impacts. The obtained results allow one to characterize the artificialization process, its intensity and territorial dispersion, as a consequence of urban sprawl and peri-urbanization, along with its consequences in exposure to hydro-geomorphological processes. The analysis concludes that changing the risk drivers resulted in an increase in frequency and spatial dispersion of hydro-geomorphologic disasters over the analysed period.

Scaling rates of extreme precipitation with temperature at different regions significantly deviate from the CC rate. We find that the daily extreme precipitation scaling is negative over sites in the warmer tropical region of South Asia, as opposed to positive scaling over the cooler subtropics. Daily precipitation scaling tends to break down and becomes negative above a temperature of 23-24 degrees C in all the regions. However, such breakdown disappears for subdaily precipitation extremes, and they continue to increase at high temperatures over both tropics and subtropics. This leads to high positive streamflow-temperature scaling over small catchments, in contrast to extreme precipitation scaling at a daily scale, which is partly negative. Our analysis highlights an increased threat due to flash flood in a warmer climate, which cannot be fully estimated with the analysis of daily precipitation extremes.

Public support for flood mitigation policies is largely influenced by flood risk perceptions and flood risk perceptions are, in turn, shaped by a multitude of factors. This paper explores the impact of the determinants of risk perception on willingness to pay for flood risk prevention in Dunkerque (France) using a contingent valuation survey. We find that whether or not respondents include their home within their perceived flood risk areas, trust in flood mitigation measures, environmental beliefs and socio-economic factors are strong predictors of public support for flood risk prevention, whereas actual distance of a respondent?s home to the flood source, knowledge of flood risk, prior experience and trust in local authorities have a limited influence. Policy implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

The Cordillera Blanca in Peru has one of the world's longest GLOF records and here we assess the evolution of glacial lakes in the region between 1948 and 2017 and investigate the links to documented GLOFs. We also model future lake evolution under two climate scenarios to provide an assessment of current and future GLOF triggering potential. Our analysis shows that the number of lakes as well as the total lake area has increased during the historical period. The formation of new lakes is, however, not uniform among different lake types with bedrock-dammed lakes exhibiting the largest increase in recent decades. We argue that moraine-dammed lakes have already formed at the majority of potential locations in the Cordillera Blanca and that the next generation of lakes which are expected to form in response to glacier retreat over topographically suitable areas will be predominantly bedrock-dammed. Based on a regional GLOF inventory, we show that the peak frequency of GLOFs occurred from the late 1930s to early 1950s. While GLOFs originating from moraine-dammed lakes dominated in this period, recent GLOFs have originated from bedrock-dammed lakes. At the same time, the majority of GLOFs originated from lakes in a proglacial phase (i.e. in contact with glacier), even though the share of proglacial lakes did not exceed 12% at any time step during the analysed period. While many moraine-dammed lakes evolved into the glacier-detached evolutionary phase, bedrock-dammed lakes became a major lake dam type among proglacial lakes. Over the remainder of the 21st century, a further increase in lake area of up to 10% is anticipated, with up to 50 new bedrock dammed lakes likely to develop as glaciers retreat. There is little difference in lake development and GLOF triggering potential under climate scenarios driven by RCP 2.6 and 8.5. Based on topographic disposition, recent and future lakes do not individually appear more or less susceptible to landslide impact than lakes that already developed earlier in the 20th century. Synthesizing these findings, we forecast that bedrock-dammed lakes will become the dominant source of GLOFs in the next decades. Because such dams are inherently more stable, we expect overall lower GLOF magnitudes compared to documented GLOFs from moraine-dammed lakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is a priority for urban planning, civil defence and insurance to accurately represent buildings and urban features in hydrodynamic models to assess flood risk to people, properties, assets and infrastructure in an uncertain future. The correct representation of urban features in models is currently blocked by the lack of detailed and accurate techniques and has become a priority for the improvement of urban flood modelling now that better data and computational resources are available. This study has reviewed the available approaches for the representation of buildings and urban features and implemented the widely used 'stubby building' approximation as well as a more realistic and innovative 'building hole' approach using the hydrodynamic model CityCAT. The city centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, was used as a case study, allowing independent validation of the methods and direct, systematic comparison of performance. Shortcomings of the approximate method are described, and guidance given on limits to its reliable application and scope for improvement.

A two-step model fits the survey data: it combines a binary sample selection rule to distinguish protesters and participants with a Tobit model to accommodate true zero responses among participants. Results show that non-symptoms-specific information on mental health risk may bias the willingness to pay downward. Risk-averse individuals who have taken self-insurance protection measures are willing to pay for additional protection through collective defence. Feelings, such as worries and anxiety related to flooding, drive the demand, which supports the risk-as-feelings hypothesis for mental health protection from flooding. Inexperience rather than experience of flooding is found to increase demand, which indicates that individual mental resilience to flooding may increase after an event as posited by the inoculation hypothesis.

Traditional mainstream facilities, such as vegetated roofs, permeable pavements, and others, are effective to eliminate urban flooding only in case of small rains because the water-retaining and detaining capacities of these traditional facilities are limited. Here, we propose a new buffer tank buried in soil to deal with rainwater onsite as peak-flow control for urban flooding mitigation. Experiments showed that the buffer tank intercepts the surface runoff and discharges the intercepted water through a designed outlet orifice. By properly setting the cross-sectional area of the orifice, the tank extends the drainage duration several times longer than that of the rainfall duration. It is found that the buffer tank attenuates the peak flow greater at heavier rain. At small rain (<2.5 mm), the tank is always unfilled, preserving storage spaces for detaining rainwater in case of heavy rain. The buffer tank is thus greatly helpful to mitigate the flooding problem, avoiding being saturated by small long-lasting rain.

Flood risk mapping has been incorporated in several countries as an important piece when it comes to planning new land uses. Thus, traditional flood risk reduction measures based on structural measures have been enriched with the incorporation of risk mapping as an argument for legal accreditation in land use planning. This paper analyzes the application of flood risk mapping in land use planning in Argentina and Spain. The analysis is focused on the use of cartographic documents to certify risk levels at a local scale. These are two countries that have opted for the elaboration of risk mapping in the processes of assigning land uses. Although the results of their implementation are different in relation to the existence of regulatory regulations for these processes and the different administrative scales with competences in spatial planning and urban planning. In both cases, it is verified that the flood map in urban processes is understood as a hazard map, without integrating, except for specific examples, vulnerability analysis in the territories under planning.

The average values of wildfire areas; total volumes of CO, CO2, and aerosol PM2.5 emissions; and their density (per area unit) in the Siberian Federal District of Russia and its regions are estimated for a 20-year period, as well as the number, radiative power, and spatial distribution of wildfires on the territory of North Eurasia in 2019. In July 2019, the wildfire area in Irkutsk oblast exceeded the average value for the period of 2001-2019 by more than four times, whereas the related total volumes of emissions of CO, CO2, and PM2.5 aerosol in June 2019 were five times higher than their average values for this period. The regional weather-climate features of summer 2019 were revealed using on-land observations and reanalysis, in particular, atmospheric blocking, which is related to the formation of extreme regimes of wildfires and floods in adjacent territories of Siberia.

To understand the potential for RoR hydropower development and modernization of the technology as an opportunity for sustainable decentralization, we use the Q-methodology to compare public values about RoR hydropower in German, Portuguese and Swedish case studies. Four perspectives on the importance of RoR hydropower emerged from our analysis: (i) maintain regional control, (ii) fight climate change, (iii) promote citizen well-being and (iv) protect natural ecosystems. Strong preferences for regional control imply RoR should be managed as distributed generation rather than viewed as part of a centralized, national system like traditional large-scale reservoir hydropower. Based on the importance of citizen well-being and ecological measures, operators could adopt strategies such as river widening and the reconstruction of secondary channels, which help control floods, create recreational opportunities as well as enhance ecological habilitation and biodiversity. Additionally, policymakers could support rigorous monitoring programs to assess the ecological impact of RoR.

Interactions Between Mean Sea Level, Tide, Surge, Waves and Flooding: Mechanisms and Contributions to Sea Level Variations at the Coast	SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Review						Water level; Hydrodynamics; Interaction processes; Implications; Flood; Quantification; Modeling	STORM-SURGE; TROPICAL CYCLONE; DRAG COEFFICIENT; WATER LEVELS; EAST-COAST; BOHAI SEA; RISE; BAY; IMPACT; SURFACE	Coastal areas epitomize the notion of 'at-risk' territory in the context of climate change and sea level rise (SLR). Knowledge of the water level changes at the coast resulting from the mean sea level variability, tide, atmospheric surge and wave setup is critical for coastal flooding assessment. This study investigates how coastal water level can be altered by interactions between SLR, tides, storm surges, waves and flooding. The main mechanisms of interaction are identified, mainly by analyzing the shallow water equations. Based on a literature review, the orders of magnitude of these interactions are estimated in different environments. The investigated interactions exhibit a strong spatiotemporal variability. Depending on the type of environments (e.g., morphology, hydrometeorological context), they can reach several tens of centimeters (positive or negative). As a consequence, probabilistic projections of future coastal water levels and flooding should identify whether interaction processes are of leading order, and, where appropriate, projections should account for these interactions through modeling or statistical methods.

Exploring the Environmental Justice Implications of Hurricane Harvey Flooding in Greater Houston, Texas	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; HEALTH-RISKS; INJUSTICE; MIAMI; RACE; VULNERABILITY; PATTERNS; HAZARDS; KATRINA; LIFE	Objectives. To assess the environmental justice implications of flooding from Hurricane Harvey in Greater Houston, Texas, we analyzed whether the areal extent of flooding was distributed inequitably with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, after controlling for relevant explanatory factors. Methods. Our study integrated cartographic information from Harvey's Inundation Footprint, developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, with sociodemographic data from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses were based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations. Results. The areal extent of Harvey-induced flooding was significantly greater in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black and socioeconomically deprived residents after we controlled for contextual factors and clustering. Conclusions. Results provide evidence of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic injustices in the distribution of flooding and represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of disproportionate impacts associated with Hurricane Harvey. Public Health Implications. Our findings highlight the need to prepare for and address the unequal social consequences of climate change-related disasters, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity.

Bringing humans and animals into closer contact with contaminated water and soil and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events may further exacerbate the risk of leptospirosis outbreaks, which is mostly relevant in the context of climate change and a widespread intensification of productive activities, particularly in the Lower Delta of the Parana River. Knowledge about the life cycle and survival mechanisms of leptospires in the environment is scarce, particularly regarding the environmental factors associated with their presence in ecosystems subject to livestock farming, where precipitation, seasonal floods, and river overflows could act as facilitators of leptospire dispersion. This study aimed to identify and study the presence of Leptospira spp. in the Lower Delta of the Parana River and describe the physical, chemical, and hydrometeorological conditions associated with their presence in wetland ecosystems impaired by livestock raising intensification. Here, we show that the presence of Leptospira was determined mainly by water availability. We detected the species Leptospira kmetyi, L. mayottensis, and L. fainei and successfully cultured the saprophytic species L. meyeri from bottom sediment, suggesting the association of leptospires with microbial communities of the sediment's biofilm to enhance its survival and persistence in aquatic environments and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Knowledge of Leptospira sp. diversity in wetlands and the impact of climate variability on the transmission of these organisms is crucial for predicting and preventing leptospirosis outbreaks in the context of human health.IMPORTANCE Wetlands are environments that are often conducive to the survival and transmission of Leptospira because they provide a suitable habitat for the bacteria and are often home to many animal species that can act as reservoirs for leptospirosis.

Present and future of the South Asian summer monsoon's rainy season over Northeast India	NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE			English	Article							TROPICAL ATLANTIC; PREDICTABILITY; VARIABILITY; TEMPERATURE	An iconic feature of the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR), a longer than June-September rainy season over Northeast India (NEI), while a much shorter one over northwest India is expected to be altered by climate change but an objective definition of the length of the monsoon rainy season (LRS) over the NEI is lacking. Here, defining the LRS objectively over NEI, we show that the El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a primary driver of LRS, while rainfall during LRS is poorly correlated with the ENSO. In contrast to a significant decreasing trend of LRS and LRS-rainfall during the historical period, the projected LRS under the SSP5-8.5 scenario continues to decrease while the LRS-rainfall acquires a significant increasing trend over NEI. A significant increase in the impact of hydrological disasters is expected over NEI in the future due to the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme rain events within a shorter rainy season.

Increased evaporation will result in more frequent and intense storms; hence, most researchers focus on climate change and its effect on Earth, particularly the precipitation. In the last two decades, the Udaipur district, India, faces water scarcity and flooding situations twice. The present study focuses on the prediction of rainfall using the most advanced soft computing techniques (SCT) such as multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), classification and regression trees (CART), and gene expression programming (GEP) in India's Udaipur district. The performance of these SCT was evaluated to test the capability to predict the rainfall. Results showed that the MARS model for rainfall prediction showed better performance than the GEP model.

With growing public concern about the impact of climate change on water security, hydrological models such as CREST need to continue improving to provide more accurate simulations, more output products, and reduced application difficulties for users. In this study, an improved version of the CREST model (version 3.0) was proposed to consider the groundwater component of the hydrological cycle. A CONUS-wide CREST model calibration was conducted to provide usable model parameters for CREST users worldwide. The calibration improved the overall NSCE score from -0.97 to 0.11 over 3206 gauge points in CONUS. The validation results indicated that the CREST model performed well in the eastern CONUS but not in the Rocky Mountains and the Mountain West. The newly added groundwater module reduced the overestimation and the steepness of the falling limb during flood events in the eastern CONUS but drastically reduced the simulated water quantities in the mountainous regions.

Global climate change, es-pecially climate warming, has accelerated the sharp decline in the level of the Caspian Sea in recent years. In the course of the study, the main factors influ-encing the dynamics and functioning of natural processes and the development of landscapes of the coastal territory were identified: 1. sea level fluctuations; 2. neotectonic processes; 3. anthropogenic transformations. Depending on the degree of influence of the Caspian Sea, the following groups of landscapes are distinguished: 1. fundamentally changed; 2. landscapes subject to different levels of flooding. The following main typical flooded landscapes were studied: strongly, moderately, and slightly flooded landscapes.

During the phase of data collection, two problems were found: (i) a block of five months of data was unavailable, and (ii) no information was collected from the coastal area, which made flood-risk estimation difficult. Thus, our aim is to explore and provide possible solutions to both issues. To avoid removing a variable (or those missing months), the proposed solution is a BN-based regression model using fixed probabilistic graphical structures to impute the missing variable as accurately as possible. For the second problem, the lack of information, an unsupervised classification method based on BN was developed to predict flood risk in the coastal area. Results showed that the proposed regression solution could predict the behavior of the continuous missing variable, avoiding the initial drawback of rejecting it. Moreover, the unsupervised classifier could classify all observations into a set of groups according to upstream river behavior and rainfall information, and return the probability of belonging to each group, providing appropriate predictions about the risk of flood in the coastal area.

This is estimated for lake development under present-day and future warming scenarios, highlighting emerging hotspots and transboundary impacts. Warming on Earth's Third Pole is leading to rapid loss of ice and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes, posing a severe threat to downstream communities. Here we provide a holistic assessment of past evolution, present state and modelled future change of glacial lakes and related glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk across the Third Pole. We show that the highest GLOF risk is at present centred in the eastern Himalaya, where the current risk level is at least twice that in adjacent regions. In the future, GLOF risk will potentially almost triple as a consequence of further lake development, and additional hotspots will emerge to the west, including within transboundary regions. With apparent increases in GLOF risk already anticipated by the mid-twenty-first century in some regions, the results highlight the urgent need for forward-looking, collaborative, long-term approaches to mitigate future impacts and enhance sustainable development across the Third Pole.

This research explores the response of rainfall to solar activity in eastern regions of Africa, with a case study in Sudan and South Sudan. Rainfall varies with time; therefore, skillful monitoring, predicting, and early warning of rainfall events is indispensable. Severe climatic events, such as droughts and floods, are critical factors in planning and managing all socioeconomic activities. Similar trends for the sunspot activity (sunspot number and sunspot groups) changes and rainfall variations for different stations in East Africa during the years 1910-2018 were not found. Correlation analysis carried out for the above period indicated a weak negative correlation between the total rainfall and the average number of sunspots over the long-term scale for selected stations in Sudan and South Sudan. The overall result of the paper indicated no significant relationship between sunspot numbers and rainfall in temporal and spatial scales in Sudan and South Sudan.

Nigeria faces numerous challenges as it struggles to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with flooding being the most serious with wide-reaching impacts. This paper highlights the impact flooding has on Nigeria reaching SDGs and enumerates the specific SDGs most directly impacted. A systematic literature review provides an overview of the relationship between flooding in Nigeria and the SDGs. It highlights the main causes of Nigeria's flooding problem are man-made and advocates spatial planning as a suitable Flood Risk Management (FRM) strategy for the Nigerian environment. The paper calls for collaborative action by all concerned stakeholders to address the flooding problem and to help move Nigeria closer to meeting the United Nations (UN) 2030 SDGs. Most importantly, the evidence presented in this paper seeks to promote action on a national scale to combat the flooding in Nigeria and help the nation work more effectively toward achieving the SDGs.

Dynamic changes in wetland HC are affected by a variety of factors. Many degraded wetlands have undergone measures to restore HC. Recovery can improve the HC pattern of degraded wetlands. Based on the knowledge of practitioners and a review of the literature, it was found that recovery measures can be divided into structural recovery and functional recovery according to the specific recovery objectives. However, the current recovery method lacks a holistic analysis of the HC pattern. To this end, we propose a hydrologic network-water balance-based HC recovery and management framework that overcomes the limitations of single-drive-factor repair and local repair effects.

Geographic information system (GIS) methods are employed in this paper to analyse coastal communities' vulnerability to these two hazards along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Specifically, two types of quantitative indicators are developed: (i) exposure to hurricanes and flooding, based on information from multiple sources; and a social vulnerability index, constructed using census data. These indices are combined to depict the spatial patterns of overall community vulnerability to hurricanes and flooding along the US Gulf Coast. The results of this study can potentially inform disaster management agencies, county governments, and municipalities in areas at heightened risk. Furthermore, the demonstration of the geographic distribution of community vulnerability can assist decision-makers in prioritising to-do items and designing policies and plans for the more effective allocation of resources. The paper ends by discussing the study's limitations and its practical implications.

This study intends to assess the flood risk in urban systems and governance in terms of the flood management plan for the Surat city, also called a part of the Lower Tapi Basin, Gujarat, India. Topographical maps of the year 1968 and a satellite image of Resources-1 for the year 2006 are used to analyze the study area. Based on the study, a change from low urbanization to a high urbanization pattern is the main driver for increasing the flood risk in the study area has been noted. These shows a lack of management of flood water in urban areas, which in turn led to increasing flood losses in the urban sprawl. The flood management maps have been made by using the spatial analysis tools of the Geographic Information System (GIS), which will be useful to reduce and transfer flood risk. It will enhance the flood resilience of the flood-prone region.	[Waghwala, Rupal K.; Agnihotri, P.

The streets of the nation's capital have been flooded with people marching about a diversity of progressive issues, including women's rights, climate change, and gun violence. Although research has found that these events have mobilized a high proportion of repeat participants who come out again and again, limited research has focused on understanding differential participation in protest, especially during one cycle of contention. This article, accordingly, explores the patterns among the protest participants to understand differential participation and what we refer to as "persistence in the Resistance." In it, we analyze a unique data set collected from surveys conducted with a field approximation of a random sample of protest participants at the largest protest events in Washington, DC, since the Resistance began at the 2017 Women's March. Our findings provide insights into repeat protesters during this cycle of contention. The article concludes by discussing how our findings contribute to the research on differential participation.

Usually flood damage is estimated by multiplying the inundated asset value by the damage rate corresponding to the inundation depth. The uncertainty of the asset value and the damage rate is described by probability distributions estimated from an analysis of actual flood damage data from a national government survey. With the inclusion of uncertainty in the damage rate and asset value, the damage potential curve defining the damage-frequency relationship is no longer a deterministic single-value curve. Through Monte Carlo simulations, which incorporate the uncertainty of the inundation damage from the damage rate and asset value, a probabilistic damage potential relation can be established, which can be expressed in terms of a series of curves with different percentile levels. The method is demonstrated through the establishment of probabilistic damage potential curves for a typical urban catchment, the Zenpukuji river basin in Tokyo Metropolis, under two scenarios, namely, with and without a planned flood control reservoir.

They are economically vital whilst also constituting some of the most diverse habitats on Earth. However, a number of anthropogenic stressors, including large-scale damming, hydrological change, pollution, introduction of non-native species and sediment mining, challenge their integrity and future, as never before. The rapidity and extent of such change is so great that large-scale, and potentially irreparable, transformations may ensue in periods of years to decades, with ecosystem collapse being possible in some big rivers. Prioritizing the fate of the world's great river corridors on an international political stage is imperative. Future sustainable management, and establishment of environmental flow requirements for the world's big rivers, must be supported through co-ordinated international funding, and trans-continental political agreement to monitor these rivers, finance their continual upkeep and help ameliorate increasing anthropogenic pressures. To have any effect, all of these must be set within an inclusive governance framework across scales, organizations and local populace.

However, the processes behind the observed changes at the scale of these basins are relatively poorly understood. While most studies have been focused on the "Big 6" Arctic rivers - the Ob', Yenisey, Lena, Mackenzie, Yukon, and Kolyma - few or no assessments exist for small and medium-sized river basins, such as the Yana and Indigirka River basins. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of streamflow data from 22 hydrological gauges in the Yana and Indigirka River basins with a period of observation ranging from 35 to 79 years up to 2015. These river basins are fully located in the zone of continuous permafrost. Our analysis reveals statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive trends in the monthly streamflow time series during the autumn-winter period for most of the gauges. The streamflow increases in a stepwise pattern (post-1981) for 17 out of 22 gauges in September (average trend value for the period of record is 58% or 9.8 mm) and 15 out of 22 gauges in October (61% or 2.0 mm). The positive trends are seen in 9 out of 19 rivers that do not freeze in November (54 %, 0.4 mm) and 6 out of 17 rivers that do not freeze in December (95 %, 0.15 mm). Precipitation is shown to decrease in late winter by up to 15 mm over the observational period. Additionally, about 10 mm of precipitation that used to fall as snow at the beginning of winter now falls as rain. Despite the decrease in winter precipitation, no decrease in streamflow has been observed during the spring freshet in May and June in the last 50 years (from 1966); moreover, five gauges show an increase of 86% or 12.2 mm in spring floods via an abrupt change in 1987-1993. The changes in spring freshet start date are identified for 10 gauges; the earlier onset in May varies from 4 to 10 d over the observational period. We conclude that warmer temperatures due to climate change are impacting the hydrological regime of these rivers via changes in precipitation type (rain replacing snow). Other factors, such as the melting of permafrost, glaciers, and aufeis or changes in groundwater conditions, are likely to contribute as well; however, no direct observations of these changes are available. The changes in streamflow can have a significant impact on the ecology of the zone of continuous permafrost, while the increasing freshwater fluxes to the Arctic Ocean can impact the Arctic thermohaline circulation.

Although we are experiencing more frequent and intense heavy rainfall events, a major contributor to field flooding, there is still not much known about the impact of these events on different crops. In this study, we investigated the effects of waterlogging on a model plant white cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata f. alba), with the aim to follow its response to both single and recurrent short-term (72-h length) waterlogging, as well as to track difference in the sensitivity between plants in different growth stages (38- and 48-day-old plants). In our 22-day experiment, settled under fully controlled conditions (16 h day/8 h night, 25 degrees C day/20 degrees C night, 60-70% relative air humidity, 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic active radiation), with the aim to more comprehensively recognize consequences of waterlogging on plants, we measured changes in plants on multiple levels: (i) within its morphological traits (number and length of leaves, leaf area, and blade width), (ii) within chlorophyll fluorescence and multispectral traits (20 parameters), (iii) following the levels of plant stress parameters (salicylic acid, abscisic acid, proline, and total polyphenols), and (iv) following changes in the plants' elemental and mineral composition. According to our results, white cabbage was shown not to be very sensitive to waterlogging, with only plants exposed to repeated waterlogging showing signs of the congestion stress. These signs, observed in the changes of molecular stress parameters salicylic and abscisic acids, were not so clearly evident at the aboveground level. We did not observe changes in the plants' morphologies, nor their photosynthetic performance. In addition, removal of waterlogging stress resulted in complete recovery of our model plants, suggesting a prompt adaptation response of white cabbage. With the projected increased frequency of occurrence of flooding events, it will become increasingly more important to recognize crops being highly sensitive to flooding with the aim to try to adapt to the changing climate.

J	Steinschneider, S; Najibi, N				Steinschneider, Scott; Najibi, Nasser			Observed and Projected Scaling of Daily Extreme Precipitation with Dew Point Temperature at Annual and Seasonal Scales across the Northeastern United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Climate sensitivity; Extreme events; Precipitation; Climate change; Temperature; Bayesian methods; Thermodynamics; Climate models; Risk assessment	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; RAINFALL EXTREMES; BIAS CORRECTION; NORTH-ATLANTIC; FUTURE CHANGES; MODEL; VARIABILITY; CMIP5	This study investigates how extreme precipitation scales with dewpoint temperature across the northeastern United States, both in the observational record (1948-2020) and in a set of downscaled climate projections in the state of Massachusetts (2006-99). Spatiotemporal relationships between dewpoint temperature and extreme precipitation are assessed, and extreme precipitation-temperature scaling rates are evaluated on annual and seasonal scales using nonstationary extreme value analysis for annual maxima and partial duration series, respectively. A hierarchical Bayesian model is then developed to partially pool data across sites and estimate regional scaling rates, with uncertainty. Based on the observations, the estimated annual scaling rate is 5.5% degrees C-1, but this varies by season, with most nonzero scaling rates in summer and fall and the largest rates (similar to 7.3% degrees C-1) in the summer. Dewpoint temperatures and extreme precipitation also exhibit the most consistent regional relationships in the summer and fall. Downscaled climate projections exhibited different scaling rates compared to the observations, ranging between -2.5% and 6.2% degrees C-1 at an annual scale. These scaling rates are related to the consistency between trends in projected precipitation and dewpoint temperature over the twenty-first century. At the seasonal scale, climate models project larger scaling rates for the winter compared to the observations (1.6% degrees C-1). Overall, the observations suggest that extreme daily precipitation in the Northeast only thermodynamic scales with dewpoint temperature in the warm season, but climate projections indicate some degree of scaling is possible in the cold season under warming. Significance StatementA warmer climate will likely result in the intensification of extreme precipitation, with the potential to enhance flood and stormwater risk. However, the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature (i.e., the precipitation-temperature scaling rate) remains uncertain, particularly at regional scales, inhibiting societal adaptation to extreme events. Using observations and climate projections of daily precipitation and dewpoint temperature across the northeastern United States, we demonstrate that extreme daily precipitation does indeed scale with dewpoint temperature, but the rate of scaling varies by season, with the strongest relationship in the warm season.

Ecosystem vulnerability of floodplain wetlands of the Lower Brahmaputra Valley to climatic and anthropogenic factors	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water-spread area; flood; drought-like situations; enclosure culture; beels; Assam	ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; PERCEPTIONS; IMPACTS; REGION	This study assessed the vulnerability of 16 floodplain wetlands (beels) of the Lower Brahmaputra Valley, Assam, India, in relation to a range of natural and anthropogenic factors including climate change. The total water-spread area of the selected beels varied widely (8-50 ha), with 68.75% of the beels showing a reduction in water-spread area over the past 30 years. High levels of siltation and encroachment and detachment of marginal areas through the construction of roads were the major factors responsible for the reduction in the water-spread area of the beels. The reduction was observed to be in the range of over 33% in three beels (Raghunath Sora, Chulkani, and Dudua beel) to 83% in Bhoishpuri beel. In addition, one beel (Chulkani) experienced reduction in its deep pool area, which is an important wetland area that provides shelter to brood fishes during the dry season. Only 12.5% of the beels studied practiced enclosure (pen) culture for rearing fish. None practiced cage culture. Our study showed that only two beels (Bhoishpuri and Tariachora) were free from exotic fishes; the remaining surveyed beels reported exotic species such as, Cyprinus carpio (Common Carp), Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass Carp), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver Carp), H. nobilis (Bighead Carp) and Piaractus brachypomus (Pacu). The prevalence of exotic fishes in the majority of the beels (due both to escape from nearby aquaculture ponds during floods and intentional stocking in certain beels) would have adversely affected the diversity of indigenous fishes in those wetlands. From discussion with the fishers, 50% of the beels surveyed experienced a reduction in the number of fish species from that recorded 10-20 years ago. In addition to climate change-related factors (e.g. abnormal rains, floods, or drought-like situations), other factors - both natural (e.g. hyper-nutrification) and anthropogenic (e.g. construction of roads, houses, and other structures) - also adversely affected the studied wetlands. To help cope with these factors and increase the adaptive capacity of fishers, four measures aimed at mitigation are suggested. These are: the practice of enclosure aquaculture in beels; the construction of floating macrophyte refuges (katal); deep pool refuges; and stock enhancement programmes with climate-resilient indigenous fishes.

To reduce the negative climate change impact, the United Union's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) set a goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C relative to pre-industrial levels based on the previous 2.0 degrees C target in October 2018. To understand the necessity of more stringent emission reduction, this study investigates the impacts of additional 0.5 degrees C global warming from 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C on global extreme precipitation, and especially its socioeconomic consequences. The extreme precipitation is represented by extreme precipitation frequency (R95pF), extreme precipitation percentage (R95pT), and maximum one-day precipitation (RX1day) as indicators, calculated based on daily precipitation data extracted from 29 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The exposures of economy and population to extreme precipitation events are also computed and compared for two warming levels by using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The results show that most regions in the world are likely to suffer from increasing extreme precipitation hazards in a warming climate, with ascending gross domestic product (GDP) and population being exposed to extreme dangers with an additional 0.5 degrees C warming. R95pT and RX1day are projected to increase overwhelmingly throughout all continents, directly leading to intensified precipitation extremes and flash floods. In middle and low latitudes, the annual total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT) shows a rich-get-richer trend and R95p1 decreases, which will reinforce the intensified trend of the magnitude of extreme precipitation. The exposures of GDP and population in regions with extensive exposure to extreme precipitation events at the 1.5 degrees C warming increase more remarkably with the additional 0.5 degrees C warming. In particular, Asia and Africa show lager sensitivity to global warming than other regions. These findings could provide information for mitigation and adaptation policymaking. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Although several studies focused on individual extreme climate events, the occurrence of compound extreme events is still not well studied in the upper Midwestern United States. In this study, compound extreme precipitation preceded by extreme hot day events was investigated. Results showed a strong linkage between extreme precipitation events and extreme hot days. A significant increasing trend was noticed mainly in Iowa (10.1%), northern parts of Illinois (5.04%), and Michigan (5.04%). Results also showed a higher intensity of extreme precipitation events preceded by an extremely hot day compared to the intensity of extreme precipitation events not preceded by an extremely hot day, mostly in the central and lower parts of Minnesota, western and upper parts of Iowa, lower and upper parts of Illinois, parts of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin for 1950-2010. In other words, extreme heat contributed to more extreme precipitation events. Our findings would provide important insights related to flood management under future climate change scenarios in the region.

It is well documented how such events have impacted society outside Antarctica through enhanced levels of rainfall and flooding, heatwaves and wildfires, drought and water/food shortages and episodes of intense cooling. Here, we briefly examine evidence for extreme events in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean across a variety of environments and timescales. We show how vulnerable natural Antarctic systems are to extreme events and highlight how governance and environmental protection of the continent must take them into account. Given future additional heating of at least 0.4 degrees C is now unavoidable (to contain heating to the "Paris Agreement 1.5 degrees C" scenario), and may indeed be higher unless drastic action is successfully taken on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by mid-Century, we explain it is virtually certain that future Antarctic extreme events will be more pronounced than those observed to date.

Both greenhouse gas fluxes and carbon storage are driven by microbial communities in wetland soils. However, these key players are often overlooked or overly simplified in current global climate models. Here, we first integrate microbial metabolisms with biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring at scales from individual microbial cells to ecosystems. This conceptual scale-bridging framework guides the development of feedback loops describing how wetland-specific climate impacts (i.e., sea level rise in estuarine wetlands, droughts and floods in inland wetlands) will affect future climate trajectories. These feedback loops highlight knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to develop predictive models of future climates capturing microbial contributions. We propose a roadmap connecting environmental scientific disciplines to address these knowledge gaps and improve the representation of microbial processes in climate models. Together, this paves the way to understand how microbially mediated climate feedbacks from wetlands will impact future climate change.

J	Wang, SZ				Wang, Shengzhe			Simplified analytical solutions to the yaw dynamics of modular floating structures	OCEAN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Floating structure; Regular waves; Wave spectrum; RAO; Climate adaptation; Dynamic analysis	INDUCED MOTION; COASTAL; VLFS	Climate change has necessitated the development of modular floating structures (MFS) as a sustainable solution to enhance the resiliency of coastal cities against flooding and sea level rise. Hence, it is imperative that simplified methods of analysis are introduced to the design community. This technical note presents closed-form expressions parameterizing the response amplitude operators (RAO) of rectangular pontoons subject to yaw (rotation about the vertical z axis) to complement solutions derived by Wang (2022) for the five remaining degrees of freedom. Following validation, a parametric investigation was implemented to assess the influence of pontoon geometry on the yaw response of an idealized MFS exposed to realistic sea states. It was identified that pontoons exhibiting a characteristic width smaller than the wavelength are generally more resistant to yaw excitation as they become squarer in shape. Conversely, while larger pontoons are less sensitive to geometric effects, they exhibit heightened sensitivity to changes in wave conditions. The simplified analytical approach thus provides an accessible pathway towards the structural or architectural design of floating structures as a precursor to detailed computational modeling.

It is crucial to assess the resilience of urban water supply systems and develop corresponding disaster mitigation and improvement strategies. Urban water supply systems include many subsystems, but existing researches generally focus on a single subsystem. Therefore, this paper proposes a correlation analysis method and a factor analysis method for the resilience evaluation index system of urban water supply systems by combining each subsystem and applying grey system theory. The method can reflect the four dimensions of the water supply process (water source, water plant, supply and distribution network and users) and the five dimensions of the urban management system (society, natural environment, economy, physics and organization). Taking Qingdao as an example, a multi-level integrated evaluation model based on a cloud model is applied to simulate and analyze the resilience of Qingdao's water supply system. As a result, decision support is provided for planning and building resilience systems for urban water systems in the short and long term, based on four main factors.

Historically, there is little evidence for systematic increases in flood magnitude despite observed increases in precipitation extremes. Here we investigate how flood magnitudes change in response to warming, using a large initial-condition ensemble of simulations with a single climate model, coupled to a hydrological model. The model chain was applied to historical (1961-2000) and warmer future (2060-2099) climate conditions for 78 watersheds in hydrological Bavaria, a region comprising the headwater catchments of the Inn, Danube and Main River, thus representing an area of expressed hydrological heterogeneity. For the majority of the catchments, we identify a 'return interval threshold' in the relationship between precipitation and flood increases: at return intervals above this threshold, further increases in extreme precipitation frequency and magnitude clearly yield increased flood magnitudes; below the threshold, flood magnitude is modulated by land surface processes. We suggest that this threshold behaviour can reconcile climatological and hydrological perspectives on changing flood risk in a warming climate.

Plants are susceptible to extreme temperatures during the crucial phases of flowering and seed development, and elevated carbon levels also lead to yield losses. Productivity is also affected by floods and droughts. Therefore, increasing plant yield and stress tolerance are the priorities to be met through novel biotechnological interventions. The contributions of NAC genes towards enhancing plant survivability under stress is well known. Here we focus on the potential of NAC genes in the regulation of abiotic stress tolerance, secondary cell wall synthesis, lateral root development, yield potential, seed size and biomass, ROS signaling, leaf senescence, and programmed cell death. Once naturally tolerant candidate NAC genes have been identified, and the nature of their association with growth and fitness against multi-environmental stresses has been determined, they can be exploited for building inherent tolerance in future crops via transgenic technologies. An update on the latest developments is provided in this review, which summarizes the current understanding of the roles of NAC in the establishment of various stress-adaptive mechanisms in model and food crop plants.

Hierarchical Approach for Assessing the Vulnerability of Roads and Bridges to Flooding in Massachusetts	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; INDICATORS	The current study addresses the issue of vulnerability assessment of transportation systems to climate change, with the purpose of improving current indicator-based approaches in this field. It builds upon other efforts and seeks to enhance rationality in the decision-making process by minimizing arbitrary choices. The study focuses on coastal Massachusetts, which is affected by sea level rise (SLR) and storms and, thus, requires adaptation plans that will prevent interruption of service to communities that are dependent upon the transportation system. A prior step to such planning is identifying the vulnerable parts of the system. An indicator-based approach is commonly employed for that matter, wherein various indicators are integrated to measure vulnerability. Limitations of this approach include arbitrary aggregation and weighting of indicators. These limitations are addressed by prioritizing indicators to create ordered asset lists for adaptation needs. Roads and bridges are analyzed in separate schemes, and the results are presented both in a table and a map format, visualizing the relevant features to users, with the purpose of providing a vulnerability assessment that is transparent, modifiable, and rational.

Based on daily precipitation dataset of 50 station records, spatial and temporal variations of annual and seasonal precipitation from 1962 to 2011 in Qinghai Province, China are investigated using four statistical methods. Moreover, rainfall is analyzed for different rainfall intensities using the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method and the double ratio statistic (DRS) method. The results indicate that the reduction of precipitation in the densely populated eastern and southeastern regions is closely related to human activities. And human activities primarily affect extreme precipitation. The decrease in summer and autumn precipitation plays a major role in the decrease in the annual total precipitation. Spring and winter rainfall exhibit significant increasing trends. The inhibition of autumn precipitation caused by human activities is the most obvious, and this inhibitory effect can cause drought. It is hoped that this study can provide support for water resources planning and for dealing with droughts and floods.

An assessment of the present hydroclimatic regime of the Madeira River basin using climate and hydrological models	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Article						Madeira River basin; regional climate model; hydrological model; Earth system models; hydroclimatic regime	AMAZON BASIN; SOUTH-AMERICA; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; INUNDATION PATTERNS; BIAS CORRECTION; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; LAND; SIMULATION	Southwestern Amazonia has low spatial coverage of hydro-meteorological data, making climate and hydrological models essential tools. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate these models to verify their suitability for future climate change assessments. We evaluate the ability of a regional climate model (Eta) forced with three Earth system models and a large-scale hydrological model (MGB) to represent hydroclimatic variables for the current climate in the Madeira River basin. Different hydro-meteorological databases are used to evaluate the systematic errors of the coupled model system. The simulation results show that the Eta model underestimates (overestimates) precipitation over the basin during the rainy (dry) season. The hydrological processes simulated by the MGB are considered satisfactory, although the model has some limitations with respect to the timing of floods and their removal in different discharge regimes.

Adaptation measures under the impacts of climate and land-use/land-cover changes using HSPF model simulation: Application to Gongola river basin, Nigeria	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Flood emergencies; Impoundment reservoir; Land use; land cover change; Peak discharge; Planned reforestation	HYDROLOGICAL RESPONSE; LOW FLOWS; CALIBRATION; FUTURE; WATER; BASINS/HSPF; HYDROPOWER; DISCHARGE; RUNOFF; SOIL	Recently, there is an upsurge in flood emergencies in Nigeria, in which their frequencies and impacts are expected to exacerbate in the future due to land-use/land cover (LULC) and climate change stressors. The separate and combined forces of these stressors on the Gongola river basin is feebly understood and the probable future impacts are not clear. Accordingly, this study uses a process-based watershed modelling approach - the Hydrological Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) (i) to understand the basin's current and future hydrological fluxes and (ii) to quantify the effective-ness of five management options as adaptation measures for the impacts of the stressors. The ensemble means of the three models derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are employed for generating future climate scenarios, considering three distinct radiative forcing peculiar to the study area. Also, the historical and future LULC (developed from the hybrid of Cellular Automata and Markov Chain model) are used to produce the LULC scenarios for the basin. The effective calibration, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are used for optimising the pa-rameters of the model and the validated result implies a plausible model with efficiency of up to 75 %. Consequently, the results of individual impacts of the stressors yield amplification of the peak flows, with more profound impacts from climate stressor than the LULC. Therefore, the climate impact may trigger a marked peak discharge that is 48 % higher as compared to the historical peak flows which are equivalent to 10,000-year flood event. Whilst the com-bine impacts may further amplify this value by 27 % depending on the scenario. The proposed management interven-tions such as planned reforestation and reservoir at Dindima should attenuate the disastrous peak discharges by almost 36 %. Furthermore, the land management option should promote the carbon-sequestering project of the Paris agreement ratified by Nigeria. While the reservoir would serve secondary functions of energy production; employment opportunities, aside other social aspects. These measures are therefore expected to mitigate feasibly the negative impacts anticipated from the stressors and the approach can be employed in other river basins in Africa confronted with similar challenges.

Swift Weathering Response on Floodplains During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							BIGHORN BASIN; WILLWOOD FORMATION; ISOTOPE EXCURSION; WESTERN INTERIOR; CARBON; CLIMATE; PALEOSOLS; LITHIUM; CONSTRAINTS; EVOLUTION	Silicate weathering is thought to increase and offset the rapid, massive input of CO2 into the atmosphere and ocean during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), but few nonmarine records have been used to quantify this. We probe changes in silicate weathering intensity by measuring Li isotope ratios of bedrock and ancient floodplain deposits spanning the PETM in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (USA). Our results reveal a rapid increase in silicate weathering intensity during the PETM that remained high during at least the initial stage of climate recovery. Additionally, we determine that soils that formed farthest from ancient river channels underwent larger weathering changes than near-channel soils. Alongside increased temperatures and pCO(2), the simplest explanation for this response relates to increased seasonal fluctuations in water table height in the floodplain that promote dissolution and precipitation reactions. These findings newly demonstrate that weathering on floodplains, like mountain hillslopes, responds to climate change. Plain Language Summary The chemical breakdown of silicate minerals on continents promotes the withdrawal of CO2 from the ocean and atmosphere. This process is thought to be enhanced when CO2 rapidly enters the ocean and atmosphere, such as during past climate change events like the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Although this enhancement of silicate weathering is found in global carbon cycle models and the chemistry of marine rocks, less terrestrial evidence exists for how, where, and to what extent silicate minerals weathered during the PETM. In this study, we measured the chemistry of bedrock and ancient floodplain sediment that span the PETM in the well-studied Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (USA) to quantify changes in silicate weathering intensity. We find that silicate weathering intensity increases rapidly (within 7,000 years of the onset of the PETM) and remains elevated even as climate has begun to return to its pre-perturbed state. We also determine that soils that formed farthest from ancient river channels underwent larger weathering changes than near-channel soils, suggesting active weathering responses on floodplains. Alongside high CO2 contents and warmer temperatures, the simplest explanation for this weathering response relates to soil hydrology, where increased water flow through soils caused by fluctuating water tables enhanced weathering.

In heavily modified landscapes, a lack of undisturbed sites hinders the description of reference conditions to help guide planning efforts. In lieu of contemporary reference sites, we used historical Public Land Survey data from the late 1800s and early 1900s to document historical streamside vegetation at 1685 sites distributed throughout the Columbia River basin. We used those data to construct a random forest classification model using climatic and geomorphic variables to predict the probability of occurrence of riparian vegetation groups (conifer, deciduous, shrub, and willow) and individual taxa (fir, pine, cedar, cottonwood, alder, sagebrush) for all stream reaches with bankfull width >6 m in the interior Columbia River basin. The most common predictor variables included in the best models for vegetation groups or individual taxa were mean annual precipitation, minimum temperature, elevation, and bankfull width. For some taxa, temperature range and floodplain width were also important predictors. The probability maps indicate that riparian zones were likely dominated by willow species in semi-desert regions and by conifer species in the humid mountain regions. Deciduous species dominated riparian areas in transition zones between conifer forests and semi-deserts. Species distributions suggest that streams in the semi-deserts were likely characterized by little shade and low wood abundance, whereas streams in the humid mountains would have been more heavily shaded with high wood abundance. The transitional deciduous areas were likely shaded with moderate wood abundance. Historical trends in air temperature and precipitation suggest relatively small changes in climate since the time of the surveys, indicating that current species ranges are likely similar to historical species ranges. Hence, these maps can be used to help identify suitable taxonomic groups and expected riparian functions for riparian restoration in the Columbia River basin, with appropriate adjustments made to site-specific restoration designs to account for model uncertainty, future climate change, or land use constraints.

This study is a comprehensive modelling exercise on quantifying flood-induced wetland connectivity and the potential impacts of climate and water storage in an unregulated river basin in northern Australia. Flood inundation was simulated using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and the connectivities between wetlands and rivers were calculated using geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS. Wetlands in the floodplain were identified using waterbody maps derived from satellite imagery. A broadly representative sample of 20 wetlands were selected from 158 wetlands in the Mitchell basin considering location, size and spatial distribution. Five flood events ranging from 1 in 2 to 1 in 100 years were investigated to evaluate how connectivity changes with flood magnitude. Connectivities were assessed for the current condition as well as for two scenarios of future climate (Cwet and Cdry) and one scenario of dam storage. Results showed that a 1 in 100 years event inundated about 5450 km(2) of land compared to 1160 km(2) for a 1 in 2 years event. Average connectivity of wetlands in the Mitchell basin varies from 1 to 5 days for the floods of 1 in 2 to 1 in 26 years. As expected, a large flood produces longer duration of connectivity relative to a small flood. Results also showed that reduction in mean connectivity under a dryer climate (up to 1.8 days) is higher than the possibility of increase under a wet climate (up to 1 day). The impacts of a water storage, in the headwater catchment, are highly pronounced in terms of inundation and wetland connectivity (e.g., mean connectivity reduced by 1.7 days). The relative change in connectivity is higher for a small flood compared to that of a large event. These results demonstrate that there is a possibility of both increase and decease in connectivity under future climate. However, any water storage will negatively impact the connectivity between floodplain waterbodies and thus reduce the material exchange resulting in a reduction in primary and secondary productions in rivers and wetlands.

Therefore, accurately identifying future changing patterns in the flood risk is essential. For this purpose, this study elaborated a new framework for a basin scale that employs a future land-use simulation model, a factor spatialization technique, and a novel hybrid model for scenario-based flood risk assessment in 2030 and 2050. Three land-use scenarios (i.e., natural growth scenario, cropland protection scenario, and ecological protection scenario) were set and applied in Jinjiang Basin to explore the changes in future flood risk under these scenarios. The results indicate the different degrees of increase in flood risk that will occur in the three scenarios. Under the natural growth (NG) scenario, the city will expand rapidly with the growth of population and economy, and the total area with high and very high flood risk will increase by 371.30 km(2) by 2050, as compared to 2020. However, under the ecological protection (EP) scenario, woodlands will be protected, and the growth in population, economy, and built-up lands will slow down with slightly increased risk of flooding. In this scenario, the total area with high and very high flood risk will increase by 113.75 km(2) by 2050. Under the cropland protection (CP) scenario, the loss of croplands will have been effectively stopped, and the flood risk will not show a significant increase under this scenario, with an increase by only 90.96 km(2) by 2050, similar to the EP scenario. Spatially, these increased flood risks mainly locate at the periphery of existing built-up lands, and the high-flood-risk zones are mainly distributed in the southeast of the Jinjiang Basin. The information about increasing flood risk determined by the framework provides insight into the spatio-temporal characteristics of future flood-prone areas, which facilitates reasonable flood mitigation measures to be developed at the most critical locations in the region.

The coastal dynamics patterns can be changed by natural or anthropogenic activities. This study is mainly focused on understanding the significant changes of geomorphology, bathymetry, and the coastal dynamics originated due to human influences in a monsoon-affected Kalu Ganga (River) outlet in Sri Lanka. In this research project, bathymetric variations before and after the collapse of sand spit barrier were analysed to understand the extent of the erosional and depositional effects. High-resolution satellite images in Google Earth Pro were also used to qualitatively analyse beach boundary changes before the collapse of the sand spit barrier. Temporal and spatial changes of beach boundary positions after collapse of the sand spit barrier were measured using high precision GPS surveying in river outlet including the evolving sand spit barrier. Nested wave model (Delft3D modelling suite) was applied to understand the wave climate changes. The data obtained from all methods were analysed to understand the geomorphological, bathymetric and coastal dynamic changes of the study area. The results show significant and widespread deepening of bathymetry up to 1-2 m extending as far as 2 km offshore from the river outlet initiated after the collapse of the sand spit barrier. Further, the study shows separation from the mainland and buckling of the sand barrier was initiated by anthropogenic activity coupled with the release of riverine floodwater and strong waves during southwest monsoon season. The weakened and buckled sand spit barrier was migrated and welded to the mainland during calm weather of northeast monsoon. This has resulted complete change of coastal dynamics in the Kalu Ganga (River) outlet area. Since the sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics completely changed, even after 2 years, the sand spit barrier across the river outlet has not been recreated naturally. Therefore, important structures in Kalutara coastal area were threatened due to severe erosion. This study shows understanding such coastal morpho-dynamic and hydrodynamic changes are vital to implement proper coastal prevention management strategies.	[Gunasinghe, G. P.; Ratnayake, N.

J	Le Gal, M; Mitarai, S				Le Gal, Marine; Mitarai, Satoshi			Reef influence quantification in light of the 1771 Meiwa tsunami	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Tsunamis; Reef; Meiwa 1771; Non-linear shallow water models	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SEA-LEVEL-RISE; CORAL-REEF; WAVE TRANSFORMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BATHYMETRY; RUNUP; FLOW	While interactions between regular wave driven flooding and reefs have been widely studied due to climate change pressure, the effects of reefs on tsunami flooding have less been investigated. From studies of historical events, reefs can behave as buffers or as amplifiers of inundation, depending upon the location. Interactions between reefs and tsunamis have generally been analyzed with idealized models, and there have been only few studies of specific reefs and their characteristics. Using numerical NonLinear Shallow Water models, this study characterizes the influence of the Southeast Ishigaki Island reef during the 1771 tsunami that hit the Yaeyama Islands. In this work, we modified reef topography in silica and then, measured the impact of these changes using a new parameter, the Reef Impact Factor (RIF). First, a reference model was built, simulating the real event with an accurate reef representation and using run-up data to calibrate bottom friction. This calibration highlights the difficulty of representing reef friction with a homogeneous coefficient. Second, a model without a reef was compared to the reference model. The impact of reef removal varies considerably along the coastline and maximum wave heights at the shore were strongly affected, with a 12.5% increase on average. Overall, this suggests a protective role of the reef along most of the coast. However, at local scale, channels that break the continuity of the front reef, increased wave heights by up to 40% on the proximate coast, revealing their strong focusing influence. Finally, changes in tide level, which regulates reef depth, were investigated, showing a global positive correlation between sea level and maximum wave height at the coast. However, the impact of the reef depth appeared weak compared to the impact of incident wave parameters. This study contributes to a global effort to understand tsunami-reef interactions in a non-idealized framework, suggesting a Reef Impact Factor for inter-reef/study comparisons. Moreover, vulnerable and exposed coasts were identified at Ishigaki Island, which may help to improve inundation forecasting, resulting in more appropriate management of these vulnerable sections of the coast.

The associated lock-downs caused local economic losses and the disruption of international supply chains. In addition, such stress alters the effects of short-term shocks as caused by climate extremes, especially their propagation through the economic network and the resulting repercussions. Here we show that adverse indirect impacts of tropical cyclones, river floods, and heat stress on global consumption are strongly enhanced when the economy is under stress. This compound effect results from aggravated scarcity causing higher consumer prices. Modeling climate impacts during Covid-19, we find that in a stressed economy with the current network structure, consumption losses due to climate extremes double in the USA and triple in China. The simulated effects intensify when climate shocks grow stronger. Our results emphasize the amplifying role of the interaction between climate change and its socioeconomic backdrop.

Despite this, existing literature and process-based frameworks enabling simulation of waterlogging are sparse. Here, we reveal a lack of field experiments that have enumerated effects of waterlogging on plant growth. We call for more research on waterlogging, particularly in controlled field conditions with quantified soil properties and continuous monitoring of soil moisture. We opine that future experiments should explicitly focus on the impact of waterlogging on phenology, root development, and water and nutrient uptake, including interactions with atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature and other biotic/abiotic stresses. Such experimental data could then be used to develop waterlogging algorithms for crop models. Greater understanding of how waterlogging impacts on plant physiology will be conducive to more robust projections of how climate change will impact on global food security.

Safe-to-fail approaches for infrastructure planning and design improve the capacity of cities to adapt for uncertain climate futures by identifying social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS) capabilities to prepare for potential failure scenarios. In this paper, we argue for transforming infrastructure planning and design to effectively utilize safe-to-fail approaches by navigating the opportunities and trade-offs of SETS resilience capabilities. From a technological vantage point, traditional infrastructure planning approaches account for social and ecological domains as external design conditions rather than embedded system characteristics. Safe-to-fail approaches directly challenge the isolation of the technological domain by necessitating a recognition that SETS domains are interconnected and interdependent in infrastructure systems, as such risks and system capabilities for resilience must be managed cohesively.

J	Javeline, D; Kijewski-Correa, T; Chesler, A				Javeline, Debra; Kijewski-Correa, Tracy; Chesler, Angela			Do Perverse Insurance Incentives Encourage Coastal Vulnerability?	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article							FLOOD INSURANCE; MITIGATION; RISK; HOUSEHOLDS; HOMEOWNERS; DECISIONS; RESPONSES; COVERAGE; WIND	Subsidized insurance is often described as a perverse incentive, moral hazard, or maladaptation that perpetuates coastal residencies in vulnerable homes despite increasing safety and economic risks from hurricanes, sea level rise, and other climate change impacts. Insurance is also often described as a positive factor in coastal risk reduction if insurers proactively reward homeowners for upgrades that mitigate losses from hurricanes. The empirical and policy-relevant question remains whether homeowners perceive insurance incentives as perverse or positive. A new survey of 662 North Carolina coastal homeowners shows that most are failing to upgrade their homes to address hurricane risk or plan for coastal retreat but not because they expect insurance to cover losses.

Limited awareness of existing policies suggests a need for greater outreach by policymakers, lenders, and insurers. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The controls on avulsion locations are poorly understood as a result of sparse data on such features. We analyzed nearly 50 years of satellite imagery and documented 113 avulsions across the globe that indicate three distinct controls on avulsion location. Avulsions on fans coincide with valley-confinement change, whereas avulsions on deltas are primarily clustered within the backwater zone, indicating a control by spatial flow deceleration or acceleration during floods. However, 38% of avulsions on deltas occurred upstream of backwater effects. These events occurred in steep, sediment-rich rivers in tropical and desert environments. Our results indicate that avulsion location on deltas is set by the upstream extent of flood-driven erosion, which is typically limited to the backwater zone but can extend far upstream in steep, sediment-laden rivers. Our findings elucidate how avulsion hazards might respond to land use and climate change.

J	Faragallah, RN				Faragallah, Riham Nady			Fundamentals of temporary dwelling solutions: A proposed sustainable model for design and construction	AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Construction-design-disaster-dwelling-model-temporary		In the last decades, the number of natural disasters has considerably increased which has an extreme effect on the built environment. In this case, most buildings undergo severe damages and plenty of them totally breakdown which is one of the strongest impacts of a disaster. Egypt is considered as one of the countries that is exposed to unexpected natural hazards as a result of climate change, floods, earthquakes, etc. Thus, the main objective is to find solutions through temporary dwellings for displaced people to help them find an alternative residence. The paper is divided into three parts. First, it explores the fundamentals of design and construction of temporary dwellings based on diverse experiences from different contexts. Second, it analyzes the Nubian resettlement as a case study. Finally, the third part proposes a sustainable model for temporary dwelling solutions that act as a road map for flexible implementation.

Here we present a dataset based on a survey (N = 4,154) of public risk perception in Italy and Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both countries were heavily affected by the first wave of infections in Spring 2020, but their governmental responses were very different. As such, the dataset offers unique opportunities to investigate the role of governmental responses in shaping public risk perception. In addition to epidemics, the survey considered indirect effects of COVID-19 (domestic violence, economic crises), as well as global (climate change) and local (wildfires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, terror attacks) threats. The survey examines perceived likelihoods and impacts, individual and authorities' preparedness and knowledge, and socio-demographic indicators. Hence, the resulting dataset has the potential to enable a plethora of analyses on social, cultural and institutional factors influencing the way in which people perceive risk.

Modeling, simulation and optimization of the rotating packed bed (RPB) absorber and stripper for MEA-based carbon capture	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Rotating packed bed; MEA process; Chemical absorption; Operation conditions; Optimization		Despite rising concern with climate change, carbon capture is yet to be implemented widely in the industry due to its size and cost. The rotating packed bed (RPB), a high gravity technology process, has been suggested to intensify the conventional packed bed. In this study, rigorous models of the RPB absorber and stripper for carbon capture are developed and implemented in the commercial simulator of gPROMS. The developed process models are validated with published steady-state experimental data and the entire carbon capture process comprising the RPB absorber, the RPB stripper, and other process units with solvent recycle is simulated. Initial designs of the rotating packed beds are suggested considering the flooding limit and capture rate. Then the steady-state optimal operation conditions minimizing the total energy of the MEA process with the intensified absorber and stripper are found and their behaviors are analyzed.

Investigating social processes that underpin local flood risk management action	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Social processes; Flood risk management; Soft FRM; Wholescape thinking; Vision-making	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SOMERSET LEVELS; TRADE-OFF; POLICY; RESTORATION; POLITICS; WETLANDS; LESSONS	As climate change erodes current levels of flood protection in the UK and government investment in 'hard' flood risk management (hFRM) is rationed by cost-benefit ratios, the option for many communities at-risk is to implement local 'soft' FRM (sFRM). The frequency of widespread flooding generates an added urgency to understand how to support sFRM. Using a case study and qualitative analysis, we explore social processes (SPs), such as acculturation, that drive stakeholder adaptation to be more flood resilient. We conceptualise the status quo beleaguered by conflict and competition and propose practices of accommodation and cooperation that can support shared objectives and responsibility that strengthen sFRM. Our conceptual model is mapped on a stylised catchment to illustrate how SPs underpin sFRM interventions that join-up the catchment in wholescape thinking. The transferable learning is that there are group behaviours and inclusive practices that can initiate and support local sFRM.

The Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis was used for grouping sub-catchments in reference to the standardized aforementioned flows. Trends analysis was performed for each cluster of catchments in all combinations of periods not shorter than 20 years. Spatial distribution of clusters of catchments has been analysed according to geographical locations. There are observed different trends in distinguished groups of catchments, wherein the substantial differences concern long-term trends. Changes in trend direction in the years 1951-2015 were revealed, which indicate flow fluctuations. Presumably, physiographical heterogeneity of the Upper Vistula Basin is reflected in no unequivocal trends occurring in clusters of catchments. Some similarities were stated in short-term trends occurring in particular groups of catchments.

The integrated assessment framework consisted of the drainage system model establishment, analytic hierarchy process theory, and regret value method. Five drainage system reconstruction schemes for Chaohu city were proposed in this study, and they were evaluated according to nine assessment factors by the integrated assessment method at the initial and future stages. The integrated assessment results show that setting up interceptive equipment for a combined drainage network is the optimal reconstruction scheme at both the initial and future stages of the life cycle. This means that an interceptive combined drainage network is better than a separate drainage network or setting up storage tanks in particular situations from a comprehensive perspective.

This climatic shift was probably triggered by a volcanic eruption in 209 BC, an event that also caused a failure of the Nile to flood, leading to the famine-induced revolt of 207-186 BC in Upper Egypt. The Berenike excavations have not only uncovered the first Hellenistic city on the East African coast, but have also contributed to a better understanding of the effect of natural disasters on ancient societies.

We use daily precipitation records from 43 Global Historical Climate Network daily (GHCNd) weather stations to examine trends in mean and extreme precipitation across Arizona from 1950 to 2020. We use a suite of standardized precipitation indices and explore the statistical significance of historical changes at the annual, monthly, and seasonal scales. Our analysis returns a motley collection of results displaying a great degree of spatial variability and sensitivity to the temporal scale of analysis. Mean total precipitation at the statewide scale underwent a small decreasing trend of 0.15 mm year  1, with considerable interannual variability being a dominant feature. The majority of stations experienced no statistically significant change in extreme precipitation at the annual scale. Monsoon season mean precipitation followed a similar pattern to annual means, with an overall reduction of 0.14 mm year  1 across the state. One fourth of stations, all located at elevations lower than 650 m, recorded decreases in monsoon precipitation intensity. Winter season analysis presents a different picture, displaying a positive statewide trend of 0.11 mm year  1 in mean precipitation. One tenth of stations recorded increases in extreme precipitation intensity and decreases in the number of consecutive dry days. Results of our observational analysis indicate a lack of a clear consensus on the climatological trends of mean/ extreme precipitation in Arizona during the study period. Our findings are in contrast to those from other similarly arid areas across the world and highlight the role of regional differences in modulating the potential hydrometeorological impacts associated with climate change. However, while we do not find widespread, significant, modification in the spectrum of precipitation changes examined, the hydrologic system of the state has been - and will continue to be - impacted by the ongoing temperature increase associated with the buildup of greenhouse gases and continued population growth.

Sediment deficit and morphological change of the Rhine-Meuse river mouth attributed to multi-millennial anthropogenic impacts	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH			English	Article						Sediment; Estuaries; Deltas; Morphology; Human intervention; Maps	SEA-LEVEL-RISE; SEINE ESTUARY FRANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YANGTZE-RIVER; DELTA; EVOLUTION; NETHERLANDS; AVULSION; VULNERABILITY; BATHYMETRY	Many delta systems worldwide are becoming increasingly urbanized following a variety of processes, including land reclamation, embanking, major engineering and port constructions, dredging and more. Here, we trace the development of one system, the Rhine-Meuse delta in the Netherlands (RMD) from two natural estuaries (the RME fed by the Rhine river and the HVL fed by the Meuse river) to a densely urbanized delta and the effect human activities have had on its morphology through time. Estuary outlines determined from palaeogeographical and old maps and tidal range at the estuary mouth were used to reconstruct basic estuary parameters. Depth distribution was predicted with a morphological tool. We have determined that the northern estuary, where port activities dominate, shows a stepwise deepening due to dredging for navigation. The southern port shows stepwise shallowing as humans closed off this branch from tidal action. Both estuaries show narrowing and loss of intertidal width over the past five centuries. The total loss of water volume has been-5.5 m(3 )x 10(9) since 1500 AD coinciding with major human intervention in the system, driven by the rapid economic boom during the mid 16th century. This has led to a reduction of intertidal areas and floodplains and long-term sediment shortage resulting in a myriad of problems, including increased flood risk, threats to bank protection and infrastructure and loss of nature areas. These problems will be exacerbated in coming centuries by predicted sea-level rise. Other urban deltas, unrestricted by engineering and dredging innovations which took place more gradually in earlier centuries, are now undergoing rapid changes in mere decades, changes which took hundreds of years in the RMD. Future predictions indicate that by 2050 the RMD will experience the highest loss of sediment in the 3500 year history of the system, despite these changes only occurring vertically (deepening) and not laterally (narrowing or embanking). This shows an urgent need to reconsider sediment management and spatial planning of port expansion in urbanized systems and the fate of such systems under climate change and rising sea-levels.

J	Bao, JL; Gao, S				Bao, Junlin; Gao, Shu			Wetland Utilization and Adaptation Practice of a Coastal Megacity: A Case Study of Chongming Island, Shanghai, China	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						coastal wetland; land use change; climatic adaptation; sea-dike system; Chongming Island; Shanghai	SEA-LEVEL RISE; LONG-TERM; LAND-USE; PROGRADATION RATE; YANGTZE-RIVER; MEKONG DELTA; DEGRADATION; FUTURE; RECLAMATION; STRATEGIES	Coastal urban areas are faced with risks induced by global warming and sea level rise, which puts pressure on regional sustainable development. In particular, land use adjustment is closely related to climate change for a coastal megacity. Coastal wetlands on the edge of the megacity represent a vulnerable ecosystem and a key area in terms of the resilient adaptation strategy. However, the interrelationship between the development of these wetlands and the megacity's adaptation practice has not been sufficiently analyzed. From a historical perspective, based on document synthesis and field investigation, we attempt in this study to reveal long-term land use stages and driving factors in association with urban marginal wetlands, with a special reference to eastern Chongming Island, Shanghai. On such a basis, the future adaptation strategy of the megacity is evaluated. The analytical results show that this island has witnessed three periods of time for wetland utilization: traditional land use for salt production, fishery and agriculture before 1950, industrialization with rapid reclamation during 1950-2001, and the land use pattern orientated toward wetland ecosystem protection after 2002. The driving forces include sediment budget on the coast, wetland morphodynamic processes, sea level rise, population growth, and resource management policy changes. Transformation occurred between the wetland utilization stages in response to the changes of these forces. Furthermore, facing future climate change, there are different options of adaptation, e.g., retreatment and adherence. It may not be suitable for coastal cities with a large population to take the first option. It will be suitable for coastal communities to adhere to the location, if solutions to the problems of flooding risk, coastal erosion, and the maintenance of coastal facilities can be found. For eastern Chongming wetlands, as a key experimental area for ecosystem-oriented development in Shanghai, the transformation from the reclamation-oriented utilization toward the protection of wetland ecosystems represents the first step toward the latter option. We suggest that the next steps would be to maintain the ecological niche of the wetlands, to create new approaches to coastal engineering with contributions from the ecosystem, and to provide better ecosystem services.

Wetlands are epoch-making reproducing and nourishing zones for wildlife and give shelters and protection for sea creatures. As with any natural habitat, wetlands are important in supporting species diversity as well as providing the climate moderating element. This study aimed at appraising the spatial pattern of the Isimangaliso Wetland, the potential determinants and effects of the wetland depletion between 1987 and 2017 using remote sensing and GIS approach. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired for 1987, 1997, 2007 and Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery for 2017 was acquired from the archives of United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the analysis using ArcGIS 10.2. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) analyses between 1987 and 2017 successfully revealed the significant depletion of the water surrounding IW area which might be as a result of natural or human activities which may include climate change, built-up areas and agricultural activities. In 1987 and 2017, the results showed that wetland extent was 655.416 Km(2) and 429.489 Km(2) respectively which connotes that IW has witnessed significant changes during the study period over the area. It was also revealed that the other land features (vegetation, built-up, open surface and rocky surface) over the area increased from 2149.911 Km(2) to 2375.838 Km(2) in 1987 and 2017 respectively. The overall classification accuracy of 97.55% and Kappa coefficient of 0.941. This wetland depletion might have a significant impact on biodiversity including human and animals as well as plants thus diminishing its world heritage status. Consequently, this natural gift needs to be conserved to create a livable environment for wetland animals in order to moderate local climate as well as preserve human wellness and protection by reducing flood disaster and maintaining efficient water quantity and quality in the area.

These conditions create unique challenges related to vulnerability and adaptation that have direct disaster management implications. Our research investigates the relationship between geographic isolation and flood-related social vulnerability across Peru's ecological regions. Ecoregions have different relationships with colonialism and capitalism that shape vulnerability, and we hypothesize that the relationship between vulnerability and geographic isolation varies across ecoregions. Using mapping techniques and spatial regression analysis, we find that relationships between vulnerability and geographic isolation vary regionally, with differences that suggest alignment with regional contexts of extraction. We find notable differences in vulnerability related to public health infrastructure and access to services and between ecoregions with sharply contrasting histories of natural resource extraction and investment and disinvestment.

Hurricane storm surge and coastal flooding can cause significant hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads on structures while saltwater intrusion (SWI) may lead to deterioration of foundations. The effects of saltwater intrusion due to Sea Level Rise (SLR) on the foundations of buildings and other civil infrastructure is poorly understood. Such damages may not be detected in a timely fashion nor be insured, leading to significant and unanticipated expenses for building owners. In this study, we evaluate the impact of SWI due to various SLR scenarios on the corrosion of reinforcement in foundations of nearly 137,000 residential buildings in low-lying areas surrounding Mobile Bay, AL. We find that the potential for costly damage is significant. Under an extreme SLR scenario, the annual expected repair costs for the foundations of the studied homes may reach as much as US$90 million by 2100.

To this end, in this study, using the qualitative method of phenomenology and painting tool, we analyzed the experiences of children who encountered a flood disaster in Lorestan province in western Iran. The study was conducted through deep interviews with 34 children who experienced floods. Analysis of interviews with and paintings obtained from the studied children revealed that ten key experiences and effects from children's flood experiences could be identified. The study's findings revealed that children's lived experiences of flood can provide a suitable opportunity for individual, social, economic, geographical, spatial, and environmental recognition, understanding, education, and preparedness of them as the future generation. Therefore, understanding children's experiences of flood disasters and their effects can be beneficial not only for planning and managing hazards, but also for reducing the vulnerability of both the future generation and their children.

This was followed in May by a second earthquake. Nepal experienced another natural disaster in 2017. Floods affected large swathes of the country from east to west. Using both qualitative and quantitative data, this article examines the impact of these climate disasters on violence against women. In doing so, it adds to a small but growing and fundamentally important body of literature that explores the intersections of gendered violence and natural disaster. It is well-established that 35% of women worldwide have experienced physical and/or sexual violence. What we know much less about is how other events impact on these figures. Given the growing intensity of climate change and the reality that adverse impacts are here to stay, understanding the detrimental legacy of natural disasters is now more urgent than ever.

However, to cope with this threat, conventional flood management suffers from limitations and difficulties because of the practice of uniform flood prevention measures being applied to all stream sections according to river grade classification. A wide array of measures should be considered to differentiate flood protection targets: adaptive flood management strategy is one such effort. One obstacle, however, to introducing such a measure is lack of clarity over how to divide quantitatively the degree of risk from flooding. In this study, we undertook quantitative risk assessment to determine the risk level in a riparian zone. We compared our results with statistically derived societal risk limits to determine whether the risk level was acceptable within the framework of the tolerance risk limit. We found that the flood risk could be reduced through adaptive flood management.

Therefore, changes relative to the local expected variability are highly relevant for assessing impact and planning for adaptation as the climate changes. We analyse the emerging climate signal relative to the diagnosed internal variability (signal-to-noise ratio, S/N) of a set of recently published climate indices over Europe. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to a recent baseline (1951-1983) which relates to recent societal experience. In this framework, we find that during the 2000-2016 period, many areas of Europe already experienced significant changes in climate extremes, even when compared to this recent period which is within living memory. In particular, the S/N of extreme temperatures is larger than 1 and 2 over 34% and 4% of Europe, respectively. We also find that about 15% of Europe is experiencing more intense winter precipitation events, while in summer, 7% of Europe is experiencing stronger drought-inducing conditions.

Vulnerability to Natural Disaster and Welfare Effect: A Case Study of Flood Risk in Vietnam's North Central Region	JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article						Coping strategy; poverty; flood risk; welfare; vulnerability; Vietnam	SOCIOECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; HOUSEHOLD INCOME; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; POVERTY; IMPACT; RESILIENCE; POLICY	This article investigates the impact of flood risk on vulnerability and welfare at the household level in Vietnam. The analytical sample is taken from a household survey conducted in a north central Vietnam community through a three-stage stratified random sampling method. The propensity score matching approach is employed to compare various welfare indicators between flooded and non-flooded households. This study finds that flooding results in significant income losses and imposes higher costs of living, especially housing costs. The two types of households are vulnerable, implying that other natural disasters or socio-economic disadvantages may have adverse effects on households' livelihoods. The insignificant effect of floods on vulnerability indicates that the flooded households can cope with floods to some extent. However, contrary to family support, formal coping strategies are insufficient or ineffective at reducing household vulnerability to floods.

In turn, protected areas are keystones or protecting coastal biodiversity and the ecosystems services ensuring sustainable livelihoods. Effective management and adaptation plans are needed to maintain ecological function and integrity. In the present article, we used a coastal digital elevation model to simulate inundation surfaces and a prioritization index for ranking management interventions in 278 coastal protected areas from 27 African countries. Of these, 15 areas and eight countries demonstrated a high need for proactive management actions because of high levels of biodiversity, international conservation relevance, and exposure to sea-level rise. From the array of management actions available, tailored solutions are being implemented according to the morphology and location of the areas. Concerted action by international, government, and local partners is required for successful protection of the areas, including implementation of adaptive plans and monitoring progress schemes.

Quantifying erosion hazards and economic damage to critical infrastructure in river catchments: Impact of a warming climate	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Erosion hazard; Economic impact; Climate change; River catchment; Decision making; UKCP18	SOIL-EROSION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; RAINFALL; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES; ENGLAND; SYSTEMS; FLOODS; BASIN	Climate change is projected to cause considerable pressure on our environment and communities. In particular, an increase in flooding and extreme erosion events is foreseeable as a result of an anticipated increase in the frequency and severity of storms. In the absence of timely and strategic intervention, climate change is taking us closer to more uncertain (non-linear, stochastic) and potentially more catastrophic climatic impacts. This paper develops a state-of-the-art modelling framework to assess the economic impact of erosion hazards on critical infrastructure and evaluate their vulnerability and resilience to differing storm regimes. This framework is trialled on a UK town (Cockermouth, NW England) that has experienced significant storm-related erosion and flood damage in recent years, highlighting its ability to determine current and future erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. A hydro-sedimentary model is used to simulate fluvial and hillslope sediment erosion and deposition caused by extreme storms within river catchments (sheet, rill, gully and channel bank and bed erosion). The model is applied for current climate conditions and for two future epochs (2021-2040 & 2061-2080) to assess changing erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. Climate conditions for the two epochs are obtained using the UKCP18 high resolution realisation projections under emission scenario RCP8.5. The economic loss caused by these hazards is projected based on new, non-linear depth-cost curves derived from previous assessments. The results show that: 1) due to a warming climate, total rainfall in the Cockermouth area (and likely across the UK) may be higher for all storm durations and annual exceedance probabilities, until epoch 2061-2080 when the rainfall regime may shift towards shorter duration events with higher rainfall and longer duration events with less rainfall; 2) the total area that undergoes flooding, erosion and sediment deposition, and the magnitude of the hazard, may increase as the climate shifts; 3) the economic damage caused by erosion and deposition is positively related to rainfall total, and the highest costs are likely to be associated with damage caused to bridges (102-130 pound million), followed by sediment deposition in the urban fabric (9-82 pound million), and erosion damage to agricultural land (16-26 pound million), buildings (0.4-18 pound million) and roads (0.4-4 pound million); and 4) the Estimated Annual Damage costs suggest that investment in bridges (4-6 pound million) in the Cockermouth area is required now to ensure their resilience to extreme storm events, and interventions are likely to be needed within the next 20 years to prevent high economic costs associated with significant sediment deposition in the urban fabric (0.3-4 pound million) and damage to roads (0.08-0.1 pound million) and agricultural land (0.6-2 pound million). This new framework can help support operational (immediate) and strategic (medium to long term i.e. 10+ years) erosion control decision making through the provision of an assessment of the scale and consequences of erosion.

The subject literature is scattered and fragmented, making it difficult to identify the key contributions and understand the current state of research; however, these considerations are an increasing preoccupation. To address this issue, a scientometric analysis was conducted in this work to identify the main contributions in the field. The methodology of the research was divided into two sections: the first section presents a scientometric mapping, including an analysis of scientific production by country, journal, and author. The second section identified the main theoretical contributions through the use of the Tree of Science metaphor. The main subfields identified include social governance structures and capacities, drinking water management, and socio-hydrogeology and collaborative governance. This research provides valuable insights for decision makers to develop and promote effective strategies to improve water safety and participatory efforts.

Water resilience is worsening under climate change because intensifying weather extremes induce more severe and increasingly frequent droughts and floods. In particular, China, as the world's most populous nation, has battled with persisting water shortages and devastating floods for decades. As a consequence, Chinese scholars have designed the sponge city concept in the early 2010s to relieve cities from the growing pressure of water shortages and floods. This is done by integrating a more natural, green infrastructure into existing urban drainage pipeline systems for absorbing, storing, and purifying rainwater in a sponge-like manner during rainfall events. Here we review the principles, design guidelines, construction items and assessment requirements of sponge cities and other similar strategies for urban stormwater management. We present four case studies of sponge cities in China in both newly constructed and renovated urban districts. Overall, China's sponge cities appear promising for green urbanization, to relieve cities from water scarcity, devastating floods and urban heat island effects, while restoring the ecological functions and aesthetics of urban natural environments.

Understanding the mechanism of the influence can help to establish flood control within a changing environment. In this study, the influence of impervious surface expansion and the operation of polders on flooding have been detected using a semi-distributed hydrological model, i.e., the Hydrological Engineering Center-Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model. The results indicate that impervious upstream surface expansion influenced peak discharge more significantly compared with downstream expansion. The peak discharge of the basin with polders decreased 26.38-36.61% compared with that without polders. Impervious surface expansion effected a higher increase in the peak discharge in a basin with than without polders. A decrease in drainage discharge and an increase in the maximum allowable water depth could reduce peak discharge at the basin outlet. On the premise of ensuring safety inside polders, polder operation could help reduce on average 7.94% and 5.90% of small and large floods peak discharge on average.

The aim of this study is to design a process such that improved both gas storage efficiency and field oil efficiency. Based on the continuous CO2 flooding results, the residual gas saturation increases up to 10% compared to solution gas injection. Also, the high oil swelling factor and the interfacial tension (IFT) reduction confirmed the changing in curvature of the relative permeability curves which causes pore throat space more available for CO2 trapping. In addition, the genetic algorithm has successfully improved the gas storage efficiency for 3.2% and field oil efficiency for 7.2% during the full field reservoir simulation. Accordingly, the objective value increased by 2.12% and indicates that the residual and CO2 capillary trappings in porous media enhanced the security and capacity of storage.

Comparative analysis of local and large-scale approaches to floodplain mapping: a case study of the Chaudiere River	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL			English	Article						Flood maps; hydraulic modeling; HEC-RAS; LISFLOOD-FP; LiDAR	FINITE-ELEMENT; INUNDATION; MODEL; RESOLUTION; SURFACE	Floods are among natural disasters that increasingly threaten society, especially with current and future climate change trends. Several tools have been developed to help planners manage the risks associated to flooding, including the mapping of flood-prone areas, but one of the major challenges is still the availability of detailed data, particularly bathymetry. This manuscript compares two modeling approaches to produce flood maps. An innovative large-scale approach that, without bathymetric data, estimates by inverse modeling the bed section for a given flow and a given roughness coefficient through 1 D/2D hydraulic modeling (LISFLOOD-FP). And a local approach, with a detailed coupled 1 D/2D hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) that uses all available information at the bed and floodplain (LiDAR and bathymetry). Both implementations revealed good performance values for flood peak levels as well as excellent fit indices in describing the areal extent of flooding. As expected, the local approach is more accurate, but the results of the large-scale approach are very promising especially for areas lacking bathymetric data and for large-scale governmental programs.

Developing countries largely react rather than being proactive in managing the effects of floods on infrastructure. This is clearly demonstrated by inadequate level of preparedness experienced before, during, and after events of floods. This research discusses the effects of floods on infrastructure users in Kenya based on a primary study carried out in 27 counties out of 47 counties in Kenya. The research findings show that events of floods in Kenya disrupt provision of infrastructure services by damaging road networks, energy facilities, buildings, and social facilities. The study reveals Kenya spend huge amount of resources in recovery phase to address the effects of floods. The study notes that local communities play a critical role in responding and recovery from floods. The study also reveals Kenya lacks climate sensitive policies, legislation, and development plans that make reference to resilience in order to protect infrastructure against known and foreseen climate risks. The study recommends that building resilience in infrastructure to respond and withstand the effects of floods demands common vision among different stakeholders.

However, the spatial extent of precipitation extremes (i.e., the area in which nearby locations experience precipitation extremes simultaneously) and its future changes are largely overlooked in climate assessments. Employing new multi-thousand-year climate model simulations, we show that under both 2.0 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C warming scenarios, wintertime total precipitation extreme extents would increase over about 80%-90% of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics (i.e., of the latitude band 28 degrees-78 degrees N). Stabilizing at 1.5 degrees C rather than 2.0 degrees C would reduce the average magnitude of the increase by 1.7-2 times. According to the climate model, the increased extents are caused by increases in precipitation intensity rather than changes in the spatial organization of the events. Relatively small percentage increases in precipitation intensities (e.g., by 4%) can drive disproportionately larger, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, growth in the spatial extents (by 93%).

This issue is certainly more important in Africa, where the increase in flood frequency is a significant concern for many areas. In this context, urban planners need accurate approaches to set up a standard for measuring the resilience to floods. In Morocco, this issue is still not fully covered by the scientific community despite the obvious need for a new approach adapted to local conditions. This study applied a composite index and geographic-information-system approach to measure and map resilience to floods in three northern coastal municipalities. The approach is also based on a linear ranking of resilience parameters, offering a more optimal classification of spatial resilience variation. The results allowed us to identify specific areas with different resilience levels and revealed the relationship between urban dimensions and the flood resilience degree. This approach provides an efficient decision-support tool to facilitate flood risk management, especially in terms of prioritizing protective actions.

However, its growth is markedly decreased by flooding stress, which is caused by climate change. Proteomic techniques were used for understanding the flood-response and -tolerant mechanisms in soybean. Subcellular proteomics has potential to elucidate localized cellular responses and investigate communications among subcellular components during plant growth and under stress stimuli. Furthermore, post-translational modifications play important roles in stress response and tolerance to flooding stress. Although many flood-response mechanisms have been reported, flood-tolerant mechanisms have not been fully clarified for soybean because of limitations in germplasm with flooding tolerance. This review provides an update on current biochemical and molecular networks involved in soybean tolerance against flooding stress, as well as recent developments in the area of functional genomics in terms of developing flood-tolerant soybeans. This work will expedite marker-assisted genetic enhancement studies in crops for developing high-yielding stress-tolerant lines or varieties under abiotic stress.

Thus, the change in water level and the influential variables are analysed for 1960-2014 in the urbanized and watery Taihu Basin, China. The results indicate that the water level displays a significant increasing trend. Furthermore, low-oscillation and high-oscillation periods were found to have occurred in the 1960s-1970s and 2000s, respectively, by the quantile perturbation method. A strong relationship was shown between water level and precipitation in the 1960s-1980s, especially in the flood season. Since then, human activities, such as land-use change, river system degradation and hydrological structures, have played distinct roles and caused more than 82% of the annual and flood-seasonal water level variation. The results may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological processes and provide a good reference for flood control.

These are increasingly being critiqued because (1) there is an absence of feedbacks between water and society; (2) the models are created by domain experts who hand them to decision makers to implement; and (3) they fail to account for global forces on local water resources. Socio-hydrological models that explicitly account for feedbacks between water and society at multiple scales and facilitate stakeholder participation can address these concerns. However, they require a fundamental change in how we think about prediction. We suggest that, in the context of long-range predictions, the goal is not scenarios that present a snapshot of the world at some future date, but rather projection of alternative, plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system. This will both yield insights into cause-effect relationships and help stakeholders identify safe or desirable operating space.

A comprehensive review of compound inundation models in low-gradient coastal watersheds	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Review						Storm surge; Rainfall-runoff; Compound flood; Flood transition zone; Tropical cyclone; Inundation model	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE INUNDATION; MIKE-SHE MODEL; NEW-YORK-CITY; LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER; FLOOD INUNDATION; HYDROLOGIC MODEL; EXTREME RAINFALL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS	Extreme coastal flooding poses a major threat to human life and infrastructure. Low-gradient coastal watersheds can be vulnerable to flooding from both intense rainfall and storm surge. Here we present a comprehensive review of the most recent studies that quantify extreme flooding using variations of a compound inundation model. A compound inundation model may consist of different numerical models, observed data, and/or a combination of these. The definitions, advantages, and limitations of each joining technique are discussed with the goal of enabling and focusing subsequent research. Future investigation should focus on the development of a tight-coupling procedure that can accurately represent the complex physical interactions between storm surge and rainfall-runoff. A more accurate compound flood forecast tool can help decision-makers, stakeholders and authorities converge on better coastal resiliency measures that can potentially save human lives, aid in the design of structures and communities, and decrease property damage.

We focus on a set of 117 near-natural "benchmark" catchments to detect trends not driven by land use and other human impacts, and aim to attribute trends in peak river flows to some climate indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic (EA) index. We propose modelling all stations together in a Bayesian multilevel framework to be better able to detect any signal that is present in the data by pooling information across several stations. This approach leads to the detection of a clear countrywide time trend. Additionally, in a univariate approach, both the EA and NAO indices appear to have a considerable association with peak river flows. When a multivariate approach is taken to unmask the collinearity between climate indices and time, the association between NAO and peak flows disappears, while the association with EA remains clear. This demonstrates the usefulness of a multivariate and multilevel approach when it comes to accurately attributing trends in peak river flows.

Material damage and relationships between insurance, rainfall, land cover and urban flooding	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						urban flooding; extreme rainfall; material damage; insurance; land cover; Lisbon Metropolitan Area	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; RISK-REDUCTION; LOSSES; IMPACTS; AREAS; STORM; UNCERTAINTY; HOUSEHOLDS; DISASTERS	This research aims to understand how insurance, rainfall, land cover and urban flooding are related and how these variables influenced the material damage in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) during the 2000-2011 period. Correlation coefficients show strong relationships between built-up areas and claims (0.94) and payouts (0.88). Despite no significant relationships being found between rainfall and the amount of material damage per event, three likelihood levels of flooding were determined for hourly rainfall. Unlike the studied period, the number of claims and their spatial distribution during the 2008 extreme rainfall event were strongly dependent on rainfall. Flooding related to the old watercourses assumed greater importance during this extreme event, recovering a more natural/ancient hydrological behaviour. In the LMA, the greatest material damage was the result of high-magnitude/low-probability rainfall events. Lower magnitude events can trigger numerous claims in heavily built-up areas, but they are hardly capable of producing large material damage.

Environmental conditions modify density-dependent salmonid recruitment: Insights into the 2016 recruitment crash in Wales	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; egg survival; river flow; spawning; water temperature	ADULT ATLANTIC SALMON; BROWN TROUT; SALAR L; TEMPERATURE; TRUTTA; SURVIVAL; STOCK; POPULATIONS; FISH; FLOW	Understanding the effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors on recruitment is often inhibited by difficulties quantifying their relative contributions in highly variable recruitment data. Use of data-driven statistical methods with data that include one or more extreme recruitment events could help overcome these difficulties. Juvenile Atlantic salmon and trout abundances in Wales have declined over the last 2 decades, and 2016 was a notably poor recruitment year in rivers around southern Europe, including England and Wales. The 2016 recruitment crash coincided with extreme winter weather conditions, leading to speculation that unusually warm temperatures and high flows adversely affect salmonid recruitment and caused the 2016 crash, although this remains untested. We developed data-driven statistical models to: (1) describe juvenile salmonid recruitment from density-dependent and density-independent factors; and (2) assess whether the density-independent factors probably contributed to the 2016 salmon recruitment crash. We compiled salmon and trout young-of-year juvenile abundances from electrofishing surveys, egg deposition estimates and river flow and air temperature data from 2001-2017 for seven Welsh rivers, broadly representative of rivers around Wales. We used river flow and air temperature data to derive ecologically and behaviourally meaningful density-independent explanatory variables. Salmonid recruitment in Wales was best described using density-dependent and density-independent factors, especially for salmon: after accounting for a concave relationship with egg deposition, salmon juvenile abundance was reduced under (1) warmer spawning temperatures that might inhibit spawning, and (2) higher flood frequencies during pre-emergence and emergence that might washout eggs or alevins. Results were less clear for trout, perhaps because they are behaviourally more plastic. Our findings provide empirical support for general and predictable effects of temperature and flow during spawning and emergence on salmonid-especially salmon-recruitment in Wales. Furthermore, we suggest that the 2016 salmon recruitment crash was caused-in part-by particularly inclement spawning and emergence conditions, which could be more common under future climate change. Our findings suggest that future salmonid stock assessment models could include the effects of density-independent variables on recruitment to improve their predictive power.

Causes and consequences of liana infestation in southern Amazonia	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						biomass; climate change; forest structure; habitat fragmentation; soil; tree mortality; wood density	BARRO-COLORADO ISLAND; TROPICAL FOREST; TREE GROWTH; CARBON ACCUMULATION; ABUNDANCE; CLIMATE; PATTERNS; CANOPY; FRAGMENTATION; DIVERSITY	Lianas, a key component of tropical forests, can limit growth of trees, impacting both the structure and functioning of forests, and are expected to benefit from fragmentation and potentially from global climatic changes. While it is critical to understand the impacts of liana infestation on contemporary tropical forests across large geographical areas, to date most liana studies have been focussed on single or few sites. We measured and quantified liana infestation of 16,066 trees with diameter >= 10 cm in 27 plots distributed across southern Amazonia, a region characterized by substantial ecological and environmental variation and environmental change. We examined the influence of potential drivers of liana infestation at the plot, species and individual tree level. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of liana infestation on tree growth. More than half of all trees had lianas in their crown. At the plot level, infestation by lianas was driven by forest structure but not by the studied climate or soil fertility variables, though low levels of liana infestation were found in seasonally flooded forests. At the tree level, larger and stouter trees had a greater proportion of their crown infested with lianas. At the species level, trees belonging to intrinsically slow-growing, dense-wooded species were more susceptible to liana infestation. Liana infestation had a negative impact on tree growth, with growth of heavily infested trees reduced by 33% compared to non-infested. The impact of liana infestation on tree growth was strongest for the best-lit tree crowns, indicating that lianas act to reduce the large competitive advantage that well-lit trees otherwise hold over their neighbours. Synthesis. Lianas are a pervasive and influential feature of the extensive forests at the southern edge of Amazonia. The degree of liana infestation in forests was closely linked to species-level variables such as potential growth and wood density as well as the size of the individual tree. The growth of heavily infested trees was particularly restricted by lianas, and especially so for trees growing in otherwise favourable conditions, indicating the potential for lianas not only to reduce forest growth rates overall, but also to modify competitive hierarchies among trees within tropical forests.

Although inland water bodies have been investigated intensively, few studies have looked at the effect of human activities and climate variability on surface area of inland waters at a larger scale over time and space. In this study, we used MODIS (MOD13Q1) images to determine water surface area extent at 250 m spatial resolution. We then applied this algorithm with MOD13Q1 images taken at 16-day intervals from 2000 to 2018 to a large river basin in China's northeast high latitude region with dense stream network and abundant wetlands to investigate spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of inland water bodies. The study identified 209 ponds, lakes, and reservoirs with an average total surface area of 2080 km(2) in the past 19 years. The total water surface area fluctuated largely from 942 km(2) to 5169 km(2), corresponding to rainfall intensity and flood. We found that the total water surface area in this high latitude river basin showed an increasing trend during the study period, while the annual precipitation amount in the river basin also had an increasing trend concurrently. Precipitation and irrigation significantly contributed to the monthly change of water surface area, which reached the highest during June and August. The increase of water surface area was significant in the lower basin floodplain region, where agricultural irrigation using groundwater for rice production has progressed. Four nationally important wetland preserves (Zhalong, Xianghai, Momoge, and Chagan Lake) in the river basin made up nearly 50% of the basin's total water surface area, of which Zhalong, Xianghai, and Momoge are designated by The Ramsar Convention as wetland sites of international importance. Seasonally, these water bodies reached their maximal surface area in August, when both the monsoon weather and agricultural discharge prevailed. This study demonstrates that water surface area in a high latitude river basin is affected by both human activities and climate variation, implying that high latitude regions will likely experience more changes in surface water distribution as global climate change continues and agriculture becomes intensified.

Further, forest vulnerability to flood is being exacerbated by large hydroelectric dams on Amazon rivers that put upland environments not adapted to flood at unique risk. To address this critical knowledge gap, we evaluated the effects of the extreme 2014 rainfall coupled with the newly constructed Jirau hydroelectric dam on tree survival and forest functionality, in the upper Madeira River basin. We used surveys of campinarana white-sand forests (stems >1 cm in seven 1 ha plots) conducted before and after the extreme flood to test trait-based ecological theory predictions of the impact of flood on overall community function. We found that flooding increased mortality by nearly five-fold (from 3.2% to 15.1%), mostly in smaller trees. This large mortality induced significant and consistent shifts in community function, towards species with conservative life strategies: direct comparison of trait differences between surviving and dying trees showed that survivors had smaller, high density stomata, and higher leaf dry matter content, wood density and root tissue density (RTD). Size and density of stomata and RTD were the most important predictors of species mortality rates. Synthesis and applications. Although focused on a single event in one type of forest, this work highlights the general importance, and need for further study, of interaction between climate change and mega-dams in Amazon forests. In particular, we expect that continued expansion of hydroelectric dams in Amazonia will likely intensify the impact of large floods on forests made newly vulnerable by these dams, with substantial effect on future forest functionality in expanded floodplain areas across the Basin. Hence, these interaction analyses should be required in the Brazilian legal instruments such as the environmental impact assessments and its accompanying Environmental Impacts Reports for large infrastructure projects in Amazon.

The cropping systems of the Central Dry Zone of Myanmar: Productivity constraints and possible solutions	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Upland cropping; Crop system; Fertiliser; Sustainable; Climate change; Water-use efficiency	AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; ROTATIONS	The Central Dry Zone (CDZ) of Myanmar is home to an estimated 12 million people, provides 35% of Myanmar's grain cropping, but is underdeveloped and food-insecure. We examined the cropping systems of the CDZ to understand the biophysical drivers of those systems, the need for change to improve productivity and sustain ability, and how future research and extension might be framed to best serve the rural communities. Data were sourced from (i) published empirical studies and web-based documents produced by the Myanmar Government and international agencies and (ii) a face to face survey of 190 Central Dry Zone farmers. Our analysis indicates that CDZ cropping systems have low productivity which threatens sustainability and future production. Farmers practice traditional cultivation and remove crop residues to use as animal feed, which together deplete soil organic matter reserves and expose the soil to physical degradation. The soils are generally coarse-textured with low water retention, high leaching potential and nutritionally deficient. Nutrient inputs from farm-yard manure and mineral fertiliser are also low. As a consequence, crop nutrient deficiencies are widespread across the CDZ and a major productivity constraint. Mineral-fertiliser use is increasing however, but farmers are conscious of the need for high-quality advice on how best to use these inputs. A narrow range of crops is grown in the CDZ with ca. 80% of the land used to grow pulse and oilseed legumes and sesame and sunflower, but few cereals. The lack of crop diversity exposes farmers to market price fluctuations and the lack of balance between broadleaf and cereal crops results in disease and yield loss. Climate changes further threaten the sustainability and economic viability of grain cropping with increasing temperatures, more erratic rainfall and fewer but more intense rainfall events during the monsoon. Consequences are more floods and dry periods and increased risk of soil erosion. The imperative now is to transition the upland cropping of Myanmar's CDZ to embrace the basic elements of conservation agriculture, i.e. crop diversity, effective weed control, in situ retention of crop residues, optimised crop nutrition and minimal-to-zero soil disturbance, to sustainably increase crop water use-efficiency and system productivity.

For millions of US homes exposed to flood risk, property-level investments in flood resilience offer an attractive strategy to manage losses. But financing such investments remains a challenge. One option is to harness insurance. We use field data of residential flood insurance purchases from a private insurer that offered a supplemental policy (FloodReady) to cover the costs of rebuilding with flood-resilient materials. We exploit a change in the default purchase option to estimate how default enrollment in FloodReady influences take-up. We estimate that autoenrollment increases take-up from 12% to 32%. This dramatic increase suggests that behavioral interventions can be used to improve the financial capacity of homeowners to reduce future flood losses. That said, the fact that most policyholders still actively opt-out even under autoenrollments indicates the limits of default effects in this context. We discuss potential moderators and implications for default effects across settings.

Recently, the focus on weather Radar in Canada has increased since the existing Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) C-band Radar network is replaced with S-band dual-polarized Radar. This paper aims to provide a wide-ranging literature review of the current Radar network in Canada and how it has been applied from a hydrological context. The review starts with an overview of the Canadian weather Radar network, emphasizing current and future developments. Next, the application of weather Radar in hydrology is summarized, including specific research and operational examples. Finally, some recommendations are provided for future studies based on new developments in Canada's weather Radar network.

Such projections generally assume that reef islands are geologically inert landforms unable to adjust morphologically. We present numerical modeling results that show reef islands composed of gravel material are morphodynamically resilient landforms that evolve under SLR by accreting to maintain positive freeboard while retreating lagoonward. Such island adjustment is driven by wave overtopping processes transferring sediment from the beachface to the island surface. Our results indicate that such natural adaptation of reef islands may provide an alternative future trajectory that can potentially support near-term habitability on some islands, albeit with additional management challenges. Full characterization of SLR vulnerability at a given reef island should combine morphodynamic models with assessments of climate-related impacts on freshwater supplies, carbonate sediment supply, and future wave regimes.

Notwithstanding these challenges, Africa, and its inhabitants, have been confronting the vagaries of climate for centuries, including severe droughts and floods. Given this context, this paper provides a commentary on the efforts to ensure and enable climate services on the continent as well as a critical, reflexive assessment of activities in this varied landscape. A special focus on the institutional frameworks and the underlying knowledge systems that support and interface with climate services will be examined. A central question underpinning the paper is: to what extent is the expanding landscape of climate services being endogenously driven in Africa? Finally, some recommendations for future efforts to enhance effective institutions and knowledge brokering and facilitate better climate services in Africa are suggested.

This article analyzes, by means of a literature review of 63 articles, if and in which aspects such an indicator approach is regarded as useful by scientific studies. The findings indicate a need for more research on the validation and justification of indicators. This article supports the conceptual development of SVA by adding to reflection about advancements and applications, but also shortcomings. The main advancement area discussed is validation and the demand for establishing benchmark criteria for vulnerability. Based on this, longitudinal monitoring of vulnerability and validation studies are conceivable based on existing SVA, but these efforts demand more conceptual development.

The Ochotnica River is located in the Gorce Mountains, in the Polish Western Carpathians. The characteristics of floods in the Ochotnica River channel were analyzed using limnigraphic records of water levels at the Tylmanowa gauging station and of precipitation based on data from the Polish Institute of Meteorology and the Water Management Station at Ochotnica Goma. Flood types were determined. The predominant type of floods in the Ochotnica River are normal floods with a discharge of 3.80 to 11.94 m(3)/s in winter and 4.74 to 16.40 m(3)/s in summer. The dominant recent process is incision, at an average speed of 3.2 cm/year. Similar results have been observed in other mountain rivers in Europe.

However, understanding the effects of environmental forcing on past flooding frequency and magnitude is difficult owing to the deficiency of observations (data available for less than 10% of the world's rivers) and extremely short measurement time series (< 100 years). In this study, a numerical model, HYDROTREND, which generates synthetic time series of daily water discharge at a river outlet, was applied to the Yalu River to (1) reconstruct annual peak discharges over the past 1000 years and estimate flood annual exceedance probabilities and (2) identify and quantify the impacts of climate change and human activity (runoff yield induced by deforestation and dam retention) on the flooding frequency and magnitude. Climate data obtained from meteorological stations and ECHO-G climate model output, morphological characteristics (hypsometry, drainage area, river length, slope, and lapse rate), and hydrological properties (groundwater properties, canopy interception effects, cascade reservoir retention effect, and saturated hydraulic conductivity) form significant reliable model inputs. Monitored for decades, some proxies on ancient floods allow for accurate calibration and validation of numerical modeling. Simulations match well the present-day monitored data (1958-2012) and the literature records of historical flood events (1000-1958). They indicate that flood frequencies of the Yalu River increased during 1000-1940, followed by a decrease until the present day. Frequency trends were strongly modulated by climate variability, particularly by the intensity and frequency of rainfall events. The magnitudes of larger floods, events with a return period of 50 to 100 years, increased by 19.1% and 13.9 %, respectively, due to climate variability over the last millennium. Anthropogenic processes were found to either enhance or reduce flooding, depending on the type of human activities. Deforestation increased the magnitude of larger floods (100- and 50-year floods) by 19.2 %-20.3 %, but the construction of cascade reservoirs in 1940 significantly reduced their magnitude by 36.7% to 41.7 %. We conclude that under intensified climate change and human activities in the future, effective river engineering should be considered, particularly for small- and medium-sized mountainous river systems, which are at a higher risk of flood disasters owing to their relatively poor hydrological regulation capacity.

J	Brink, E; Wamsler, C				Brink, Ebba; Wamsler, Christine			Citizen engagement in climate adaptation surveyed: The role of values, worldviews, gender and place	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Citizen participation; Disaster risk reduction; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Inner dimensions; Willingness to adapt	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CULTURAL THEORY; RISK; GOVERNANCE; COPRODUCTION; INSTITUTIONS; MINDFULNESS; SCIENCE	Local governments' limited mandate and capacity to adequately deal with increasing climate risk and impacts means that citizen engagement is becoming increasingly important for adapting to hazards such as floods and storms. Stronger collaborative approaches are urgently needed. At the same time, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on what inspires adaptation engagement in different citizen groups. Against this background, this paper examines the external/material (e.g., resources, hazards, public support) and internal aspects (e.g., values and worldviews) that shape people's engagement in and for adaptation. Based on a survey of Swedish citizens at risk from severe climate events, we show that engagement is a gendered process, which is mediated by personal values, worldviews and place aspects rarely considered in public adaptation. While a high level of diverse citizen action is often related to past experiences of hazards, motivation to adapt goes beyond the idea of acting out of rational self-interest. Economic considerations (e.g., low cost) are not the only motivation to adapt; the potential of an adaptation action to contribute to green, thriving surroundings and mitigate global climate change was found nearly as (and among female respondents, more) motivating. Women were also found to be more motivated to engage in adaptation if this supports other community members at risk. At the same time, past adaptation action could not be linked to motivation to adapt, and was found to be negatively correlated with communitarian and ecological values or worldviews. This confirms that motivation to adapt does not automatically translate into action, and indicates a 'mitigation-adaptation gap' in people's climate awareness, which can lead to ineffective climate responses. Given these findings, we discuss alternative approaches to support increased citizen engagement and more effective and transformative climate action. We end with a call for public adaptation and risk communication that takes greater account of inner/subjective dimensions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, an accurate assessment of urban flood processes and improved pre-disaster mitigation strategies in threatened areas is essential. Urban flood modeling enables users to understand, assess, and forecast flood conditions as well as their impact. For effective flood modeling, especially in highly urbanized floodplains, model selection based on the contextual requirements is a challenge. This review provides a systematic overview of the application of urban flood modeling approaches from the perspective of urban flood strategy design sequences. In this review, recent research advances are presented as well as suggestions for future research topics that will improve the availability and reliability of urban flood modeling methods. The results of this review will help urban flood managers and potential users balancing model complexity and needs while undertaking effective flood modeling tasks.

Agricultural Innovations to Reduce the Health Impacts of Dams	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						dams; agriculture; livelihoods; health; schistosomiasis; restoration; sustainable development; climate adaptation		Dams enable the production of food and renewable energy, making them a crucial tool for both economic development and climate change adaptation in low- and middle-income countries. However, dams may also disrupt traditional livelihood systems and increase the transmission of vector- and water-borne pathogens. These livelihood and health impacts diminish the benefits of dams to rural populations dependent on rivers, as hydrological and ecological alterations change flood regimes, reduce nutrient transport and lead to the loss of biodiversity. We propose four agricultural innovations for promoting equity, health, sustainable development, and climate resilience in dammed watersheds: (1) restoring migratory aquatic species, (2) removing submerged vegetation and transforming it into an agricultural resource, (3) restoring environmental flows and (4) integrating agriculture and aquaculture. As investment in dams accelerates in low- and middle-income countries, appropriately addressing their livelihood and health impacts can improve the sustainability of modern agriculture and economic development in a changing climate.

Holocene landscape evolution of the Brahmaputra River valley in the upper Assam Basin (India): Deduced from the soil-geomorphic studies	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Holocene; Neotectonics; Paleopedology; Brahmaputra basin	HIMALAYAN FORELAND BASIN; MIDDLE GANGETIC PLAINS; WESTERN GANGA PLAIN; FLUVIAL RESPONSE; PO PLAIN; QUATERNARY; PALEOSOLS; STRATIGRAPHY; TECTONICS; SEDIMENTS	The Brahmaputra River basin exhibits a variety of landforms, including alluvial fans, old and active floodplains, and piedmont belts. The surface expression of the subsurface basement ridge, known as the Brahmaputra Arc, is characterized by paleosol exposures aligned along its crestal region. Using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology and paleopedological studies, four stages of landform development have been identified in this region, influenced by neotectonics and climate change. The soils in the study area have been categorized into four members of the Quaternary Brahmaputra Morphostratigraphic Sequence (QBMS). QBMS-I (<1.77 ka) represents the youngest soil found in the active floodplains, QBMS-II (2-3.65 ka) includes the Mikri hills piedmont and adjacent river plains, QBMS-III (4-6.5 ka) covers most parts of the study area and is formed on alluvium. The oldest unit QBMS-IV (>7 ka) is exposed on the crest of the Brahmaputra Arc. These soils provide insights into the geomorphologic history of the region, with QBMS-II and III recording multiple avulsions during the Holocene. Micromorphological studies indicate that these soils have undergone multi-phase development under varying redox conditions. The Mid-Miocene compression in the foreland basin led to the formation of the Brahmaputra Arch, and subsequent sedimentation covered the crestal part. Presently, erosion and removal of sediment from the crestal region have exposed older soils as paleosols. Two alluvial fans occur in the study area, the older one located in the central part and the younger one in the northeast corner. The Naga hill piedmonts also exhibit a similar distribution, with the older segment in the central part and younger segments in the northern and southern parts. These patterns of piedmonts and alluvial fans suggest distinct tectonic episodes responsible for sediment redistribution in the study area. The proximity of the Brahmaputra Arc and the Naga thrust in the central part further supports this observation. The findings of this study are consistent with the episodes of neotectonic activity in the nearby Ganga plain, highlighting their regional relevance. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the evolution of landforms in the Brahmaputra River basin, highlighting the role of neotectonics and climate change in shaping the landscape.

Body mass dynamics in wintering mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Waterfowl; Mallard; Body Mass; Climate; Fitness; Foraging Ecology	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPRING MIGRATION; BLACK DUCKS; WATERFOWL; WETLANDS; WEIGHTS; BIRDS; RICE; TIME; DIET	Body mass in overwintering waterfowl is an important fitness attribute as it affects winter survival, timing of spring migration, and subsequent reproductive success. Recent research in Europe and the western United States indicates body mass of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) has increased from the late 1960s to early 2000s. The underlying mechanism is currently unknown; however, researchers hypothesize that increases are due to a more benign winter climate, increased food availability through natural and artificial flooding, introgression of wild mallard populations by game-farm mallards, or shifting of wintering distributions northward. Further investigation of factors related to winter mallard body mass increases and whether this phenomenon is occurring in other major flyways could increase understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic variables influencing waterfowl fitness. Here, we analyzed mallard body mass in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley from 1979 to 2021 to determine sources of temporal variation. We measured hunterharvested mallards from private hunting clubs, public hunting areas, and duck-plucking businesses. Mallard body mass increased by approximately 6% among all age-sex classes from 1979 to 2021. Average mallard mass increased by about 1.5% per decade but varied substantially among years. Within years, body mass was related to rainfall and river gage height; mallards had greater mass after periods of increased rainfall or river flooding, likely due to increased food availability. Mallard body mass had a marginal negative relationship with severe cold weather (derived using a weather severity index [WSI]). While body mass increased after wet periods within years, there was no relationship of mallard body mass with wet vs dry years, low vs high flood years, or hot vs cold years. Additionally, there was no detectable change in rainfall, river discharge, or temperature from 1979 to 2021. This indicates that rainfall and river height may influence mallard body??mass within years, but may not be the primary factor responsible for mass increases over time. Our research confirms changes in mallard body mass are widespread and within-season precipitation and flooding account for much of the observed annual variation. Future research investigating specific mechanisms, such as introgression of game-farm mallard DNA and climate change, may clarify their contribution to mallard body mass change over time.

Regional modulating behavior of Indian summer monsoon rainfall in context of spatio-temporal variation of drought and flood events	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						SA-CORDEX; Regional climate model; Flood; Drought; Empirical orthogonal function	DOWNSCALING EXPERIMENT CORDEX; CUMULUS PARAMETERIZATION; MODEL DESCRIPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE; SCHEMES; SIMULATIONS; IMPACT	In this paper, daily modulating behaviors of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) has been evaluated over eight important sub-zones of India viz Northwest India (NWI); Northcentral India (NCI); West Peninsular India (WPI); Eastern Peninsular India (EPI); Southern Peninsular India (SoPI); Central India (CI), Northeast India (NEI) and Western Ghat (WG) using latest SA-CORDEX simulated climate data during 1981-2015. The climate extreme indices, standardized precipitation index (SPI) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) have been utilized to uncover substantial regional spatial patterns and temporal variability of monsoon precipitation over India and its sub regions to understand the regional modulation of these events based on duration, frequency and severity. The comprehensive assessment of ISMR modulated characteristics (intensity, spell, and frequency) were showing significant decreasing trend over NEI and NCI which can be leading factors for demarcating major hotspots for land degradation, effective management and adaptation towards water resources and hazards related to the flood/drought events. India has received flood events (1983, 1988, 1994, 2005, 2011, 2013) and drought event (1982, 1987, 2002, 2004 and 2009) during 1981-2015, which have been verified with SA-CORDEX RCMs (RegCM4.7, COSMO & REMO2015) using SPI. The first mode of EOF(IMD), explained 17% of the total SPI variability on the interannual scale, shows anomalous large positive values concentrated over the western peninsular region and extending towards central India as well as the NWI region of India. On the other hand, high anomalous negative values dominated over the NEI and eastern parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Therefore, this study underscores the importance to uncover the prevalent dynamics and climate change variability on changing trend variability of the precipitation indices, drought and flood characteristics. As moderate to severe drought variability portrays a diversity over regional scale viz northwest India, north central India, eastern ghat of the southern peninsular region and northeast India while the occurrence of moderate to severe flood are dominated towards Himalaya region (26N-35N; 70E-80E), western peninsular region and western ghat.

Community responses to the annual flooding<i> (efundja)</i> in the Cuvelai-Etosha basin, Northern Namibia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disaster risk reduction; Efundja; Cuvelai-etosha basin; Focus group discussions; Focus group schedules; Community voices	RISK REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT	The efundja is the annual flooding experienced in the Cuvelai-Etosha basin of northern Namibia. This recurring flooding varies in intensity and impact the lives of the inhabitants of the basin in disparate ways. The rural population of the basin is especially vulnerable to the impacts associated with these floods. The governmental response to the efundja is mostly reactive, and the voices of the rural community are lacking in the development and execution of the disaster response strategy for the area. Limited studies exist to include the voices of rural communities in the narrative about the efundja and its impact and mitigation. This study used focus group discussions to investigate the experiences of heads of households in the affected rural communities in the study area to address this hiatus in the research. The results of the study can also aid in addressing the deficiencies in the governmental response strategy used to deal with the floods. Rural communities in the study area articulated the impacts of the efundja on their lives well and indicated that the impacts are pervasive and affect their entire way of life. They reported that the nature and duration of the efundja have changed over time, with a longer duration, more severe impacts, pollution, and poor water quality associated with recent efundja events. They attribute this mainly to climate change, an increase in the population of the basin, inappropriate human behavior and bad spatial planning. Although the rural communities reported various practical methods to alleviate the adverse impacts of the flooding, they expressed a general lack of capacity to deal with the flooding effectively. Empowerment through education and training on how to mitigate effects and participation in disaster response planning and execution were affirmed needs in the communities surveyed. The research and its results can be used to inform a better disaster response strategy for northern Namibia. The study can also be emulated in other areas of the Global South. The results of such studies can be compared with that of the present study to expand the disaster response narrative. Adding the voices of vulnerable rural communities can be a particularly valuable addition to the disaster response narrative since their views are sometimes excluded in disaster response studies.

Managing sea level rise in an age of austerity	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Localism; Adaptation; Flood management; Legitimacy; Governance	PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; REALIGNMENT SCHEME; COASTAL MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT; ATTITUDES; FLOOD; POLICY; GOVERNANCE; LOCALISM	Recent trends in governance in England, UK ? exemplified by the notion of the ?Big Society? and the 2011 Localism Act ? have seen local communities and individuals encouraged to take greater responsibility for public policy issues that were previously seen as largely or exclusively state-led. This paper examines a case study where this localism presumption has been applied to estuary flood defence and considers the appropriateness of localor community-based initiatives in dealing with sea level rise. We examine the Alde and Ore Estuary, Suffolk, England, UK, where the state has retreated as the main decision-maker for climate change adaptation and consider the impacts of this change in governance approach. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with local actors focusing on: a) perceptions of the governance of flood defence plans, b) the legitimacy of decisions reached, and c) social equity linked with localism. We find that there is a limit to what can be devolved down to local communities in the absence of structure, guidelines, funding or supervision provided by state actors. It is unrealistic that responsibility for problems such as flood defence, involving complex trade-offs; issues of public safety and public expenditure; and protection of natural assets be devolved so comprehensively to local communities without substantial co-leadership. State actors still need to co-lead and provide a link between the local scale and the national and international policy scales and to facilitate a broader sense of vision for future landscapes. Without transparent co-led processes involving a broad range of actors in the local community and state bodies, decisions made regarding flood defence initiatives may be perceived by local people to lack legitimacy. Without an independent arbiter involved in project planning and decision-making, disagreements may dissolve into intractable disputes that damage project credibility and hamper or even paralyze practical progress. Without compensation schemes that acknowledge that any flood defence plan will mean some local people lose out, some are likely to vigorously resist change, hampering progress. It will also be necessary to ensure a focus on inter-generational equity so that current generations do not deflect costs onto later generations, for whom costs may be higher and decisions more difficult.

J	Walter, J				Walter, Julia			Dryness, wetness and temporary flooding reduce floral resources of plant communities with adverse consequences for pollinator attraction	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; community level; drought; global change ecology; pollination; pulsed stress; Trifolium pratense; waterlogging	DROUGHT STRESS; LEAF HERBIVORY; WATER-STRESS; AVAILABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; DECLINES; QUALITY; TRAITS; YIELD; TIME	Climate change alters precipitation regimes world-wide and is regarded as a major threat for pollinators and pollination services. Yet, not much is known on how wetter as well as drier conditions affect food resources for pollinators and pollinator attraction in a multi-species community context. It is unclear how community shifts under changed hydrological conditions might affect pollinators. This mesocosm study addresses existing research gaps by investigating effects of drought, wetness and temporary flooding on floral resources and pollinator attraction within a plant community, initially including nine insect-pollinated and six wind-pollinated species. Floral resources were assessed over three growing seasons. I monitored community descriptors (percentage of herbs and herbaceous species richness, presence of flowering insect-pollinated individuals), floral traits (flower height, size and weight, floral sugar content of one key species) and proxies for plant fitness (pollinator attraction, seed and flower weight of one key species). Wetness and especially dryness decreased the species richness and biomass proportion of insect-pollinated herbaceous species and flowering herbaceous plant individuals occurred less frequently. Permanent wetness decreased the floral sugar content of the key speciesTrifolium pratense. Wet, temporary flooded and especially dry communities were visited by pollinators less often. Active pollinators spent less time within wet and flooded communities, while not at all visiting dry communities. Seed and flower weight of the obligate xenogamousT. pratensein flooded and dry communities decreased, indicating negative consequences for plant fitness caused by a lack of pollination. Synthesis. While dryness had negative effects for floral resources both in terms of community descriptors and floral traits, negative effects of wetness and temporary flooding were mostly caused by a decrease of insect-pollinated herbaceous species. The study thus indicates that shifts in plant community composition are decisive for a predictive understanding of plant-pollinator interactions under environmental change, but these have been neglected in past research. Changing precipitation patterns will adversely affect floral resources and pollinator attraction in agriculturally used temperate grassland, which might have widespread negative consequences for pollination services and food security in the coming decades.

J	Ovando, P; Brouwer, R				Ovando, Paola; Brouwer, Roy			A review of economic approaches modeling the complex interactions between forest management and watershed services	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS			English	Review						Hydro-economic models; Forest management; Forest conservation; Decision-making; Watershed services	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LAND-USE; JOINT PRODUCTION; TIMBER; COST; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK; QUALITY; IMPACT	This paper provides a comprehensive review of two decades of published research that applies different economic approaches to address forested watershed management decisions. The review takes stock of the applied integrated economic and ecohydrological modeling approaches and assesses the way these approaches capture the complexities involved when linking ecohydrological and economic systems. The implications of integrating watershed services into forest management decisions are discussed, lessons are drawn from existing approaches and future research needs identified. Existing modeling approaches are categorized from independent modular models with a unidirectional flow of information to fully coupled holistic models, and are analyzed, among others, in terms of the efficiency improvement that forest-based investments achieve in watershed services provision. The review shows that the number of studies investigating the relationship between forest management and watershed services in economic decision-support models is very limited. Only 14 studies that were identified examine these relationships for water supply, while 9 studies were found to focus on the impact on water quality, 2 of which addressed water quality in combination with water supply. A shortcoming is that about half of the studies do not clearly specify baseline conditions to test the incremental value of the evaluated forest management actions in terms of watershed services provision, which undermines evaluating their cost-effectiveness or economic efficiency. A promising finding is nevertheless that in 8 of the 10 studies where these relationships were evaluated in terms of their costs and benefits compared to a specified baseline alternative, forest conservation or forest management is shown to be an economically efficient nature-based solution to supply the watershed services of interest. The limited availability of geo-referenced data and information, including the often complex and confidential nature of cost and price data, and the high data demands of more advanced spatial econometric models are among the main barriers to address relevant forest and water economic interactions. Important future extensions of existing integrated approaches include the further coupling of more detailed ecohydrological models and multi-sectoral hydro-economic models that are able to account for the different risks (floods, droughts, wildfires) and uncertainties under climate change and their impact on watershed services and water security.

J	Fan, JW; Jiang, HC; Xu, HY; Zhang, W				Fan Jiawei; Jiang Hanchao; Xu Hongyan; Zhang Wei			Impacts of seismic activity and climatic change on Chinese history in the recent millennium	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						catastrophic seismic activity; extreme climatic event; agricultural production; social stability; Chinese dynasty alternation	INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE; MEDIEVAL WARM PERIOD; ICE-AGE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; MONSOON; RESPONSES; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHTS; DECLINE; RECORDS	General history of disasters in China suggests that China has frequently experienced two major natural disasters in its long history, one is from catastrophic earthquake events, and the other is from extreme climatic events, due to its unique active tectonic environment and climatic complexity. Although these two major natural disasters have caused great damage to human society, it remains unclear whether and how they affect Chinese dynasty alternation on decadal (emperor) timescales. Based on detailed comparisons between abrupt climatic changes, catastrophic seismic activities, and the history of Chinese dynasty alternation from 1000-2000 AD, we conclude that on decadal timescales, extreme drought (and/or flood) events could indeed significantly reduce agricultural production, cause severe food shortages and famine, and result in increases in population exile, rising food prices and inflation, and insufficient supplies for military defense, which could exceed social resilience and eventually lead to financial risks and social upheavals of the dynasties. In addition, catastrophic seismic events in the densely populated, agricultural areas of China, including the 1303 surface wave magnitude (M-s) 8.0 Hongtong earthquake, the 1556 M-s 8.25 Huaxian earthquake and the 1920 M-s 8.5 Haiyuan earthquake, caused more than 200,000 casualties and millions of victims to live in exile which was almost equivalent to the order of magnitude of those extreme climatic events-induced refugees. The secondary geological hazards related to the earthquakes (e.g., extensive landslides and soil erosion), which could last for decades, caused more casualties and reduced food production. Furthermore, great plague spread caused by the casualties could significantly increase psychological panic among the survivors, resulting in social instability. Therefore, catastrophic seismic events could also accelerate the collapse of the dynasties (e.g., the Ming dynasty) without immediate mitigation measures. This study indicates that catastrophic seismic activities, as well as extreme climatic events, could have great effects on the social structures and thus on the Chinese dynasty alternation on decadal timescales, which highlights the far-reaching implications of geological hazard research.

J.; Shen, Xinyi; Gourley, Jonathan J.; Kolar, Randall L.; Hong, Yang			A Comprehensive Flood Inundation Mapping for Hurricane Harvey Using an Integrated Hydrological and Hydraulic Model	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						North America; Hurricanes; Coupled models; Hydrologic models; Model comparison; Model evaluation; performance	CHANNEL BATHYMETRY; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; FATALITIES	Because climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes and coastal flooding, there is a clear need for an integrated hydrology and hydraulic system that has the ability to model the hydrologic conditions over a long period and the flow dynamic representations of when and where the extreme hydrometeorological events occur. This system coupling provides comprehensive information (flood wave, inundation extents, and depths) about coastal flood events for emergency management and risk minimization. This study provides an integrated hydrologic and hydraulic coupled modeling system that is based on the Coupled Routing and Excessive Storage (CREST) model and the Australia National University-Geophysics Australia (ANUGA) model to simulate flood. Forced by the near-real-time Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) quantitative precipitation estimates, this integrated modeling system was applied during the 2017 Hurricane Harvey event to simulate the streamflow, the flood extent, and the inundation depth. The results were compared with postevent high-water-mark survey data and its interpolated flood extent by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Federal Emergency Management Agency flood insurance claims, as well as a satellite-based flood map, the National Water Model (NWM), and the Fathom (LISFLOOD-FP) model simulated flood map. The proposed hydrologic and hydraulic model simulation indicated that it could capture 87% of all flood insurance claims within the study area, and the overall error of water depth was 0.91 m, which is comparable to the mainstream operational flood models (NWM and Fathom). SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We wanted to provide a tool for local emergency response officials to visualize the possible flood conditions in their region, because the heavy rainfall flood is likely becoming more frequent and more intense, possibly as a result of climate change. The simulated flood information includes the water channel flowrate, two-dimensional flood extent, and the inundation depth throughout the flooded area. The results proved that, with less data requirement, the proposed tool can provide the comprehensive flood information, with accuracy of flood extent simulation comparable to mainstream flood models and acceptable inundation-depth simulation. We will keep working to expand the capability of the framework from the real-time simulation to the 1-h lead-time prediction.

However, insufficient age control for these regional loess records, especially over glacial-interglacial cycles, severely limits our understanding of loess depositional dynamics and accurate interpretation of paleoclimate conditions across central Asia. in this study, we applied K-feldspar optical dating, and magnetic susceptibility, grain size distribution, CaCO3 and color to loess-paleosol sections in the Yili Basin of the Tianshan Mountains to constrain loess depositional dynamics, identify timing of loess-paleosol formation and clarify the role of paleoclimate influence in this region since the late middle Pleistocene. Our results demonstrate that loess deposition started as early as 350 ka in the Yili Basin. Following river down-cutting associated with glacial-interglacial transitions and exposure of riverbed sediments, enhanced dust emission from flood plains played an important role in loess deposition. Very rapid loess deposition as high as 60-120 g cm(-2) ka(-1) on river terraces occurred during the last interglacial, when loess accumulation at different locations of the site had remarkably different rates, ranging from 10 to 100 g cm(-2) ka(-1). This heterogeneous behavior indicates that not only climatic changes influenced Yili Basin loess deposition and preservation but by complex interaction of local geomorphology, wind velocity, and changes of materials in dust origins. Depositional hiatuses frequently occurred during the past 250 ka, likely induced by strong erosion resulting from increased wind strength and dry-cold climate with poor vegetation cover in the region. Magnetic susceptibility, grain size distribution, CaCO3 and color analyses of the loess-paleosol sequences showed that paleosols formed around similar to 288 ka, 230-191 ka, 120-106 ka, 92-89 ka, and 84-71 ka. Hence, a generally moist climate characterized the Yili Basin before Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 9, MIS 7, MIS 5d, MIS 5b, and the MIS 5-MIS 4 transition, respectively. This study suggests a climate pattern of moist interglacial and dry glacial periods in the Tianshan Mountains, whereas substages of interglacials had cold-moist and warm-dry climate characteristics.

A wide paleochannel belt, the Ghaggar-Hakra channel, has been mapped in this region. Our previous studies along with others established that a large Himalayan river flowed through this paleochannel, and a large-scale drainage reorganisation occurred during the last 10 ka. This follow-up study presents sedimentary facies and chrono-stratigraphy of the alluvial deposits from the Ghaggar-Hakra paleochannel (1) to understand the depositional environments of the river system; (2) to reconstruct aggradation/incision history and stratigraphic development, and (3) to understand fluvial response to climate change at a regional scale. Sediment cores (35-50 m) across the length and width of the paleochannel, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) based chronology are used to reconstruct alluvial stratigraphy developed during marine isotope stage (MIS) 5-1. Twelve sedimentary facies identified in the cores characterize floodplain, channel, and aeolian depositional settings. Four stratigraphic units were identified; the oldest Unit 1 (> 150 ka) representing aeolian deposition disconformably underlies the younger Units 2 to 4 that represent four periods of fluvial aggradation (and incision). Period I (similar to 86-64 ka) comprises coarse grained grey micaceous channel sand, and period II (similar to 62-30 ka) shows transition to fine to medium channel sand interlayered with yellow mud of floodplain deposition. Period III (similar to 25-12 ka) comprised of fine grained grey micaceous channel sand and very fine deposits of channel margin settings. Period IV (similar to 11-4.0 ka) marks the termination of flow from the large Himalayan river, the Sutlej, into the Ghaggar-Hakra system and fluvial sequence in this period, red brown silty clay, represents modern Ghaggar deposits. We suggest a strong climatic control on the stratigraphic development in this region based on the available proxy records. We further compare our stratigraphic data with that of the IGP and the adjoining western Indian rivers for understanding the regional-scale fluvial response to monsoonal fluctuations.

Monitoring and identifying the geographic and temporal land-cover changes and driving forces in this unique type of area may help to give the scientific basis needed to understand the effects of climate change and human activities on LUCC. The Third Pole is one such landscape that provides inevitable key ecosystem services to over 2 billion people in Asia. However, this important landscape is increasingly being threatened by the impacts of climate change. Policy and program responses to the Third Pole's mounting socioeconomic challenges are inadequate and lack scientific evidence. Using the land-change model (LCM) and historical data from 1992 onwards, our study attempted to (i) detect the spatial patterns of land use and land-cover changes in the Third Pole from 1992 to 2020; and (ii) project them into 2060. Our analysis shows that the land use and land-cover types in the Third pole are undergoing changes. About 0.07% of the snow and ice have melted in the last three decades, indicating global warming. This melt has resulted in increasing water bodies (0.08%), especially as glacial lakes. This has significantly increased the risk of glacial outburst floods. Other key alpine land-cover types that decreased are bare land (0.6%) and agricultural land (0.05%). These land types represent important habitats for wild flora and fauna, grazing land for livestock, and food for nomads, and their loss will directly degrade ecological services and the health and wellbeing of the nomads. Land cover of forest, shrubs, and scanty vegetation have all increased by 0.3%, 0.02%, and 0.77%, respectively, inducing socio-ecological changes in the Third pole mountains. Further predication analysis showed that snow and ice, along with bare land, will continue to recede whereas forest, grassland, water bodies, shrubland, sparse vegetation, and settlement will increase. These results indicate the increasing impact of global warming that will continue to change the Third Pole. These changes have serious implications for designing adaptation and mitigation interventions in the mountains. We recommend more detailed research to investigate the underlying factors that are changing the Third Pole to develop policy and programs to help humans, livestock, and biodiversity adapt to the changes in these remote and harsh mountains. This will also help to mitigate the effects on downstream communities.

These systems face multiple stresses of altered water regime, increased human interference and biological invasion, climate change, land developments and other site-specific issues that may include eutrophication and urbanisation. In due course of urbanisation, riparian vegetation is replaced by both impervious and less permeable surfaces causing more frequent floods, greater total surface runoff, and decreased time to produce runoff. This may result in flooding of the city when a substantial rain is received. In this study, we evaluated the vulnerability of riparian zones in Dehradun city of India due to urbanisation using a series of indicators extracted from remote sensing data. The changes in the landscape pattern of the riparian zones were examined by analyzing and manipulating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets using Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS 10.1 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. Factors influencing the changes within the riparian area were identified using higher resolution image, existing base maps and reconnaissance surveys to qualify them as one of the indicators. Anthropogenic activities such as new residential buildings, infrastructure (such as roads), farming activities and commercial activities (industrial set up) were some of the factors contributing to the vulnerability of riparian zones. The final indicators in the form of riparian zone slope, extent of the riparian area, vegetation cover, human disturbance were mapped as raster layers and were integrated in a GIS environment to obtain final vulnerability map. This was intersected with settlement density map to categorize the vulnerability levels for three settlement density classes of low, medium and high. The findings reveal a significant land cover change within the riparian zones over a period of twenty years (2000 to 2019) with various levels of human encroachment. It was observed that 26.15% of the riparian area falls under low, 47.68% under medium, 12.98% under high, and 13.19% under very high vulnerability classes. Furthermore, the coverage percentage of high vulnerability class was largest in the low and high settlement density areas of riparian zones accounting for 36.96% and 51.48%, respectively. The majority of the area (74.36%) falls under medium vulnerability class under medium settlement density class. The study provides an opportunity to map riparian zone vulnerability considering predominant indicators of vulnerability that could be mapped using remotely sensed data and application of GIS tools.

These natural phenomena, in turn, affect the supply of drinking water in some communities, which causes an increase in the prevalence of diseases related to the supply of drinking water. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the effects of global warming on human health in the population of Monterrey, Mexico after Hurricane Alex. We interpolated data using statistical downscaling of climate projection data for 2050 and 2080 and correlated it with disease occurrence. We found a remarkable rise in the incidence of transmissible infectious disease symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms predominated and were associated with drinking of contaminated water like tap water or water from communal mobile water tanks, probably because of the contamination of clean water, the disruption of water sanitation, and the inability to maintain home hygiene practices.

Coastal flooding will disproportionately impact people on river deltas	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TROPICAL CYCLONES; SEDIMENT; RISK; MORPHOLOGY; DISCHARGE; WATER; WAVE	Climate change is intensifying tropical cyclones, accelerating sea-level rise, and increasing coastal flooding. River deltas are especially vulnerable to flooding because of their low elevations and densely populated cities. Yet, we do not know how many people live on deltas and their exposure to flooding. Using a new global dataset, we show that 339 million people lived on river deltas in 2017 and 89% of those people live in the same latitudinal zone as most tropical cyclone activity. We calculate that 41% (31 million) of the global population exposed to tropical cyclone flooding live on deltas, with 92% (28 million) in developing or least developed economies. Furthermore, 80% (25 million) live on sediment-starved deltas, which cannot naturally mitigate flooding through sediment deposition. Given that coastal flooding will only worsen, we must reframe this problem as one that will disproportionately impact people on river deltas, particularly in developing and least-developed economies.

From incremental to transformative adaptation in individual responses to climate-exacerbated hazards	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review							SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CHANGE BELIEFS; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CHANGE-MITIGATION; RISK PERCEPTIONS; FLOOD-PROTECTION; DEFENSIBLE SPACE; PERCEIVED RISK; WILDFIRE	Individual responses to climate hazards can contribute to long-term societal resilience. This Review finds that the literature emphasizes intrapersonal cognitive and affective drivers of adaptation behaviour rather than the interpersonal social factors that promote coordinated cooperative action. Building societal resilience to climate change depends on increased adaptation. In this Review of scholarship on behavioural adaptation, we find that most empirical studies focus on the affective and cognitive drivers of behaviours with largely private benefits. Few examine behaviours with collective benefits or explore the moderating role of social factors on affective and cognitive cues. We point to cultural evolution and complex adaptive systems as frameworks that can improve our understanding of behaviours that lead to greater societal resilience in the long term. Integrating such research traditions with the socio-psychological perspectives that dominate the literature will ensure that future studies better distinguish the drivers of incremental coping from transformative adaptation.

PNSA is a UNESCO world heritage city and the cultural and economic hub of Ayutthaya. The finding showed that a large proportion of agricultural land was converted into commercial areas to accommodate economic development and population growth. Furthermore, construction of anti-flood structure infrastructure in PNSA increased flood intensity and duration in three neighboring districts as more floodwater was diverted to the peri-urban area. In addition, this research looks into the social impacts related to land use change and anti-flood structural infrastructure.

The article is situated in a case study of flood and climate risk governance in Canada's Metro Vancouver region. Drawing on 60 interviews with emergency managers, engineers, planners, and elected officials, and a regional survey of resilience practitioners, we identify distinct knowledge systems used for managing urban resilience. We find that technical hazard- and engineering-based knowledge that has maintained its supremacy over the past decades is being increasingly challenged through knowledge co-production. We find that formalized and shadow spaces for learning and collaborative problem-solving break down barriers and enable a collective search for flood resilience solutions across governance levels.

J	Borrego, JB				Borrego, Jessica Bernal			Outdated regulations and institutional vulnerability: Hydrological risk management in M′alaga's municipal planning	HELIYON			English	Article						Hydrological; Planning; Risk; Urban	FLOOD	M & PRIME;alaga, a Mediterranean region, is increasingly prone to water-related risks, a situation compounded by the impacts of climate change. Urban development practices over the past decades have significantly exacerbated these risks. Our study offers a novel, scientifically derived methodology to evaluate municipal capabilities in managing hydrological risks through urban planning instruments. Leveraging a checklist applied through multicriteria analysis, we scrutinized the integration of theoretical and regulatory frameworks relating to hydrological risks in numerous municipalities. Our findings highlight a glaring deficiency in local Disaster Risk Reduction strategies in alignment with the Sendai Framework. Additionally, there's minimal incorporation of natural risk analysis and mapping into planning instruments. Our results spotlight M & PRIME;alaga's high institutional vulnerability due to its limited capacity in hydrological risk management, underlining the pressing necessity for land use policies informed by risk assessments and prioritizing citizen safety. This study significantly contributes to future urban planning initiatives, offering a roadmap toward more resilient communities amid escalating hydrological risks.

This approach can quickly identify and locate ponding with relatively high accuracy. Based on the approach, a model is developed, which is constructed by two tandem processes and utilizes a multi-task learning mechanism. The superiority of the developed model was demonstrated by comparing with two widely used neural networks (LSTM and convolutional neural networks). Then, the model was further revised with the available monitoring data in the study area to achieve higher accuracy. We also discussed how the number of selected monitoring points influenced the performance of the corrected model. In this study, over 15 000 designed rainfall events were used for model training, covering various extreme weather conditions.

To effectively respond to these coastal risks requires structured, deliberative approaches with the aim of fostering resilience and contributing to sustainability. A collaborative engagement process was used to explore community challenges. This included a project launch, key informant interviews, meetings, focus groups (agriculture, tourism, youth), and on-line methods (shoreline residents). Participatory social network analysis and theory of change were used for overall sense-making. As a result, community members identified six impact pathways moving forward with climate action: partnerships and collaboration; strategic engagement; water and watersheds; ecosystem-based adaptation; shoreline protection; and education. These themes are consistent with current theory on sustainability and theory of change development.

This study provides a state-of-the-art review of compound events from the perspective of the dependence of multiple contributing variables, based on both synthetic data sets and observations. The cause of dependence, the relationship between dependence and likelihoods of compound events, and changes in risks associated with dependence changes are reviewed, with the illustration of two typical examples of compound dry-hot events and compound flooding events. Also discussed are related topics, including impacts of sample sizes, multivariate bias correction of dependence, and separating driving factors of compound event changes. Insights provided by this study will be useful for building resilience to cope with compound extremes under changing climate.

To tackle threats arising from environmental change, developing WAVs with amphibious functions will inevitably become a trend in the future. The purpose of this study is to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of WAVs. An existing WAV model is adopted as a starting point, and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techniques are used for performing analyses. This study analyzes the relationship between the configuration of a WAV and the sailing resistance. Two computation modes are associated with CFD used for flow simulation around the vehicles: the relative motion and absolute motion computation modes. The results of the simulations obtained through these two modes have been discussed and compared to develop an efficient tool for performing hydrodynamic performance analysis of amphibious wheeled armored vehicles (AWAV).

Drainage conditions of the reference area were compared on the basis of two time periods, for years 1980 and 2010. Two maps of land use were processed for two years. Total runoff coefficients were calculated based on the processed maps, which differed because in 1980 the territory was not so built up compared to now. The calculated results were also proved by using PCSWMM - Storm Water Management Model. The results prove that the maximum 2010 runoff at the area has increased by almost double from 1980. The increased discharge, therefore, requires flood protection measures in the area.

Inundation effects will be evident, but isolation that arises from the loss of accessibility to critical services due to inundation of transportation networks may be less obvious. We examine who is most at risk of isolation due to SLR, which can inform community adaptation plans and help ensure that existing social vulnerabilities are not exacerbated. Combining socio-demographic data with an isolation metric, we identify social and economic disparities in risk of isolation under different SLR scenarios (1-10 ft) for the coastal U.S. We show that Black and Hispanic populations face a disproportionate risk of isolation at intermediate levels of SLR (4 ft and greater). Further, census tracts with higher rates of renters and older adults consistently face higher risk of isolation. These insights point to significant inequity in the burdens associated with SLR.

However, the terrestrial versus marine origin of the SPM in the GBR is uncertain. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence (13C NMR, isotopic and genetic fingerprints) to unravel that a considerable proportion of the terrestrially-derived SPM is degraded in the riverine and estuarine mixing zones before it is transported further offshore. The fingerprints of SPM in the marine environment were completely different from those of terrestrial origin but more consistent with that formed by marine phytoplankton. This result indicates that the SPM in the GBR may not have terrestrial origin but produced locally in the marine environment, which has significant implications on developing better-targeted management practices for improving water quality in the GBR. This multidisciplinary fingerprinting study, using isotopic, structural and genetic fingerprints, has shown that the suspended particulate matter in the Great Barrier Reef does not have terrestrial origin but produced locally by marine phytoplankton	[Bahadori, Mohammad; Chen, Chengrong; Rashti, Mehran Rezaei] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Bahadori, Mohammad; Chen, Chengrong; Rashti, Mehran Rezaei] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Lewis, Stephen; Bainbridge, Zoe; Stevens, Tom] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res, Catchment Reef Res Grp, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Wang, Juntao] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Wang, Juntao] Western Sydney Univ, Global Ctr Land Based Innovat, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Shen, Jupei] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Hou, Enqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Eco, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou 510650, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qiaoyun] Huazhong Agr Univ, State Key Lab Agr Microbiol, Wuhan, Peoples R China	Griffith University; Griffith University; James Cook University; Western Sydney University; Western Sydney University; Fujian Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Botanical Garden, CAS; Huazhong Agricultural University	Chen, CR (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.; Chen, CR (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Sch Environm & Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.	c.chen@griffith.edu.au	Rezaei Rashti, Mehran/S-5131-2016; Wang, Juntao/O-4423-2015; Huang, Qiaoyun/A-8418-2012; Bahadori, Mohammad/AAQ-5320-2021; Lewis, Stephen/P-7205-2016; chen, chengrong/B-3814-2009	Rezaei Rashti, Mehran/0000-0003-2639-7547; Wang, Juntao/0000-0002-1822-2176; Huang, Qiaoyun/0000-0002-2733-8066; Bahadori, Mohammad/0000-0002-1185-5472; Lewis, Stephen/0000-0002-6929-6626; chen, chengrong/0000-0001-6377-4001	Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program; Griffith University; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Jane Waterhouse;  [2.1.5]	Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program(Australian Government); Griffith University(Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus); Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Jane Waterhouse; 	This work was financially supported by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program (NESP projects 2.1.5 and 5.8 to S.L. and Z.B.), Griffith University (M.B. and C.R.C.) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Reef Guardian Research Grant 2019 (M.B and C.R.C.).

This paper supports their management, conservation, and restoration by synthesizing research about their hydrology, while their large geographic range and extensive literature base allow broader insights into wetland hydrology. Cypress domes occur in shallow karst depressions that intersect the water table and are often underlain by low permeability sediments. Following differences in hydrogeologic and watershed characteristics, cypress domes naturally show variability in water level behaviors. Despite this variability, the hydropatterns of healthy cypress domes operate within a relatively narrow regime, which reflects the wetlands' shallow morphology, and the consistency of this regime is necessary to maintain the canopy dominance of cypress trees. Many cypress domes modulate regional water tables, collecting runoff and rainfall and supplying water to the surficial aquifer during most of the year, while receiving groundwater during high rainfall periods. Anthropogenic drying or flooding can convert cypress domes into upland-like communities or other wetland or waterbody types.

We find that estuarine response to SLR is influenced by both morphological changes to channel capacity and the associated changes to channel hydrodynamics. Low and moderate SLR scenarios result in an increase in flood extent throughout the estuary relative to the no SLR base case. Surprisingly, more severe SLR scenarios result in decreased flood extent in upstream reaches. This shift is due to penetration of tidal energy and erosion further upstream with greater SLR, which increases channel capacity locally. A periodic pattern of local sediment transport is additionally observed due to SLR, which we attribute to the time response lag between hydrological and morphological response. The finding that increased SLR does not result in increased flood extent everywhere emphasizes that flood mitigation measures need to carefully account for non-linear responses in the estuarine morphodynamic systems, such as the feedbacks resulting from increased tidal erosion.

For this purpose, we quantified several indicators and criteria for each component of a conceptual cause- effect relationship diagram. According to the findings, climate change (with an average rank of 2.93), population pressure (similar to 2.78), and traditional animal husbandry (similar to 2.45) are the most influential factors influencing the occurrence of flooding in this watershed. The combination of flood risk factors has resulted in a significant increase in runoff production and consequently in flood discharge in the region. The results of this study indicate that: (a) there has been an upward trend in flood occurrence; (b) the pressure caused by the driving forces is intensifying; (c) the ability of managers to control the driving force is extremely limited; and d) the introduced policies have failed to mitigate flood risk.

Management strategies to restore or enhance sedimentation on delta plains, Sedimentation-Enhancing Strategies (hereafter SES), are now being pursued in many deltas but there has been limited cross-disciplinary and cross-delta review. Here we compare 21 existing and planned SES, synthesizing their physical characteristics, funding, governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement, process of implementation, environmental impact, land use change, and potential for upscaling. Strategies exist at various scales, from ~0.05 km2 - 500 km2. 79% of strategies are capable of outpacing high rates of sea-level rise. Cheaper strategies are limited to short term impacts and small spatial scales, while more expensive strategies can have longer lifetimes. Most strategies create wetlands and flood water storage. Some create opportunities for agriculture, aquaculture, housing, or recreational land use. Combinations of SES will likely be the most effective and sustainable method for maintaining elevation in river deltas.

The water industry faces considerable challenges accessing climate data sets that extend beyond that of historical gauging stations. Without this, variability around the extremes of floods and droughts is unknown and stress-testing infrastructure design and water demands is challenging. User-friendly access to relevant palaeoclimate data is now essential, and importantly, an efficient process to determine which proxies are most relevant to a planning scenario, and geographic area of interest. This paper presents PalaeoWISE (Palaeoclimate Data for Water Industry and Security Planning) a fully integrated, and quality-assured database of proxy data extracted from data repositories and publications collated in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format. We demonstrate the application of the database in Queensland, one of Australia's most hydrologically extreme states. The database and resultant hydroclimate correlations provides both the scientific community, and water resource managers, with a valuable resource to better manage for future climate changes.

Drawing on four cases from South and Southeast Asia, we show how megacities' search for additional water supplies or sites to store floodwater repeatedly disadvantage the most vulnerable groups in rural and urban areas. Rather than rehashing urban-rural conflicts, we argue these outcomes demonstrate the continuous reproduction of water insecurity for a class of society that is dispossessed of water and rural livelihoods, excluded from water and land access within the cities they migrate to, and evicted from flood-securitized cities back to the periphery. Water-related injustices confronting the urban poor mirror injustices along the entire water governance spectrum that begins and ends in rural areas. These shared vulnerabilities suggest opportunities for solidarity across urban-rural divides and novel directions for research and coalition building. A fundamental challenge ahead will be whether and how urban and rural poor groups can build regional or national alliances across geographic and identity divides.

The urban mapping results verified with reference data indicated close agreement, with the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients higher than 88.9% and 0.78, respectively. A remarkable increase of 14.9% in urban area was observed for the period 2005-2020, compared to 7.2% during the period 1990-2005. The results of flood risk modeling revealed that RF produced slightly more accurate results than SVM. The flood risk areas aggregated with urban maps showed that the larger urban flood risk area was especially observed for the period 2005-2020. The urban areas of high/very high and medium flood risks calculated for 2020 were 19.7% and 20%, respectively. Such flood risk areas were also overlaid with the population density for urban planning and management.

A simulation-based modeling environment can be useful when modeling a set of related events that lead up to the estimation of the probable consequences of hazard events, which affect network managers and society. Nonetheless, running such simulations can be computationally expensive because each type of event requires a model of its own, and proper interfaces are needed to link events. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can often be conducted, with the expectation that their results are representative of those that could have been obtained if all simulations had been run. This article presents a simulation reduction technique to calculate the risk related to transportation networks due to extreme hydrometeorological hazard events by conducting statistical analysis on the risk estimated when simulating the impact of nonextreme events. The technique may be of interest to network managers seeking to make decisions based on possible future climate scenarios. An example road network in Switzerland is used to illustrate the technique.

With worsening severe weather events due to climate change, public health policy and practices must evolve to more effectively engage communities. This study's findings identify and suggest new strategic public health policies to shift the practice of all-hazards preparedness into routine, everyday life. Methods: Semi-structured interviews, focus groups and Thematic Analysis were used to investigate the interactions between participant groups: emergency responders and animal owners. Results: Three policies designed to improve human safety and well-being are proposed and discussed. These are (i) a new system of workplace leave, (ii) an innovative regime of financial incentives for fire-ready properties, and (iii) review of the use of firebreaks on farms and rural blocks. Conclusion: Policies proposed in this research aim to proactively narrow the awareness-preparedness gap and build adaptive capacity to minimise risk to human health in all-hazards contexts. Further research could evaluate the efficacy of trialled public policy.

J	Ma, JS; Song, CQ; Wang, YJ				Ma, Jingsong; Song, Chunqiao; Wang, Yanjun			Spatially and Temporally Resolved Monitoring of Glacial Lake Changes in Alps During the Recent Two Decades	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						glacial lake; ALPS; glacier; climate change; remote sensing; landsat	TIBETAN PLATEAU; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EUROPEAN ALPS; MASS CHANGES; TIME-SERIES; INVENTORY; EVOLUTION; HIMALAYAS; EXPANSION; REGION	Climate warming is intensifying the melting of glaciers and the growth of glacial lakes in the Alps, which has a profound impact on the management of water resources and high-mountain hydropower in this region. However, the research on the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the Alps glacial lakes of various types still lacks a holistic view. In this study, we developed an inventory of Alps glacial lakes of different types and then obtained the annual areas of these lakes from 2000 to 2019 using JRC Global Surface Water and Global Land Analysis and Discovery data at a resolution of 30 m. A total of 498 glacial lakes (>0.01 km(2)) with the net area of 33.77 +/- 6.94 km(2) were identified in the Alps in 2019 and are mainly distributed in the western and central Alps. These Alps glacial lakes, with the area ranging 0.01-1.59 km(2), are generally dominated by small-sized ones. The comparison of lakes of different types indicated that ice-uncontacted lakes are dominant in number and area, accounting for 59.4 and 58.4%, respectively. In terms of the elevation distribution, almost half of the lakes are concentrated at the altitude of 2,250-2,750 m (a.s.l.). Meanwhile, the mean altitude of small glacial lakes is higher than that of large lakes. The distribution of ice-contacted lakes and supraglacial lakes were more concentrated, and the mean altitude was higher. During the study period, the number, area, and water volume of glacial lakes were increasing, but the expansion varied between different periods. The changing trends of the glacial lake area and volume were consistent and presents in three stages, as the glacial lake expanded rapidly in the first 5 years and in the last 7 years and remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2012. The number and area of glacier-fed lakes increased rapidly, while the non-glacier-fed lakes were relatively stable. The area change rate of supraglacial lakes was the largest (+47%). This study provides a spatially-complete and temporally-consecutive picture of glacial lake changes in the Alps and can be greatly helpful for future research on climate-glacier-lake interactions, glacial lake outburst floods, and freshwater resources in this region.</p>	[Ma, Jingsong; Wang, Yanjun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jingsong; Song, Chunqiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China	Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS	Song, CQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China.	cqsong@niglas.ac.cn			Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0202]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFA0607101, 2018YFD0900804, 2018YFD1100101]; Thousand Young Talents Program in China [Y7QR011001]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23100102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971403, 41801321]	Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Thousand Young Talents Program in China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was partly funded by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0202), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0607101, 2018YFD0900804, 2018YFD1100101), the Thousand Young Talents Program in China (Grant No. Y7QR011001), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA23100102), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41971403, 41801321).		52	6	6	5	34	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		2296-6463		FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ	Front.

Observed meteorological drought trends in Bangladesh identified with the Effective Drought Index (EDI)	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						EDI; Meteorological drought; Drought occurrence and severity; Onset and ending; Agricultural loss; Barind tract; Teesta floodplain; Bangladesh	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANN-KENDALL; CROPPING SEASONS; WATER-RESOURCES; RAINFALL TRENDS; WESTERN PART; RICE; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; ADAPTATION	Countries dependent on small-scale agriculture, such as Bangladesh, can be vulnerable to the effects of climate change and variability. Changes in the occurrence and severity of drought are an important part of this issue and form the subject of this paper. We examined the characteristics of meteorological drought occurrence and severity using the Effective Drought Index (EDI), including the drought events, drought chronology, onset and ending of drought, consecutive drought spells, drought frequency, intensity and severity, using North-Bengal of Bangladesh as a case study. The rainfall and temperature dataset of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) for the study region throughout 1979-2018 is utilised. The trends of drought are detected by using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen Slope estimation. We evaluated the performance of EDI using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), historical drought records and rice production. This study finds that seasonal and annual droughts have become more frequent over the period studied in all seasons except the pre-monsoon. In addition, the largest decrease in seasonal EDI is found in the monsoon, both in the Teesta floodplain and Barind tract regions. In the decades prior to the late 2000s, a drought spell typically starts between March and May (+/- 15 days) and ends with the monsoonal rainfall in June/July. In the years since the late 2000s, monsoon and postmonsoon droughts spells have significantly increased. Overall, the peak intensity of droughts are higher in the Barind tract than in the Teesta floodplain, and the frequency and severity of moderate to severe drought are increasing significantly in the Barind tract. The drought frequency has increased by at least 10% in North Bengal of Bangladesh over the periods of 1979-2018. Though EDI is strongly correlated with the SPI index, our analysis shows that, surprisingly, rice production is actually decoupled from meteorological drought (as identified by the EDI and SPI). Hence, this research suggests that there are other significant influences on rice yield beyond meteorological drivers. This could include effects from differing irrigation infrastructure, technology and management strategies in the study regions. Challenges to agricultural production may be exacerbated in coming years, should the identified increasing meteorological drought trends continue.

J	Aziz, R; Yucel, I				Aziz, Rizwan; Yucel, Ismail			Assessing nonstationarity impacts for historical and projected extreme precipitation in Turkey	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Nonstationarity; CORDEX; Precipitation; RCM; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE SIMULATIONS; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; MODEL	The temporal variability in yearly and seasonal extreme precipitation across Turkey is investigated using stationary and nonstationary frequency approach. Four frequency distributions namely, generalized extreme value (GEV), gumbel, normal, and lognormal distributions are used for the historical period (1971-2016) as well as the projection period (2051-2100). The nonstationarity impacts are determined by calculating the percentage difference of return levels (30 years) between stationary and nonstationary cases for both periods. The results are presented as nonstationarity impact maps across Turkey, providing information about the spatial variability of the magnitude of impacts as well as the impact types, i.e., the increase or decrease in return levels of extreme precipitation. For nonstationarity analysis during the projection period, the projected precipitation data is obtained from a 12-member ensemble of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models (RCM) based on the worst emission scenario (RCP8.5). In addition to this, the effects of bias-corrections on stationarities are also investigated for selected RCMs. Performance evaluation of CORDEX ensemble members suggested significant intramodel and intraregion variability in the simulation of historical precipitation. Overall, GEV provided the best fit while normal distribution provided the worst fit to precipitation extremes. However, with a few exceptions, all the distributions exhibited a similar pattern for the historical impacts of nonstationarities across the country. The yearly nonstationarity impacts for the 30-year return level reached 35, 30, 25, and 20% for the Mediterranean, Aegean, Marmara, and Black sea regions, respectively, while a mixed type of nonstationarity impacts was found in Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern Anatolia regions. Moreover, the magnitude and impact type of nonstationarity showed important variations between the seasons. The ensemble analyses of CORDEX-based projected precipitation demonstrated that during the projection period, the nonstationarity impacts are found to be different in magnitude and type as compared to the impacts during the historical period in many regions (particularly in the eastern part of Turkey). The 30-year return levels of extreme precipitations are expected to increase (up to 30%) across Turkey in the yearly, winter, spring, and autumn seasons during the projection period. However, during the same period, the summer extremes in Eastern Anatolia and Mediterranean regions decreased ( up to 30%) with nonstationarity. Projected increases in the precipitation extremes lead to more floods and winter storms, while decreases in the summer precipitations will further dwindle water availability.

This study aimed to assess flood risk using geographic information system-based multi-criteria evaluation techniques in the Wabi Shebele River Sub-basin. Six parameters, namely, soil type, slope, land use and land cover, proximity to rivers, rainfall, and elevation, were used. The eigenvector of weight for each factor was computed in IDRISI Selva 17.0. Results show that the study area was subjected to a very high 527.31 km2 (9.42%), high 2133.66 km2 (38.12%), moderate 1906.44 km2 (34.06%), low 847.35 km2 (15.14%), and a very low 182.54 km2 (3.26%) flood risk, respectively. Results reveal that the Wabi Shebele River Sub-basin is highly vulnerable to flooding. This study assists policymakers with regard to land-use planning. To reduce the effects of flood risk, integrated watershed management must be implemented in the study area.

An Index-Based Method to Assess the Resilience of Urban Areas to Coastal Flooding: The Case of Attica, Greece	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coastal Resilience Index; sea-level rise; coastal resilience assessment; coastal flooding; coastal infrastructure resilience	SEA-LEVEL RISE; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY INDEX; REGIONAL VULNERABILITY; EXTREME; PELOPONNESE; IMPACTS; EVENTS; INDIA	The aim of this study is to assess the resilience of coastal urban areas and their exposure to sea-level rise and coastal flooding, using the proposed Coastal Resilience Index (CResI). The CResI is an innovative combination of diverse characteristics. It includes 19 parameters and is implemented using GIS techniques. The parameters included in the CResI are classified into six category factors (geomorphology, flooding, wave exposition, land use, socioeconomic, and infrastructure/functional). The Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to assign weights and rank the parameters. The framework is tested in the southwest waterfront of the Athens Metropolitan Area in Greece. The study identified that around 25% of the coastal area could be at risk of coastal flooding in the upcoming years, including areas in both the metropolitan and suburban environments. As a result, the need for adaptation measures cannot be overlooked.

Policy and programme measures for disaster response and climate adaptation often perceive women as homogenous, vulnerable groups, instead of addressing underlying structural and conceptual barriers and strengthening their adaptive capacities to disasters and displacement. This article draws upon a political ecology lens to understand gendered recovery processes following disasters across four districts in Assam, northeastern India using empirical research from 2012 to 2018. The findings add nuances to the displacements of women in Assam as being 'climate-induced' by showing the different mechanisms of displacement and how it impacts particular groups of women, as well as their differential ways of coping with these changes. This article draws on sustained long-term qualitative research among rural villagers, particularly women, in Assam where migration is connected to riverbank erosion, exacerbated by the construction of a new embankment, and disrupted due to waterlogging caused by embankments and government relocation schemes in order to construct further dams/embankments.

Ruby			Spatial pattern of lake evaporation increases under global warming linked to regional hydroclimate change	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							WATER AVAILABILITY; LAND MODEL; CLIMATE; RESPONSES; IMPACT; CMIP5	Spatial patterns in lake evaporation increase with global warming are closely linked to regional hydroclimate drying through energetic and aerodynamic effects, according to analyses of ensemble projections of lake and climate models. Lakes are critical natural resources that are vulnerable to climate change. In a warmer climate, lake evaporation is projected to increase globally, but with substantial variation between regions. Here, based on ensemble projections of climate and lake models and an attribution method, we show that future lake evaporation increase is strongly modulated by regional hydroclimate change. Specifically, a drying hydroclimate will amplify evaporation increase by enlarging surface vapor pressure deficit and reducing cloud shortwave reflection. Future lake evaporation increase is amplified in tropical America, the Mediterranean and Southeast China with drier future hydroclimates, and dampened in high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau with wetter future hydroclimates. Such spatially coupled changes in lake evaporation and hydroclimate have important implications on regional lake water balance and volume change, which can aggravate water scarcity and flood risks.

Combining vertical land motion (VLM) with sea-level rise (SLR) projections and storm surge scenarios for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, we quantify the extent of flooding hazards. VLM rates are obtained from GNSS data and InSAR imagery from ALOS and Sentinel-1A/B satellites. VLM is resampled and projected on LIDAR topographic data, then multiple inundation and flooding scenarios are modeled. By the year 2100, over 76 km(2) are projected to subside below sea level. Subsidence increases the area of inundation over SLR alone by up to 39%. Under the worst-case composite scenario of an 8-m storm surge, subsidence, and the SLR RCP8.5, the total affected area is 1,156 km(2). These models enable communities to improve flood resiliency plans.

Spatially, "pockets" of high public concern towards urban flooding were found in areas with low altitude, high percentage of water bodies, and rapid urban construction in recent years. Temporally, public responses tend to peak during the rainstorm period, rather than prior to that. Within a day, behavioural and emotional changes in relation to the rainstorm were most discernable during the morning peak hours. Variations in the response among people of different backgrounds, and the impact of urban flooding on different domains of people's daily life have been revealed. Based on the knowledge gained from this study, policy measures are proposed to increase urban flooding resilience, covering both physical infrastructure and human elements.

We introduce a two-stage OLS approach for nonstationary flood frequency analysis that (i) models changes in their central tendency (median) in response to environmental perturbations with one regression and then (ii) examines changes in the coefficient of variation (Cv) by running a second regression on Anscombe-transformed residuals from the first regression. Monte Carlo simulations show that this approach yields 100-year flood estimates with mean squared errors comparable to estimates made with an advanced generalized linear model-based method. Also, this second-stage regression often produces approximately normal residuals, which permits statistical inferences on Cv trends. Case studies illustrate the dramatic impact that decreasing and increasing Cv trends can have on 100-year floods. Findings motivate the incorporation of trends in variability in infrastructure design along with further research examining asymmetric changes in urban flood variability.

In contrast to the majority of research on weather extremes in sub-Saharan Africa, which focus primarily on how a lack of rainfall causes droughts, this paper aims to elucidate the effect of flooding on harvest failure in rural Burkina Faso. MethodsWe conducted a case study in north-western Nouna, Burkina Faso, between August and December 2021 covering a study population of n = 180 participants. The study comprised four components: (i) interviews with farmers (n = 180) on whether any of their fields had been inundated and if so, on harvest loss on these fields; (ii) determining the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 satellite images to validate study participants reports of floods; (iii) characterizing short-term weather including frequency and duration, of extreme rainfall events within the study area, as well as comparing cumulative rainfall (long-term) over the past 50 years; and (v), estimating both the food energy and economic loss of harvest failure due to flooding. Results49% of interviewed farmers (n = 88) reported that floods had damaged at least one of their fields. Some fields (n = 13, 7%) had no harvest due to flooding, while some farmers (n = 14, 8%) had lost part of their harvest. Images from the Sentinel-2-Satellite indicated that reported and remotely observed flooding were consistent. According to time series of data from the local weather station, there has been an increase irregular rainfall distribution and at the same time of cumulative annual rainfall in Nouna. Furthermore, a first illustrative calculation allowed us to estimate the amount of energy lost when one hectare of a common crop is flooded. ConclusionThis case study demonstrated that flood-related harvest failures leading to crop losses in sub-Saharan Africa, exemplified by Burkina Faso, are likely to be substantial. This study serves as a proof-of-principle for flooding effects on food security. This could provide more detail for agricultural adaptation and mitigation strategies. Inundation-vulnerable fields need alternative and novel management practices, which may only be effectively implemented if agricultural institutions and national policy-making bodies receive evidence of flooding e.g., from remote sensing.

A combined analysis using sea-level data and remote sensing techniques allows the estimation of the current rates of land subsidence and shoreline retreat, supporting the development of quantified relative sea-level projections and flood maps, which are appropriate for specific areas. This study focuses on the coastal plain of Tavoliere delle Puglie (Apulia, Southern Italy), facing the Adriatic Sea. In this area, land subsidence is mainly caused by long-term tectonic movements and sediment compaction driven by high anthropogenic pressure, such as groundwater exploitation and constructions of buildings. To assess the expected effects of relative sea-level rise for the next decades, we considered the following multidisciplinary source data: (i) sea-level-rise projections for different climatic scenarios, as reported in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, (ii) coastal topography from airborne and terrestrial LiDAR data, (iii) Vertical Land Movement (VLM) from the analysis of InSAR and GNSS data, and (iv) shoreline changes obtained from the analysis of orthophotos, historic maps, and satellite images. To assess the expected evolution of the coastal belt, the topographic data were corrected for VLM values, assuming that the rates of land subsidence will remain constant up to 2150. The sea-level-rise projections and expected flooded areas were estimated for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, corresponding to low and high greenhouse-gas concentrations, respectively. From our analysis, we estimate that in 2050, 2100, and 2150, up to 50.5 km(2), 118.7 km(2) and 147.7 km(2) of the coast could be submerged, respectively, while beaches could retreat at rates of up to 5.8 m/yr. In this area, sea-level rise will be accelerated by natural and anthropogenic land subsidence at rates of up to -7.5 +/- 1.7 mm/yr. Local infrastructure and residential areas are thus highly exposed to an increasing risk of severe inundation by storm surges and sea-level rise in the next decades.

However, little work has explored the relative impacts of natural and human-induced changes on the natural balance of these delta systems. This study explores the overall influences of intensive human interventions (e.g., dam constructions, sand excavations, and land reclamations) on the relative mean sea level (RMSL) changes in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China. The analysis uses long-term measurements based on monthly averaged RMSL in 26 stations and reproduces the RMSL that would have occurred in the absence of large-scale human interventions by means of a simple bivariate linear regression model. Generally, we observe that the RMSL dynamics can be categorized into three distinct types, descending, ascending and fluctuant, according to the Mann-Kendall trend test. The analysis shows that the RMSL in the upper and central parts of the PRD displays a significant descending tendency owing to the deepening of the channels, which is primarily attributed to large-scale sand excavation. In contrast, for stations near the outlets, we observed an ascending tendency in RMSL that can be attributed to the combined effects of both the rise in global sea level and channel extension due to large-scale land reclamations. The regression model confirms that the human interventions have greater impacts in the upper and central parts of the PRD that feature river-dominated dynamics, compared with the lower parts of the PRD that are characterized by tide dominated dynamics. In addition, the simulated results display a marked seasonal alteration in the RMSL: the alteration induced by human interventions is apparently greater during the flood season than it is during the dry season. The proposed method used here to quantify the impacts of both natural and human-induced interventions on the RMSL is particularly useful for setting scientific guidelines for water managements (e.g., flood control and salt intrusion prevention) and regulation projects (e.g., dam constructions and land reclamation) in river deltas.

The 2015 Chileno Valley glacial lake outburst flood, Patagonia	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						GLOF; Glacial lake; Paraglacial response; Patagonia	MORAINE-DAMMED LAKE; NORTHERN PATAGONIA; CATASTROPHIC DRAINAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RETREAT; HAZARDS; NORTE; RECESSION; SATELLITE; ICEFIELD	Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) have become increasingly common over the past century in response to climate change, posing risks for human activities in many mountain regions. In this paper we document and reconstruct the sequence of events and impact of a large GLOF that took place in December 2015 in the Chileno Valley, Patagonia. Hydrograph data suggests that the flood continued for around eight days with an estimated total discharge of 105.6 x 10(6) m(3) of water. The sequence of events was as follows: (1) A large debris flow entered the lake from two steep and largely non-vegetated mountain gullies located northeast of the Chileno Glacier terminus. (2) Water displaced in the lake by the debris flow increased the discharge through the Chileno Lake outflow. (3) Lake and moraine sediments were eroded by the flood. (4) Eroded sediments were redistributed downstream by the GLOF. The post-GLOF channel at the lake outlet widened in some places by >130 m and the surface elevation of the terrain lowered by a maximum of 38.8 +/- 1.5 m. Farther downstream, large amounts of entrained sediment were deposited at the head of an alluvial plain and these sediments produced an similar to 340 m wide fan with an average increase in surface elevation over the pre-GLOF surface of 4.6 +/- 1.5 m. We estimate that around 3.5 million m(3) of material was eroded from the flood-affected area whilst over 0.5 million m(3) of material was deposited in the downstream GLOF fan. The large debris flow that triggered the GLOF was probably a paraglacial response to glacier recession from its Little Ice Age limits. We suggest that GLOFs will continue to occur in these settings in the future as glaciers further recede in response to global warming and produce potentially unstable lakes. Detailed studies of GLOF events are currently limited in Patagonia and the information presented here will therefore help to inform future glacial hazard assessments in this region.

To reverse this trend, awareness of flood risk among the population is required to support flood risk management policies and improve flood preparedness. However, empirical studies on the drivers of flood risk perceptions conducted thus far have reported mixed and contradictory results. The aim of this study is to provide insights into the factors that influence perceptions of various dimensions of flood risk to draw lessons to guide flood risk communication strategies. We test a variety of hypotheses of possible factors of influence on flood risk perceptions that are motivated by theoretical concepts and previous empirical studies, whilst also controlling for socio-demographic variables. A representative sample of 2,976 residents answered our survey assessing the role that past flood experiences and risk communication play in shaping flood risk perceptions. Besides exploring flood risk perceptions more robustly, this large sample also facilitates the systematic study of 'don't know' answers, which are often dismissed as missing data in many studies. Rather in this study we analyze what 'don't know' answers reflect in terms of knowledge about particular dimensions of flood risk. The study finds that older people, as well as those who have higher levels of income and education, are significantly more likely to express their flood risk perceptions, respondents who are unable to answer the questions on flood risk perceptions face a lower flood risk, report to have been living in their neighbourhood for a shorter period of time and have less first-hand flood experience. Previous studies might thus be biased by an implicit selection effect. Finally, we show that findings are highly dependent on other explicit choices made by researchers, including the apparently self-fulfilling impact of selecting one explanatory framework over another. New insights emerge from the role that information campaigns and social vulnerability play in the ability to answer the questions. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for improving flood risk communication policies, specifically increasing the frequency of communication, ensuring that campaigns are focused in terms of the content they provide and the subgroups of the population they target.

J	Zhong, S; Cheng, Q; Huang, CR; Wang, Z				Zhong Shuang; Cheng Qiu; Huang Cun-Rui; Wang Zhe			Establishment and validation of health vulnerability and adaptation indices under extreme weather events on the basis of the 2016 flood in Anhui province, China	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Climate extreme events; China; Diarrhea; Flood; Health vulnerability and adaptation	BACILLARY DYSENTERY; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; DISEASE; BURDEN; IMPACT	Climate change could intensify extreme weather events, such as flooding, which amplifies the public health threat of waterborne diseases. Thus, assessing health vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) could facilitate nationally effective responses to extreme climate events. However, related studies are still negligible, and the assessment urgently needs to be validated with actual health data after extreme weather events. We established health V&A indices through literature review and factor analyses. Then, we separately mapped the spatial distribution of flood exposure, social and public health sensitivity, and adaptive capacity before the 2016 flood in Anhui province and compared it with post-flood diarrhea risks by using the geographic information system method to assess health vulnerability. Finally, we validated the indices by exploring the relationship between health V&A indices and post-flood diarrhea risks by using the quantile regression model. Results revealed that health V&A can be framed and categorized as key components of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The remarkable differences in the spatial distribution of health vulnerability were generally consistent with the demographic sensitivity, geographic flooding exposure, and post-flood diarrhea risks in Anhui. In addition, health V&A indices exerted significant positive impacts on infectious diarrhea post-flooding at all quantiles and were significant across different percentiles. Moreover, the impacts of flood exposure on total infectious diarrhea were high and continuous, whereas the impacts of sensitivity were not obvious in the flood's early stage (Coeff = 0.643; p < 0.001) but high in the flood's middle (Coeff = 0.997; p < 0.001) and late stages (Coeff = 0.975; p < 0.001). However, the impacts of adaptive capacity were heterogeneous and high in the flood's early stage (Coeff = 0.665; p < 0.001 at the 25th percentile) and late stage (Coeff = 1.296; p < 0.001 at the 75th percentile) but were insignificant at the 50th percentile. This study contributed validated three-layered health V&A indices with 30 indicators and identified that the impacts of the key components on post-flood waterborne-disease risks are heterogeneous. For instance, local public health sensitivity and adaptive capacity are insufficient to reduce these risks in the long run. This study could be used to project population health risks after extreme weather events and thereby contributes to local government planning of health adaptation.

It disrupts agricultural production, threatening food production, increases the severity of floods and droughts and impacts on soil biology and biogeochemical cycling. This review describes the different processes and manifestations of erosion on arable land and the availability of global data. It points out that while there is a good understanding of the processes of erosion, the causes are complex and even if agronomic and landscape solutions are available, their implementation is challenging and needs tailored approaches to account for the specific local socio-economic, political, and institutional contexts.

The challenges of dynamic vulnerability and how to assess it	ISCIENCE			English	Article							SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROUGHT VULNERABILITY; RISK PERCEPTION; DISASTER RISK; HAZARD RISK; STORM-SURGE; FLOOD; COMPOUND; SCIENCE	Recent disasters have demonstrated the challenges faced by society as a result of the increasing complexity of disaster risk. In this perspective article, we discuss the complex interactions between hazards and vulnerability and suggest methodological approaches to assess and include dynamics of vulnerability in our risk assessments, learning from the compound and multi-hazard, socio-hydrology, and socio-ecological research communities. We argue for a changed perspective, starting with the circumstances that determine dynamic vulnerability. We identify three types of dynamics of vulnerability: (1) the underlying dynamics of vulnerability, (2) changes in vulnerability during long-lasting disasters, and (3) changes in vulnerability during compounding disasters and societal shocks. We conclude that there is great potential to capture the dynamics of vulnerability using qualitative and model-based methods, both for reproducing historic and projecting future dynamics of vulnerability. We provide examples using narratives, agent-based models, and system dynamics.

This limits the ability to accurately forecast flood crests and issue hazard warnings. Here we utilize directly measured datasets acquired for streamflow estimation to develop a data-driven forecasting algorithm that does not require conventional physically-based modeling. We test the potential of our algorithm using measurements acquired at an index-velocity gaging station on the Illinois River, USA, between 2014 and 2019. We find that the forecasting protocol is able to deliver short-term predictions of flood crest magnitude and arrival time. The algorithm produces better agreement with larger events and is more reliable for single-peak storms possibly due to the prominence of hysteretic behavior in such events. We conclude that flood hazard can be forecast using directly measured index-velocity and stage alone.

More often than not, such infrastructure building is legitimized as an urgent technical intervention-while less attention is paid to the distribution of costs and benefits among the affected population. However, as this article shows, adaptation interventions may directly or indirectly result in the relocation or even eviction of households or communities, thereby increasing vulnerabilities for some while intending to reduce long-term climate vulnerabilities for all. We argue that this raises serious, if underappreciated, ethical issues that need to be more explicitly addressed in adaptation policy making. We illustrate our conceptual argument with the help of three examples of infrastructural 'climate buffers': Space for the River projects in the Netherlands, the Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan and the coastal protection plan in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Opportunities for crowdsourcing in urban flood monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Urban hydrology; Flooding; Crowdsourced data; Data integration	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL MEDIA; EXTREME; EVENTS; INUNDATION	Flooding is the most common natural hazard, leading to property damage, injuries, and death. Despite the potential for major consequences, urban flooding remains difficult to forecast, largely due to a lack of data availability at fine spatial scales and associated predictive capabilities. Crowdsourcing of public webcams, social media, and citizen science represent potentially important data sources for obtaining fine-scale hydrological data, but also raise novel challenges related to data reliability and consistency. We provide a review of literature and analysis of existing databases regarding the availability and quality of these unconventional sources that then drives a discussion of their potential to support fine-grained urban flood modelling and prediction. Our review and analysis suggest that crowdsourced data are increasingly available in urban contexts and have considerable potential. Integration of crowdsourced data could help ameliorate quality and completeness issues in any one source. Yet, substantial weaknesses and challenges remain to be addressed.

Although most of the adaptation work in Virginia has focused on urban economic centers, the majority of the coastline is rural and faces different threats and opportunities to address them compared to urban areas due to their reduced economic assets and their reliance on private infrastructure. In this case study, we assess the potential for geospatially quantifying impact to septic systems and adjacent water ways due to sea level rise. The case study found that the data necessary to reliably quantify these impacts on a state-wide scale are lacking and collection of that information needs to be prioritized given the potential for extensive sea level impacts.

The potential of this directive to integrate relevant policy areas and deliver catchment-based measures may however be undermined by sectoral laws and policies in the Member States. This article focuses on the legal issues affecting the integration of catchment-based measures for managing flood risk in three relevant policy areas, namely, energy (in the form of hydropower production), agriculture, and forestry, in Sweden. The results show that that the present legal frameworks not only can restrict attempts to introduce catchment-based measures through compulsory means, but in some cases can also encumber collaborative and voluntary initiatives. It is therefore important to reinforce the catchment perspective in the processes leading to the adoption of flood risk management plans, in terms of assessing flood risks, evaluating measures and engaging stakeholders.

This paper reports on the catastrophic floods in western Japan in 2018. Continuous rainfall resulted in catastrophic floods, leading to 212 deaths, damage to more than 2000 houses and 619 geological disasters in 31 prefectures. The causes and contributing factors of these catastrophic floods are analyzed. The analysis of the causes of typical natural hazards provides an important lesson for hazard prevention and management. To adapt to climate change and prevent natural hazards in the future, the preliminary investigation and sustainable perspective analysis in this paper suggest the importance of the construction of a spongy city and the establishment of an early warning system with the help of information science and artificial intelligence technologies (ISAIT); we also highlight the urgent need to improve and strengthen the management of infrastructure.

IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						El Nino phenomenon; Data mining; Sequential pattern mining; Pattern visualization	CLIMATE; PREFIXSPAN	El Nino phenomenon starts with an increase in the temperature of the sea surface in the equatorial zone of the Pacific Ocean. This increase is characterized by the arrival of a superficial mass of warm waters into the sea, which generates anomalous climate changes on land. These unusual events can be floods, droughts, intense rains, which endanger the urban population and infrastructure of cities. To be able to launch early warnings of possible catastrophic events in populated areas, it is necessary to know how and within how long the change in sea temperature impacts on continental characteristics. The present work describes a computational process based on techniques of extraction and visualization of sequential patterns to capture temporal variations of the variables describing the El Nino phenomenon. Results show the existence of correlations between the sea surface temperature and the flow of the rivers of the coast. These correlations can be used as monitoring tools for early warning releases.

Non-stationary frequency models integrate trends and climate variability by introducing covariates in the distribution parameters. These models often assume that the distribution function and shape of the distribution do not change. However, these assumptions are rarely verified in practice. We propose here an approach based on L-moment ratio diagrams to analyze changes in the distribution function and shape parameter of hydro-climate extremes. We found that important changes occur in the distribution of annual maximum streamflow and extreme temperatures. Eventual relations between the shapes of the distributions of extremes and climate indices are also identified. We provide an example of a non-stationary frequency model applied to flood flows. Results show that a model with a shape parameter dependent on climate indices in combination with a scale parameter dependent on time improves significantly the goodness-of-fit.	[Ouarda, Taha B. M.

In the past, Egypt experienced rainfall over time. Although Egypt is still classified as a low-precipitation country, it can experience extreme rainfall events, resulting in flash floods. Many fragile materials related to heritage building facades may be affected by the change in rainfall rates without any risk assessment plan. This research aims to confront the hazards of raindrop strikes, as the need for making a risk management plan has arisen in order to preserve heritage buildings from heavy rainfall. The research methodology uses the ABC risk assessment quantitative method in addition to experts' multi-round assessments and tornado diagrams to analyze the magnitude of risks in order to create a risk assessment plan for a group of heritage buildings in Historic Cairo as a pilot study that can be generalized for similar cases. The final output is framed into a cause-and-effect model for rainfall risk problem solving, generated by rainfall risk causes and effects on the heritage building facades.

A new study shows that the terrestrial water cycle in Brazil has been mostly drying or accelerating, aligned with changes in rainfall, water use, and forest cover. Increasing floods and droughts are raising concerns of an accelerating water cycle, however, the relative contributions to streamflow changes from climate and land management have not been assessed at the continental scale. We analyze streamflow data in major South American tropical river basins and show that water use and deforestation have amplified climate change effects on streamflow extremes over the past four decades. Drying (fewer floods and more droughts) is aligned with decreasing rainfall and increasing water use in agricultural zones and occurs in 42% of the study area. Acceleration (both more severe floods and droughts) is related to more extreme rainfall and deforestation and occurs in 29% of the study area, including southern Amazonia. The regionally accelerating water cycle may have adverse global impacts on carbon sequestration and food security.	[Chagas, Vinicius B.

In this regard, this paper presents a distribution system planning model to improve the system resilience against hurricane. A scenario-based mathematical model is proposed to capture the random nature of weather events. Moreover, a stochastic optimization model is developed to simultaneously harden the distribution lines and place different types of distributed generation (DG) units such as microturbines (MTs), wind turbines (WTs), and photovoltaic cells (PVs). The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used as a risk index to manage the system risk against different failure scenarios. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that can be solved by various commercial solvers. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is implemented on the IEEE 33 bus system, and various case studies are defined. The results show the effectiveness of our mathematical model in improving the distribution system resiliency and managing the system risk.

An international (Canada-France) questionnaire study was conducted among 190 people, approximately half of whom lived on New Brunswick's Acadian Coast and half on France's west coast. The results highlight, on the one hand, the residents' strong relationship with their coastal living environment and, on the other, a representation of coastal risks as an important area of concern for them. That said, the worry concerning these risks varied among the participants. The local and cultural context (media coverage of this issue and the country-specific risk management strategies) may explain the differences in attitude between the two countries.

JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA			English	Article							GLACIATIONS; UTTARAKHAND; CHRONOLOGY; VALLEY; SYSTEM	The upper catchment of Dhauli Ganga valley (Chamoli district) in Uttarakhand Himalaya recently witnessed a large snow avalanche on the night of 23(rd) April 2021 along the Indo-Tibet border. This event followed the 7(th) February 2021 Rishi Ganga (debris flow induced) flash flood within less than three months. This note analyses the plausible causes of the avalanche using pre-disaster field survey data, supported by the limited geological and remote sensing based geomorphological investigations as the site could not be investigated due to remoteness of the location and travel restrictions due to COVID pandemic. The present observations suggest that active and relict cirques to the north of the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) are the sites for potential snow and debris avalanches under the projected warming trends in the western Himalaya. Particularly, the study calls for climate change adaptation measures in the climate sensitive Trans Himalayan region and optimize anthropogenic activities in order to safeguard the lives and vital infrastructure.

A key challenge is the integration of the social into socio-hydrological logic. To date, most studies have excluded the potential outcomes of policy changes based on socio-hydrology models. The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical framework that extends the current debates in socio-hydrology around the concept of social justice. Social justice considers and reflects on the question of fairness in the allocation of resources, participation, and wealth across residents of a river basin. This critical review elucidates the role of social justice in flood risk management by considering the possible consequences of including social justice and by proposing how to integrate those consequences into the current socio-hydrology model. As such, the review contributes to the ongoing discussion of human-environment interaction in socio-hydrology.

Not only should these be better understood, but there is also a necessity to improve the assessment of their impacts. Flooding is one of the most common powerful impacts of these storms. Analyzing the impacts of floods is essential in order to delineate damaged areas and study the economic cost of hurricane-related floods. This paper presents an automated processing chain for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This processing chain is based on the S1-Tiling algorithm and the normalized difference ratio (NDR). It is able to download and clip S1 images on Sentinel-2 tiles footprints, perform multi-temporal filtering, and threshold NDR images to produce a mask of flooded areas. Applied to two different study zones, subject to hurricanes and cyclones, this chain is reliable and simple to implement. With the rapid mapping product of EMS Copernicus (Emergency Management Service) as reference, the method confers up to 95% accuracy and a Kappa value of 0.75.

Ground-based remote sensing with rapidness and flexibility has been widely used in evaluating rice growth, but less attention has been paid to predicting physiological maturity. A field experiment with rice was conducted to investigate the effects of water saving irrigation on physiological maturity based on hyperspectral data. The results indicated that, with higher coefficients of determination (R-2 = 0.93 and 0.87, respectively), higher residual prediction deviation (RPD = 3.54 and 2.58, respectively) and lower root mean square error (RMSE = 2.88 and 4.43, respectively) among the tested models, R-1654/R-662 and R-546/R-562 were suggested as the optimal indexes for monitoring relative water content in rice panicle under flooding and wetting conditions, respectively. This finding is helpful in providing reference for monitoring rice physiological maturity.

An attempt has been undertaken in this research to identify crucial zones in the Idukki district that are more susceptible to flooding. The AHP technique was used to give relative weights to 12 flood contributing parameters. The resultant flood susceptibility map shows that 1346.4 km(2) of the total land in the Idukki district has a high to very high likelihood of flooding. Validation of the resultant map was achieved using the AUC-ROC approach, which showed good accuracy of 0.91.

The roles of flood magnitude and duration in controlling channel width and complexity on the Green River in Canyonlands, Utah, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Channel change; Streamflow regulation; Climate change; Sediment transport	FLAMING GORGE DAM; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; FLUVIAL ADJUSTMENTS; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; RIO-GRANDE; NEW-MEXICO; COLORADO; DOWNSTREAM; SAND; TAMARISK	Predictions of river channel adjustment to changes in streamflow regime based on relations between mean channel characteristics and mean flood magnitude can be useful to evaluate average channel response. However, because these relations assume equilibrium sediment transport, their applicability to cases where streamflow and sediment transport are decoupled may be limited. These general relations also lack the specificity that is required to connect specific characteristics of the streamflow and sediment regime with the dynamics of channel morphological change that create channel complexity, which is often of ecological interest. We integrate historical records of channel change, observations of scour and fill during a snowmelt flood, measurements of sediment transport, and predictions from a two-dimensional streamflow model to describe how annual peak flow magnitude and peak-flow duration interact with the upstream sediment supply to control channel form for a 15-km study reach on the regulated Green River in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Two major decadal-scale episodes of channel narrowing have occurred within the study area. For each of these episodes, the reduction in average channel width was consistent with the change predicted by hydraulic geometry relations as a function of average flood magnitude. However, channel narrowing occurred during periods of exceptionally low annual floods. The most recent episode of channel narrowing occurred between 1988 and 2009, during low-flow cycles when the 5-yr mean peak flow was less than 60% of the long-term (1959-2016) mean peak flow. These findings, together with findings from previous studies, demonstrate that decreases in peak-flow magnitude caused by streamflow regulation, climate change, or a combination of those factors have driven episodes of channel narrowing on the Green River. Observations of streamflow, sediment-transport, and morphologic change coupled with predictions from a two-dimensional streamflow model indicate that peak flow magnitudes of at least 75% of the long-term mean peak flow are required to transport bed-material sand in suspension in all regions of the multi-thread channel and that the similar to 2-month duration of the snowmelt flood played an important role in creating conditions necessary to maintain channel conveyance. These results indicate that detailed characterizations of channel response such as these are needed to predict how river channels will respond to changes in streamflow regime that affect annual peak flow magnitude and duration.

New Emphasis on Water Transparency as Socio-Ecological Indicator for Urban Water: Bridging Ecosystem Service Supply and Sustainable Ecosystem Health	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						urban green-blue space; recreational lake area; oxbow lake restoration; Secchi depth; threshold light requirement; phytoplankton; aquatic plants; climate change	MACROPHYTE STRATIOTES-ALOIDES; LAKE BALATON HUNGARY; SECCHI DISK DEPTH; LONG-TERM CHANGES; SHALLOW LAKES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES; PLANKTOTHRIX-RUBESCENS; PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES; ECOLOGICAL QUALITY	The perspective on water transparency changed since the early days of limnology from being a physical parameter of optical water property to an ecological indicator tracking algal turbidity due to eutrophication or an overall success of sustained lake restoration in the late 60ies to 80ies. In modern cities, where ecosystems are commonly deteriorated by man-made modifications, water transparency offers a great opportunity to the public to raise socio-ecological consciousness concerning urban green-blue spaces. We thus re-emphasize water transparency as a key indicator of multi-functional value when assessing an oxbow lake of the riverine floodplain in Vienna, the Alte Donau. Our study covers the eutrophication from 1987 to 1994 due to the inclusion of the riverine landscape in the urban area, the following lake restoration with an ecosystem shift from a nutrient-rich, algal-turbid water body to a nutrient-poor, clear-water macrophyte controlled system and the impact of global warming in recent decades. We used light attenuation profiles to identify depth layers of specific ambient light requirements for photosynthetic domains (phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes), and to interpret Secchi measurements. Here, we calculated the depth at 1% (minimum light requirements for phytoplankton growth as euphotic depth), 3% (minimum light requirements for macrophytes as maximum macrophyte colonization depth), and 12% (preferred light requirements for phytoplankton development) of surface ambient light. A Secchi disk water transparency of 1.5 m ("lake bottom view"), judged as good water quality by human perception, refers to mesotrophic conditions with a maximum colonization depth for macrophytes exceeding the mean lake depth in Alte Donau. Water clarity required for sustained macrophyte growth, in particular for favoring bottom-dwellingCharameadows instead of tall-growingMyriophyllum spicatum, is 3.5 m Secchi depth and thus exceeds by far water clarity requested due to bathing aesthetics. Global warming, mirrored by an advanced warming in spring seems to favor significantly a higher yield of macrophytes mainly built up byMyriophyllumat the expense of the yield of algae. The prolongation of the summer period above 21 degrees C, however, coincides with lowered Secchi transparency. Water visibility during the hot season thus seems to be slightly hampered against lake restoration efforts by global warming.

In order to overcome the reduction of oxygen, plants activate coping mechanisms and strategieS.Prunus spp. are hypoxia-sensitive woody species and although many information has been gathered over the last decades, many physiological mechanisms remain unclear. To verify whether anoxic plant responses are also regulated by photoperiod, plants of Mr.S.2/5-WT plum, and its variant genotypes S.4 tolerant (plus) and S.1 sensitive (minus) to flooding, were grown in a greenhouse and were submitted to natural photoperiod (NP) and to constant photoperiod (CP) from mid-July until the first 10 days of October. From mid-September plants from each genotype, grown under the two photoperiods, were divided into two groups, and one of them underwent long-term flooding. Gas exchange parameters, energetic and biochemical activities, leaf chlorophyll contents, and stress symptoms were measured at different times, whereas soluble sugars were quantified in leaves and roots 14 days after flooding, when stress symptoms in WT and S.1 became prominent. Seasonal changes in the photoperiod played a role in the adaptability to anoxia, although flooding stress response differed among the three genotypes.Anoxia affected leaf gas exchange and S.4 flooded-leaves retained higher ACO(2) under conditions of NP and CP. Leaf soluble sugar concentration differed among genotypeS.Regardless the photoperiod, S.4 anoxic-leaf sugar concentration was the lowest, except for sorbitol. S.4 anoxic-roots under CP accumulated the highest levels of sucrose and sorbitol. Influences of the photoperiod were observed in WT and S.1 anoxic-leaves, whereas S.1 anoxic roots accumulated the lowest concentration of sugars, regardless of photoperiod. Leaf and root respiratory activity in flooded plants was highest in S.4, and ADH activity increased in all flooded plants under CP but the highest activity was observed only in S.1 under NP during flooding. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that the S.4 genotype has a plastic adaptability to flooding stress, escaping from the photoperiod regulatory cross-talk system, and can better cope with the new scenarios generated by climate changes.

Blue-green measures have been recognised as a sustainable solution and a necessary complement to pipe-bound approaches. The aim of this study is to identify barriers and drivers in the implementation of blue-green measures in a Swedish context, to increase the understanding of how they could be implemented in a more successful manner. The study is qualitative and based on semi-structured interviews. Through the lens of transition theory, barriers and drivers for blue-green measures were identified and they give an updated picture of Swedish urban stormwater management. Many factors encourage municipal actors to implement blue-green solutions, such as increased need for recreation, protection of biodiversity and climate change. Identified barriers are found within the municipal stormwater management it-self, but can also be found outside the storm water management structure, such as lack of knowledge among politicians, officials, exploiters and civilians, fragmented roles and responsibilities in general, as well as uncertainty of the effects and cost of new alternatives. The study has three main findings; Several barriers were mentioned by most of the interviewees clearly show that a wide range of changes are needed to alter the current stormwater management regime; Niche innovations are often put forward as a way to enhance socio-technical transition, but this study is that such an approach is oversimplified instead elaborated suggestions for an alteration of urban stormwater management is given, both with top-down and bottom-up perspective. For the success of blue-green solutions, educational efforts are important at different levels in the planning, building and maintenance process of blue-green solutions. Therefore, employees must have a good general knowledge of both blue and green issues as well as having contacts in the different sectors of the municipality. To conclude we argue that a transition can not only be induced by pilot projects but requires change in legal structures as well as altered financing models for blue-green solutions. Moreover, the ongoing, but slow, change should therefor probably be interpreted as a shift to a new regime, but rather an evolutionary transition where new approaches are combined with traditional, pipe-bound solutions.

Part of these losses can be minimized with the help of different methodologies and tools used to prepare simulations, analyses, and data monitoring to predict such phenomena in time. The metropolitan area of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, is the study area of this paper and it is located in Floresti, the largest rural settlement in Romania. In this area, changes in urbanization, land use, and the expansion of urban areas in a chaotic mode represent a problem. This study focuses on an area prone to flooding due to its proximity to the Somes River. Previous events of this type have caused economic losses that must be considered. This approach combines photogrammetric methods for obtaining data from the field with topographical methods for establishing control points and GIS methods for data processing, modeling, and simulation to obtain the necessary data for flood prevention and intervention.

An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is conducted to develop a risk assessment index system, determining the relative severity of different hazardous events. This study adopts the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) to estimate road user delay and associated costs under simulated rainfall scenarios by the Synthetic Storm Pattern Generator (SSPG). A case study showed that flash flooding incurs over 2.89 million United States dollars/km risks to road users in 20 years. Retrofitting the impervious catchments with permeable pavements was found to reduce risks by 77 % and the drainage pipe diameter affects flood duration most. The proposed method can be used to evaluate flash flood risks to users for any road and to develop efficient risk treatment measures.

This paper reports results on this issue obtained within the framework of subproject 6 of the DFG research group SPATE (Space-Time Dynamics of Extreme Floods). The analyses use an extensive dataset of flood observations at rivers and complementary information to determine and explain significant changes in flood probabilities. The data show that the flood-rich periods of the last 500 years in Europe have been significantly colder than usual. Over the last 60 years, the number of flood-rich periods in north-western Europe has increased. This increase is due to more intense precipitation. In medium-sized and large catchments of southern and eastern Europe, on the other hand, lower soil moisture and less snow cover have led to decreasing flood probabilities. These results are intended as a basis for more reliable design flood estimates in a changing world.

Pakistan experienced devastating flooding, leading to numerous fatalities, extensive destruction of homes, and millions of displaced or otherwise affected individuals. Using survey data from households in Chitral District, we apply indicators from the literature on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to generate actual vulnerability scores for households. We then determine household-level risk as a function of vulnerability and hazard. Finally, we employ Kruskal-Wallis one-way variance analysis to measure the association between household risk and flood impact in terms of both agricultural and non-agricultural losses. The findings indicate that loss due to floods is not a random function of nature's impact; instead, households with higher levels of risk also face higher agricultural and non-agricultural losses. These results emphasize the importance of addressing underlying risk factors to reduce household vulnerability rather than simply responding to post-crisis emergencies.

The state-of-the-art hydrological climate-impact model chain consists of one or more global climate models, downscaling and bias-correction techniques, and one or more hydrological models. Machine learning offers a complementary approach to hydrological climate-impact modelling by facilitating direct downscaling from large-scale atmospheric variables to streamflow. This paper presents the development of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks benchmarked against regression tree models for reconstruction of daily streamflow and floods from atmospheric reanalysis data with comparable resolution to global climate model outputs. Catchment-specific, physically-based input features representing the dominant flood drivers were identified for 27 catchments in Norway. Overall, the LSTM obtained the highest accuracy. This article provides a springboard for future research on hydrological climate-impact modelling with neural networks in high-latitude countries.

Heatwave-preconditioned hourly precipitation extremes in the Yangtze River Valley are typical of the latter situation. Fueled by soaring convective energy after heatwaves' passage, hourly precipitation extremes are heavier, intensifying faster, and more concentrated during afternoon to evening, compared to those not proceeded by heatwaves. Consequently, flash flood-producing events (e.g., 50 mm/hr or stronger) account for larger fractions in preconditioned events than in the non-preconditioned group, with the spectrum difference further exaggerated by warming. This drives the frequency increase in potentially high-impact events several-fold larger than expected from the widely-adopted univariate perspective. These results point to heatwave-preconditioned hourly precipitation extremes as an emerging hazard of climate change carrying greater flash flood risks.

Additional risk is posed in developing countries, where access to sanitation is not universal. Few studies assess the flood risk to the sanitation-health nexus. Therefore, this study aims to present a theoretical and general framework for assessing the resilience of flood-sanitation-public health nexus in urban environments, composed by risk estimation and risk management assessment. The framework was developed from a system analysis approach focusing on central supply systems. Regarding risk assessment, the main vulnerability and exposure factors identified were land use, social vulnerability, coverage of sanitation systems, occurrence of waterborne diseases, number of people affected by floods and intersection with the flood map. From the risk management assessment stage three main typologies of trade-offs and synergies were identified: urban territorial planning versus runoff control, water quality versus sanitation infrastructure and flood management policy versus social behavior.

Firstly, the weight of the indicator system is analyzed by the Delphi method and cloud model, and then the urban stormwater recilience evaluation model is constructed by using the cloud model and approximate ideal solution ranking method. Through the fuzzy description, the corresponding quantitative value is given to the qualitative indicator, so that the stormwater resilience of the city can be measured by accurate values. Finally, the feasibility of the model is verified by case analysis. The results show that the urban stormwater resilience evaluation theory and method based on cloud model and approximate ideal solution ranking method have important guiding significance to improve the level of urban stormwater resilience.

Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the Mississippi River flood hazard has been amplified by river engineering. In contrast, the world's largest reservoir group with the Three Gorges Reservoir at its core has been built along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, but the question of whether there has been a positive effect on flood control is worthy of discussion. Here, we revisit nine paleofloods from the ancient stone inscriptions for the first time and show that while annual peak discharge in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is dominated by sunspot numbers and the North Atlantic Oscillation, the magnitude of flooding has been decreased by the reservoir group, which diminished flood hazard through reversing or strengthening the direction of climate control on the flood.

Yet, factors influencing loss, i.e. vulnerability, have gained less attention to date. Vulnerability is defined as the degree of loss resulting from the hazard impact on buildings. Recent studies have focused on evaluating vulnerability to dynamic flooding using proxies from case studies and based on empirical ex-post approaches. However, the transferability to other case studies and, therefore, the ability of such models to actually predict future losses is limited. To overcome this gap, we present a beta model based on loss data from the European Alps, which clearly shows that a single vulnerability function is sufficient to predict losses resulting from different types of torrential hazards and to provide probabilities of destruction under specific scenarios. As a result, the curves are transferable and may significantly increase the predictive power of risk analyses.

The coupling of historic records, sewer network maps, and well bore hydrogeology explains spatial patterns in groundwater elevations. Furthermore, a synthesis of early twentieth century United States census data, and continental scale GIS data demonstrates the potential for groundwater inundation in coastal United States cities that are served by aging sewer infrastructure. Altered groundwater flow dynamics caused by sea level rise, coupled with climatic shifts will likely stress aging sewer infrastructure, and can lead to increased discharge of combined sewer overflow systems and flooding.

The monitoring of the water table amplitude is crucial in a permeable substrate, such as low-lying sandy coasts. In scenarios of sea-level rise (SLR), these environments will be impacted by the direct action of marine flooding and, indirectly, by the rising of the groundwater. In 2018, seasonal monitoring of the water table was carried out at Cassino beach, located on the south Brazilian coast. The Cassino beach is an exposed coast dominated by waves, inserted in a low elevation barrier (Holocene lagoon-barrier system), with a humid subtropical climate and the action of extratropical cyclogenesis. The objectives were to determine the water table variation throughout the year and to identify the main forces that act in the high-frequency fluctuations. The low-cost electronic sensor systems Arduino-based were installed in tubular wells for monitoring. In parallel, indirect surveys were performed using the GPR method. The results demonstrated the significant contribution of the infiltration and recharge pulses in the shallow freshwater lens. The contributions of energy waves and winds in the S quadrant were identified, promoting the stacking of water on the shore. The results also suggest a relationship between the water table depth and the morphology of ridges and swales. The projections performed with the groundwater level from SLR scenarios on the IPCC showed a higher susceptibility of the Cassino beach to direct and indirect floods for the second half of this century. The intensification and increase of the frequency of the storms caused by climate change may result in a situation of urban infrastructure collapse, with the progressive occurrence of compound flooding (rainfall and storm surge).

Breeding climate-resilient wheat (Triticum aestivum I..) genotypes may mitigate adverse effects of ECEs on crop productivity. To reveal crop traits conducive to long-term yield impmvement in the target population of environments, we created 8,192 virtual genotypes with contrasting but realistic ranges of phenology, productivity and waterlogging tolerance. Using these virtual genotypes, we conducted a genotype (G) by environment (E) by management (M) factorial analysis (G x E x M) using locations distributed across the entire cereal cropping zone in mid-China. The GxExM invoked locally-specific sowing dates under future climates that were premised on shared socioeconomic pathways SSPS-8.5, with a time horizon centred on 2080. Across the simulated adaptation landscape, productivity was primarily driven by yield components and phenology (average grain yield increase of 6-69% across sites with optimal combinations of these traits). When incident solar radiation was not limiting carbon assimilation, ideotypes with higher grain yields were characterised by earlier flowering, higher radiation-use efficiency and larger maximum kernel size. At sites with limited solar radiation, crops required longer growing periods to realise genetic yield potential, although higher radiation-use efficiency and larger maximum kernel size were again prospective traits enabling higher rates of yield gains. By 2080, extreme watcrlos . ing stress in some regions of midChina will impact substantially on productivity, with yield penalties of up to 1,010 kg ha(-1). ldcotypes with optimal G x M could mitigate yield penalty caused by waterlogging by up to 15% under future climates. These results help distil promising crop trait by best management practice combinations that enable higher yields and robust adaptation to future climates and more frequent extreme climatic events, including flash flooding and soil waterlogging.

Despite the key role of archaea in soil biogeochemical cycles, the assembly processes and co-occurrence patterns of archaeal communities in coastal wetlands in response to increasing inundation frequencies remain elusive. In this study, we established an in situ mesocosm with an inundation frequency gradient to investigate the response of soil archaeal community toward increasing inundation frequencies in monocultures of Spartina alterniflora and a mangrove species, Kandelia obovata. Both neutral community model and null model analyses suggested that stochastic processes are dominant in governing the archaeal community assembly and that the stochastic processes are enhanced with increasing inundation frequencies. Increasing inundation frequencies significantly increased the community niche width. Moreover, archaeal community in S. alterniflora soil displayed lower niche overlap and higher stochasticity than in K. obovata soil. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the network complexity increases with increase in the inundation frequencies. Soil water content is the most decisive factor influencing the archaeal communities. Overall, we found that increasing inundation frequencies enhance the stochastic processes and network complexity of the soil archaeal community in coastal wetlands. This study could enhance our understanding on the response of soil archaeal communities in coastal wetlands toward global change. IMPORTANCE Coastal wetlands, subjected to regular disturbances by periodic tides, are highly productive and important in the regulation of climate change. However, the assembly mechanisms and co-occurrence patterns of soil archaeal communities in coastal areas remain poorly known, especially for their responses to increasing inundation frequencies. In this study, we aimed at unraveling these uncertainties by studying typical estuarine ecosystems in southern China. We show that increasing inundation frequencies enhance the stochastic processes and network complexity of the soil archaeal community. This study offers a new path for an improved understanding of archaeal community assembly and species coexistence in coastal environments, with a special focus on the role of inundation frequency.

Among all the impacts of these extreme weather events, the consequences to our reliable water supply have gained increasing attention as they exacerbate the inequities in health and education, especially in marginalized populations. In this perspective, we emphasize that extreme weather events are able to undermine a stable supply of drinking water through a number of approaches, and conventional centralized water treatment is insufficient at addressing these challenges. We urge that greater recognition, increased public awareness, and more efforts on technological innovation on decentralized, especially point-of-use (POU), water treatment should be prioritized to better help tackle the challenges faced by increasingly frequent extreme weather events.

Optimum rate and timing of N-application is otherwise important to harvest good quality grain for backing in the recent climate change scenario. Optimum N-rate (NAR) corresponds with the application timing (NAT) has resulted in good quality grains. Aim of the study was to focus on spring wheat grain quality and N use efficiency (NUE) with NAR {i.e., 0, 100, 120, 140 and 160 kg ha(-1)) and NAT (i.e., 100% at sowing (NAR(1)), 50% at sowing and 50% at tillering (NAT(2)), 25% at sowing, 50% at tillering and 25% at booting (NAT(3)) and 25% at sowing, 25% at tillering and 50% at booting (NAT(4))}. Treatment impacts were investigated focusing grain yield, grain-N, and quality parameters (i.e., crude protein, gluten, amylose and amylopectin). Experiment was a randomized complete block, in three replications, conducted at Agronomy Res. Farm of the University of Agric. Peshawar in 2016-17 and repeated in 2017-18. Results showed the highest NUE in 100 kg N ha(-1), followed by a decreasing rate (p<0.05) for every next N-increment. While averaged on N-rates, the highest NUE observed in NAT(3) which did not differ from NAT(4) but decreased (p<0.05) for treatment NAT(2) with lowest for the NAT(1). Pakhtunkhuwa-2015 showed higher NUE among the varieties. Grain-N, grain yield, gluten and amylose did not differ with NAR 140 and 160 kg ha(-1) as well as for the NAT(3) and NAT(4) but decreased for NAT(2) and the lowest was noted for NAT(1). The N-content of wheat grain was highest in Pakhtunkhuwa-2015, followed by Pirsabak-2015 and the lowest in DN-84. Nonetheless, grain amylopectin showed a reduction with increasing NAR and/or split N-applications from one to two and/or three doses. Cultivars did not show any changes in the amylopectin. It is concluded that in recent climate changes where flood irrigation system is practiced, three N-splits (NAT(3) or NAT(4)) resulted higher quality grains with 140 kg N ha(-1) to wheat crop.

J	Hamlet, AF; Byun, K; Robeson, SM; Widhalm, M; Baldwin, M				Hamlet, Alan F.; Byun, Kyuhyun; Robeson, Scott M.; Widhalm, Melissa; Baldwin, Michael			Impacts of climate change on the state of Indiana: ensemble future projections based on statistical downscaling	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article								Using an ensemble of 10 statistically downscaled global climate model (GCM) simulations, we project future climate change impacts on the state of Indiana (IN) for two scenarios of greenhouse gas concentrations (a medium scenario-RCP4.5 and a high scenario-RCP 8.5) for three future time periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s). Relative to a 1971-2000 baseline, the projections show substantial changes in temperature (T) for IN, with a change in the annual ensemble mean T for the 2080s RCP8.5 scenario of about 5.6 degrees C (10.1 degrees F). Such changes also indicate major changes in T extremes. For southern IN, the number of days with daily maximum T above 35 degrees C (95 degrees F) is projected to be about 100 days per year for the 2080s RCP8.5 scenario, as opposed to an average of 5 days for the historical baseline climate. Locations in northern IN could experience 50 days per year above 35 degrees C (95 degrees F) for the same conditions. Energy demand for cooling, as measured by cooling degree days (CDD), is projected to increase nearly fourfold in response to this extreme warming, but heating demand as measured by heating degree days (HDD) is projected to decline by 30%, which would result in a net reduction in annual heating/cooling energy demand for consumers. The length of the growing season is projected to increase by about 30 to 50 days by the 2080s for the RCP8.5 scenario, and USDA hardiness zones are projected to shift by about one full zone throughout IN. By the 2080s, all GCM simulations for the RCP8.5 scenario show higher annual precipitation (P) over the Midwest and IN. Projected seasonal changes in P include a 25-30% increase in winter and spring by the 2080s for the RCP8.5 scenarios and a 1-7% decline in summer and fall P (although there is a low model agreement in the latter two seasons). Rising T is projected to cause systematic decreases in the snow-to-rain ratio from Nov-Mar. Snow is projected to become uncommon in southern IN by the 2080s for the RCP8.5 scenario, and snowfall is substantially reduced in other areas of the state. The combined effects of these changes in T, P, and snowfall will likely result in increased surface runoff and flooding during winter and spring.

In this paper, we propose a new modelling method, LoHy + , which can be applied to efficiently simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of flood inundation with reasonable accuracy. The method integrates a low-fidelity two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model and a mapping module to estimate water depth in a catchment during floods. The performance of the proposed modelling method was evaluated using a real-world catchment of approximate 2,000 km(2), in the Southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The results show that there is a good agreement between flood inundation obtained from the proposed method and that simulated using a high-fidelity 2D hydrodynamic model. The proposed method is much more efficient than the high-fidelity 2D hydrodynamic model, which makes it an alternative method for applications requiring many model runs or long simulation durations. Also, the LoHy+ model has the potential to be applied in flood inundation forecast, flood risk mitigation design water resource management, etc.	[Yang, Qi] Guangdong Res Inst Water Resources & Hydropower, Guangzhou 510610, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qi; Wu, Wenyan; Wang, Q.

In south-east Iceland, a fracture in the mountainside of Svinafellsheioi threatens to cause between 60 and 100 million cubic metres of rock to fall onto the glacier below. A large landslide could break up the surface of the glacier, crash into the proglacial lake, and affect people and infrastructure downhill. In addition to the unprecedented scale, the Svinafellsheioi fracture represents the first time people and infrastructure have been exposed to this type of hazard in Iceland. In this article we examine the role of local knowledge in disaster risk reduction and management for communities that are facing a particular type of hazard for the first time. We argue that even when a community lacks experience with a specific type of hazard, local knowledge can still play a valuable role in hazard identification and risk management.

Here, we focus on a compound event that relates these two hazards; we find that a high percentage of floods are preceded by a heat stress event. The potential impacts are significant, leading to overwhelming the current infrastructure (e.g., damaged roads, hospitals, and power grid) and to a high number of fatalities and economic damage. We show that heat stress is tied to high surface temperatures, sensible heat flux, and humidity, which all tend to enhance convective available potential energy (CAPE) and stormy weather, frequently resulting in flooding. Given that heat stress is projected to become more frequent and intense, our findings point to an associated enhanced risk of flooding throughout this area.

New elevation data triple estimates of global vulnerability to sea-level rise and coastal flooding	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROJECTIONS; MODELS; ICE; MIGRATION; IMPACTS; OCEAN; TIDE	Most estimates of global mean sea-level rise this century fall below 2 m. This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASA's SRTM. Coastal DEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show - employing Coastal DEM-that 190 M people (150-250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, Coastal DEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 250 M below 1 m.

Improved social learning is urgently needed to transform urban water governance and make it more integrated and adaptive. However, empirical studies remain few and fragmented. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse how social learning has supported or inhibited sustainable transformations in urban water governance. On the basis of multiple case studies conducted in urban, flood-prone areas in Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, India, and Sweden, we study learning processes related to different aspects of water management and governance. Our results show that transformations in water governance are often triggered by crises, whereas other potentials for transformation are not tapped into. Furthermore, learning is often inhibited by "lock-ins" created by powerful actors. We conclude that there is a need for more proactive design of governance structures for triple-loop learning that take into account the identified barriers and supporting principles.

Hurricane storm surge in Volusia County, Florida: evidence of a tipping point for infrastructure damage	DISASTERS			English	Article						flooding; infrastructure; resiliency; spatial analysis; storm surge; tipping point	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; COASTAL; DISASTER; KATRINA; COMMUNITY; IMPACT; THREAT	Storm surge often is the most destructive consequence of hurricanes and tropical storms, causing significant economic damage and loss of life. Many coastal communities that are located in high-risk areas vis-a-vis hurricanes and tropical storms are prepared for moderate (between six and eight feet) storm surges. Such preparation, though, is not commensurate with more severe, but less frequent, storm surges (greater than eight feet). These gaps in preparedness have serious implications for community resilience. This paper explores elements of the vulnerability and resilience of coastal communities during major storm surge events, drawing on Volusia County, Florida, United States, as a case study. It simulates the impacts of five hurricanes (Categories I-V) and their associated storm surges on local infrastructure systems, populations, and access to resources. The results suggest that Volusia County is subject to a 'tipping point' , where surge damage from Category IV storms is significantly greater than that from Category III and lower hurricanes.

This study examines flood risk in the Chi watershed, Thailand, using Weekly Moving Cumulative Rainfall (WMCR) data from 1990 to 2021. We employ extreme value copula analysis to assess spatial dependence between meteorological stations in the watershed. Nine bivariate generalized extreme value (BGEV) models were evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Likelihood Ratio test (LRT) to ensure model robustness. The BGEV model revealed higher tail dependence among stations near the bay of the watershed. We also calculated the flood recurrence period to estimate flood events' frequency and potential severity. Stations ST5 (Khon Kaen), ST6 (Tha Phra Khon Kaen), and ST8 (Maha Sarakham) were identified as potential hotspots, with higher probabilities of experiencing extreme rainfall of approximately 200 (mm.) during the rainy season. These findings provide valuable insights for flood management and mitigation strategies in the Chi watershed and offer a methodological framework adaptable to other regions facing similar challenges.

Spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme rainfall: Added benefits with sub-kilometre-resolution climate model simulations?	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						climate models; convection-permitting models; extremes; model evaluation; precipitation; reanalysis; sub-hourly; sub-kilometre	POINT RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE; PROJECTIONS; IMPACT; REGION; END	Local, short-duration extreme precipitation events can cause floodings and have massive economic consequences. The climate change impact on such events is of great interest, but due to the small spatio-temporal scales involved, these are challenging to properly represent in climate models. This study analyses a new sub-kilometre (750 m) HARMONIE-Climate model simulation driven by ERA5 reanalysis data. Three convection-permitting models at 750 m, 3 and 5 km grid distance are analysed and compared with driving reanalyses, intermediate model simulations and a dense rain gauge network. The representation of convective events is analysed by a range of metrics categorised as spatial, temporal and event-focused. Precipitation events are analysed at both hourly and sub-hourly scales and a clear difference between model performance on these scales is found. Overall, we find a better performance for HCLIM750m for most metrics, yet the added benefits of the computationally intensive sub-kilometre scale simulation seems limited compared to the convection-permitting models at 3 and 5 km.

Where should hydrology go? An early-career perspective on the next IAHS Scientific Decade: 2023-2032	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Article						IAHS Scientific Decade; early-career scientists; tipping points; water cycle intensification; water services	INCENTIVIZING FIELD HYDROLOGY; WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; TIPPING POINTS; REGIME SHIFTS; FLASH FLOODS; GLOBAL-SCALE; STORM-SURGE; RIVER-BASIN; BIG DATA	This paper shares an early-career perspective on potential themes for the upcoming International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) Scientific Decade (SD). This opinion paper synthesizes six discussion sessions in western Europe identifying three themes that all offer a different perspective on the hydrological threats the world faces and could serve to direct the broader hydrological community: "Tipping points and thresholds in hydrology," "Intensification of the water cycle," and "Water services under pressure." Additionally, four trends were distinguished concerning the way in which hydrological research is conducted: big data, bridging science and practice, open science, and inter- and multidisciplinarity. These themes and trends will provide valuable input for future discussions on the theme for the next IAHS SD. We encourage other early-career scientists to voice their opinion by organizing their own discussion sessions and commenting on this paper to make this initiative grow from a regional initiative to a global movement.

This study focused on the NDVI characteristics of three different ecosystems and their dominant influencing factors. It proposed a method to show the immediate effects of factors influencing NDVI on a statistical level. The results showed that: (1) NDVI of floodplain wetland > NDVI of meadow > NDVI of sand ribbon. There were obvious differences among the three ecosystems, and the spatial distribution of NDVI was consistent with altitude. (2) The main explanatory factors were the phenological period, humidity, temperature, accumulated precipitation, runoff, and evaporation, which accounted for 68.8% of the total explanation. (3) Phenological period, humidity, and precipitation were positively correlated with NDVI. Temperature and evaporation had a positive effect on NDVI within a certain range. This study revealed the differences in environmental factors in different ecosystems, enriched the theory of NDVI influencing factors, and provided a scientific basis for future NDVI research and regional ecological conservation.

The obtained results can provide support for urban water security and sustainable urban water resource management. The land use change, represented by the expansion of sealed surfaces, has a positive impact on the distribution and the volume of flood in Handan City, while the drainage system has the opposite effect. The flooding distribution changes over decades reveal that flooding risk is reduced in most areas by improved drainage conditions but exacerbated in impervious areas and riversides due to increasing impermeable areas, the rapid draining of pipes, and poor outlet conditions. This study demonstrates how the dual changes in land use and drainage pipeline networks affect urban flooding distribution; we suggest considering land use and the extension of drainage pipelines in future construction.

In-situ rainfall observations retrieved from a number of sources, including national organizations and undigitized data from the colonial era, were used. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to assess product's ability to capture spatial and temporal variability. The results revealed spatial variability of the percentage bias (PBIAS) in the range of -2 to 2%, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) <20%, and correlation coefficient (R-2) >0.88 at most of the locations. The temporal variability in mean PBIAS for 1901-2018 was in the range of -4.5 to 4.3%, NRMSE between 9 and 19% and R-2 in the range of 0.87 to 0.95. The BDGR also showed its capability in replicating temporal patterns and trends of observed rainfall with greater accuracy. The product can provide reliable insights regarding various hydrometeorological issues, including historical floods, droughts, and groundwater recharge for a well-recognized global climate hotspot, Bangladesh.

This situation increases the flood risk in urban watersheds, which represent a management challenge for urban communities and authorities. To increase the resilience of communities due to modifications of the hydrological cycle produced by climate change and urban development, a methodology is proposed to delineate flood-prone areas in urban basins. This methodology is implemented in an urban subbasin of Culiacan, Mexico, and is based on stream order. A high-resolution digital elevation model was used, which was validated independently through a photogrammetric flight with an unmanned aerial vehicle and ground control points obtained with GNSS (global navigation satellite systems) receivers. Morphometric parameters related to geometry, shape, relief, and drainage network aspects of the subbasin were determined and analyzed. Then, flood-prone area zonation was carried out based on stream-order classification and flow direction. Fieldwork was also carried out for the inspection of the sewage network conditions. This methodology simplifies the identification of the flood-prone areas in urban subbasins without carrying out complex hydraulic calculations.

Climate and weather factors affecting winter sheltering by shoreline Copper Rockfish <i>Sebastes caurinus</i> in Howe Sound, British Columbia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								We monitored winter sheltering behavior of Copper Rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) in layered boulders at a shoreline in British Columbia and identified possible links to climate change and evolutionary adaptation. During late autumn and winter, these fish were inside the interstices of the boulder pile (termed "winter sheltering"); these fish were actively swimming above the boulders during spring through early fall. Sheltering duration did not vary between normal and most El Nino years (154-177 days). Sheltering longer than 6 months occurred during strong La Nina winters (197-241 days). Additionally, the proximate stimulus for entry into sheltering was intense Arctic outflow windstorms. Emergence from sheltering appears linked to water temperatures, occasionally related more to spring river flooding (snowmelt). The winter sheltering behavior we describe may be unique to shoreline populations in inland seas. Sheltering may confer a fitness advantage by conserving energy or reducing mortality from predation, thus increasing longevity and chances for successful reproduction. Our observations suggest that an ONI threshold of 0.8 degrees C or greater would be better suited than the current 0.5 degrees C threshold used to define ONI events.	[Marliave, J. B.; Borden, L.

Synthesis of Irrigation Water Use in the United States: Spatiotemporal Patterns	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water use; Irrigation; Water application rate; Agricultural management	CLIMATE-CHANGE; AGRICULTURE; TECHNOLOGY; DROUGHT; REQUIREMENTS; CONSERVATION; CALIFORNIA; RESOURCES; IMPACTS; LAWS	The role of large-scale drivers-climate, population, and adaption of efficient irrigation practices-in controlling irrigation water use efficiency has rarely been addressed. The primary objectives of our study are to (1) investigate the long-term changes in irrigation water use over the contiguous United States using a nationwide, multidecadal database created by USGS; and (2) understand the role of large-scale drivers in the water application rate, an indicator of irrigation efficiency. The authors find that the eastern states are currently withdrawing more surface water than in the past, while groundwater withdrawal has increased across all states. An increase in efficient irrigation schemes is leading to a decrease in traditional flood irrigation schemes. Spatiotemporal analyses confirm that the eastern states are presently withdrawing more irrigation water per acreage than in the past. While the choice of efficient irrigation practices (sprinkler and drip) is the major driver influencing the application rate, other factors such as cost and type of crops predominantly determine the type of irrigation system chosen for improving the application rate.

The traditional flood control approach implies in continuous corrective interventions, usually of local character, and resulting from post-events responses. This process requires increasingly large investments to implement (or retrofit) structures capable to accommodate the runoff generated by new urbanized areas. These efforts have not prevented floods from continuing to cause high damages worldwide. Thus, there is a need to change stormwater management strategies, shifting to a risk management approach, not only considering cost-benefit analysis, but also internalizing the residual risk accounting for inherent uncertainties, such as climate change and fast and uncontrolled urban growth. This paper proposes a multi-criteria index, the Urban Flood Resilience index-UFRI, to measure quantitatively urban resilience to floods, supported by a hydrodynamic mathematical model and socio-economic indicators, resulting in spatialized maps as a communicating tool. A case study of an urban watershed in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil is used to demonstrate UFRI potential.

In order to reduce and stop these unfavourable climate changes, there has been a shift to the use of renewables, and in this sense, a significant contribution of the photovoltaic (PV) power plant is planned. This paper analyses the safety, reliability, and resilience of PV systems to extreme weather conditions such as wind storms, hail, lightning, high temperatures, fire, and floods. In addition to using available information from the literature, temperature measurements were also carried out on the rooftop PV power plant in Slavonski Brod, as well as a numerical stress analysis at extreme wind speeds using Ansys software. The results of the analysis show that existing PV systems are very resilient to extreme weather conditions. Utility-scale PV systems can usually withstand wind speeds of up to 50 m/s without any problems, and only at higher speeds do local stresses occur in certain parts of the structure that are higher than permissible. Resistance to hail is also very high, and manufacturers guarantee resistance to hail up to 25 mm in size. At high air temperatures, the temperature of the panel frame can reach about 70 degrees C, the panel temperature up to 85 degrees C, and the temperature of the cable insulation over 60 degrees C, as measurements have shown. Such high temperatures lead to a drop in electricity production up to 30% but do not pose a fire hazard to the cables and the roof if the roof insulation is conducted correctly. Forest fires do not usually pose a direct threat to PV systems, but the smoke that spreads over a large area reduces the solar radiation reaching the PV panel. It can also cause an unfavourable "wiggle effect". Lightning strikes to a PV panel are not common, although they are possible. With built-in safeguards, no major damage should occur. Flooding is always a possibility, but with properly designed drainage systems, the damage is minimal in most cases.

J	Jiménez-Bonilla, A; Díaz-Azpiroz, M; Rodríguez, MR				Jimenez-Bonilla, Alejandro; Diaz-Azpiroz, Manuel; Rodriguez Rodriguez, Miguel			Tectonics may affect closed watersheds used to monitor climate change and human activity effects	TERRA NOVA			English	Article							PIEDRA PLAYA-LAKE; GIBRALTAR ARC; SOUTH SPAIN; EVOLUTION; BETICS; RELIEF; FUENTE	Playa lakes developed in closed watersheds have been used as environmental impact indicators (global warming, water extractions, etc.), but they could be also sensitive to active tectonics. Our study area is located in the main watershed in the western Betics, the northern branch of the Gibraltar arc, which is within the fold-and-thrust belt. This area is characterized by an endorheic zone that includes some playa lakes floored by low-permeable rocks. Our study shows the reduction or disappearance of playa-lake flooded surfaces due to the reduction in their watershed area. This area reduction is favoured by stream catchments related to knickpoints, which seem to be generated by the quaternary activity of a dextral-transpressive band within the Betics fold-and-thrust belt. chi map also shows the higher erosion power of Mediterranean streams, which will likely catch this endorheic area in tectonics quiescence. Statement of significance: Playa lakes developed in closed watersheds are commonly used to study environmental impacts such as global warming or water extractions. In this work, we analyse how these endorheic systems are sensitive to small water balance variations due to active tectonics. The endorheic area we chose to apply this new approach is located in the main Atlantic-Mediterranean water divide of the western Betics (northern branch of the Gibraltar arc). The recent tectonics in this fold-and-thrust belt segment provoked the Atlantic-Mediterranean gateway closure and the Messinian Salinity Crisis at 5.6 My. Our study of playa-lake flooded surface and watershed modifications, together with structural and other geomorphic analyses such as the chi index, never before has it been made to detect active structures. Active tectonics likely influenced in the medium-term evolution of the studied watersheds and this study is useful to predict both landscape and drainage network evolution in the future. In fact, the possible effect of active tectonic should be taken into account when using closed watersheds to monitor the impacts of climate change and/or local stressors such as water pumping activities.

J	Sass, O; Viles, H				Sass, Oliver; Viles, Heather			Heritage hydrology: a conceptual framework for understanding water fluxes and storage in built and rock-hewn heritage	HERITAGE SCIENCE			English	Review						Cultural heritage; Stone decay; Rock moisture	WIND-DRIVEN-RAIN; RISING DAMP; MOISTURE DYNAMICS; POROUS MATERIALS; DRIVING RAIN; STONE; WALLS; VALIDATION; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE	Water plays a vital role in the deterioration and conservation of built and rock-hewn heritage and it is generally agreed that climate change is significantly changing the environmental controls on stone decay. We here introduce the framework of heritage hydrology as a holistic way of conceptualising the flows and stores, processes and impacts of water interacting with building materials. We distinguish the basic types of stone-built buildings, ruins and free-standing walls, and rock-hewn sites. Analogous to catchment hydrology, heritage hydrology can be subdivided into water fluxes and water reservoirs, further subdivided into inputs (e.g. wind-driven rain, capillary rise), throughputs (e.g. runoff down facade), storages (moisture content) and outputs (evaporation and runoff). Spatial patterns of moisture are different between buildings and rock-hewn sites, both presenting hydrological complexities. The interaction between mean and short-term precipitation, wind, radiation and resulting evaporation may lead to very different impacts at different heritage sites. We here differentiate between the detail scale, the facade scale and the building or site scale. Patterns at different sites can be very variable on different scales due to the multitude of influencing parameters and it is not clear which scale of moisture variations is actually relevant for decay processes. Temporal patterns are equally scale-dependent and include short-term fluctuations in temperature and rainfall, high-magnitude episodic events such as floods and storms, and longer-term changes as a result of seasonality, interannual variability and secular trends or climate change. Based on the outlined framework we advocate a research agenda for heritage hydrology in the future. This should focus on (1) finding the best combinations of methods to measure and model spatio-temporal patterns in moisture; (2) researching the major factors controlling spatio-temporal patterns in moisture; (3) figuring out which spatio-temporal patterns are most important for driving deterioration and how their respective scales interact.

Historical limnological changes were identified through a multiproxy-based reconstruction including diatoms, sedimentation, and sediment geochemistry, while historical climatic changes were derived from the application of the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index. The main gradients in climatic and limnological change were assessed via multivariate analysis and generalized additive models. The reconstruction of the more isolated San Juana Lake spanned the last c. 500 years. Between c. 1,620 and 1,750 CE, riverine-flooded conditions prevailed as indicated by high detrital input, reductive conditions, and dominance of planktonic diatoms. Since the early 1800s, the riverine meander became disconnected, conveying into a marsh-like environment rich in aerophil diatoms and organic matter. The current lake was then formed around the mid-1960s with a diverse lake diatom flora including benthic and planktonic diatoms, and more oxygenated waters under a gradual increase in sedimentation and nutrients. The reconstruction for Barbacoas Lake, a waterbody directly connected to the Magdalena River, spanned the last 60 years and showed alternating riverine-wetland-lake conditions in response to varying ENSO conditions. Wet periods were dominated by planktonic and benthic diatoms, while aerophil diatom species prevailed during dry periods; during the two intense ENSO periods of 1987 and 1992, the lake almost desiccated and sedimentation rates spiked. A gradual increase in sedimentation rates post-2000 suggests that other factors rather than climate are also influencing sediment deposition in the lake. We propose that hydrological connectivity to the Magdalena River is a main factor controlling lake long-term responses to human pressures, where highly connected lakes respond more acutely to ENSO events while isolated lakes are more sensitive to local land-use changes.

China is facing a severe risk of rainstorm waterlogging disasters, which is affecting sustainable development. Urban rainstorm waterlogging in China is caused by many factors, including natural factors and human factors, such as climate warming, unreasonable urban construction, inadequate upgrading of urban fortification standards, etc. Based on the analysis of the current strategies to deal with urban waterlogging around the world, including an increase in surface infiltration, and a reduction in runoff (and its various impacts), this paper holds that the connotation and goal of these measures are highly consistent with the construction of a sponge city in China. Based on the analysis of the problems, including construction of an urban rainwater recovery system, construction of urban rainwater storage facilities, and construction of data platforms faced by China's sponge city, this paper puts forward the guiding principles of promoting the construction of a sponge city. The guiding principles are to cooperate to deal with climate change and ecological civilization construction, to study the foreign experience, and to unite multiple subjects, integrate multiple elements, design multiple processes, form a joint force, and create an all-round response system to deal with urban rainstorm waterlogging. Then, this paper gives policy recommendations on how to deal with the urban rainstorm waterlogging disasters, which include improving the defense standards, encouraging social participation, popularizing the construction of sponge cities, perfecting the monitoring and early warning system, strengthening the scientific planning of cities, strengthening the ability of dealing with catastrophes in metropolitan areas, the overall planning of cross-regional responses, and enhancing the awareness of decision makers. Finally, this paper expounds the reference significance of urban rainstorm waterlogging control in China to the global audience. This paper explores the significance of comprehensively and scientifically understanding urban rainstorm waterlogging disasters, and provides support for long-term planning and high-quality construction of future safe cities.

Here, we introduce the molecular biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), combined with charcoal and black carbon in sediments of archaeological sites, to identify anthropogenic signals of environmental change during the middle Holocene. In the prehistoric period, an intensified-fire regime period, inferred on the basis of PAHs, char and macro-charcoal levels, has been attributed to intensified anthropogenic biomass burning from dry crop cultivation between 6500 and 5000 and 3900-3600 yr BP., corresponding to the earliest Chinese settlements during the Miaodigou & Banpo IV Culture and the development of the Erlitou Culture under drier climate conditions. Subsequently, the fire frequency decreased notably between 4500 and 4000 yr BP. as the climate became wetter and there were shifts in the frequency of high-magnitude floods, corresponding to the abandonment of late Neolithic settlements in the floodplain. Changes in the PAH fluxes in sediments are positively correlated with intensified-fire regime periods, consistent with the charcoal and black carbon fluxes during those periods. Principal component analysis of PAH fluxes suggests that these intensified-fire events have a pyrogenic signature, implying that the PAHs were derived from biomass burning of fuelwood and other woody plants. In this study, PAHs in loess sediments have been used as the indicators of anthropogenic biomass burning through time. Meanwhile, PAHs also record the shift of modes of production and the evolution of human settlements as well as the choices made in response to limited natural resources. To comprehensively analyze the paleofire records of PAHs, charcoal and black carbon combined with multiproxy evidence are needed to understand wildfire history as well as human land use and social and cultural development across the study regions in depth.

The study employs the latest operative climate projections from 10 general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) to drive a hydrologic model (VIC) in generating runoff projections through 2099. Changes in peak runoff, peak timing, seasonal (major water supply season April-July) runoff, and annual runoff during two future periods, mid-century and late-century, relative to a historical baseline period are examined. Trends in seasonal and annual runoff projections are also investigated. The results indicate that watershed characteristics impact runoff responses to climate change. Specifically, for rain-dominated watersheds, runoff is generally projected to peak earlier with higher peak volumes on average. For snow-dominated watersheds, however, runoff is largely projected to peak within the same month as historical runoff has, with little changes in peak volume during mid-century but pronounced decreases during late-century under the higher emission scenario. The study also identifies changes that are common to all study watersheds. Specifically, the temporal distribution of annual runoff is projected to change in terms of shifting more volume to the wet season, though there is no significant changing trend in the total annual runoff. Additionally, the snowmelt portion of the total annual runoff (represented by April-July runoff divided by total annual runoff) is projected to decline consistently under both emission scenarios, indicative of a shrinking snowpack across the study watersheds. Collectively, these changes imply higher flood risk and lower water supply reliability in the future that are expected to pose stress to California's water system. Those findings can inform water management adaptation practices (e.g., watershed restoration, re-operation of the current water system, investing in additional water storage) to cope with the stress.

Duma florulenta (lignum) is a keystone species that facilitates biodiversity in the floodplains and wetlands of Australia's dryland river systems. This paper explores spatial genetic structure of lignum and investigates factors influencing dispersal and gene flow within and among river catchments of the northern Murray-Darling Basin. Location Northern Murray-Darling Basin, eastern Australia. Methods A total of 122 individual plants from subpopulations located on rivers in four adjacent catchments were genotyped using 10 microsatellite markers. Microsatellite data were then analyzed using population genetic techniques to evaluate levels of gene flow and genetic structure and identify factors influencing dispersal. Results Results suggest high levels of gene flow between lignum subpopulations of the northern Murray-Darling Basin. AMOVA revealed small but significant differences between subpopulations, and STRUCTURE analysis did not detect meaningful structure when sampling information was not provided. However, when sampling information was supplied using the LOCPRIOR model, three genetic clusters were identified. All Lower Balonne subpopulations were assigned to cluster 1 while a number of the other subpopulations showed mixed ancestry. Weak relationships were identified between pairwise genetic distance and geographic as well as river distance, although the R-2 value of the former was only half that of the latter. Main conclusions Patterns of genetic variation suggest frequent long-distance overland gene flow largely as a result of the movement of seeds via floodwater. Therefore, maintenance of natural variability in flow regime is key both to maintain conditions favorable to recruitment and to promote dispersal and gene flow across the landscape. However, given future climate change projections persistence may be more reliant on the species ability to endure long periods of drought between flood events.

For this reason, a wide range of institutions, governments, and financial bodies are currently promoting the use of green infrastructure (GI) as an alternative or a complement to traditional grey infrastructure. A considerable amount of research already certifies the benefits and multi-functionality of GI: natural water retention measures (NWRMs), as GIs related specifically to the water sector are also known, are, for instance, a key instrument for the prevention and mitigation of extreme phenomena, such as floods and droughts. However, there are persisting difficulties in locating and identifying GI and one of the most promising solutions to this issue, the use of satellite-based data products, is hampered by a lack of well-grounded knowledge, experiences, and tools. To bridge this gap, we performed a review of the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) products, which consist of freely-available bio-geophysical indices covering the globe at mid-to-low spatial resolutions. Specifically, we focused on vegetation and energy indices, examining previous research works that made use of them and evaluating their current quality, aiming to define their potential for studying GI and especially NWRMs related to agriculture, forest, and hydro-morphology. NWRM benefits are also considered in the analysis, namely: (i) NWRM biophysical impacts (BPs), (ii) ecosystem services delivered by NWRMs (ESs), and (iii) policy objectives (POs) expressed by European Directives that NWRMs can help to achieve. The results of this study are meant to assist GI users in employing CGLS products and ease their decision-making process. Based on previous research experiences and the quality of the currently available versions, this analysis provides useful tools to identify which indices can be used to study several types of NWRMs, assess their benefits, and prioritize the most suitable ones.

We apply a framework that is able to monitor the deterioration in territorial accessibility of the two systems in response to the cumulative elimination of sections. Road sections are removed according to different elimination types: random order, deterministic order of criticality, and deterministic order in areas at high risk of flooding. The results show that the Sardinian network is more resilient than the Valencian network, despite its poorer quality. We demonstrate that the framework can integrate climate change considerations in the resilience assessment. As the framework identifies the most critical sections, the method can be adopted as a support system by transport planners and policy makers.

Most of these assessments assume homogeneous scenarios, i.e. the regional risk estimate is obtained by summing up the local estimates, whereas each local damage value has the same probability of exceedance. This homogeneity assumption ignores the spatial variability in the flood generation processes. Here, we develop a multi-site, extreme value statistical model for 379 catchments across Europe, generate synthetic flood time series which consider the spatial correlation between flood peaks in all catchments, and compute corresponding economic damages. We find that the homogeneity assumption overestimates the 200-year flood damage, a benchmark indicator for the insurance industry, by 139%, 188% and 246% for the United Kingdom (UK), Germany and Europe, respectively. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering the spatial dependence patterns, particularly of extremes, in large-scale risk assessments.

Groundwater-dominated systems are sustained by underground aquifers that are recharged by rain that has fallen in the distant past, while surface water-dominated systems are fed by recent local rain or floods. Some waterbodies are fed by a mixture of these sources. Perennial, groundwater-dominated systems will act as refuges and refugia under future rainfall declines associated with global warming. We sought to identify climate refugia, based on groundwater dominance, by using isotope hydrology to characterise water samples collected by citizen scientists across arid central Australia. There is a linear relationship between hydrogen isotopes (H-2/H-1, delta H-2) and oxygen isotopes (O-18/O-16, delta O-18) in rainfall. This relationship is known as the meteoric water line (MWL). By comparing our samples with the Australian MWL, and developing a local evaporation line, we were able to test the hypotheses that groundwater-dominated systems will follow the Australian MWL while temporary systems follow the local evaporation line, and, accordingly, distinguish between groundwater and surface water-dominated systems. The isotopic composition of samples collected over a 36-month period was determined using isotope ratio infrared spectrometry. The electrical conductivity of each sample was recorded to determine where freshwater is available for biota within this arid region. Over 240 water samples were collected from 62 waterbodies and seven bores (groundwater wells) spanning an area of more than 250,000 km(2). Approximately 75% of the samples were collected by citizen scientists and 25% by research scientists. Twenty groundwater-dominated waterbodies, characterised by a small range of delta H-2 and delta O-18 values (c. -55 to -20 parts per thousand andc. -9 to -3 parts per thousand, respectively) clustered around the long-term mean composition of rainfall (delta H-2 = -37.5 parts per thousand, delta O-18 = -6.4 parts per thousand), were identified as future evolutionary refugia. These sites are likely to contain water through the most severe of droughts and will be critically important for the persistence of water-dependent species. Based on their isotopic composition, we identified 45 waterbodies (rockholes/waterholes) as temporary or ephemeral (delta H-2 c. -40 to -100 parts per thousand and delta O-18 c. -4 to +25 parts per thousand), that is, with no evidence of groundwater inflow. These, together with waterbodies supported by a mix of groundwater and surface water, can act asstepping stonesand form part of the aquatic mosaic that is critical to supporting species in arid regions. Over two-thirds of the waterholes sampled were very fresh (electrical conductivity <0.8 mS/cm), indicating that they provide the freshwater needed to support much of the regional aquatic and terrestrial fauna. All evolutionary refugia are located within protected areas (i.e. national parks or Indigenous Protected Areas), but some are subject to the impacts of feral animal species and invasive plants. Our findings indicate where control programmes and restoration actions can be prioritised to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation. Our approach, combining citizen science and isotope hydrology, can be used to identify future refugia in other remote and arid regions where water scarcity is likely to increase under global climate change.

V.; Kugler, Zsofia			Passive Microwave Radiometry at Different Frequency Bands for River Discharge Retrievals	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						hydrology; rivers; runoff; streamflow; sensing	CLIMATE; CALIBRATION	The present era of climate change and expanding population requires major improvements in sustained observation of global river discharge. Floods and droughts are affecting food supplies, and suspected long-term trends require appropriate data for evaluation. Orbital remote sensing can address this observational need. Here we use satellite Ka- (36.5 GHz) and L-band (1-2 GHz) passive microwave radiometry (PMR) to monitor river discharge changes and determine what size rivers can be measured and the frequencies and polarization configurations that yield the most robust results. Selected satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) can be measured at near-daily intervals from 1998 to present (Ka-band) and 2010 to present (L-band). The SGRs are 10-36 km in length; the dynamic proportion of water surface area within each varies with river discharge. Due to contrasting dielectric properties, water and land emit different intensities of microwave radiation; thus emission from a mixed water/land pixel decreases as the proportion of water within the pixel increases. Depending on the river and floodplain morphology, water flow area can be a robust indicator of discharge and the microwave sensors can retrieve daily discharge to +/- 20%. Instead of spatial resolution, it is the sensor measurement precision, geolocation accuracy, and channel and floodplain morphology that most strongly affect accuracy. Calibration of flow area signals to discharge can be performed using nearby ground stations (even if now discontinued) or by comparison to hydrologic modeling. River discharge (flow rate) measurements are critical to hydrology research and water resource management worldwide. Such data have long been collected on the ground at gauging stations, but environmental monitoring in an era of climate change and expanding population now requires major improvements in its quantity and quality. River flow area can be used to monitor streamflow variation, and such area observations are available from a variety of orbital satellite sensors. Passive microwave information offers the advantage of frequent (near daily) sampling with little interference from cloud cover. Flow area is monitored for defined satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) measuring 10-36 km in length depending on the sensor and band used. As demonstrated by comparison to ground gauging stations, Ka-band and L-band microwave information can both be used successfully. Ka-band data offer higher spatial resolution and a time series extending back to 1998. L-band SGR data from the SMAP polarimetric radiometer are less sensitive to small geolocation errors, and may provide better results especially for the larger rivers or those with forested floodplains.

Investigation of Multi-Timescale Sea Level Variability near Jamaica in the Caribbean Using Satellite Altimetry Records	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Caribbean sea level; sea level rise; Jamaica; satellite altimetry; climate change	TROPICAL NORTH-ATLANTIC; SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIDE GAUGES; RAINFALL; CYCLONES; TRENDS; STATES; WINTER; JET	There is a dearth of studies characterizing historical sea level variability at the local scale for the islands in the Caribbean. This is due to the lack of reliable long term tide gauge data. There is, however, a significant need for such studies given that small islands are under increasing threat from rising sea levels, storm surges, and coastal flooding due to global warming. The growing length of satellite altimetry records provides a useful alternative to undertake sea level analyses. Altimetry data, spanning 1993-2019, are used herein to explore multi-timescale sea level variability near the south coast of Jamaica, in the northwest Caribbean. Caribbean basin dynamics and largescale forcing mechanisms, which could account for the variability, are also investigated. The results show that the average annual amplitude off the south coast of Jamaica is approximately 10 cm with a seasonal peak during the summer (July-August). The highest annual sea levels occur within the Caribbean storm season, adding to the annual risk. The annual trend over the 27 years is 3.3 & PLUSMN; 0.4 mm/yr when adjusted for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), instrumental drift, and accounting for uncertainties. This is comparable to mean global sea level rise, but almost twice the prior estimates for the Caribbean which used altimetry data up to 2010. This suggests an accelerated rate of rise in the Caribbean over the last decade. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and correlation analyses show the long-term trend to be a basin-wide characteristic and linked to warming Caribbean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the period. When the altimetry data are detrended and deseasoned, the leading EOF mode has maximum loadings over the northwest Caribbean, including Jamaica, and exhibits interannual variability which correlates significantly with a tropical Pacific-tropical Atlantic SST gradient index, local wind strength, and the Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ). Correlations with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in summer, seen in this and other studies, likely arise through the contribution of the ENSO to the SST gradient index and the ENSO's modulation of the CLLJ peak strength in July. The results demonstrate the usefulness of altimetry data for characterizing sea level risk on various timescales for small islands. They also suggest the potential for developing predictive models geared towards reducing those risks.

In the Central Valley of California, shorebird habitat incentive programs pay landowners to create additional habitat during the non-breeding season by flooding their fields. However, it remains unclear how successful these programs have been in supporting baseline shorebird population needs or meeting established population goals, particularly in the face of changing environmental conditions. To address these questions, we used bioenergetics modeling to estimate shorebird food energy needs over four consecutive years that had the highest annual mean air temperatures ever recorded in California, and included years of extreme drought, as well as the second wettest winter on record. Our objectives were to (1) characterize annual variability in the timing and magnitude of shorebird food energy shortfalls, (2) estimate the contributions that incentive programs made to meeting these needs, and (3) develop recommendations for implementation of future habitat programs to advance shorebird conservation in the region. Overall, we found a high level of consistency in the timing and magnitude of habitat shortfalls, especially in fall, despite large differences in annual rainfall, a result that was unexpected, but that emphasizes how highly managed the hydrological system is in the Central Valley. We also found that the magnitude of both fall and spring energy shortfalls increased, relative to recent (2007-2014) estimates, perhaps due to aberrantly warm conditions. Incentive programs implemented to provide supplemental habitat were somewhat effective in reducing shortfalls for the assumed baseline population, but there were consistent unmet habitat needs when there were not enough shallow open water foraging areas available. Strategies to offset these remaining food energy deficits include scaling up habitat investments, adjusting the timing of habitat programs to better match the migration patterns of the birds, and adapting programs to new geographies. To the extent that there is variability in annual habitat need we recommend implementing a dynamic conservation approach. This involves scaling the amount of additional habitat created to match the shifting needs of the birds to maximize return on investment.

Due to climate change, extreme precipitation events have globally and regionally increased in frequency and intensity, leading to a higher probability of natural disasters. This study, using the long-term APHRODITE dataset, employed six precipitation indices to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation in the Pearl River Basin during 1951-2015. The Mann-Kendall (M-K) test was used to verify the significance of the observed trends. The results indicate that: (1) the interannual PRCPTOT showed a trend with an average positive increase of 0.019 mm/yr, which was followed by an increase in SDII, R95P, and RX1day, and a decrease in R95D and CWD; seasonal PRCPTOT also displayed an increase in summer and winter and a decrease in spring and autumn, corresponding to increases in R95P and SDII in all seasons. (2) The annual precipitation increases from the west to east of the basin, similar to the gradient distribution of SDII, R95P and RX1day, with the high R95D happening in the middle and lower reaches of the Xijiang River, but the CWD increased from the north to south of the basin. The seasonal spatial distributions of PRCPTOT, SDII, and R95P are relatively similar except in autumn, showing an increase from the west to east of the basin in spring and winter and a gradual increase from the north to south of the basin in summer, indicating that the Beijiang and Dongjiang tributary basins are more vulnerable to floods. (3) The MK test results exhibited that the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region in the upper reaches of the Xijiang River Basin became drier, and there was an increase in extreme precipitation in the Beijiang and Dongjiang river basins. The study results facilitate valuable flood mitigation, natural hazard control and water resources management in the Pearl River Basin.

J	Sánchez-Almodóvar, E; Olcina-Cantos, J; Martí-Talavera, J				Sanchez-Almodovar, Esther; Olcina-Cantos, Jorge; Marti-Talavera, Javier			Adaptation Strategies for Flooding Risk from Rainfall Events in Southeast Spain: Case Studies from the Bajo Segura, Alicante	WATER			English	Article						urban runoff; water management; climate change	COAST; VALENCIA; TOURISM	The management of runoff during torrential rainfall events is a significant problem in urban areas of southeast Spain. The increase in soil sealing and the occupation of areas prone to flooding have aggravated this problem. Due to this situation, municipal administrations, in collaboration with the concession holder for the supply of water and sewage services, Hidraqua Gestion Integral de Aguas de Levante SA, are committed a more efficient management of non-conventional water resources. An example of this can be found in the municipalities of Rojales, Daya Nueva, and San Fulgencio. These towns are located in the Bajo Segura region of the province of Alicante, where various initiatives have been implemented that break away from the traditional paradigm of rigid infrastructures. These initiatives include green spaces or areas, and sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) or nature-based solutions (NBS). This article presents various case studies. Firstly, in the town of Rojales, where several actions are being undertaken to improve the management of wastewater and rainwater and provide a solution to unauthorised dumping, as well as encouraging the use of reclaimed water with the creation of a recreational green area, El Recorral Park. Secondly, in the case of Daya Nueva, the Europa Park constitutes a recreational green area, Europa Park, facilitates runoff drainage by SUDS and NBS. Finally, the creation of a floodable pond in the municipality of San Fulgencio encourages the use of wastewater, thus avoiding the discharge of this non-conventional water resource into the sea. In addition, the pond facilitates the appropriate management of runoff water. The working method in this article has been twofold: firstly, bibliographical references have been consulted from other national and international areas; and secondly, the technical projects in the case studies have been analysed in detail. Several field trips have been made to the selected municipalities, accompanied by the technical personnel in charge of the execution of the projects, to examine the measures adopted. The results show that the implementation of these systems contributes to adapting to climate change and creates more resilient urban spaces.

Extreme Precipitation and Flooding Contribute to Sudden Vegetation Dieback in a Coastal Salt Marsh	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						extreme climatic events; extreme precipitation; Hurricane Harvey; tropical cyclones; coastal wetlands; ecosystem collapse; regime shift; ecological thresholds; sudden vegetation dieback	TROPICAL CYCLONES; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; ESTUARINE MARSH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-LEVEL; ATLANTIC; EVENTS; HURRICANES; MORTALITY; COLLAPSE	Climate extremes are becoming more frequent with global climate change and have the potential to cause major ecological regime shifts. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, a coastal wetland in Texas suffered sudden vegetation dieback following an extreme precipitation and flooding event associated with Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Historical salt marsh dieback events have been linked to climate extremes, such as extreme drought. However, to our knowledge, this is the first example of extreme precipitation and flooding leading to mass mortality of the salt marsh foundation species, Spartina alterniflora. Here, we investigated the relationships between baseline climate conditions, extreme climate conditions, and large-scale plant mortality to provide an indicator of ecosystem vulnerability to extreme precipitation events. We identified plant zonal boundaries along an elevation gradient with plant species tolerant of hypersaline conditions, including succulents and graminoids, at higher elevations, and flood-tolerant species, including S. alterniflora, at lower elevations. We quantified a flooding threshold for wetland collapse under baseline conditions characterized by incremental increases in flooding (i.e., sea level rise). We proposed that the sudden widespread dieback of S. alterniflora following Hurricane Harvey was the result of extreme precipitation and flooding that exceeded this threshold for S. alterniflora survival. Indeed, S. alterniflora dieback occurred at elevations above the wetland collapse threshold, illustrating a heightened vulnerability to flooding that could not be predicted from baseline climate conditions. Moreover, the spatial pattern of vegetation dieback indicated that underlying stressors may have also increased susceptibility to dieback in some S. alterniflora marshes. Collectively, our results highlight a new mechanism of sudden vegetation dieback in S. alterniflora marshes that is triggered by extreme precipitation and flooding. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of considering interactions between multiple abiotic and biotic stressors that can lead to shifts in tolerance thresholds and incorporating climate extremes into climate vulnerability assessments to accurately characterize future climate threats.

In this study, to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of hydrological and meteorological droughts over the Hanjiang River Basin (HRB); the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) were selected and applied for the period 1961-2018. In addition, the cross-wavelet method was used to discuss the relationship between hydrological drought and meteorological droughts. The results and analysis indicated that: (1) the meteorological drought in the HRB showed a complex cyclical change trend of flood-drought-flood from 1961 to 2018. The basin drought began to intensify from 1990s and eased in 2010s. The characteristics of drought evolution in various regions are different based on scale. (2) During the past 58 years, the hydrological drought in the HRB has shown a significant trend of intensification, particularly in autumn season. Also, the hydrological droughts had occurred frequently since the 1990s, and there were also regional differences in the evolution characteristics of drought in various regions. (3) Reservoir operation reduces the frequency of extreme hydrological drought events. The effect of reducing the duration and intensity of hydrological drought events by releasing water from the reservoir is most obvious at Huangjiagang Station, which is the nearest to Danjiangkou Reservoir. (4) The hydrological drought and meteorological drought in the HRB have the strongest correlation on the yearly scale. After 1990, severe human activities and climate change are not only reduced the correlation between hydrological drought and meteorological drought in the middle and lower reaches of the basin, but also reduced the lag time between them. Among them, the hydrological drought in the upper reaches of the basin lags behind the meteorological drought by 1 month, and the hydrological drought in the middle and lower reaches of the basin has changed from 2 months before 1990 to 1 month lagging after 1990.

J	Rauter, M; Kaufmann, M; Thaler, T; Fuchs, S				Rauter, Magdalena; Kaufmann, Maria; Thaler, Thomas; Fuchs, Sven			Flood risk management in Austria: Analysing the shift in responsibility-sharing between public and private actors from a public stakeholder's perspective	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						flood mitigation; flood risk management; policy arrangements approach; responsibility-sharing; risk governance	DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOUNTAIN HAZARDS; RIVER FLOODS; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; VULNERABILITY; PROTECTION; EXPERIENCE; AWARENESS	The frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events are expected to increase due to the effects of climate change and socio-economic development. Potentially higher flood risk, hence, triggered debate about a shift in flood risk management from mainly public to increasingly private involvement. So far, public flood mitigation schemes were standard modes to deal with flood hazards in many countries, including Austria. With high implementation and maintenance costs as well as substantial losses remaining, alternative management approaches have increasingly been discussed. This paper analyses the debate on shifting responsibilities in flood risk management from public to private actors and whether or not the current governance arrangement would accommodate this shift in the public-private divide. Based on qualitative research, we explicitly analyse this potential shift from an institutional perspective and not from the perspective of individual homeowners, taking the case study of Dornbirn (Austria) as an example. The results show that, firstly, the current governance arrangement hardly encourages property-level flood risk adaptation measures. Secondly, several factors stabilise the current governance arrangement and prevent a shift in the public-private divide. Although the need for an increased sense of responsibility among private actors seems to be evident among interviewees, strong historical narratives and adaptive expectations lead to a society seeing public authorities to be responsible for flood risk management and trust their expertise as well as the technical flood infrastructure. However, such areas of expertise and law are fragmented and therefore impede a redistribution or enforcement of responsibilities. Furthermore, fixed costs delay a shift in the public-private divide as the traditional engineering approach (i.e. structural measures) is predominant with high investments in the current system but limited investment in risk communication to raise awareness. Yet, a shift towards sharing responsibility might contribute to flood risk management for risks to remain manageable.

Increasing drought favors nonnative fishes in a dryland river: evidence from a multispecies demographic model	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						assemblage; climate change; community; demographic model; drought; freshwater fish; hydrology; invasive species; multispecies model; nonnative species; non-stationarity; stochasticity	FLOW-ECOLOGY RELATIONSHIPS; FRESH-WATER FISHES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; INTERMITTENT-STREAM; VARIABILITY; COMMUNITY; REGIME; PERSISTENCE; RESPONSES	Understanding how novel biological assemblages are structured in relation to dynamic environmental regimes remains a central challenge in ecology. Demographic approaches to modeling species assemblages show promise because they seek to represent fundamental relationships between population dynamics and environmental conditions. In dryland rivers, rapidly changing climate conditions have shifted drought and flooding regimes with implications for fish communities. Our goals were to (1) develop a mechanistic multispecies demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes, and (2) evaluate demographic responses in population and community structure to changing flow regimes. Each fish species was represented by a stage-structured matrix, and species were coupled together into a multispecies framework through density-dependent relationships in reproduction. Then, community dynamics were simulated through time using annual flow events classified from gaged streamflow data. We parameterized the model with vital rates and flow-response relationships for a community of native and nonnative fishes using literature-derived values. We applied the simulation model to the Verde River (Arizona, USA), a major tributary within the Colorado River Basin, for the past half century (1%4-2017). Model validation revealed a match between model projections and relative abundance trends observed in a long-term fish monitoring dataset (1994-2008). At the beginning of the validation period (1994), model and survey observations showed that native species comprised approximately 80% of total abundance. Model projections beyond the survey data (2008-2017) predicted a shift from a native dominant to a normative dominant assemblage, coinciding with increasing drought frequency. Trade-offs between native and nonnative species dominance emerged from differences in mortality in response to the changing sequence of major flow events including spring floods, summer high flows, and droughts. In condusion, the demographic approach presented here provides a flexible modeling framework that is readily applied to other stream systems and species by adjusting or transferring, when appropriate, species vital rates and flow-event thresholds.

It is also a necessary decision-making tool for disaster mitigation policy-makers in Japan and around the world. This paper successfully develops a simple methodology using only open data to build the first large-scale (whole country), fine resolution (sub-municipal level) social vulnerability analysis in the context of five different types of natural hazards (earthquake, tsunami, storm surge, flooding and landslide). The result is then compared to an indicator of exposure of population to these hazards in Japan in order to propose a representation of disaster risk. Results show that vulnerability in Japan is highly heterogeneous with urban/rural and north/south fractures. Combining the social vulnerability index with exposure analysis, results show a wide variety of spatial patterns of risk areas in Japan.

By the proportional sampling method, data were collected from 381 dairy farmers. The survey was performed from September 2020 to June 2021. The study data were evaluated by descriptive statistics, risk matrix method, equally likely certainty equivalent method and probit model. In this study, severe storm, excessive rainfall/flood, livestock diseases, high temperature and drought was posed an important risk for dairy farmers. The majority of them showed risk aversion behaviour. Age, education level, household size, dairy farming experience, the number of dairy cattle, the land ownership status, livestock insurance and access of agricultural credits had a significant effect on risk perceptions and attitudes of dairy farmers. As a result, these findings are expected to ensure contribution to rural development, province and region economy, insurance institutions, agricultural policy makers, and further emphasizing the importance of environmental risks in dairy farming activity.

Here, we use a numerical model to investigate whether the Intra-Allerod Cold Period was triggered by the drainage of Glacial Lake Iroquois, similar to 13,300 years ago. Performing a large suite of experiments with various combinations of single and successive, short (1 month) and long (1 year) duration flood events, we were unable to find any significant weakening of the AMOC. This result suggests that although the Hudson Valley floods occurred close to the beginning of the Intra-Allerod Cold Period, they were unlikely the sole cause. Our results have implications for re-evaluating the relationship of meltwater flood events (past and future) to periods of climatic cooling, particularly with regards to flood input location, volume, frequency, and duration.

It will serve as a gateway to share trade and other industrial benefits with each other. On one hand it's a blessing for both countries, the other way it is offering a potential threat to the environment i.e. due to wide construction of roads the major effect is threatening biodiversity and environmental sustainability. It will cause deforestation, floods, glacier melting, climate change, and global warming. "Climate engineering" is the newly emerging concept to resolve the problems related to the environment and biodiversity. Under the umbrella of concept "Climate engineering" we proposed attractive and environmentally friendly solutions that are helpful to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on the environment of both countries. These proposed strategies include installation of CO2 scrubbers, construction of Algal ponds, and development of research stations across the roads and by introducing the concept of carbon canopy. It will also help the legislators and policymakers of both countries to incorporate these solutions for sustainable development on each side.

The politics of disaster risk education in Rio de Janeiro	DISASTERS			English	Article						Brazil; critical pedagogy; disaster risk education; environmental policy; risk communication; urban development	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; FLOOD	Disaster education outcomes are highly dependent on the political context of that education. Based on a rich, in-depth case study of the creation of community monitors in a landslide and flood-prone city in southeast Brazil, this paper demonstrates how developmental and political environments add much additional nuance to existing theories of behaviourist and transformative education for disaster preparedness and mitigation. Beyond identifying the benefits of education, it argues that disaster risk reduction outcomes are reliant on governance frameworks that alter over time. The study reveals the political complexity associated with programme implementation and cites the perspectives of a number of participants. Disaster education is shown to be the necessary yet underappreciated twin of the militarised and technical approaches that dominate disaster response in Brazil. Understated, however, is education's situatedness: how it can become an arena of conflict between government and civil actors over matters of state and society in increasingly hazardous urbanisation settings in Latin America.

As state authorities also have difficulty in providing sufficient flood protection, experts argue that collective adaptation initiated by firms can compensate for these shortcomings. However, private sector engagement in this field remains rare and is mostly dominated by large firms. Our article examines whether MSMEs are willing to contribute to flood risk reduction measures. Based on scenario-based field experiments, 120 participating enterprises in Jakarta and Semarang are willing to contribute to collective adaptation in 43% of all the scenarios we ran. Even though MSMEs often operate under difficult conditions, they are surprisingly often willing to contribute if the costs are distributed fairly. The analysis underlines the importance of social motives in explaining the collective engagement of MSMEs and, thus, provides relevant results for future adaptation policies.

In the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, the highly variable and localized nature of rainfall during the North American Monsoon makes it difficult to detect temporal changes in rainfall intensities in response to climatic change. This study addresses this challenge by using the dense, subdaily, and daily observations from 59 rain gauges located in southeastern Arizona. We find an intensification of monsoon subdaily rainfall intensities starting in the mid-1970s that has not been observed in previous studies or simulated with high-resolution climate models. Our results highlight the need for long-term, high spatiotemporal observations to detect environmental responses to a changing climate in highly variable environments and show that analyses based on limited observations or gridded data sets fail to capture temporal changes potentially leading to erroneous conclusions.

Regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) is widely used for this purpose. This paper develops artificial intelligence (AI)-based RFFA models (artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)) using data from 181 gauged catchments in South-East Australia. Based on an independent testing, it is found that the ANN method outperforms the SVM (the relative error values for the ANN model range 33-54% as compared to 37-64% for the SVM). The ANN and SVM models generate more accurate flood quantiles for smaller return periods; however, for higher return periods, both the methods present a higher estimation error. The results of this study will help to recommend new AI-based RFFA methods in Australia.

We use the 2D-depth integrated ADCIRC + SWAN wave-ocean model, baroclinically coupled to an ocean-eddying version of the Community Earth System Model, to compare impacts of the September 2017 hurricanes with projected impacts of similar hypothetical tropical storms occurring in the future. The model predicts only minor changes in the hurricane-induced extreme water levels for those Caribbean islands which were severely devastated by the 2017 tropical storms (Irma and Maria). That is, provided that the hurricane intensity remains at the present-day level, the global mean sea-level rise is the main future coastal flood risk factor.

To do so, we employ a dyadic regression analysis on monthly maize prices, transport costs, and spatial identification of markets as well as droughts and flooded areas. Our estimates show that, while a drought reduces price differences between markets, price dispersion increases during flood periods, an effect that is mainly driven by increases in transport costs. Finally, floods are found to affect price differences more if markets are closer to each other and if the road infrastructure quality is poor. An important implication of our results is that markets show some degree of efficiency during supply shock periods in Mozambique. However, spatial market integration continues to be insufficient, probably due to high transfer costs.

A breakthrough in fast flood simulation	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Floods; Flow networks; Algorithms; Forecasting	FAST SWEEPING METHOD; CATCHMENTS; MODEL	The current status of technological advancement does not allow to generate detailed spatial flood forecasts. This hinders warning-systems, interactive planning tools and detailed forecasts. Our novel method computes flood hazard maps over three orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art methods. It applies physically-based principles of steady-state flow to evade dynamic aspects of flood simulations. It estimates the relevant information for flood hazard, such as peak flow height, velocity and flood arrival time. Performance indicators show similar or exceeding accuracy compared to traditional flow models depending on the type of and data. In our tests, computation is reduced 1500 times. The method provides new perspective for the field of flood hazards, flood risk reduction through new types of early-warning systems, and user-interactive hazard assessment systems. As climate change is expected to aggravate flood hazard, the presented method can bring efficiency to flood simulation. The method is freely available at www.fastflood.org.

We proposed a novel and automatic system for urban flood detection and quantification. Our software takes image/video data of flooding as inputs because the such data source is easy to obtain and widely available compared with conventional water level sensors or flood gauges. First, the kernel of our system is a robust water region segmentation module that detects flooded regions together with surrounding reference objects from the scene. We combine image and video segmentation technologies to make the system reliable under varying weather and illumination conditions. Second, our system uses the detected situated objects to determine the inundation depth. Field experiments demonstrate that our segmentation results are accurate and reliable; and our system can detect flooding and estimate inundation depths from images and time-lapse videos.

Assessing the climate change exposure of foreign direct investment	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EXPERIENCE; EMISSIONS; TRADE; LEVEL; FDI	This study deploys newly available data to examine the exposure of multinational companies' overseas investments to physical climate risks. Globally, foreign investments are significantly exposed to lower physical climate risks, compared with local firms across countries. Within countries however, the differences of physical climate risks between foreign and local facilities are small. We also examine China, as it is fast becoming one of the largest sources of outward foreign investment across the globe. We find that foreign direct investment from China is significantly more exposed to water stress, floods, hurricanes and typhoon risks across countries, compared with other foreign facilities. Within host countries however, once again the physical climate risks of Chinese overseas facilities are comparable to those of non-Chinese foreign investments. This study finds that foreign firms tend to shy away from countries with higher physical climate risks than do local firms. Chinese FDI is significantly more exposed to most physical climate risks than non-Chinese FDI across countries.

These cities are already suffering from frequent floods, though few comparative analyses have been conducted on the similarities and differences of their adaptation approaches. Thus, this study aims to investigate the current adaptation pathways of Asian deltaic cities to flooding induced by slow onset events such as urbanization-induced land subsidence and sea level rise, by looking at Tokyo, Jakarta, Manila, and Ho Chi Minh City as case studies. Evidence from them shows that an engineering approach towards flooding adaptation is shaping the future of Asian deltaic cities. However, emerging challenges question the sustainability of this approach. Recommendations on how to improve current adaptation pathways and direction for future research are also provided.

Resilience of Urban Transport Network-of-Networks under Intense Flood Hazards Exacerbated by Targeted Attacks	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RECOVERY; DESIGN	Natural hazards including floods can trigger catastrophic failures in interdependent urban transport network-of-networks (NoNs). Population growth has enhanced transportation demand while urbanization and climate change have intensified urban floods. However, despite the clear need to develop actionable insights for improving the resilience of critical urban lifelines, the theory and methods remain underdeveloped. Furthermore, as infrastructure systems become more intelligent, security experts point to the growing threat of targeted cyber-physical attacks during natural hazards. Here we develop a hypothesis-driven resilience framework for urban transport NoNs, which we demonstrate on the London Rail Network (LRN). We find that topological attributes designed for maximizing efficiency rather than robustness render the network more vulnerable to compound natural-targeted disruptions including cascading failures.

Hydro-geomorphological particularities and socio-productive transformations in the Uco Valley, Mendoza, Argentina	REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE			Spanish	Article						Vulnerability; oasis; floods; socio-productive transformations; Uco Valley; Mendoza	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION	The recent process of expansion of the Uco Valley oasis towards the Andean foothills has been carried out by large agricultural enterprises. This advance modifies the alluvial channels of the area and produces new vulnerabilities that impact on other actors and sectors of the territory. Based on a mixed methodology between qualitative research techniques and a geographical analysis, we examine how the features of the dominant agricultural model in the region meet the hydro-geomorphological characteristics of this oasis, enabling a process of production and transfer of new vulnerabilities downstream. To explain this process we follow an approach based on a relational conceptualization of vulnerability and on the instrumental logic of producing the nature, typical of capital accumulation. Our analysis aims to make evident a phenomenon that tends to be invisible and highlights that the agricultural model is only successful for some at the expense of others.

Drought, megafires and flood-climate extreme impacts on catchment-scale river water quality on Australia's east coast	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Aquatic chemistry; Nutrients; Suspended sediment; Nitrate; Phosphate	SEDIMENT RATING CURVES; PRESCRIBED FIRE; WILDFIRE; FOREST; CHEMISTRY; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; EXCITATION; EROSION	Increased frequency and intensity of drought, wildfires and flooding due to climate change has major implications for river water quality, yet there are limited high-temporal resolution data capturing the combined transient impacts of these extreme events at large catchment scales. We present flow-stratified water quality data from a large coastal catchment (Macleay River, Australia) spanning severe drought and extensive fires followed by flooding. We examine concentrations (C), discharge (Q) and flux of suspended sediment, major ions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and key nutrients (NO3 and PO4), with a focus on the critical first-flush period after the fires. Highly elevated suspended sediment (-5500 mg L-1; > 100x median pre-fire levels) during the initial post fire period reflected enhanced erosion from fire-impacted, high-relief landscapes, with peak monthly suspended sediment loads of-1.1-3.7 t ha(-1). The greatest sensitivity to erosion was during initial flow events following fire, highlighting the compounding effect of sequential extreme events on sediment transport. Maximum solute concentrations typically occurred during the first hydrograph peak post-fire with significantly (P = 0.01) elevated major ions following the order of K > Ca > SO4 > HCO3 & AP;Mg > Cl > Na, broadly reflecting the composition of ash materials. Distorted CQ relationships for major ions, DOC and nutrients indicated mobilisation behaviour and enhanced surface runoff during initial hydrograph peaks post-fire, with mean concentrations and CQ relationships progressively shifting to those approximating pre-fire within-3-12 months. Elevated DOC (-7x; P = 0.01) displays distinct changes in fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectral characteristics, attributable to both fire and drought. Both NO3-N (160 mu M) and PO4 (7.5 mu M) were significantly elevated after the fires (-15-22x; P = 0.01), with maximum monthly loads of 0.82 and 0.14 kg ha(-1) respectively. Fast biogeochemical cycling of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species occurred during initial flow events following fire, with NH4-N initially dominant (> 80% of DIN) and exceeding ecosystem guideline threshold values (> 100 mu M NH4-N), followed by rapid (-1 week) nitrification. The extreme dynamism and transience of water quality parameters highlights the critical importance of high-frequency sampling to adequately capture the compound impacts drought, fires and floods on aquatic systems.

Modelling river flow in cold and ungauged regions: a review of the purposes, methods, and challenges	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS			English	Review						streamflow prediction; empirical and process-based methods; data-driven models; machine learning; flood prevention; Canada	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; NEURO-FUZZY MODEL; LAND-USE CHANGE; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; RUNOFF SIMULATION; DURATION CURVES; RAINFALL-RUNOFF; SURFACE-WATER; BASINS PUB; PREDICTION	River flow forecasting models assist in the understanding, predicting, monitoring, and managing of issues related to surface-water resources, such as water quality deterioration and flooding, or developing adaptation strategies to cope with climate change and increasing water demand. This review presents an overview of the current research status and progress in river-flow forecasting, focusing on cold climates and ungauged locations. River-flow forecasting in cold regions represents a challenge because the natural processes that occur within catchments vary greatly both seasonally and annually. This variability, which highly depends on climatic and topo-geomorphological characteristics within a basin, translates into increased model uncertainty and a substantial limitation when attempting to forecast river flow in cold regions, which are often poorly gauged or ungauged. To address this limitation, the "Predictions in Ungauged Basins" initiative offers a variety of studies to improve forecasting performance by adopting regionalization, spatial calibration, interpolation, and regression approaches. Process-based models demonstrate significant improvement by including remote-sensing data to replicate and derive complex hydrological processes. Empirical models, which utilize observed data to formulate a graphical solution, unlike mathematical models that require formulating the relationships between the processes, are also implemented with the most recent developments in machine learning, showing exceptional forecasting accuracy. Although process-based models provide a wide understanding of a watershed hydrology, data are often unavailable, expensive, and time-consuming to collect. They also generate numerous calibration parameters, resulting in complex and computationally demanding methods to operate. River-flow forecasting using empirical models reduces the number of calibration parameters but could produce biased results when insufficient variables are available to explain the physical mechanisms of a watershed's hydrology. Moreover, empirical models could be potentially sensitive to calibration and validation dataset selection. In this review, Canadian studies are primarily selected to highlight some of the efforts that may be necessary in other similar cold and ungauged regions, including: (i) coping with limited data availability through regionalization methods; (ii) providing user-friendly interfaces; (iii) advancing model structure; (iv) developing a universal method for transferring regionalization parameters; (v) standardizing calibration and validation dataset selection; (vi) integrating process-based and empirical models.

Altai relict forests are under the risk of degradation under the recent warming. Investigations of climatic impacts on the southern Siberian forest, where temperature is not the main limiting growth factor are still rare and urgently needed. Therefore, we aim to reveal and evaluate the impact of recent extreme climatic events (1919-2019) on relict larch trees (Larix sibirica Ldb.) from two contrasting sites in the Russian Altai (Ersin-HO and Chadan-CH). Application of the state-of-the-art methods of stable isotope and tree-ring analyses is very promising in this region due to high sensitivity of trees to temperature and precipitation changes. We found site-specific differences (ca. 4 parts per thousand) recorded in newly developed centennial stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope chronologies, showing their climate sensitivity and reflecting the contrasting conditions at the dry (HO) and wet (CH) sites. The most extreme drought anomalies (sigma >= + 3 sigma) over the past 100 years (1919-2019) were revealed for the HO-site in 1935 and 2018. In contrast, a wet extreme anomaly (sigma = - 2.7 sigma) was detected for the CH site only in 1994. Moreover, trees from the CH-site are receiving a greater amount of precipitation during the summer months, especially for the years with extremes sigma >= - 2 sigma (1939, 1948, 1958, 1994, 2000, and 2019). Divergent delta C-13 and intrinsic water-use efficiency trends after the 1980s indicate increasing drought stress at the HO- compared to the CH-site, which is confirmed by changes in the running correlation between the isotopes and comparison with declining tree-ring width data. Drought or flooding extremes are recorded heterogeneously at the two study sites in southern Altai, indicating dependence from local habitats, type of soils and freezing active soil depths. Recent climate change affected both forest and humans as public and agricultural sectors are suffering from recent droughts or flooding events. To provide measures and apply mitigation plans for the unique relict forest and public sector, our reconstruction of past anomaly events in this region is important and helpful to predict future climate changes.

Floods, droughts and storms are the most common catastrophes. These risks endanger millions of lives and create massive financial and production losses.Objective: This study aims at reviewing the disaster risk management (DRM) system in Vietnam, identifying progress and challenges of this system, hence making recommendations for improving the system for better responding with natural hazards.Method: The study uses PSR model (Pressure- State- Response) in combination with DRM management framework by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to evaluate DRM system in Vietnam with 5 aspects: (i) DRM regulatory framework (ii) DRM organization (iii) DRM financial resources (iv) DRM integration in to plans at central and local levels (v) Disaster warning and education. The data collection consists of reviewing existing literature and interviewing key informants in DRM.Results: Disasters is a serious threat to Vietnam's socio economic development. To respond, Vietnam has made many efforts including develop a comprehensive legal framework for DRM which Law on Disaster Prevention and Control takes the key role. Vietnam has also established a fairly well organized DRM system from the central to local levels. The financial sources for DRM are arranged from State budget and sources outside State budget. Vietnam has developed major policies for integrating DRM into development plans centrally and locally. The disaster information and warning system is being modernized with the integration of disaster education in training programs. Challenges in DRM are identified, including institutional, financial and information issues. In addition, Vietnam is facing the increase of disasters and extreme climate events due to climate change. Covid 19 and its socio-economic consequences also lead to a lack of resources for DRM. Economic development moreover results in the decline of ecosystem-based disaster mitigation works and put more pressures on DRM.Recommendations: In the future, Vietnam should develop an information-sharing network between ministries, sectors, localities and NGOs to support the policy formulation process and enhance the coordination of multistakeholders. The country should also establish more proper funding allocation mechanisms to fulfill DRM's demands, especially for disaster preparedness and reconstruction phases.

To study those communities, researchers have begun to explore how local environmental factors influence species composition patterns at relatively fine scales within complex habitat mosaics. However, a robust description of the link between communities' composition and their floodplain habitat characteristics remains poorly articulated. In the Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) of Cambodia, we evaluated whether mesohabitat-scale (1-5 km) factors throughout the floodplain structured the fish assemblage temporally and spatially. First, we determined whether TSL fish assemblage changed seasonally and, if so, what assemblage components were driving that change. Second, we determined whether environmental factors structured fish composition across floodplain mesohabitat patches during the wet season. Third, we evaluated whether dominant species displayed affinities for specific areas within the floodplain during the wet season, potentially identifying critical mesohabitat patches for the fish assemblage. Fish were collected from nine sites along an elevational gradient traversing the floodplain every 3 months from March 2014 through January 2015. Correspondence analysis and analysis of variance were used to assess seasonal variation in the species composition. Canonical correspondence analysis and a mantel test were then used to identify the significance of environmental factors structuring the fish assemblage. Fish assemblages changed across seasons; in particular, migratory species occurrence decreased during the dry season. During the wet season, the fish assemblage was structured spatially by mesohabitat-scale factors such as vegetation and water quality. Furthermore, the flooded forest mesohabitat directly adjacent to the permanent lake displayed particularly high species richness and abundance. However, a majority of TSL species appeared to be highly mobile, occurring across multiple floodplain mesohabitats. We concluded that fish assemblage structure and floodplain mesohabitat use within TSL may depend strongly upon the maintenance of the natural flow regime. Since the flow regime will probably be modified by upstream dam development, trade-offs will emerge between the cycle of fishing on which local residents depend, and the hydropower and agricultural benefits of damming the Mekong River system.

Environmental implications of salinity and flooding induced changes in porewater nitrogen and phosphorous dynamics	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS AND BIOAVAILABILITY			English	Article						Climate change; sea level rise; coastal agriculture; water quality; nutrients	SEA-LEVEL RISE; DISSIMILATORY NITRATE REDUCTION; FRESH-WATER; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; SALTWATER INTRUSION; WETLAND SOILS; MOBILIZATION; SALINIZATION; RESPIRATION; SEDIMENT	This study aimed to investigate the effects of fresh water and seawater flooding on phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in two calcareous soils (Biscayne and Krome) of South Florida using a 28-day greenhouse flooding experiment. Porewater samples were collected at three depths over four periods (1, 7, 14, and 28 days) of flooding and analyzed for selected water quality parameters. Results showed that seawater-flooded Biscayne soil had a 4.4 fold higher porewater soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration than freshwater. Additionally, porewater SRP concentration and total phosphorus (TP) in Biscayne soil increased with prolonged flooding duration and column depth. Furthermore, both freshwater and seawater flooding increased porewater NH4 + - N concentration; however, the increase was more pronounced in seawater flooded samples. NH4 (+) - N concentration also increased with flooding duration. Overall, the study highlights the risks of nutrient leaching from seawater flooded coastal soils that could contribute to the deterioration of surface and groundwater quality.

Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most widely cultivated crops and the most abundant grain crop in production worldwide. However, the stability of maize yield is highly dependent on environmental conditions. Recently, great progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underly-ing maize responses to environmental stresses and in developing stress-resilient varieties dueto advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, multi-omics analysis platforms, and automated phenotyping facilities. In this review, we summarize recent advances in dissecting the genetic factors and networks that contribute to maize abiotic stress tolerance through diverse strategies. We also discuss future challenges and opportunities for the development of climate-resilient maize varieties.

Enhancing PM<sub>2.5</sub> Prediction Using NARX-Based Combined CNN and LSTM Hybrid Model	SENSORS			English	Article						air quality prediction; PM2 5; NARX neural network; machine learning; CNN-LSTM		In a world where humanity's interests come first, the environment is flooded with pollutants produced by humans' urgent need for expansion. Air pollution and climate change are side effects of humans' inconsiderate intervention. Particulate matter of 2.5 mu m diameter (PM2.5) infiltrates lungs and hearts, causing many respiratory system diseases. Innovation in air pollution prediction is a must to protect the environment and its habitants, including those of humans. For that purpose, an enhanced method for PM2.5 prediction within the next hour is introduced in this research work using nonlinear autoregression with exogenous input (NARX) model hosting a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The proposed enhancement was evaluated by several metrics such as index of agreement (IA) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The results indicated that the CNN-LSTM/NARX hybrid model has the lowest NRMSE and the best IA, surpassing the state-of-the-art proposed hybrid deep-learning algorithms.

These impacts are expected to be aggravated by climate change. Here we analyze and compare the impacts of multiple types of extreme events across several domains in Europe, to reveal corresponding impact signatures. We characterize the distinct impacts of droughts, floods, heat waves, frosts and storms on a variety of biophysical and social variables at national level and half-monthly time scale. We find strong biophysical impacts of droughts, floods, heat waves and frosts, while public attention and property damage are more affected by storms and floods. We show unexpected impact patterns such as reduced human mortality during floods and storms. Comparing public attention anomalies with impacts across all other considered domains we find that attention on droughts is comparatively low despite the significant overall impacts. Resolving these impact patterns highlights large-scale vulnerability and supports regional extreme event management to consequently reduce disaster risks.

Citrus are mainly cultivated in areas with a high susceptibility to climate change. Therefore, it is vital to explore their responses to these events to anticipate future challenges by means of genetic improvement of the commercial rootstocks. In this experiment, three popular commercial rootstocks, namely 'Cleopatra' (C. reshni Hort. Ex Tanaka), C. macrophylla, and 'Forner Alcaide no. 5 ' (Citrus reshni Hort. Ex Tanaka x Poncirus trifoliata), were evaluated after being submitted to short-term waterlogging and a period of recovery of 7 days in each case. Photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance decreased in 'Cleopatra', while in the other two genotypes they were maintained (C. macrophylla) or restored after recovery ('Forner Alcaide no. 5 ''). Relative water content and chlorophylls also decreased in 'Cleopatra'. This indicates a deeper effect of flooding in 'Cleopatra', which suffered changes during flooding that were also sustained during the recovery phase. This did not occur in the other two rootstocks, since they showed signs of recovery for those parameters that decreased during waterlogging.

A novel concurrent approach for multiclass scenario discovery using Multivariate Regression Trees: Exploring spatial inequality patterns in the Vietnam Mekong Delta under uncertainty	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Model-based decision support; Fairness; Adaptation; Deep uncertainty; Equity	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; DECISION-MAKING; FUTURE; MODEL; POLICY; RICE; FLOODPLAINS; DIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK	To support equitable planning, model-based analyses can be used to explore inequality patterns arising from different scenarios. Scenario discovery is increasingly used to extract insights from ensembles of simulation. Here, we apply two scenario discovery approaches for unraveling inequality patterns and their drivers, with an application to spatial inequality of farms profitability in the Vietnam Mekong Delta. First, we follow an established sequential approach where we begin with clustering the inequality patterns from the simulation results and next identify model input subspaces that best explain each cluster. Second, we propose a novel concurrent approach using Multivariate Regression Trees to simultaneously classify inequality patterns and identify their corresponding input subspaces. Both approaches have comparable output space separability performance. The concurrent approach yields significantly better input space separability, but this comes at the expense of having a larger number of subspaces, requiring analysts to make extra effort to distill policy-relevant insights.

The earthquake hazard map was derived from a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. The mean decrease Gini (MDG) method was implemented to determine the relative importance of effective factors on the spatial occurrence of each of the four hazards. Area under the curve (AUC) plots, based on a validation dataset, were created for the maps generated using the three algorithms to compare the results. The random forest model had the highest predictive accuracy, with AUC values of 0.994, 0.982, and 0.885 for gully erosion, flooding, and forest fires, respectively. Approximately 41%, 40%, 28%, and 3% of the study area are at risk of forest fires, earthquakes, floods, and gully erosion, respectively.

Estimating extended time series of ED is, however, scientifically challenging because of the paucity of long-term high-resolution pluviometric observations. This research presents the longest ED time series reconstruction (1701-2019) in northwest Italy (Piedmont region) to date, which is analysed to identify damaging hydrological periods. With this aim, we developed a model consistent with a sample (1981-2015) of detailed novel Revised Universal Soil Loss Erosion-based high-resolution data and documentary hydrological extreme records. The modelled data show a noticeable rising trend in ED from 1897 onwards, together with an increase of extreme values for return periods of 10 and 50 years, consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme rainfall. We also suggest the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation may be associated with rainfall extremes in Piedmont.

Understanding the risk as a social construction, evaluation of the modification results proves to be crucial in order to improve the exposed population's adaptation. The use of indices is one of the several methods used to carry carry through those evaluations. In the present research we used a replica of the SOVI (R) (Social Vulnerability Index), one of the most used worldwide indices and its adaptation has been implemented in an area of special sensitivity for floods: the Mediterranean coast in the Region of Murcia and the Valencian Community (Spain). The results obtained show a greater social vulnerability in non-floodable census sections than in those that can be flooded and reveal a pattern of social inequality in areas where the hydrographic network presents an ephemeral and sudden runoff such as the ramblas.

A warming and drying trend was seen in Xiongan New Area during 1961-2018, as evidenced by the increase in the number of high-temperature days and the maximum rainfall intensity per hour, a decrease in surface water resources and groundwater levels, a reduction in wind speeds, and weakening of the self-purification capacity of the atmosphere. It is estimated that the areas at high risk of floods and heats will increase by 15.7 and 15.6% in around 2035 relative to 1986-2005, respectively. Although the runoff in the Daqing River Basin will increase, the construction of Xiongan New Area means that the imbalance between the supply and demand of water resources will remain. Climate change adaptation measures should therefore be improved in the planning and construction of Xiongan New Area. Finally, we discuss the approaches to address climate-related risks in this new area.

Hydrodynamics of urban runoff are simulated using the one-dimensional Storm Water Management Model. A genetic algorithm-based multiobjective optimization technique is employed to derive the optimal trade-off between physical performance and implementation costs under changing conditions. The results show that from a hydrological point of view, the dominant solution for flood mitigation is the pipe system due to its high efficiency in handling local overloading problems. However, if additional benefits of LID measures are taken into account, the optimal combination strategy shifts towards a higher share of LIDs. The relations revealed help to improve the planning and investment of alternative flood mitigation measures in an integrated system.

Simple ordinary least squares and decomposition analysis were then used to examine the effect of recurrent shocks on livelihood diversification. The results elicited several findings. Although findings from the constructed vulnerability indices revealed overall high risks of disasters, females were disproportionally more vulnerable to cattle rustling. Conversely, both natural hazard-induced and cattle rustling-driven shocks have a strong negative impact on livelihood diversification. This effect is invariant regardless of the perceived gender of the respondents. Decomposition results show that recurrent shocks have moderate influences on inter-gender income disparities, as a larger proportion of the inequalities are explained by demographic characteristics. The findings point to a number of policy recommendations, most notably that the disaster prevention and management strategies should prioritise interventions that have a direct bearing on an individual's economic, human, and social capitals.

However, the influences of gender on resilience at the household level remain largely unexplored. Using data gathered from households in informal settlements in Accra, Ghana, this paper examines the varying effects of flooding on male and female-headed households, gendered differences in resilience, as well as factors influencing these gendered differences. The research revealed that female-headed households had reduced capacities to prepare, cope and recover from the impacts of flooding due to their expected gender roles, relatively larger family sizes, care responsibilities, lower levels of employment, and limited access to resources. These findings show that gender sensitivity to recovery and resilience are key to disaster planning and management programmes, and so the driving forces should be considered in policymaking.

Forecasting Water Inflow into the Tsimlyansk Reservoir during Spring Flood under Current Climate Conditions: Problems and Reproducibility	WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						spring flood; runoff forecast; climate changes; runoff formation		Studies of water balance and variations of water regime of rivers in the Don Basin have shown a steady trend toward a decrease in spring flood volumes and an increase in runoff volume in winter since the mid-1980s. More frequent thaws have resulted in that snowmelt runoff formation can be seen almost throughout winter. A decrease in soil moisture content in the late October along with a decrease in the maximal freezing depth in the major portion of the basin increases water losses during thaws and at the early stages of spring flood. At a considerable decrease in the water equivalent of snow cover along with an appreciable increase in water losses, spring flood will not occur in some years. Therefore, changes in the climate and anthropogenic load considerably reduce the reliability of relationships developed in the XX century and used to forecast the spring inflow into the Tsymlyansk Reservoir.

Therefore, the monitoring of Himalayas glacial change is of great significance in the aspects of climate change and disaster prevention and reduction. The Himalayas glacier outlines in China were extracted by ratio threshold and visual interpretation based on the Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data and glacier catalogue data. Based on the ASTER GDEM data, the distribution and change characteristics at different altitudes were studied, and the surface moraine was identified to study the influence of glacial area variations. In addition, Glaciers were divided into marine and continental glaciers in this study, and the distribution and changes of the two types of glaciers were analyzed. Also, a comprehensive analysis of a long time series was performed. The results showed that: (1) From 1990 to 2015, the glaciers in the study area showed an overall trend of melting; the annual melting speed gradually accelerated from 0.48%/a to 0.75%/a. The total melting glacial area was 828.16 km(2), and the melting rate of the glaciers in the western section was the highest, at 0.63%. (2) The total area of continental glaciers was larger than that of marine glaciers, and its reduction was relatively larger, too. (3) The average size of debris-covered glaciers was 10 times that of debris-free glaciers, but their rate of change (8.1%) was 1/2 of that of debris-free glaciers (17.8%). (4) The number of glaciers gradually decreased as the size of glaciers increased. The glaciers with grades of >50 km(2), 0.5 similar to 1 km(2), and 1 similar to 2 km(2) had large change rates, which were 20.1%, 19.1%, and 18.5%, respectively. In summary, the Himalayas glaciers in China were melting at an accelerated rate and their numbers were gradually decreasing from 1990 to 2015. The location, type, elevation, size and debris cover of a glacier are all important factors influencing glacier change. It has been found that the lower the elevation or the smaller the size of the glacier, the greater the likelihood of glacier ablation, and the debris can inhibit the melting of glaciers to a certain extent.

A large debris flow occurred during July 16-19, 2017 near the present snout of the Gangotri Glacier in the Garhwal Himalaya, India resulting in significant geomorphological changes in the vicinity. The present study assesses the applicability of multi-source remote sensing data from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) along with process-based modelling to understand and quantify glacier snout dynamics and morphological changes around Gangotri Glacier in the Garhwal Himalaya of India. We show that retreat rates of Gangotri Glacier snout along the lateral flowlines are (left flowline 29.6 m year(-1); right flowline 60.5 m year(-1)) are significantly higher compared to the central flowline (18.2 m year(-1)) during 2010-2020 leading to total loss in glacial ice area of 0.11 +/- 0.015 km(2). The snout dynamics and evolution of the new channel from the terminus of the adjoining Meru Glacier, connecting the moraine-dammed glacial lake and the Bhagirathi River, suggest that retreat of the Gangotri Glacier, intense precipitation and excessive seepage from the glacial lake were the important drivers of the debris flow in July 2017. The accumulated debris occupied an area of similar to 0.25 km(2) near the snout of the Gangotri Glacier and shifted Bhagirathi River by 36-200 +/- 9.35 m towards northeast. The synergistic analysis of pre-and post-event satellite, UAV and TLS-based digital elevation models (DEMs) and satellite images indicate that about similar to 8 +/- 0.066 x 10(6) m(3) of sediments were generated by the debris flow. The results from remote sensing data suggest that a significant portion (similar to 60%) of the deposited debris has been transported to the downstream areas between July 16-19, 2017 and October 2, 2017. Regular monitoring of the area is recommended, especially in light of climate change using earth observation data and ground measurements. The multi-source integrated framework implemented in this study is generic and can be applied for any debris flow or landslide studies in glaciated terrain. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of soil water content on the overturning resistance of young <i>Pinus</i> <i>Pinaster</i> in sandy soil	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Windstorm damage; Toppling; Soil water content; Anchorage; Soil shear strength; Pinus pinaster	SHEAR-STRENGTH PARAMETERS; STRESS-DILATANCY RELATION; PICEA-ABIES L.; ROOT REINFORCEMENT; UPLIFT CAPACITY; CRITICAL-STATE; UNSATURATED FLOW; SLOPE STABILITY; TREE ANCHORAGE; PILE GROUPS	Background and aims: The tree resistance to uprooting is crucial to face wind damage in temperate forest. Tree anchorage varies considerably with site conditions, species, and tree age. Only few studies have focused on the influence of the site soil properties on the tree anchorage. With ongoing climate change, the soil hydrologic conditions are changing in Europe due to higher precipitations during winter, with possible higher risk of wind damage in forests. Methods: This study investigates the role of soil hydrology on tree anchorage of Pinus pinaster in sandy soil with a combination of field experiments and simulations. Tree pulling experiments until root-soil system failure were performed for 12 Pinus pinaster of 14 years-old growing in podzol to measure the tree resistance to uprooting M-c for two contrasted soil water conditions. In addition, simulations were conducted to analyze how M-c changes during the progressive wetting of the layered soil. For that purpose, a new model was developed for M-c. This model also includes a sub-model for the shear mechanical strengths of the sandy soil layers and their variation with soil water content. The model was calibrated with different data sets: (1) the M-c-data obtained from the tree pulling experiments performed on 14 years-old Pinus pinaster; (2) the 3D root system architectures of the pulled trees; and (3) the soil shear mechanical strength as function of the soil water content measured in laboratory by direct shear tests and soil water retention curve measurements. After calibration,-calculations were performed when simulating a progressive soil wetting by water table increase or by water saturation front progression. Results: Field-data and simulations show that M-c depends little on soil water content outside the domain of complete soil saturation. Close to saturation, simulations show that M-c decreases drastically up to 40 % of its value. This is specific to sandy soil whose mechanical strength is mainly due to the capillarity forces between grains. As illustrated by simulations, the anchorage resistance results from two components. The first friction component slightly increases with soil water content. The second suction component decreases little with soil water content and drops down at saturation when all the interstitial water in the soil porous network merges. Conclusions: This loss of anchorage resistance at full saturation may increase considerably the risk of wind damage of forest growing in sandy soil as floods increase with climate change in Europe.

J	Pearson, C				Pearson, Clive			Liveability at Risk Rehearsing a Public Theology in the Anthropocene	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY			English	Article						liveability; Sydney; fire; pandemic; flood; extreme cities; theology		It is now recognized that the majority of people who will be adversely affected by climate change will live in cities. It is time for a public theology to explore how its resources might be put to use in the service of extreme cities in the era of the Anthropocene. The city of Sydney provides a rather surprising case study for such. Through 2019/2020 it was subject to succession of extreme heat, fire in its surrounds, followed by the pandemic and then five floods. It had just been deemed to be the world's third most liveable city. In these matters theology is not the lead discipline. It is seldom invoked and invited to be placed along many other fields of knowledge in this knot of transdisciplinary challenges. It has been claimed that the future in the Anthropocene is likely to be ugly and cities will be marked by precarity. It is time for a public theology to consider the potential plight of cities and develop ahead of time - in ordinary time - a pattern of understanding and moral practice. For that to be possible it is critical for such a theology to heed the theoretical work being done in the fields that comprise an Earth System science.

A framework for assessing the remaining life of storm surge barriers	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Flood defences; functional life; hydraulic structures; lifespan; remaining life; sea level rise; storm surge barriers		Over the course of the last century, storm surge barriers have been built in several countries and proven to be successful in preventing flooding. However, the operation, reliability, and remaining life of these structures have come under increased pressure due to changing demands, intensified utilisation, and climate change. Yet, there is relatively little known about how these factors affect the remaining life of storm surge barriers. To address this issue, a framework is presented to assess the impacts of external drivers on the remaining life in a systematic manner. The framework considers both the technical state and functional performance and uses scenarios to evaluate the impact of external drivers. The application of the framework is demonstrated for the Hollandsche IJssel barrier (the Netherlands). The results indicate that sea level rise (SLR) is the dominant physical driver. Even in moderate SLR scenarios, the lifespan of the barrier may end in the 2040s if the functional performance with respect to flood protection and navigation cannot be improved. Ultimately, the study demonstrates how the remaining life of storm surge barriers could be assessed systematically and the impact of external drivers on the remaining life could be evaluated.

The integration of natural hazard information and social media data could improve warning systems to enhance the awareness of disaster managers and citizens about emergency events. The news about landslide events in newspapers or crowdsourcing platforms allows fast observation, surveying and classification. Currently, few studies have been produced on the combination of social media data and traditional sensors. This gap indicates that it is unclear how their integration can effectively provide emergency managers with appropriate knowledge. In this work, rainfall, human lives, and earmarked fund data sources were correlated to "landslide news". Analysis was applied to obtain information about temporal (2010-2019) and spatial (regional and warning hydrological zone scale) distribution. The temporal distribution of the data shows a continuous increase from 2015 until 2019 for both landslide and rainfall events. The number of people involved and the amount of earmarked funds do not exhibit any clear trend. The spatial distribution displays good correlation between "landslide news", traditional sensors (e.g., pluviometers) and possible effects in term of fatalities. In addition, the cost of soil protection, in monetary terms, indicates the effects of events.

This study develops a probabilistic framework to evaluate heat waves and cold spells. As case studies, average daily temperatures of meteorological stations of the two cities (Tehran and Vancouver) from 1995 to 2016 are used to identify four main indicators including intensity, average intensity, duration, and the rate of the occurrence. In addition, probabilistic spatial analysis of the events is obtained through MODIS's land surface temperature product. To include possible uncertainties, the predictive probability distributions of the intensity and duration are derived using a Bayesian scheme and Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. The probability distributions of the indicators show that the most extreme temperature (lowest temperature) occurs during the cold spell. Reliability evaluations indicate that both cities are more likely to be affected by the cold spell than the heat wave. Results of this study can be used as a benchmark for heat wave/cold spell characterization. The developed approach can be applied to characterize other extreme weather events in any location.

We interrelate concepts from recent research on the climate-heritage-nexus with contemporary coastal climate adaptation projects to reveal some of the complex realities and nuances that are apparent on the ground, and to raise heritage concerns for future practice. Questioning the role that heritage plays in specific climate adaptation projects from Denmark and the Netherlands, two low-lying countries with long coastlines facing climate risks, we show the wide range of roles that heritage can play in climate adaptation planning and we propose a framework to conceptualise heritage in this context. The study shows the important role that climate imaginaries (i.e. depictions, affect, and ways of apprehending the climate past) play in climate adaptation projects, and reveals national and local differences. Finally, we discuss the knowledge gained from climate adaption projects in terms of developing dynamic responses to climate change, of working with rather than against landscape processes, and the potential role of heritage in creating climate-resilient living environments.

Little has been done, however, to assess the flood patterns and severity along its course. Here, the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests are used to identify long-term trends of precipitation and peak streamflow at multiple locations in the catchment. Then, flood susceptibility mapping is performed by the analytical hierarchy process, accounting for 14 geomorphic, hydraulic, and geologic factors. The analyses suggest a decline in total precipitation and peak flow discharges at most locations, consistently with the general climatic trend of the area, featuring a weakening summer monsoon. Nonetheless, a significant portion of the catchment area remains highly susceptible to flooding, with stream powers capable of mobilizing boulders up to 1 m in size in extraordinary floods. These results can support the work of engineers and policymakers dealing with floods in the study area, but the proposed methodology can also be applied to other fluvial catchments to evaluate the role of climate trends in modulating flood susceptibility.

Ports are developing the capacity to integrate climate change adaptation with strategic planning and making capital investments in infrastructure. Geospatial risk assessments have demonstrated utility for planning marine port terminal facilities. Such assessments have tended to be coarse and comprehensive (whole port cities) or narrow, site-specific and single-hazard approaches (single terminal or site scale). This study develops a methodology for major container port terminals on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States to advance a screening approach to sea level rise, identify exposure to terminals and associated surface transportation, and enable comparative assessment. The study leverages geospatial data, elevation, imagery, transportation databases, tide gauges, and sea level rise projections. The approach extends prior methods to quantify exposure across multiple ports and terminals. Hypsographs and modelled future tidal flooding are derived for each port.

Restoration is key to the persistence of these forests but conventional reforestation techniques, including the exclusive use of locally sourced seed and nursery-raised planting stock, are being reconsidered in terms of cost-effectiveness and ability to create climatically resilient forests. In this study, we examined the success of a 2-year-old direct seeding restoration project ofCorymbia citriodoraandEucalyptus tereticornisfrom one local and two nonlocal provenances. We established a field trial to compare germination rates ofE.tereticornisseed and seed-balls from the varying provenance sources in the field and in controlled laboratory growth chambers. We found no evidence of local provenance superiority in the field or in laboratory conditions. Periods of unseasonable rainfall and flooding may have constrainedE.tereticornisgermination in the field site. We conclude that direct seeding with seed-balls may represent an effective method for establishingC.citriodorain South East Queensland, and that the approach warrants further investigation with other restoration species. Matching species with site conditions should be an initial consideration before long-term revegetation investments are made.

As has been shown previously, hydrologic models are good at simulating rainfall-runoff processes on a large scale, e.g., over several hundred km(2), while hydraulic models are more advantageous for applications on smaller scales. In order to take advantages of these two types of models, this paper coupled a hydrologic model, the Xinanjing model (XAJ), with a hydraulic model, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated high-performance integrated hydraulic modelling system (HiPIMS). The study was completed in the Misai basin (797 km(2)), located in Zhejiang Province, China. The coupled XAJ-HiPIMS model was validated against observed flood events. The simulated results agree well with the data observed at the basin outlet. The study proves that a coupled hydrologic and hydraulic model is capable of providing flood information on a small scale for a large basin and shows the potential of the research.

While Jakarta has always experienced flooding from the coast and from its rivers, flooding is getting worse, and has dramatic effects on kampungs and their residents. At the same time, flood mitigation efforts by the government of Jakarta involve new infrastructures, such as sea walls and land reclamation, which interrupt livelihood practices in the kampungs and have led to violent evictions. Residents of North Jakarta's kampungs must negotiate the surprise impacts of both flooding and the government's attempts to manage flooding. In this article, we catalogue the social and material practices that support life and livelihoods in the contexts of these urban environmental transformations, drawing from fieldwork conducted in three North Jakarta kampungs and from recent critical geographical research about urban resilience and urban political ecologies. We describe these practices as everyday acts of resilience, reworking, and resistance. These everyday practices are social and material, drawing from and remaking social and material relations. Although everyday practices of resilience, reworking, and resistance require investments in social relations, we also demonstrate that the dividends filter through existing power structures in the kampungs.

J	Webber, JL; Fu, GT; Butler, D				Webber, James L.; Fu, Guangtao; Butler, David			Comparing cost-effectiveness of surface water flood management interventions in a UK catchment	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision support; resilience; surface water; sustainable drainage systems	RAPID ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; STORMWATER; DRAINAGE; ENGLAND; OPTIONS; PERFORMANCE; SUPPORT; MODELS	Despite significant consequences caused by recent events, surface water flooding has historically been of lower priority relative to fluvial and coastal risks in UK flood management. Legislation and research proposes a variety of innovative interventions to address this; however, widespread application of these remains a challenge due to a number of institutional, economic, and technical barriers. This research applies a framework capable of fast and high-resolution assessment of intervention cost-effectiveness as an opportunity to improve available evidence and encourage uptake of interventions through analysing permutations of type, scale, and distribution in urban catchments. Fast assessment of many scenarios is achieved using a cellular automata flood model and a simplified representation of interventions. Conventional and green strategies are examined across a range of design standard and high-magnitude rainfall events in an urban catchment. Results indicate high-volume rainwater capture interventions demonstrate a significant reduction in estimated annual damage costs, and localised surface water drainage interventions exhibit high cost-effectiveness for damage reduction. Analysis of performance across a wide range of return periods enhances available evidence for option comparison decision support and provides a basis for future resilience assessment of interventions.

Based on focus groups and interviews with the same households after floods in 2016 and 2017, we found a cumulative decline in assets through sale of livestock and borrowing, and almost all households evacuated short term to higher places. Three notable recent ways that vulnerable households use socio-hydrological landscapes to enhance their resilience to hazards were revealed. Firstly, local flood protection embankments were the main destination for evacuation and were highly valued as safe places, although they breached and failed to protect the land. Secondly, community organisations, formed mainly for livelihood enhancement, took initiatives to provide warnings, to help households relocate during floods, and to access relief and rehabilitation services. Thirdly, seasonal migration by men, particularly to urban areas, is an important element of long-term coping and resilience based on diversified livelihoods for about 70% of these rural households. Although the unintended use of infrastructure, social capital and urban opportunities all form part of coping and resilience strategies in hazardous riverine landscapes, the high mobility that they are based on is not supported by enabling policies.

Flood concerns are raised around the world in the events of rain. Flood forecasting, a typical nonstructural measure, was developed to help prevent repetitive flood damage. However, it is difficult to apply flood prediction techniques using training processes because training needs to be applied at every usage. Other techniques that use predicted rainfall data are also not appropriate for small watershed, such as single drainage area. Thus, in this paper, a flood prediction method is proposed by improving four criteria (50% water level, 70% water level, 100% water level, and first flooding of water pipes) in an attempt to reduce flooding in urban areas. The four criteria nodes are generated using a rainfall runoff simulation with synthetic rainfall at various durations. When applying real-time rainfall data, these nodes have the advantage of simple application. The improved flood nomograph made in this way is expected to help predict and prepare for rainstorms that can potentially cause flood damage.

J	Mathews, R; Hardman, M				Mathews, Richard; Hardman, Martin			Winter monitoring of damaged bridges: learning from the December 2015 floods in Cumbria, UK	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						bridges; floods & floodworks; sustainability		The December 2015 storms resulted in unprecedented damage to bridges in Northern England, UK. In Cumbria, the inspection of lower-priority structures was then delayed by continuing high water levels and the need to prioritise scarce diving resources to the repair works. Thus, full inspections were not completed until after the end of the summer river access period, leaving over 180 bridges that could not be repaired because rising river levels prevented safe access. This paper describes the risk-based strategy adopted to manage the monitoring and urgent repair of damaged bridges during the winter of 2016/2017. The strategy combined the engineering assessment of bridge condition and catchment-based river-level informatics to provide duty engineers with timely warning of river flows deemed likely to cause further risk, thus enabling them to call out inspection and maintenance engineers to assess the risks on-site and, where necessary, assure public safety by initiating bridge closures. The lessons learnt from the implementation of this strategy on this 10% sample of Cumbria's bridge stock will be used to inform the selection of measures for resilience against the effects of climate change and to develop county-wide emergency preparedness processes for all the highways network structures.

The proposed CAESAR-LISFLOOD system was applied to analyze flood inundation patterns of the Tonle Sap Lake using satellite images, as well as to compare the simulated inundation maps. The flow duration variability was also analyzed at the outlet point of the Mekong River basin based on the analysis results of CAESAR-LISFLOOD, according to the basin development. The results show that the CAESAR-LISFLOOD model produces acceptable flooding areas (8607 km(2)) compared with the satellite observations (9615 km(2)), and the flood inundation areas decrease gradually from 3.69 (10(3) km(2)) in the BS scenario to 3.54 (10(3) km(2)) in the FFS scenario. However, it was found that the annual average flow duration variability scenario at the Kratie point, presented in the MRC, does not significantly affect the flow duration downstream from the Kratie point.

They provide many benefits, including flood mitigation and sustenance for communities. The unique characteristics of wetlands make them vulnerable to natural and human-induced disturbances. Numerous factors, including industrialisation, urbanisation, and climate change, add to this phenomenon. The activities that threaten coastal wetlands in the world are relevant to coastal wetlands in Ghana. The Songor and Sakumo wetland catchments are international ecosystems endangered by land modifications and sea level rise. There are gaps in the body of knowledge that need investigation as regards underlying processes and transformation. This study assessed land use and land cover (LULC) changes between 1990 and 2020. The study used geospatial techniques and intensity analysis. LULC change results were from Landsat images (1990, 2000, 2011, and 2020). These changes were attributed to an increase in human activities. Changes in the Sakumo wetland catchment fell more into human-induced LULC categories, and vice versa for the Songor wetland catchment. The study recommends comprehensive methods of LULC change analysis. This would enhance biodiversity and allow the sustainable usage of wetland resources.

Estimating coastal flood damage costs to transit infrastructure under future sea level rise	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; TRANSPORTATION; UNCERTAINTY; RESILIENCE; PROTECTION	Future sea level rise (SLR) and associated increases in the frequency and intensity of coastal flooding poses significant threats to coastal communities and transit systems. Yet current literature and practice lack methods for estimating flood damage costs to transit systems. Here, we construct an event-specific flood damage cost estimation framework for transit systems, simulating separately flood ingress into underground spaces. We apply this framework to the MBTA rail transit system in Boston, estimating damages under several coastal flood events with SLR and project expected annualized losses (EAL) through 2100 with uncertain SLR. We estimate EALs to the MBTA system have doubled since 2008 to $24.4 M/year and are expected to reach $58 M/year by 2030 under all SLR scenarios. Our results suggest that absent adaptation schemes, particularly at tunnel ingress locations, coastal flood risk will continue to accelerate, potentially resulting in permanent inundation of underground and low-lying sections of the transit system. Coastal flood risk to transit infrastructure in Boston, USA, has more than doubled in terms of annual economic losses since 2008 and will double again by 2030, according to a cost estimation framework based on Monte Carlo simulations.

Dams and reservoirs are key tools for controlling and managing water resources; they have benefited human cultures in a variety of ways, including enhanced human health, increased food production, water supply for domestic and industrial use, economic growth, irrigation, hydro-power generation, and flood control. This study aims to compare the application of deep learning and conventional machine learning algorithms for predicting daily reservoir inflow. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been applied as a deep learning algorithm and boosted regression tree (BRT) has been implemented as a machine learning algorithm. Five statistical indices have been selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The selected statistical measurements are mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R-2), mean square error (MSE), Nash Sutcliffe Model Efficiency Coefficient (NSE), and the RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The findings showed that LSTM outperformed BRT with a significant difference in terms of accuracy.

Here, Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was introduced to analyze the impact of flood influencing factors. PLS-SEM integrated with four Machine Learning (ML) methods as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Radial Basis Function Neural network (RBFN). In addition, significant flood influencing factors from PLS-SEM analysis was taken as the input of ML models. Then SVM, MLPNN, KNN, and RBFN integrated with the PLS-SEM classifier to develop hybrid models for constructing FSM. The performance of models is assessed in terms of standard statistical methods. The performance of the achieved model is good having AUROC > 0.8 and PLS-SEM-SVM (AUROC = 0.978) perform superior than others. Thus, hybrid SVM model can be best utilized for flood susceptibility. This study provides the importance of mechanism for flood influencing factors and extends the application of proposed hybrid ML models to minimize flood risk.

Unexpected errors or sabotage can lead to blackouts, causing a significant loss for the public, businesses, and governments. Climate change and an increasing number of consequent natural disasters (e.g., bushfires and floods) are other emerging network resilience challenges. In this paper, we used network science to examine the topological resilience of national energy networks with two case studies of Australian gas and electricity networks. To measure the fragility and resilience of these energy networks, we assessed various topological features and theories of percolation. We found that both networks follow the degree distribution of power-law and the characteristics of a scale-free network. Then, using these models, we conducted node and edge removal experiments. The analysis identified the most critical nodes that can trigger cascading failure within the network upon a fault. The analysis results can be used by the network operators to improve network resilience through various mitigation strategies implemented on the identified critical nodes.

The WRF-VIC atmospheric-hydrological coupling model based on the data assimilation correction is constructed to carry out snowmelt runoff simulation research in alpine mountains. The results show that the WRF-VIC atmospheric-hydrological coupling model has better simulation results in non-flood season runoff, and the total simulation error value of the whole flood season was -81.85mm; and the data assimilation improves the runoff simulation effect of the WRF-VIC atmospheric-hydrological coupling model in the flood season, and the error is reduced from -81.85 mm to -68.86 mm.

In recent years, there has been a marked increase in ex-ante studies of index-based insurance as a financial risk management tool for agricultural risks. New and improved indices have emerged, and new methods for quantifying the yield-index relationship have been explored to minimise basis risk in contract design. Our review indicated that rainfall-followed by temperature-based indices were most prevalent, while indices based on droughts and floods, vegetation, soil moisture, humidity, and sunshine hours were underrepresented despite their demonstrated potentials. Ordinary least square-based correlation and linear regression methods dominated yield-index modelling, while methods addressing extremes such as quantile regression and copulas have increased prominence in developed countries recently. We highlighted several new research trends to guide future research studies, in particular, the use of remote sensing data and hydrological and crop modelling to address data scarcity, geographical basis risk, and climate change.

While reports show tremendous achievements, more people - globally - still lack even the basic service level especially in developing countries like Tanzania. The existing water supply systems (WSSs) are vulnerable to climate change impacts such as flooding, which are already affecting the livelihood and wellbeing of the people, prompting for more resilient societies. The current study assisted with a review of existing frameworks, proposes a social resilience mea-surement tool that was made relevant to Tanzania through pre-assessment, pre-testing, and a three-round Delphi process. The tool was further evaluated in Dar es salaam to show how it works. The final tool contains nine indicators organised in five mechanisms for measuring social resilience. The most significant indicators include community awareness, preventive health measures, mitigation plan, houses location, and community partici-pation. The tool provides a basis for prioritising measures that are useful in planning and budgeting processes to improve the social resilience for the country's WSSs and in other developing countries.

Among the diversity of flood risks in urban areas, direct damage to property has been extensively studied. A novel model approach (SFLOOD) to estimate flood damage to property in urban areas has been developed and presented herein. The model was conceptualised according to the knowledge of an insurance surveyor, acquired over many years on flood economic losses appraisals. It is a micro scale-, depthdamage- and GIS-based model where water depth is the only hydrodynamic variable considered as a damage driver. The model testing has been conducted through the direct comparison of computed damage and damage appraisals provided by the Spanish public insurance company, Consorcio de Compensacion de Seguros (CCS), for three actual flood events occurred in Barcelona (Spain). Although a variety of uncertainties related to the flood damage estimates have been revealed here, the model is able to predict the order of magnitude of the actual damages according to the results obtained.

First, Do No Harm: Evaluating the Vulnerability Reduction of Post-Disaster Home Buyout Programs	NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW			English	Article							SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROPERTY ACQUISITION; UNITED-STATES; RECOVERY; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK; DISASTER; HAZARDS; PLACE	Post-disaster home buyout programs are intended to reduce hazard vulnerability by facilitating the permanent relocation of people and property away from known hazardous areas. However, the effectiveness of home buyouts in reducing vulnerability has not been empirically evaluated. This study quantifies change-in-exposure to coastal flood hazards and social vulnerability among households that participated in a buyout program in New York State following Hurricane Sandy. Using a GIS-based overlay analysis, household vulnerability was evaluated before and after program participation. The authors found that 99% of the 323 households studied relocated to an area of higher social vulnerability and over 20% relocated to an area exposed to coastal flood hazards. These results suggest that significant uncertainty remains regarding the extent to which buyout programs reduce household vulnerability. More broadly, findings from this study raise questions about the use of buyout programs as policy tools for reducing hazard vulnerability and suggest that failure to carefully consider the dynamics of population relocation may result in the large-scale redistribution and shifting of vulnerability rather than its actively managed reduction.

Global change and physiological challenges for fish of the Amazon today and in the near future	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Review						Amazon formation; Fish diversity; Environmental adaptations; Hypoxia; DOC; lonoregulation; Acidic environments; Temperature tolerance	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; ACID-BASE REGULATION; TAMBAQUI COLOSSOMA-MACROPOMUM; FRESH-WATER FISH; TETRAS PARACHEIRODON-AXELRODI; ACUTE ENVIRONMENTAL HYPOXIA; OSCAR ASTRONOTUS-OCELLATUS; TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; BIOTIC LIGAND MODEL; LOW PH EXPOSURE	Amazonia is home to 15% (>2700, in 18 orders) of all the freshwater fish species of the world, many endemic to the region, has 65 million years of evolutionary history and accounts for 20% of all freshwater discharge to the oceans. These characteristics make Amazonia a unique region in the world. We review the geological history of the environment, its current biogeochemistry and the evolutionary forces that led to the present endemic fish species that are distributed amongst three very different water types: black waters [acidic, ion-poor, rich in dissolved organic carbon (DOC)], white waters (circumneutral, particle-rich) and clear waters (circumneutral, ion-poor, DOC-poor). The annual flood pulse is the major ecological driver for fish, providing feeding, breeding and migration opportunities, and profoundly affecting O-2, CO2 and DOC regimes. Owing to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures such as deforestation, pollution and governmental mismanagement. Amazonia is now in crisis. The environment is becoming hotter and drier, and more intense and frequent flood pulses are now occurring, with greater variation between high and low water levels. Current projections are that Amazon waters of the near future will be even hotter, more acidic, darker (i.e. more DOC, more suspended particles), higher in ions, higher in CO2 and lower in O-2, with many synergistic effects. We review current physiological information on Amazon fish, focusing on temperature tolerance and ionoregulatory strategies for dealing with acidic and ion-poor environments. We also discuss the influences of DOC and particles on gill function, the effects of high dissolved CO2 and low dissolved O-2, with emphasis on water- versus air-breathing mechanisms, and strategies for pH compensation. We conclude that future elevations in water temperature will be the most critical factor, eliminating many species. Climate change will likely favour predominantly water-breathing species with low routine metabolic rates, low temperature sensitivity of routine metabolic rates, high anaerobic capacity, high hypoxia tolerance and high thermal tolerance.

In the case of Dongting Lake, the typical river-lake system, we collected the water level from 1990 to 2019, spanning before and after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. This study was conducted to detect water level fluctuations in Dongting Lake and to quantify the relative influence of climate, land cover and dam construction on water levels. We defined the impact of the dam construction as the three inlets inflow of Yangtze River (In-YR), and four waters inflow of Hunan (In-HN). The Mann-Kendall (M-K) test revealed the trends and change points of water level fluctuations. Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to detect the direct and indirect effects of these factors on water level and quantify their relative importance. The MIKE21 hydrodynamic model reflected the spatial-temporal variability of water levels under the action of key driver. The results showed that the water level appeared a downward trend during 1990-2019 and the change point appeared in 2003; During 1990-2002, the significant factors were: precipitation (V = 0.469, P = 0.013), evaporation (V = -0.424, P = 0.029), non-agricultural cover (V = -0.334, P = 0.025), and agricultural cover (V = 0.235, P = 0.033); During 2003-2019, the significant factors were: In-YR (V = 0.436, P = 0.007), In-HN (V = 0.431, P = 0.012), and precipitation (V = 0.349, P = 0.045); The In-YR was the key factor affecting the changes of the water level during 1990-2019; Under the influence of In-YR, the most obvious fluctuation of water level was in the flood adjustment period (Jun-Aug) and the impoundment period (Sep-Nov) when the average declined by about 0.50 and 0.67 m, respectively. Our findings provide a new insight into how to better maintain the stability of river-water system water resources under the influence of multiple factors. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, these projections are usually associated with large uncertainties arising from different sources. A numerical modeling system including three emission scenarios (ESs), four climate models (CMs), four statistical downscaling (SD) methods, four hydrological modeling (HM) schemes, and four probability distribution (PD) functions was established in this study to project future extreme flow changes at basin scales. This modeling system was employed in the following three watersheds with different climatic and topographical characteristics in China: The Upper Ganjiang River basin (UGRB) in the humid region, the Laoha River basin (LRB) in the semi-arid region, and the Yellow River source region (YRSR) in the semi-humid region. Subsequently, the analysis of variance approach (ANOVA) was used to quantify the contribution of different uncertainty sources in extreme flow projections. Results show that extreme high flow was projected to increase in all basins. By contrast, extreme low flow would decrease in UGRB, and inconsistent change signals were found in LRB and YRSR. The ANOVA-based assessment reveals that CM is generally the dominant uncertainty source for mean monthly streamflow and extreme low flow projections. ES explains a large proportion of total uncertainty for extreme low flow projection in the 2060s in UGRB because of the large difference in non-precipitation frequency projected under different ESs. SD is the main uncertainty source in extreme high flow projection in UGRB where extreme precipitation events frequently occur. Compared with other basins, HM produces relatively high uncertainty in LRB due to its inferior performance in historical streamflow simulations. PD contributes a low percentage of uncertainty in extreme flow projections. Interactions among uncertainty sources even produce larger uncertainties than most individual sources. Although future extreme flow projections are associated with non-negligible uncertainties, the projected remarkable changes in extreme high and low flows indicate that stakeholders should take certain measures to mitigate flood risks in the three basins and alleviate drought risks in UGRB	[Zhang, Limin; Yuan, Fei; Ren, Liliang; Zhao, Chongxu; Shi, Jiayong; Liu, Yi; Jiang, Shanhu; Yang, Xiaoli; Liu, Shuya] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bing] Yellow River Conservancy Commiss, Hydrol Bur, 12 East Chengbei Rd, Zhengzhou 540004, Peoples R China; [Ren, Liliang] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab HydrologyWater Resources & Hydraul, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Hydrol & Water Resources Dept, 225 Guangzhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China	Hohai University; Hohai University; Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute	Yuan, F (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.	fyuan@hhu.edu.cn	Chen, Tao/ABB-5983-2022; Yang, Xiaoli/KGK-8051-2024		National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFA0601500]; Ministry of Science and Technology of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51779070]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019B10314, B200204029]	National Key Research and Development Program; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)	This study was sponsored by the National Key Research and Development Program (under Grant No. 2016YFA0601500) approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51779070); and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grand Nos. 2019B10314 and B200204029).		73	10	10	8	54	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA	0169-8095	1873-2895		ATMOS RES	Atmos.

Ecosystem services values at risk in the Atlantic coastal zone due to sea-level rise and socioeconomic development	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES			English	Article						Ecosystem service valuation; Meta-analitic function transfer; Climate change scenarios; Socioeconomic pathways; Country-level	CLIMATE-CHANGE RESEARCH; METAANALYSIS; SCENARIOS; WORLD	Uncertainties about the future extent of sea-level rise (SLR) and socioeconomic development will determine the future of coastal ecosystem services and values. This study analyzes the joint impact of flooding and socioeco-nomic development on the future ecosystem services and values in the Atlantic coastal zone by 2100. To this end, flood probability maps (using the Uncertainty Bathtub Model; uBTM) and local ecosystem service value (ESV) estimates (using meta-analytic based global ecosystem service value functions for Provisioning, Regulating & maintenance, and Cultural ecosystem services across 12 biomes) are derived for a wide combination of Repre-sentative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios to obtain future values of coastal ecosystem services (ES). Results show that the higher potential of ESV at risk is associated with RCP 8.5 and SSP5, i.e. the scenario associated with a narrative related to fossil-fueled development. For this scenario, by 2100, the coastal zone with the highest probable losses in Provisioning ESV is Europe (-5.9 euro billion/year), for Regulating & maintenance ESV this is North America (-6.0 euro billion/year) and for Cultural ESV this is South America (-21.3 euro billion/year). Countries facing highest relative risk of losing Provisioning ESV are the Netherlands (10.6 %), United States (7.4 %), and Mauritania (5.8 %). For Regulating & maintenance ESV, the top 3 countries impacted are Mauritania (17.6 %), the Netherlands (10.0 %) and Argentina (8.0 %). For Cultural ESV, the countries are Mexico (19.0 %), Denmark (18.1 %) and Sweden (15.6 %). Changes in ESV are expo-nentially related to flood risk and economic growth, such that small changes in flood or income lead to large changes in ESV. Unlike previous studies, the ESV functions used are dependent on time and local factors, such as population and income. Although population and income growth result in an increase in ESV, it also emphasizes the ecosystem service values at risk. Thus, sea-level rise and socioeconomic changes impact ecosystem services and values - directly affecting the well-being of the world population. The unequal distribution of coastal ecosystem service value losses across continents and countries highlighted in this work is important to identify what values are at risk and for whom. Adaptation measures and strategies can, in turn, be defined.	[Magalhaes Filho, L. N. L.; Roebeling, P. C.; de Lima, L.

Even though Alaska hosts 65% of U.S. wetlands, less than half of the wetlands in Alaska have been mapped by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) or other high-resolution wetlands protocols. The availability of time series satellite data and the development of machine learning algorithms have enabled the characterization of Arctic wetland inundation dynamics and vegetation types with limited ground data input. In this study, we built a semi-automatic process to generate sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) maps across the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska using random forest regression and 139 Sentinel-2 images taken in ice-free seasons from 2016 to 2019. With this, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of wetland inundation and explored their potential usage in determining NWI water regimes. The highest levels of surface water expression were detected in June, resulting from seasonal active layer thaw and snowmelt. Inundation was most variable in riverbeds, lake and pond margins, and depressional wetlands, where water levels fluctuate substantially between dry and wet seasons. NWI water regimes that indicate frequent inundation, such as permanently flooded wetlands, had high SWF values (SWF >= 90%), while those with infrequent inundation, such as temporarily flooded wetlands, had low SWF values (SWF < 10%). Vegetation types were also classified through the synergistic use of a vegetation index, water regimes, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, topographic data, and a random forest classifier. The random forest classification algorithms demonstrated good performance in classifying Arctic wetland vegetation types, with an overall accuracy of 0.87. Compared with NWI data produced in the 1980s, scrub-shrub wetlands appear to have increased from 91 to 258 km(2) over the last three decades, which is the largest percentage change (182%) among all vegetation types. However, additional field data are needed to confirm this shift in vegetation type. This study demonstrates the potential of using time series satellite data and machine learning algorithms in characterizing inundation dynamics and vegetation types of Arctic wetlands. This approach could aid in the creation and maintenance of wetland inventories, including the NWI, in Arctic regions and enable an improved understanding of long-term wetland dynamics.

However, the eastern Tanggula Mountains, which are the only area where lake-terminating glaciers are found within the Tibetan Plateau, have received little attention to date. In this study, to address this gap, we generated updated glacier boundaries and estimated the interdecadal area changes for 2000-2020 based on the interpretation of Landsat-5/8 and Sentinel-2 images. In addition, based on the method of digital elevation model (DEM) differencing, we quantified the changes in glacier thickness and mass balance using TanDEM-X radar data and SRTM DEM over almost the same periods. The final results show that the glaciers in the eastern Tanggula Mountains, as a whole, have experienced accelerated area shrinkage (with a rate of area loss increasing from -0.34 +/- 0.83 km(2) a(-1) to -0.93 +/- 0.81 km(2) a(-1) for 2000-2013 and 2013-2020, respectively) and accelerated ice thinning (changing from -0.19 +/- 0.05 m a(-1) and -0.53 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) for 2000-2012 and 2012-2020, respectively). Furthermore, the region-wide glacier mass balance was -0.16 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1) and -0.45 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1) for these two sub-periods, corresponding to a 1.8 times acceleration of mass loss rate. The average mass balance during 2000-2020 was -0.23 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1), which is equivalent to a rate of mass loss of -0.04 Gt a(-1). More specifically, within the region, the lake-terminating glaciers have exhibited more significant acceleration of area loss and mass loss, compared to the land-terminating glaciers. However, interestingly, the average thinning rate of the lake-terminating glaciers is always lower than that of the land-terminating glaciers over all study periods, which is in contrast with previous findings in other high mountain areas (e.g., the Himalaya Mountains). Field study and proglacial lakes monitoring suggest that the local topography plays a vital role in the evolution of the glacial lakes in this region, which further affects the glacier changes. Furthermore, the present status of the glacier changes in this region can be attributed to the long-term increase in air temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of glacier changes across the eastern Tanggula Mountains and will help to improve the understanding of the heterogeneous response of glaciers to climate change.

Spatial and interannual variability in the seasonal flood pulse is a fundamental ecological driver in these ecosystems. This study analyzes optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite to determine the extent and seasonal patterns of inundation over five years in the northern Pantanal, a Ramsar site renowned for its wildlife. The study site is bordered by the Cuiaba and Sao Lourenco rivers, each with distinct flow regimes. Inundation patterns were revealed with a combination of water indices, supervised classification of land cover, and a digital elevation model. Total extent of flooding was underestimated by the optical imagery, but open water bodies were readily delineated with the land cover classification.

Landslide susceptibility was analyzed by maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) using 11 conditioning factors. Potentially dangerous lakes for glacial lake outburst flood were identified based on volume, lake type, slope and distance from mother glacier. Rainfall induced flash flood conditioning factors were classified and ranked using weighted overlay approach to get flash flood risk map. About 237 km(2) is highly vulnerable to the rainfall induced flash floods, whereas, 259.36 km(2) was found high to moderately susceptible to landslides. Most of the settlement areas along the river banks, in and around geological faults are found in high risk zone. The residents of the catchment need to be cautious and appropriate logistic arrangements should be made before rainy season to reduce the fatality and infrastructure damage.

Located largely in Zambia, it is nevertheless a novel of the Zambezi watershed, and of hydrocolonial and southern African regional proportions. Encompassing both human and non-human narrators and protagonists, its centrepiece is the Kariba Dam, the largest hydro-electrical dam in the world at the time of its construction. This is a very rainy novel, alert to the region's histories of flooding and to the ever-heavier rainfall of accelerating climate change, in one of the regions of the world most susceptible to its present and coming effects. I focus on the novel's pluviality as material, historical and narrative mode, traced in its registers of water and wit, prescience and prophecy, as it surges, silts and drifts across the literary landscapes of African fiction.

Despite a growing body of research, there has never been a systematic review of the literature on buyout programs, although our ability to implement buyouts successfully relies on a thorough understanding of buyout policy, design, implementation, and impacts. In this systematic literature review of voluntary buyouts in the United States, we distill key learnings, identify remaining gaps, present avenues for future research, and make policy recommendations. We find that the buyout literature is nascent, but coalesces around the topics of buyout experience, buyout practice and implementation, housing policy, flood reduction, and justice and equity. Recommendations for future research include an increased emphasis on theory, the contexts in which buyouts occur, longitudinal studies, and more explicit recognition of researcher and disciplinary bias.

Projected incremental changes to extreme wind-driven wave heights for the twenty-first century	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TROPICAL CYCLONES; CLIMATE; MODELS; NEED	Global climate change will alter wind sea and swell waves, modifying the severity, frequency and impact of episodic coastal flooding and morphological change. Global-scale estimates of increases to coastal impacts have been typically attributed to sea level rise and not specifically to changes to waves on their own. This study provides a reduced complexity method for applying projected extreme wave changes to local scale impact studies. We use non-stationary extreme value analysis to distil an incremental change signal in extreme wave heights and associate this with a change in the frequency of events globally. Extreme wave heights are not projected to increase everywhere. We find that the largest increases will typically be experienced at higher latitudes, and that there is high ensemble model agreement on an increase (doubling of events) for the waters south of Australia, the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Guinea by the end of the twenty-first century.

Inspired by the 'smart cities' agenda, we propose the use of integrated stormwater inflow control to dynamically activate cloudburst conveyance infrastructure in the urban landscape as well as green storage elements more often than originally intended. This control facilitates synergy between sewers, green infrastructure and the urban landscape, and has lower environmental impacts than isolated control approaches. A simulated, yet realistic, case study in Copenhagen, Denmark, shows that combined sewage emissions can be eliminated or reduced substantially in this manner. Other potential benefits include increasing amenity value and educating citizens, for example. The results suggest that the proposed control concept potentially provides a viable path towards more resilient, liveable and sustainable cities.

The 2017 North Atlantic hurricane season induced record-breaking economic losses and caused hundreds of fatalities, and for many represents a presage of what the future holds under warmer tropical sea surface temperatures. This article focuses on one such major hurricane, Maria, and answers the question of how this event compares to the historical record of tropical storms that have assailed the island of Puerto Rico since 1898. Comparisons relied on interpolated weather station total rainfall and maximum 24-h rainfall intensities. Maria proved to have the greatest 24-h rain intensities among all storms recorded in Puerto Rico, yielding maximum 24-h recurrence intervals greater than 250 years for about 8% of the island.

WSE in a river is controlled by three main factors: discharge, riverbed geometry, and hydraulic roughness. In remote and poorly instrumented rivers, discharge and riverbed geometry are highly uncertain and WSE is therefore hard to predict. ICESat-2 laser altimetry provides accurate elevation transects across the river at very high spatial resolution (70 cm along track). This paper demonstrates how ICESat-2 elevation transects can be used to parameterize a basin-scale hydraulic model of a continental-scale river. The workflow is demonstrated for the transboundary Amur River in North-East Asia. Simulated WSE is subsequently validated against a large dataset of in situ and satellite altimetry observations, and we demonstrate that the model can reproduce available WSE observations throughout the basin with an accuracy of 1-2 m.

This may adversely affect the establishment of warm-season turf species, usually selected for low water consumption. A simulated waterlogging experiment was conducted at the University of Padua in northeastern Italy during the summers of 2017 and 2018. Four bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) cultivars (La Paloma, Transcontinental, SR 9554, and Jackpot), 'Pure Dynasty' seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz), and 'SWI 2000' buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.] were compared under waterlogging conditions. The response of the three warm-season species to four waterlogging events during establishment at two different seeding rates was investigated. The number of seedlings, percentage green coverage, and NDVI were measured. At the end of the experimental periods, the dry weights of the above-ground biomass and roots were also determined. All the cultivars tested demonstrated high tolerance to waterlogging in the early stages of establishment. Moreover, they produced a significantly higher number of seedlings per unit area when sown at the higher seeding rate.

However, ABM simulation results can be highly sensitive to a number of modeling choices. Here, we introduce an agent-based modeling framework to explore the impact of structural versus parametric choices of household flood aversion on modeled outcomes of flood risk in a hypothetical urban environment. We deploy three structural variants of the model that fundamentally differ in the manner in which households are assumed to interface with flood hazards (disamenity, avoidance, and protection), evaluating multiple model parameterizations within each structural variant. The structural variants lead to fundamentally different conclusions regarding the evolution of flood risk, indicating that the structural choices made regarding human representation in flood risk ABMs have substantial bearing on modeling insights and ought to be elevated from an overlooked to a critical aspect of future modeling efforts.

Information regarding flood effects on food security is of particular importance for humanitarian organizations and is especially valuable across Africa's rural areas that contribute to regional food supplies. We quantitatively evaluate where and to what extent flooding impacts food security across Africa, using a Granger causality analysis and panel modeling approaches. Within our modeled areas, we find that similar to 12% of the people that experienced food insecurity from 2009 to 2020 had their food security status affected by flooding. Furthermore, flooding and its associated mete-orological conditions can simultaneously degrade food security locally while enhancing it at regional spatial scales, leading to large variations in overall food security outcomes. Dedicated data collection at the intersection of flood events and associated food security measures across different spatial and temporal scales are required to better characterize the extent of flood impact and inform preparedness, response, and recovery needs.

Climate change is causing pluvial flooding, according to the newest IPCC report. This mostly affects urban areas in cities due to: (1) limited capacity of existing drainage systems during heavy-intensity rainfall over a short period of time and (2) limited space for ditches in city areas. Permeable pavements are, therefore, sustainable drainage solutions which combine road infrastructure with water infrastructure. Are permeable pavements a preferable sustainable solution? To answer that question, 24 respondents were interviewed. The interview study was based on a semi-structured interview methodology. A lessons-learned experience was gathered, and the following conclusions were contrived: Firstly, official guidelines on how to construct, consult, and maintain permeable pavements are required. Secondly, more contractors should be able to offer the same product. Finally, official guidelines on the relationship between the contractors are required. These three indicators were extracted from the study.

Amazon Sediment Transport and Accumulation Along the Continuum of Mixed Fluvial and Marine Processes	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 13, 2021	Annual Review of Marine Science		English	Review; Book Chapter						Amazon River; sediment transport; sediment accumulation; tidal river; mangrove shoreline; continental shelf	DEEP-SEA FAN; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; PHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS; TURBIDITY MAXIMUM; FLOODPLAIN LAKE; PEAK DISCHARGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH-AMERICA; PLUME REGION	Sediment transfer from land to ocean begins in coastal settings and, for large rivers such as the Amazon, has dramatic impacts over thousands of kilometers covering diverse environmental conditions. In the relatively natural Amazon tidal river, combinations of fluvial and marine processes transition toward the ocean, affecting the transport and accumulation of sediment in floodplains and tributary mouths. The enormous discharge of Amazon fresh water causes estuarine processes to occur on the continental shelf, where much sediment accumulation creates a large clinoform structure and where additional sediment accumulates along its shoreward boundary in tidal flats and mangrove forests. Some remaining Amazon sediment is transported beyond the region near the river mouth, and fluvial forces on it diminish. Numerous perturbations to Amazon sediment transport and accumulation occur naturally, but human actions will likely dominate future change, and now is the time to document, understand, and mitigate their impacts.

This widespread paradigm has become increasingly ineffective and needs radical transformation. A promising alternative strategy involves the development of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), which mimic natural processes to manage floods. In this article, the effects of SuDS, as a transitional pathway from conventional to sustainable flood management, are reviewed. Levels of development and support of SuDS in various contexts and at different scales within the European Union are also examined. Scholarly work to date has been limited and technically focused. The transition remains a local, slow, and mainly northern European phenomenon. The research attention on technical performance indicates a continuing need for evidence of the effectiveness of SuDS. Further research is needed to gain a broad-based perspective on the transformation process. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They are highly vulnerable and very likely to suffer losses and damages due to heat waves, droughts, wildfires, landslides, and extreme coastal events. To this date, however, there is no systematic understanding of how cities in Mediterranean Europe are preparing to adapt to these impacts. To address this question, we analyse local adaptation plans in 73 cities located in 51 regions across 9 European countries along the Mediterranean Sea (France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Croatia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta). We also investigate upper levels of planning to understand the influence of policy environments. Across the sample, 67 % of regions have adopted a plan, but only 30 % of the cities. The most common climate-related hazards these cities prepare for are extreme temperatures and rainfall, followed by drought and water scarcity, as well as floods and landslides. Without legal obligations, neither regional nor national adaptation policy frameworks seem to influence the development of urban plans. In some cases, cities are ahead of national policy. This paper sheds light on the progress of local adaptation planning in Mediterranean Europe and paves the way for further research in this climate-threatened geographical area.

J	Bukvic, A; Barnett, S				Bukvic, Anamaria; Barnett, Steven			Drivers of flood-induced relocation among coastal urban residents: Insight from the US east coast	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal; Flooding; Urban; Adaptation; Relocation; Migration	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HURRICANE SANDY; MIGRATION; DISASTER; KATRINA; IMPACT; MOVE; HOME	Many coastal urban areas are experiencing impacts of accelerated chronic and episodic flooding on the built environment and people's livelihoods and quality of life. These impacts sometimes exceed the households' adaptive and coping capacities to deal with flooding, prompting residents to consider relocation. It is unclear how urban dwellers living in flood-prone locations perceive this adaptation strategy and under what flood-driven circumstances they would consider permanently moving. This paper provides empirical evidence on relocation preferences among urban residents along the U.S. East Coast. It further explores how this decision is influenced by socioeconomic determinants, experiences with flood exposure, comprehensive concerns with flooding, and preferences for relocation destinations. We administered an online survey to 1450 residents living in flood-prone urban areas across multiple states, from New York to Florida, and analyzed the results using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results show that almost half of respondents would consider relocating due to coastal flooding, with only 13 percent declining this option. The results show that age and race, several determinants of place attachment, problem-solving capacity, and flood-related household- and community-level concerns play a significant role in willingness to relocate.

However, flood impacts on urban road connectivity are not yet well assessed due to inaccurate simulation of flood processes in urban areas where high-resolution data for drainage networks and gauged hydrological data are insufficient. Thus, this study assesses flood impacts on road network connectivity in an urban area of southern China through joint modeling of 1-D hydrodynamic processes in drainage networks and 2-D flood inundation processes on roads using MIKE Urban and MIKE 21. High-resolution DEM images of 5 m and a drainage network of 5635 pipelines were used for urban hydrological simulation. Flood depths were gauged for model calibration and validation by recruited volunteers in the context of citizen science. The results show that road network connectivity decreases as rainfall increases. More than 40% of road connectivity is lost in the study area when a 1-in-100-year return period rainfall occurs. The study results can help to inform more adaptive strategies for local flood control. The study methods are also applicable to improving urban hydrological modeling in broader regions.

This project used a community engaged approach to co-create an agent-based model geographically bounded to a reserve community to examine three community-requested simulations. Community members and researchers co-designed, built, and verified the model simulations: a contaminated water delivery truck; a Pow Wow where a waterborne infectious disease spreads; and a flood which restricts typical movement around the reserve for daily tasks and health care. The simulations' findings, displayed as both conventional and narrative outputs, revealed management areas where community adaptation and mitigation are needed, including enhancing health service provision in times of disease outbreaks or large community events, and creating back-up plans for overcoming flood impacts to ensure services are accessible for vulnerable members of the community. Recommendations for communities, researchers, and modelers are discussed.

With this in mind, HEC-HMS was calibrated to estimate excess-runoff potential of five watersheds and the model results showed a good agreement with the observed streamflow. The study revealed that due to the presence of rocky-outcrops, precipitous-topography and impervious-surfaces, Vishav, Lidder and Sandran are the major contributors of the excess-runoff among the 5 watersheds as compared to Bringi and Kuthar. For the model-efficacy, the excess-runoff potential and the social-vulnerability of the region were compared to the floodwater-depth observed during the 2014-flooding event. The comparison reveals that the flood-vulnerability assessment of the UJB are well corroborated by the observed floodwater levels and the Vishav watershed is most vulnerable. The findings of this study are expected to inform flood management plans in the UJB.

Trends in rainfall extremity and peak flood in Sabarmati River Basin, India	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article						Rainfall extremity; Rainfall indices; Peak river flood; Sabarmati river basin	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION; INCREASE; EVENTS; RUNOFF	It is important to recognize the trend of the extreme rainfall and its influence on peak flood event occurrences. This study analyzes the trends in the rainfall extremity and the trend in the peak river flood in the Sabarmati River basin of India and its sub-basins/sub-regions. Five indices have been considered for the assessment of extreme rainfall evaluation and trend detection. Results of the trend of each index is coherent with the trend of observed peak flood in Sabarmati River basin. The spatial distribution of trend of intense rainfall has been obtained by aggregating the spatial distribution of indices for maximum 1-day rainfall of the year (MR-1 day), and number/count of heavy rainfall days (Rheavy) in GIS in each sub-basin of the study area. It is concluded that the positive trend in the intense rainfall index govern the positive trend with a strong correlation in the peak river flood in the Sabarmati River sub-basins. The study will be helpful for infrastructure facilities and services such as storm water drain and water storage structure design and operation etc., and to prevent the damages due to extreme events in the river basin area.

It has resulted in widespread flooding and landslides with more than 400 casualties. The present study has implemented the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)-based Sentinel 1C band satellite data. The researchers have analyzed the remotely sensed data to examine the severely affected areas. The study area included Alappuzha, Kottayam, Thrissur, and Pathanamthitta districts. The daily and monthly precipitation data is acquired from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). During 2018, Kerala has experienced a severe escalation in the volume of rainfall from June onwards till September. The current study has analyzed the spatial and temporal variation in the extent of severe flooding in Kerala during the monsoon months of 2018. The south-central parts of Kerala are most severely impacted by flooding. The districts of Alappuzha and Kottayam were severely affected, followed by Thrissur and Pathanamthitta, moderate to low.

This article establishes a prediction system using feature sets with multiple data dimensions, including meteorological data and socio-economic data. Based on data of historical floods in 31 provinces and municipalities in China from 2006 to 2018, five machine learning methods are compared to predict the direct economic losses. Among them, GBR performs the best with a goodness-of-fit of 90%. Combined with the input-output (IO) model, the indirect economic losses of agriculture to other sectors are calculated, and the total economic losses caused by floods can be predicted effectively by using the GBR-IO model. The model has a strong generalization ability with a minimum requirement of 80 pieces of data. The results of the data show that in China, provinces heavily reliant on agriculture suffered the most with the proportion of direct economic losses to provincial GDP exceeding 1 & PTSTHOUSND;. Therefore, some policy implications are provided to assist the government to take timely pre-disaster preventive measures and conduct post-disaster risk management, thereby reducing the economic losses caused by floods.

Mexico, are studied through the analysis of observations and numerical simulations. The numerical ocean model used is the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) of the Marine Ecosystem Dynamics Modeling Laboratory of the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, and the meteorological forcing comes from high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The ocean simulations were carried out using unstructured meshes with the possibility of flooding and drying in their cells. Results of the numerical simulations were compared against observations. Considering the current mean sea level, an intense northern cold front event (or Norte) floods an area of 940 km(2) that is currently covered by mangroves. This indicates that Nortes are important in the irrigation of extensive mangrove areas. Under scenarios of sea level rise of 0.25. 0.50 and 0.75 in the flooded areas increase by 297, 1062 and 2152 km(2), representing a considerable increase in the areas flooded at Isla del Carmen. It is suggested to consider this situation in long-term planning.

The upper stream of the reservoir was characterized by minor changes in urbanization in recent decades, while several large reservoirs were built since 1975. To better explain the changes in floods, this paper used the nonstationary generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution by considering the impacts of climate change and human activity. The GEV parameters were expressed as functions of time, climate indices, and climate-reservoir index (CRI). By using CRI as the covariate, the performance of the nonstationary GEV distribution was much better than others. This paper also analyzed the risk of floods using design life level and annual average reliability methods. The reliability obtained from these methods can describe the effects of external indices on floods. Finally, the uncertainty analysis indicated that a nonstationary model might not be practical, and the large confidence intervals of the design flood implied that the results were meaningless. It is essential to build a deterministic relationship between parameters and covariates, and we should be prudent when using general circulation models outputs in extreme statistics.

Development of Return Period Stillwater Floodplains for the Northern Gulf of Mexico under the Coastal Dynamics of Sea Level Rise	JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING			English	Article							RESPONSE FUNCTION-APPROACH; STORM-SURGE; POTENTIAL IMPACT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; HURRICANE STRIKES; HAZARD; MODEL; WAVES; TEXAS	Rising seas increase the exposure, vulnerability, and thus the risk associated with hurricane storm surge flooding across the coastal floodplain. A methodology is applied to down select a suite of synthetic storms from recent flood insurance studies. The purpose is to force wind-wave and hurricane storm surge models of the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) coast (Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle) that represent the future landscape and derive the 1 and 0.2% annual chance floodplain for present-day and four sea-level-rise (SLR) scenarios. Vast new regions become part of the 100-year floodplain by the end of the century. In Mississippi, the present-day 500-year return period event is likely to be the 100-year event under an SLR of 1.2m. Throughout most of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, the present-day 500-year return period event becomes a 100-year event with just 0.5m of SLR. Results indicate the need to apply a coastal dynamic modeling approach to plan and prepare for the effects of SLR across the NGOM and other low-gradient coastal landscapes.

Flood Impacts on Net Ecosystem Exchange in the Midwestern and Southern United States in 2019	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						CO2; carbon cycle; NEE; GEOS model; NASA	ATMOSPHERIC CARBON; CLIMATE EXTREMES; CO2; PRECIPITATION; EMISSIONS; FLUXES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; UNCERTAINTY; VARIABILITY; DIOXIDE	Climate extremes such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, frosts, and windstorms add considerable variability to the global year-to-year increase in atmospheric CO2 through their influence on terrestrial ecosystems. While the impact of droughts on terrestrial ecosystems has received considerable attention, the response to flooding is not well understood. To improve upon this knowledge, the impact of the 2019 anomalously wet conditions over the Midwest and Southern US on CO2 vegetation fluxes is examined in the context of 2017-2018 when such precipitation anomalies were not observed. CO2 is simulated with NASA's Global Earth Observing System (GEOS) combined with the Low-order Flux Inversion, where fluxes of CO2 are estimated using a suite of remote sensing measurements including greenness, night lights, and fire radiative power as well as with a bias correction based on insitu observations. Net ecosystem exchange CO2 tracers are separated into the three regions covering the Midwest, South, and Eastern Texas and adjusted to match CO2 observations from towers located in Iowa, Mississippi, and Texas. Results indicate that for the Midwestern region consisting primarily of corn and soybeans crops, flooding contributes to a 15%-25% reduction of annual net carbon uptake in 2019 in comparison to 2017 and 2018. These results are supported by independent reports of changes in agricultural activity. For the Southern region, comprised mainly of non-crop vegetation, annual net carbon uptake is enhanced in 2019 by about 10%-20% in comparison to 2017 and 2018. These outcomes show the heterogeneity in effects that excess wetness can bring to diverse ecosystems. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main driver of climate change whose atmospheric concentration is governed by a mix of human emissions and absorption by land and ocean sinks. Understanding how these sinks will respond to climate change in the future, including in response to increasingly frequent extreme events like floods, is critical in setting reliable emission reduction targets and improving Earth system models. Here, the devastating flood of 2019 that affected the Midwestern and Southern US is examined with respect to its effects on the ability of land ecosystems to absorb CO2. The analysis is performed using NASA's GEOS model, which simulates CO2 concentrations based on a simple land model that had previously been adjusted to match global background insitu observations. In this study, fluxes are adjusted using CO2 observations from measurement towers in the U.S. Simulations covering the years of 2017-2019 are compared and indicate that parts of the affected region absorbed less CO2 in 2019 than in previous years. The results demonstrate the effects of floods on the carbon cycle are complex and warrant further study, which is needed to understand how land ecosystems will respond to climate change in the future.

Proxy reliability is advanced by an understanding of the modern hydrologic system and controls on calcite growth. Here we integrate monitoring of Cave CWN in central Texas with high-resolution imaging and delta O-1(8) analysis of Stalagmite CWN-4 to understand how regional hydroclimate changed during a rapid deglacial warming event - the transition from Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) to the Bolling-Allerod (BA) warm period. This event is recorded in CWN-4 as a rapid negative delta O-1(8) excursion of 1.7 parts per thousand over similar to 210 years (HS1-BA delta O-1(8) excursion = 'HBO'), followed by a 6-fold growth rate increase. Monitoring demonstrates that modern calcite grows during cool seasons, growth rates follow drip rate, and drip water and calcite delta O-1(8) reflect the delta O-1(8) of recharge. Because drip waters have interannual epi-karst residence times, their delta O-1(8) values are well-mixed averages of their Gulf of Mexico (GoM) moisture source delta O-1(8) values, which rapidly decreased during Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) melting events. Confocal laser fluorescence microscopy imaging indicates that growth lamina are seasonal within U-series age constraints. The timing of the HBO (14.75 +/- 0.08 to 14.54 +/- 0.08 ka), corresponds with 1) the onset of Bolling warming in Greenland (14.64 ka), 2) AMOC reinvigoration (similar to 14.61-14.25 ka), 3) Meltwater Pulse la (14.65-14.31 ka), and 4) Meltwater Flood 3 (MWF-3) - the most intense episode of LIS meltwater discharge into the GoM (14.97-14.46 ka). The rapid increase in growth rates following the HBO indicates an abrupt transition to a wetter hydroclimate in central Texas following these regional and global events. The HBO delta O-1(8) excursion occurred monotonically, consistent with meltwater discharge being continuous. This excursion also corresponds with climate change recognized across the HS1-BA transition in marine and terrestrial records influenced by changes in North Atlantic climate, AMOC, and ITCZ migrations. We infer that central Texas deglacial hydroclimate largely followed changes in AMOC, linked via meltwater input to the GoM. Periods of fast (slow) speleothem growth coincide with warmer (cooler) North Atlantic episodes, with the exception of the HS1 to BA transition. For this transition, slow growth rates during MWF-3 may reflect protracted cooling of GoM SST and corresponding atmospheric moisture reduction. The common timing and duration of the HBO with shifts toward wetter conditions across the HS1-BA transition in many northern Hemisphere climate records supports common ocean-atmosphere teleconnections related to AMOC intensity.

In this study, the effects of temperature and precipitation at key growth phases on yield formation of oats (Avena sativa L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were compared using the Finnish official variety trial data (VCU, Value for Cultivation and Use) and farm data (FD) for the period from 1976 to 2018. We examined data of the early growth (0-28 days after sowing), determination of grain number (0-21 days before heading), early grain filling (0-21 days after heading) and the whole growing period. The average yield potential of oats was 300-370 kg ha(-1) higher than that of barley until the turn of the century. Since 2007, the yield of barley has been on average 376 kg ha(-1) higher than that of oats (VCU data). In FD, the yield advantage of barley was evident 10 years earlier (starting from 1997). In the VCU data, there were few major differences in the yield potentials of oats and barley due to different weather events, but when significant differences occurred, they were in favor of oats. In practical farming (FD), the yields of barley were slightly but significantly higher than those of oats in most studied weather events. Oat yields were higher in the FD only when high precipitation occurred during early grain filling or on average during the whole growing period. The results indicate that the predicted higher precipitation and the increased risk of heavy rain events in the future warmer climate will threaten barley production more than oats, unless new flood tolerant varieties are introduced. Early sowing and cool early growth periods are beneficial to both crops. Barley is more sensitive than oats to delayed sowing and to an increase in the temperatures during early growth. During the periods of grain number determination and early grain filling, low temperatures resulted in significantly higher yields in oats than in barley in the VCU data, but at higher temperatures this difference disappeared. This indicates similar tolerance of slight temperature increases in both crops at these growth phases. Temperatures above 28 degrees C during the time frame of anthesis decreased the yields of both crops, with oat yields decreasing more than those of barley. This calls for introduction of new, heat tolerant varieties of both crops, but especially of oats, in the warmer future climate. When the growing period was longer than average or when the precipitation during the growing season was high, barley yields were significantly lower than those of oats in the VCU data and about equal to oats in the FD. Low and medium precipitation levels resulted in no differences in the yields of the two crops in any of the studied growth stages in the VCU data. This contradicts the assumption that oats need more water for yield formation than barley. Climate change will challenge crop production in Finland and globally. Availability of nationally and locally suitable crop varieties will help farmers to prepare and respond to climate change.

This was motivated by the fact that, due to the effects of climate change, the global configuration of the environmental matrix has suffered visible transformations in many places. Another important factor considered is related to the constant development noticed in the last few decades of European inland navigation, in general, and in the Lower Danube sector, in particular. From this perspective, the processes analysed were the wind speed at a 10 m height, the air temperature at a 2 m height, precipitation, and river discharge. The 30-year period of 1991-2020 was considered for analysis. The ERA5 reanalysis data were processed and analysed in the case of the first three processes, while for the river discharge, the data provided by the European Flood Awareness System were used. The emphasis was placed on the evolution of the extreme values and on the identification of the geographical locations with a higher probability of occurrence. The average values and the seasonal variations of the four processes were also considered. The results indicated that the maximum wind speed and air temperature values along the Lower Danube did not suffer significant changes in the last few decades. However, the values of the minimum air temperatures increased with an average value of about 0.8 ? per decade, and the same tendency was noticed also for the average temperatures. Regarding the precipitation, the trend indicated a tendency to decrease by about 0.5 mm per decade, while for the river discharge, a clear increase of more than 1200 m(3)/s corresponded to each ten-year period. Finally, it can be concluded that the present analysis provided a global and more comprehensive perspective of the recent environmental dynamics along the Lower Danube, delivering useful information for inland navigation, as well as for other human activities.

J	Seymen, M; Sahin, AS; Tanriverdi, B				Seymen, Musa; Sahin, Abdullah Samil; Tanriverdi, Omer Burak			Mitigation Effects of Proline and Glycine Betaine to Green Onion Under Flooding Stress	GESUNDE PFLANZEN			English	Article						Allium cepa L; Antioxidant enzyme; Color pigments; Photosynthesis activity; Growth	ABIOTIC STRESS; EXOGENOUS APPLICATION; GAS-EXCHANGE; GROWTH; PLANT; TOLERANCE; RESPONSES; DROUGHT; LEAVES; SOIL	Global climate change is increasing its negative impact on agricultural production day by day. Abiotic stress factors brought about by climate change cause significant losses in yield, quality, and plant growth. In addition to increasing the effects of drought and salinity with global warming, changes in precipitation regimes and flooding stresses have recently negatively affected agricultural areas. To avoid the negative effects of stress, proline (Pro) and glycine betaine (GB) applications are the subject of research as important applications. This study, it was aimed to determine the effects of Pro and GB doses on growth, physiological and biochemical parameters applied under conditions artificially created ten-day flooding stress in green onions. One full irrigation subject (I-100) and one stress subject (flooding), were created in the experiment. On the other hand, three different Pro doses (Pro(1)-1 mu M, Pro(2)-2 mu M, and Pro(3)-3 mu M) and three different GB doses (GB(50)-50 mu M, GB(100)-100 mu M, and GB(150)-150 mu M) administration and control were the other subjects of the study. Pro and GB applications were applied to the leaves as a spray twice. As a result of the study, flooding stress revealed 28% loss in leaf number, 43% plant fresh weight, and 32% plant dry weight loss. Malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxidase (H2O2), and leaf temperature (T leaf) flooding stress conditions were found to be the parameters that provide the most significant increase and define the stress. It was observed that Pro(2), Pro(3,) and GB(50) applications supported plant growth under full irrigation conditions. Besides, it was revealed that Pro(3) and GB(50) doses reduced the negative effects of flooding stress. It has been concluded that appropriate doses of Pro and GB applications in terms of sustainable agriculture are important applications in reducing the negative effects of stress.

However, due to a lack of long-term monitoring data, the onset and causes of ecosystem degradation are unclear. Here, we used chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in dated sediment cores from six lakes spanning the region to reconstruct changes in algae and cyano-bacterial HAB (harmful algal bloom) taxa alongside sedimentary nutrient flux measurements and his-torical archives. Sedimentary N fluxes are linked to changes in agriculture, while urbanization has had greater influences on P fluxes. Over the last 70 years algal and N2-fixing HAB pigments increased markedly in lakes (Luhu, Wanghu) that are strongly influenced by urbanization/industrialization. Algal assemblages in two other lakes (Futou, Honghu) changed gradually and responded primarily to agri-culture and associated N fluxes; diazotrophic HAB pigments were absent and the lakes retained macrophyte cover. Local dam installation had no discernible effect on pigment assemblages in three of the four lakes in the past 70 years, but in the two hydrologically-open lakes (Poyang, Dongting), increasing algal production was significantly related to the upstream installation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and to urban/industrial and agricultural stressors. Temperature only influenced phototrophs in the most degraded lakes (Luhu, Wanghu). This spatial and temporal overview identifies that nutrient pollution is the primary regional driver of lake phototrophs, but that diazotrophic HABs are stimulated by P-enriched urban wastewater pollution, and agriculturally-derived N pollution favors non-N2-fixing cyanobacteria. Despite negative effects of the Three Gorges project, free connection to the river appears to help mitigate excess HABs in freely connected lakes. Management thus needs to be tailored appro-priately to specific lake conditions and palaeolimnology can be valuable in identifying appropriate strategies.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Raffa, P				Raffa, Patrizio			Where is research on fossil fuels going in times of climate change? A perspective on chemical enhanced oil recovery	MRS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PREFORMED PARTICLE GEL; BRANCHED POLYACRYLAMIDES; RAFT POLYMERIZATION; FIELD APPLICATIONS; CIRCULAR ECONOMY; NANOPARTICLES; CHALLENGES; POLYMERS; FUTURE; FOAM	In a society where the global search for renewable and sustainable sources of energy, chemicals and materials has rapidly become a priority, due to the challenges posed by climate change, one may think that there is no place anymore for research regarding extraction and production of fossil fuels. However, there is no denying that coal, oil and gas still constitute the major source of energy worldwide by far, and humanity will be dependent on them still for decades. As a matter of fact, the global demand of fossil fuels is still increasing rather than decreasing. However, fossil resources are consumed at a much higher rate than they are generated. Only focusing on crude oil, the chances of finding new conventional reservoirs are nowadays low, and this conventional sources are quickly depleting, therefore it is necessary to turn more and more the attention to unconventional sources, such as carbonate reservoirs, tar sands, oil shales and deep off-shore reservoirs. Chemical enhanced oil recovery (cEOR) techniques are already well established in improving macroscopic and microscopic oil displacement, increasing oil production after primary and secondary methods are exhausted. However, these are mostly implemented in reservoirs that normally possess favorable conditions. Research can still contribute in making these processes more efficient and sustainable, especially for unconventional oil, for as long as we will need to extract fossil fuels. After supporting the idea that exploitation of fossil resources cannot stop just yet, this perspective article will highlight recent advances in the field of cEOR, mentioning new developments in traditional methods, such as polymer and surfactant flooding, as well as newer methods, such as nanoparticles, preformed particle gels, and smart waterflooding, plus the various possible new combinations (hybrid EOR). This paper will finally try to shortly outline future directions of cEOR research, with emphasis on sustainable methods, such as CO2 flooding combined with carbon capture and storage strategies, and newly available research tools, such as reservoir-on-a-chip and machine learning.

Sensitivity of Estuaries to Compound Flooding	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Compound hazard; Storm surge; Flood; CAESAR-Lisflood; Estuaries	SEA-LEVEL RISE; STORM-SURGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; EXTREME RAINFALL; UK ESTUARIES; RIVER FLOW; TIDE; INUNDATION; UNCERTAINTY	Fluvial and surge-tide extremes can occur synchronously resulting in compound flooding in estuaries, greatly intensifying the hazard. This flood risk has the potential to increase in the future as the frequency, phasing and/or intensity of these drivers change. Improved understanding of how extreme fluvial discharge and surge-tides interact will help inform future flood mitigation methodology. In this paper, therefore, we resolve for the first time intra-estuary sensitivities to fluvial and surge-tide extremes, for two contrasting UK estuaries (Humber and Dyfi). Model simulations at hyper-spatial resolution (< 50 m) using a 2D hydrodynamic model predicted compound flooding hazards based on: (1) present-day extreme events (worst on record); (2) present-day extreme events with shifted timings of the drivers to maximise flooding; and (3) modified drivers representing projected climate change. We found that in a small estuary with short-duration, high-intensity fluvial inputs (Dyfi), flood extent is sensitive to the relative timing of the fluvial and surge-tide drivers. In contrast, the relative timing of these drivers did not affect flooding in a larger estuary with a slower fluvial response to rainfall (Humber). In the Humber, extreme fluvial inputs during a compound hazard actually reduced maximum water depths in the outer estuary, compared with a surge-tide-only event. Projected future changes in these drivers by 2100 will increase compound flooding hazards: simulated sea-level rise scenarios predicted substantial and widespread flooding in both estuaries. However, projected increases in surge-tide behaved differently to sea-level rise of the same magnitude, resulting in a greater seawater influx and more flooding. Increased fluvial volumes were the weakest driver of estuarine flooding. In this paper we show how these interactions are complex and how the hydrodynamics vary considerably between different estuaries and sites within estuaries, making it difficult to generalise, use probabilistic or use 1D approaches for assessing compound flooding hazards. Hence, we contribute new knowledge and methods for catchment-to-coast impact modelling used for flood mitigation strategies.

Nevertheless, detailed records of changes in coastal vegetation composition and diversity in the Holocene, coupled with climate change and river evolution, remain unclear. To explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors on the coastal area of the Bohai Sea (BS) during the Holocene, we present high-resolution pollen and sediment grain size data obtained from a sediment core of the BS. The results reveal that two rapid and abrupt changes in salt marsh vegetation are linked with the river system changes. Within each event, a recurring pattern - starting with a decline in Cyperaceae, followed by an increase in Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae - suggests a successional process that is determined by the close relationship between Yellow River (YR) channel shifts and the wetland community dynamics. The phreatophyte Cyperaceae at the base of each sequence indicate lower saline conditions. Unchannelized river flow characterized the onset of the YR channel shift, caused a huge river-derived sediment accumulation in the floodplain and destroyed the sedges in the coastal depression. Along with the formation of a new channel, lateral migration of the lower channel stopped, and a new intertidal mudflat was formed. Pioneer species (Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia) were the first to colonize the bare zones of the lower and middle marsh areas. In addition, the pollen results revealed that the vegetation of the BS land area was dominated by broadleaved forests during the Early Holocene (8500-6500 BP) and by conifer and broadleaved forests in the Middle Holocene (6500-3500 BP), which was followed by an expansion of broadleaved trees (after 3500 BP). The pollen record indicated that a warmer Early and Late Holocene and colder Middle Holocene were consistent with previously reported temperature records for East Asia. The main driving factors of temperature variation in this region are insolation, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and greenhouse gases forcing.

Assessing Bandung's Governance Challenges of Water, Waste, and Climate Change: Lessons from Urban Indonesia	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bandung City; Water pollution; Water governance; Waste management; Climate change	RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CITIES; CITY; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; PROJECT; IMPACT; BASIN	This study assesses the gaps, opportunities, and priorities of Bandung in managing its water and waste challenges. The City Blueprint Approach is used to identify pressures, to measure the city's Integrated Water Resources Management performance, and to assess its governance. Based on the analyses of Bandung, 4 topics are discussed in more detail: 1) the transferability of the lessons from Bandung, 2) the challenges of solid waste management in Indonesian cities, 3) community-based sanitation, and 4) implications for informal settlements. The assessment reveals that Bandung's basic water services are largely met but flood risks are high and wastewater treatment is poorly covered, leading to large-scale pollution. This is amplified by extensive land-use change and poor solid waste collection and treatment, as waste is almost completely dumped in landfills. Proper solid waste handling will reduce landfill dependency. Slum areas are disproportionately affected by climate-related hazards and continuously under recognized in the discussion of cities' risk and vulnerability, while its dwellers are the most vulnerable members of the society. Bandung has started with slum area legalization which provides slum dwellers with legal security that protects their right to live as well as access to basic public infrastructures. Inadequate monitoring and uncoordinated financial source allocations are among the governance gaps. Governance is reactive and community involvement is low. Yet, Bandung exhibits the characteristics of a collaborative city with the potential to maximize its cross-stakeholder learning with supportive leadership. Bandung and other cities in Indonesia face multilevel governance gaps. Bandung is recommended to expand the cooperation of private, civil, and public actors and implement network governance and decentralized management approaches focusing on improving the implementing capacity, better monitoring, cocreation, and better exploration of the options for financial support.Integr Environ Assess Manag2020;00:1-11.

They rely on seasonal monsoon rains that inundate rice fields and reconnect water bodies. Species assemblages vary over time and space, but infrastructure developments and climate change are negatively impacting the timing and magnitude of the flood pulse as well as fish migration routes and populations. In lowland rice field landscapes of Cambodia, community fish refuges (CFRs) are used to maintain fish abundance and biodiversity, with varying success. There is little knowledge of the drivers of this variation to guide management interventions. We used beta diversity to explore the effectiveness of 40 CFRs in maintaining species abundance and diversity during the dry seasons from 2012 to 2015. Results show CFR connectivity to the floodplain is important and suggest the type of inlet/outlet influences fish retention. CFRs connected to a large area of rice fields during the wet season had lower losses in species abundance through the dry season. However, large CFRs, or those part of a larger body of water, had higher losses in species abundance. Key design features of CFRs must be coupled with strong management capacity to guide the conservation and fisheries strategy in the Mekong Basin.				s.freed@cgiar.org	Tilley, Alexander/P-2431-2019; Cagua, Edgar Fernando/J-3028-2014	Tilley, Alexander/0000-0002-6363-0945; sean, vichet/0009-0007-9881-078X; Freed, Sarah/0000-0001-8574-8218; Cagua, Edgar Fernando/0000-0001-5867-3687	CGIAR Trust Fund; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-442-IO-12-00001]; Feed the Future through USAID [AID-442-IO-16-00002]	CGIAR Trust Fund(CGIAR); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)CGIARNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Feed the Future through USAID(CGIAR)	This publication is made possible with kind support from GIZ and the Sustainable Aquaculture and Community Fish Refuge Project (SAFR) in Cambodia.

Flooding is the foremost challenge to agricultural productivity, and it is believed to become more intense under a changing climate. Flooding is a serious form of stress that significantly reduces crop yields, and future climatic anomalies are predicted to make the problem even worse in many areas of the world. To cope with the prevailing flooding stress, plants have developed different morphological and anatomical adaptations in their roots, aerenchyma cells, and leaves. Therefore, researchers are paying more attention to identifying developed and adopted molecular-based plant mechanisms with the objective of obtaining flooding-resistant cultivars. In this review, we discuss the various physiological, anatomical, and morphological adaptations (aerenchyma cells, ROL barriers (redial O2 loss), and adventitious roots) and the phytohormonal regulation in plants under flooding stress. This review comprises ongoing innovations and strategies to mitigate flooding stress, and it also provides new insights into how this knowledge can be used to improve productivity in the scenario of a rapidly changing climate and increasing flood intensity.

Planning costly measures requires proper insight into system risk effects. Especially in a riverine dike system, the risk contributions of individual assets to the system flood risks are not independent, because reinforcement of a dike upstream increases the risks downstream. Tactical plans define the planning of consecutive measures to implement a flood risk reduction strategy, which may take decades. They may differ due to choices such as a prioritization metric, planning conditions and budget. In this study, a method is developed to compare different tactics to prioritize and plan measures in interdependent systems of dikes to reduce risks most effectively and efficiently. A case study meant as a proof of concept was carried out for the reinforcement of about 500 km of dikes along the Rhine River branches in the Netherlands. We studied the effects of 12 different tactical plans on the aggregated risks over time. The economic risks differ by up to about 40%, and the risks on victims differ by up to 70 %. We conclude that tactical planning and corresponding decisions are important for reduction of time-aggregated flood risks.

However, flooding is a poorly understood natural hazard in arid and semi-arid areas and its management needs to address a set of challenges, some of which are unique to these zones. Hence, it is of great demand to develop a comprehensive understanding of Flood Risk Management (FRM) difficulties and needs that are significant in these regions. This review paper aimed to understand the current state of FRM in arid and semi-arid areas and to explore challenges existing in FRM of these zones, based on the authors' experiences from practice-based research. The study identified four main classes of challenges: (i) regional features and flood characteristics, (ii) operational challenges, (iii) technical challenges, and (iv) management/organizational challenges. It was then concluded that these FRM challenges are multidimensional and coupled together. After discussing the challenges, the study addressed requirements and provided an outlook on solutions, further improvements, and possibilities for FRM in these regions.

However, many countries such as Australia lack measuring systems to quantity vulnerability for hazard risk evaluation. Drawing on 41 indicators from multiple data sources at the finest spatial unit of the Australian census, we re-forged the Cutter's classic vulnerability measuring framework by involving the '4D' quantification of built environment (diversity, design, density and distance), and constructed the first nationwide fine-grained measures of vulnerability for urban and rural locales, respectively. Our measures of vulnerability include five themes-(1) socioeconomic status; (2) demographics and disability; (3) minority and languages; (4) housing characteristics; and (5) built environment-that were further used to assess the inequality of vulnerability to three widely affected natural hazards in Australia (wildfires, floods, and earthquakes). We found the inequality of vulnerability in the affected areas of the three hazards in eight capital cities are more significant than that of their rural counterparts.

With the further intensification of the impact of global warming, flood disasters have brought a more severe threat to the sustainable development of farmers' livelihoods. This paper therefore examines the livelihood resilience of farmers with different livelihood strategies in the region by constructing a livelihood resilience evaluation system based on three target levels: buffering capacity, Adaptation and restoration, and using a contribution model to identify the main contributing factors affecting the livelihood resilience of fa rmers. The following three conclusions were found: (1). The overall level of livelihood resilience of farmers in flood-affected areas in Hubei Province is not high, and the difference in livelihood resilience indices between farmers with different livelihood strategies is large; (2). Farming-led farmers and part-time balanced farmers can better adapt to external shocks brought about by floods; (3). The main contributing factors affecting the livelihood resilience of various types of farmers have Convergence.

However, the role of key controlling factors responsible for the frequency and landward extent of extreme storm surges is not yet fully understood. Here, we present a high-resolution sedimentary record of extreme storm surge flooding from the non-tidal southern Baltic Sea, spanning two periods: 3.6-2.9 ka BP and 0.7 ka BP until present. Sediments from coastal wetland, including sandy event layers, were analyzed by sedimentological (grain size, loss-on-ignition, micromorphology), geochronological (C-14), geochemical (XRF), mineralogical (heavy minerals) and micropaleontological (diatoms) methods. The results show that both periods were characterized by high-frequency of storm surge flooding, in order of 1.3-4.2 events per century. These periods correlate with phases of enhanced storminess in northwest Europe and took place during both rising and fluctuating sea levels. The study shows that the frequency and landward extent of coastal inundation, largely depended on the development of natural barriers (e.g. beach ridges and aeolian foredunes). Thus, in the context of the future coastal storm-surge hazard, the protection of existing coastal barriers and their morphology is essential.

Using an approach (from Bhalme and Mooley 1980) that generates separate indices for excess (wet) as well as negative (dry) rainfall shocks and adjusts for the level of persistence in monthly shocks, we find that both too much and too little rainfall are associated with lower relative female population. The results are robust to using alternative rainfall shock indices and different sets of fixed effects. We estimate about 1.156 million missing women due to differential effects of early-life rainfall shocks, which is about 3.01% of the total estimate of 38.46 million missing women (average over 1990, 2000 and 2010) from Bongaarts and Guilmoto (2015). Our results suggest the need for targeting aid for weather shocks towards girls, especially in regions with indicators suggesting stronger male preference. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Flood mitigation in coastal urban catchments using real-time stormwater infrastructure control and reinforcement learning	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article						real-time control; reinforcement learning; smart stormwater systems; urban flooding		Flooding in coastal cities is increasing due to climate change and sea-level rise, stressing the traditional stormwater systems these communities rely on. Automated real-time control (RTC) of these systems can improve performance, and creating control policies for smart stormwater systems is an active area of study. This research explores reinforcement learning (RL) to create control policies to mitigate flood risk. RL is trained using a model of hypothetical urban catchments with a tidal boundary and two retention ponds with controllable valves. RL's performance is compared to the passive system, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy, and a rule-based control strategy (RBC). RL learns to proactively manage pond levels using current and forecast conditions and reduced flooding by 32% over the passive system. Compared to the MPC approach using a physics-based model and genetic algorithm, RL achieved nearly the same flood reduction, just 3% less than MPC, with a significant 88x speedup in runtime. Compared to RBC, RL was able to quickly learn similar control strategies and reduced flooding by an additional 19%. This research demonstrates that RL can effectively control a simple system and offers a computationally efficient method that could scale to RTC of more complex stormwater systems.

This study presents an analysis of topsoil biogeochemistry within three floodplain forest stands with different levels of human alteration. Decreasing contents of soil organic carbon (OC) and microbial biomass were observed along the gradient from natural to plantation forest. High annual variations were observed in soil N contents and in microbial biomass, while comparable spatial variations were observed within the natural forest. High ground-water levels resulted in increased accumulation of available Na+ and SO42- in the natural forest soil, yet the concentrations of ions were at sub-saline levels. The increasing contents of available Mn, SO42- or Cl- had mostly positive effects on soil microbial activity across the sites, though the results indicate the existence of a certain ecological limit for soil microorganisms. Reintroduction of surface-water flooding should be considered in future forest and water management to promote the dilution of ions accumulated in soils and natural deposition of sediments rich in organic matter (OM) at the sites.

In this work, we investigate the temporal and geographical relationships between two long-term historical series of catalogued landslide occurrences and daily rainfall data in Umbria, a central Italian region, from 1928 to 2001. Moreover, we search for changes in the frequency and density of landslides, and in the characteristics of the associated rainfall events. Using a consolidated approach, partially modified, we find that the rainfall events that have produced rainfall-induced landslides in Umbria changed in space and time during observation period and between two considered sub-periods (1928-1975 and 1976-2001). In particular, we find that: (i) the monthly distribution of landslides associated with rainfall events is quite different than that of all landslides in the regional catalogue; (ii) the spatial and temporal distribution of REL changed from the older (most events occurred in winter) to the recent period (most events occurred in autumn); (iii) the recent most rainfall events associated with landslides are characterized by a lower cumulated rainfall and a shorter duration, sign of an increased propensity of the regional territory to produce landslides over time.

The review consists of an examination of the current practice and the various developments published in the literature. The focus is on relevant research where the effect of climate dynamics on the PMP are discussed, as well as statistical methods developed for estimating very large extreme precipitation including the PMP. The review includes interpretation of extreme events arising from the climate system, their physical mechanisms, and statistical properties, together with the effect of the uncertainty of several factors determining them, such as atmospheric moisture, its transport into storms and wind, and their future changes. These issues are examined as well as the underlying historical and proxy data. In addition, the procedures and guidelines established by some countries, states, and organizations for estimating the PMP are summarized. In doing so, attention was paid to whether the current guidelines and research published literature take into consideration the effects of the variability and change of climatic processes and the underlying uncertainties.

Generating new vulnerabilities and shaping adaptive capacities through the politics of climate-related resettlement in a Philippine coastal city	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Resettlement; Fairness; Climate Change; Displacement; Philippines	HOUSING MODIFICATIONS; INDUCED DISPLACEMENT; METRO MANILA; JUSTICE; IMPACTS; HAIYAN; RISKS; COMMUNITIES; RESILIENCE; FAIRNESS	Drawing on the adaptation, justice, and resettlement literatures, this study explores the prospects for procedural (who is involved, how they are selected) and distributive justice (how the outcomes are experienced by different groups) in a resettlement project in the coastal city of Iloilo in the Philippines. This project, which sought to reduce flood risks, required the resettlement of 3500 families. The city was lauded locally and internationally and the government intends to replicate it across the country. This study uses a mixed method approach, including 200 household surveys and interviews with government officials, NGO staff, and community members. It finds that while some households experience notable improvements in their housing quality, incomes and climate resilience, the resettlement process exacerbated intra-community inequality and exclusion. It also finds that the distribution of these benefits was a function of political power and pre-existing wealth discrepancies rather than of need. To avoid these mistakes in the future, governments and resettlement planners must take account of how inequality and asymmetries in power shape resettlement outcomes. To do this, questions of procedural, distributive and contextual justice must be brought to the fore.

The gradual increase in sea level has been slowly diminishing the Atlantic coastline by eroding beaches and worsening coastal flooding. Narrowing beach width, one of the most important attributes of beach quality, has been a major concern for policy makers, local residents and visitors as lower beach quality has environmental and economic consequences. Filling the beaches with sand under beach replenishment projects has been widely used to treat this problem. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the economic value of beach width using the past residential property prices in Hilton Head Island, SC. Spatial error hedonic price method was adopted to account for spatial dependency among error terms. The results of this study show that beach width has significant influence on the values of neighboring properties that are located within 633 feet of the shoreline. An additional foot of beach width would add as much as $3,012 to the value of an oceanfront residential property. Without an accurate estimation of the economic value of beach width, cost-benefit analyses of beach nourishment and other shoreline management projects would be incomplete.

The impacts of these flood events include physical damage to critical infrastructure, as well as significant losses caused by business interruption and general disruption to communities. Human losses and impacts can be life changing. This study identifies the current challenges and opportunities of managing flood risk in the city of Birmingham, drawing on a desk-based account of current flood risk management (FRM) practice and diagnostic evidence. This interrogation adopts the use of a flood resilience circle model' to consider ways to address the challenges in a methodological manner aligned to an integrated approach to flood risk management. Solutions aligned to the key FRM stages of prevention, preparation, response and recovery are provided. The findings will be of interest to policy makers and decision makers on how to address current weaknesses in FRM practices towards the prospect of a sustainable approach that improves the resilience of the city and delivers multiple benefits. Recommendations made include the adoption of a blue-green systems approach, the development of a new communication strategy aligned to motivating behaviour change, and improved flood forecasting especially for surface water flooding.

Neighbourhoods are not homogeneous in terms of their socio-economic and physical vulnerability to flooding and other climate related impacts resulting in diverse challenges. Working with communities to better identify their concerns, liabilities, and strengths in the face of climate challenges will help build resiliency for all residents of the Tampa Bay area. This research identifies the weaknesses in knowledge, preparedness and ability to adapt in two communities in Pinellas County, Florida: examining a neighbourhood that is socio-economically vulnerable and a neighbourhood that experiences only physical (locational) vulnerability. We also identify opportunities for inclusive disaster planning, climate adaptation plans and to increase resiliency through long-term interactions between residents, community leaders, and local officials.

There are several studies that show how the influence of socio-economic factors over local planning authorities seems to be the main reason for exposure increase. This paper explores the causes and consequences of inefficient flood risk governance along the Spanish Mediterranean coastal municipalities. For that purpose, national and regional flood management policies were contrasted with the outcomes of a spatial intersection between cadastral data at local level and floodable areas, for different return periods (10, 50, 100 and 500 years). The results demonstrate a significant growth in exposure due to inefficient spatial planning and flood reduction strategies.

A 'blue' ecocritical lens identifies Lavinia's alignment with aquatic imagery, and tracks the development of this imagery across four main phases in the play: human tears, a river, a flood, and a freeze. These phases broadly map onto different modes of ecological relations as the play explores alternative patterns of human-environmental interactions. Lavinia is reinterpreted as an active and independent complex ecosystem, and one capable of communicating through the same aquatic imagery which is utilised in the narrative to attempt to contain and commodify her. Titus's aquatic discourse finds parallels in our own climate crises, in ongoing problematic associations between women and nature, and in our need to generate new models of agency and ecological relations.

Dynamic monitoring of the distribution and composition of saltmarsh vegetation is an urgent need for understanding the balance of saltmarshes. Previous studies have examined the possibility of identifying the plant species of saltmarshes using Land Surface Phenology (LSP). However, balancing species identification with the timespan of the monitoring remains challenging, given that the available observations are limited by the frequent occurrence of cloudy weather and periodic tidal fluctuations in coastal areas. To overcome the difficulty, we first filtered out observations contaminated by cloud cover and tidal flooding, then proposed an intra-annual time-series model by incorporating inter-annual observations using the inter-calibrated Landsat observations, finally classified the plant species of saltmarshes using phenological parameters derived from the intra-annual time-series model. The annual changes of the three dominant plant species-Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), Suaeda salsa (S. salsa), and Phragmites australis (P. australis) during 2000-2020 in Jiangsu Province, the most abundant salt marsh area of China, were tracked. The results demonstrate the following: (i) The intrinsic phenological differences among the plant species (similar to 32 days between S. alterniflora and P. australis) are greater than the latitudinal and temporal phenological variations (9-24 days). Large-scale and long-term classification mapping using LSP was thus feasible. (ii) The annual classification maps achieved a favorable performance with an average overall accuracy of 84.8% with minor fluctuations of 5.5%. Sufficient available observations for the spring and autumn seasons (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.05) and for locations far from the sea (>240 m) were the reasons for this good performance. (iii) The saltmarsh vegetation was resilient to tidal flat reclamation on the Jiangsu coast, as indicated by a slight increase in the area from 300.30 to 336.38 km(2). However, this was concentrated within the Nature Reserve (38.3%), with the increasing dominance of two species: S. alterniflora (49.6%) and P. australis (42.7%). Special conservation measures are needed for S. salsa to prevent its continuing decrease and possible future disappearance.

The situation is particularly challenging in developing nations where poor communities are more vulnerable to the impacts of flooding. Consequently, this study investigated the impact of flooding on poor communities and poverty levels in Africa with particular reference to the Makoko community in Lagos State, South-West Region of Nigeria. A survey design was employed with the collection of data through an environmental structured audio interview questionnaire (ESAIQ). Three Hundred and Fifty-Eight participants located in the core six district areas of the community took part in the research. The impacts of flooding were found to be negative and a significant impediment to community development. Flooding was found to aggravate poverty levels and negatively impact educational status and community development. This study recommends more community-based approaches to help raise awareness and support the co-development of interventions that can help improve resilience.

The mathematical model presented for predicting the multiannual number of stormwater floods accounts for dynamic changes in the urban catchment in the subsequent years covered by the simulations. Logistic regression was applied to predict flooding occurring during rainfall events. The model may be applied to catchments with different characteristics. The assumed solution allows the development of early warning systems by modeling the occurrence of stormwater flooding in a studied catchment area based on the identification of the rainfall origin. To verify the simulations with a mathematical model, an innovative concept based on a hydrodynamic model is used; this concept includes the changes in the impervious area that occur during the simulation period.

However, the prevalence of univariate definitions and inability to identify low-likelihood events in short observations/simulations leave the knowledge on sequential extremes sparse. Leveraging two initial-condition large ensembles, we project future changes in historically unprecedented sequential flood-hot extremes in China. Results show that despite dozens of 1 in 50-year floods and hot extremes in more than 2,000 years of historical simulations, their sequenced occurrence within a week has no historical precedent. This out-of-ordinary configuration is projected to be increasingly possible across China, with earlier emergence and larger frequency increases expected in Southwest and Southeast China. The direction, spatial extent, and magnitude of projected changes in unprecedented sequential extremes cannot be explained by internal variability alone, though it has the potential to modulate human-caused changes in emergence timing and magnitude.

Catastrophic Drainage From the Northwestern Outlet of Glacial Lake Agassiz During the Younger Dryas	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						catastrophic flood; lake Agassiz; Northwest outlet; younger Dryas	LAURENTIDE ICE-SHEET; OUTBURST FLOODS; ALTAI MOUNTAINS; WISCONSINAN DEGLACIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MELTWATER; SASKATCHEWAN; ENTRAINMENT; CIRCULATION; DISCHARGE	Catastrophic meltwater drainage from glacial Lake Agassiz has been hypothesized as a trigger for large-scale ocean circulation change initiating the Younger Dryas cold reversal. Here we quantify the flood discharge that formed the northwestern outlet of Lake Agassiz using a one-dimensional step-backwater model and a zero-dimension gradual-incision model. Applying these two independent models, we estimate a peak discharge range of 1.8-2.5 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1) and a flood volume of similar to 21,000 km(3). Such a discharge can only be derived from Lake Agassiz rather than one of the two smaller regional glacial lakes: Churchill or Meadow. When coupled with existing ice margin chronologies, these results demonstrate that the northwestern outlet of Lake Agassiz provides a viable link for catastrophic meltwater to drain to the Arctic Ocean over a 6-9 month period during the Younger Dryas, though it is unclear whether this was near its beginning.

In accordance with this purpose, the precipitation map of the catchment was prepared using the Kriging method by assigning values, with the Schreiber formula. Then, the slope, aspect, distance to the stream, land use, geology, soil, and precipitation maps were classified according to the analytical hierarchy process, and consistency indices and consistency ratios were calculated; thus, the factors affecting the flood were ranked as precipitation (CI 0.324), distance to the stream (CI 0.207), slope (CI 0.168), geology (CI 0.101), soil (CI 0.091), land use (CI 0.087), and aspect (CI 0.022). In the last step, consistency indices calculated by the AHP method were superposed on the weighted sum method, and then flood risk analysis was performed.

We match thirtyone billion-dollar disasters with individual survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate the effect of extreme weather events on the subjective well-being of U.S. residents. Our results indicate that natural disasters have a negative and robust impact on subjective well-being in the affected communities, and that, on average, this impact peaks 6 months after the event, and then decays over time. We then investigate the attenuating impact of health care access, flood insurance, and governmental assistance programs and find a partial compensating role for risk-transfer and relief measures. We also find that stronger emotional and social support mitigates the negative impact of natural disasters.

The impact of floods is exacerbated by population density in nearshore urban areas, and combined with land conversion and urbanization, the vulnerability of coastal towns and public spaces in particular is significantly increased. The empirical analysis of a selected number of waterfront projects, namely the winners of the Mies Van Der Rohe Prize, highlighted the different morphological characteristics of public spaces, in relation to the approximation to the water body: near the shoreline, in and on water. The critical reading of selected architectures related to water is open to multiple insights, allowing to shift the design attention from the building to the public space on the waterfronts. The survey makes it possible to delineate contemporary features and lay the framework for urban development in coastal or riverside areas.

A critical discourse analysis was used involving a documentary analysis of UK national newspaper articles published on two disasters, Hurricane Harvey in the USA and the South Asian monsoon, in 2017. A reporting bias was found in favour of the number of articles published, the length of those articles, and duration of coverage for the global North disaster. Language used and imagery evoked also differed considerably. Whereas UK media coverage of the global North focused on shared cultural, economic and political values, coverage of the global South emphasised difference, reinforcing an "us" and "them" mentality based on the poor alignment of national/political interests. Such disparities are deeply problematic for informing the public about global matters of concern, creating empathy between nations, and building support for collective action.

This rapid urbanization increases the concentration of people and critical services in cities, which also upscale their exposure to acute shocks and long-term stresses such as floods, earthquakes, climate change or social dynamics. While all of these challenges are complex in themselves, in most cases, cities must face a combination of them. Resilience thinking demands cities plan holistically so that they are prepared for whatever shocks and stresses may arise. Although there is a set of frameworks aimed at building city resilience, frameworks specifically aimed at operationalizing the resilience-building process within cities remain undeveloped. This research begins to fill this gap by developing a Resilience Maturity Model (RMM) that provides cities with a roadmap for operationalizing the resilience-building process. For that purpose, the RMM defines a sequence of maturity stages and a set of policies that help cities to assess their current maturity stage and identify the policies that need to be implemented to improve their resilience level.

The Pearl River is the longest watercourse in southern China, and its lower reach has been identified as one of the world's most vulnerable regions for flood exposure. However, there is a complete lack of millennial-scale geological records of paleomegafloods for the future prediction of once-in-a-hundred (even once-in-a-thousand) year floods in southern China. Here, we identified a series of paleomegaflood deposits interbedded with wood-rich peat layers in the lower West Pearl River area. All paleoflood layers have been well dated using AMS 14C dating method. According to the regional correlation of the flood sequence, sediment characteristics and provenance analysis, there have been at least 7 megafloods corresponding to once-in-a-thousand-year events in the lower reaches of the West Pearl River during the past 6000 years, with an average return period of approximately 855 years. The identified paleomegafloods were coeval with periods of strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), indicating that weakening of the Asian summer monsoon, associated with enhanced ENSO variability, may have triggered abnormally high precipitation leading to flooding of exceptional magnitude in southern China. In addition, the most prominent paleomegafloods identified in the lower Pearl River coincided with intervals of lower precipitation and fewer storms in central-eastern China, indicating the intensification of the meridional "tripole" pattern of precipitation across eastern China during the latter half of the Holocene. Increased land use and deforestation over the last 2000 years have resulted in soil loss and rapid degradation of local primeval forest ecosystems, leading to more catastrophic flooding. Large amounts of rice pollen in the uppermost flood layer during the Song Dynasty indicate that this megaflood may have inundated a large area of cultivated land. The periodic occurrence of Holocene megafloods not only caused damage to human existence, but also affected the evolution of local civilization. This study reveals for the first time a series of Holocene millennial-scale megafloods and sheds new light on the importance of atmosphere-ocean interactions in the tropical Pacific and monsoon subtropical climate dynamics for precipitation anomalies in East Asia. Our data yield valuable information for future research into climate extremes and hazard prevention.

Understanding the occurrence of the natural disasters and their spatio-temporal variation characters is crucial for sustainable of our society. Therefore, based on the collection and collation of historical documents, and adopting mathematical statistics, Kriging interpolation, correlation analysis and other methods, we systematically explored the meteorological disasters in Henan Province during the past two millennia in analyzing their spatio-temporal distribution characters and driving forces. The results demonstrate that there were five major types of meteorological disasters in Henan Province, including drought, flood, hails, low temperature and frost and insect pests, which presented obvious spatio-temporal variations and have occurred frequently during the past two millennia. According to the historical documents, the major meteorological disasters occurred 1,929 times in Henan from 221 BCE to 2000 CE. On the whole, the disaster frequency show that the occurrence cycle of the meteorological disasters has obvious changes, which mainly occurred in the middle and late stages during the past two millennia, especially after 1300 CE. Furthermore, we also find that the variation of meteorological disaster events is consistent with the variation of temperature in eastern China and the frequency of meteorological disaster increases in the cold period, but decreases in the warm period. In addition, there are obvious differences in the spatial distribution of the major meteorological disaster, which were mainly distributed in the northwest and southern part region of the Henan Province before 1911 CE. While after 1911 CE, the northern and southeastern parts were the meteorological disaster-prone areas in this region during this period. Spatial correlation analysis of each meteorological disaster before and after 1911 CE points out the droughts disaster frequency-occurring district has transferred in different periods, while the hail and low temperature and frost disasters just have a smaller transferred during these two periods. Conversely, the frequency-occurring districts of floods and insect pest disasters have no obviously transferred in different periods. These results can provide an important scientific basis for governmental decision makers and local people to prevent and mitigate meteorological disaster in the future.

Our research on the closed elongated depressions (CEDs) of the Jedwabno test field (Szuc site, north-east Poland) focuses on explaining their origins and their post-glacial history. This region was covered by an ice sheet and glacitectonically active during the Vistulian, and at least some surface fractures are possible witnesses to this activity. Using geomorphological mapping, sedimentological and geophysical research, we assumed it was related that the origin of these features here is associated with groundwater migration at the end of the Vistulian glaciation or later when groundwater flow intensified due to a rapid climate warming that caused permafrost to melt. The thawing of permafrost caused to transition from continuous permafrost to discontinuous, which in turn created groundwater flow that was probably responsible for the development of the surface cracks (fractures). Radiocarbon, palaeobiological (pollen, Cladocera) and geochemical studies allowed for an estimation of the formation time of these unique surface cracks in the Older Dryas. Prevailing conditions were also reconstructed for the later dynamic changes of the end of the Late Vistulian glaciation and in the Late Holocene until the Subatlantic Period (Megalayan stage). The surface cracks with steep slopes, despite their small area, are extraordinary sedimentation traps that have, in a special way, retained an almost complete record of the environmental and climate changes of the Late Glacial. There are sedimentological gaps in the Holocene, especially after the Preboreal (old part of the Greenlandian Stage), caused by changes in water levels, aeolian processes and human activity. The research results allowed for the recognition of the morphological effects of permafrost thawing, which caused the development of surface cracks during the Older Dryas. Prevailing conditions were also reconstructed for the later dynamic changes of the end of the Late Vistulian glaciation and in the Late Holocene until the Subatlantic Period (Megalayan stage).

Therefore, the current study examines the role of Natural Resources (NTR), Globalization (GLB), and Renewable Energy Consumption (REC) in Environmental Pollution (CO2). Moreover, this study employed a sophisticated timeseries estimate technique called Bootstrap ARDL to consider pivotal factors inside a Chinese setting. The BARDL shows the results of NTR explaining CO2 as positive and significant, GLB explaining CO2 as positive and significant, and REC explaining CO2 as negative and significant in both the long and short run. No matter how important the elements under study are to a nation's economy, they all contribute to CO2 levels either rising or falling. Therefore, it is recommended that based on the respective significance, proper planning, and subsequent execution must be done regarding these factors.

An improved understanding of the causes of changing impacts is therefore needed, but has been hampered by a lack of empirical data(4,5). On the basis of a global dataset of 45 pairs of events that occurred within the same area, we show that risk management generally reduces the impacts of floods and droughts but faces difficulties in reducing the impacts of unprecedented events of a magnitude not previously experienced. If the second event was much more hazardous than the first, its impact was almost always higher. This is because management was not designed to deal with such extreme events: for example, they exceeded the design levels of levees and reservoirs. In two success stories, the impact of the second, more hazardous, event was lower, as a result of improved risk management governance and high investment in integrated management. The observed difficulty of managing unprecedented events is alarming, given that more extreme hydrological events are projected owing to climate change(3).

To stem flood losses, local floodplain managers make decisions on how best to mitigate, prepare, and respond to flood hazards. Using quantitative and qualitative data gathered from interviews with 200 floodplain managers in the United States, this study explores the extent to which local communities are concerned about floods, perceptions of communities' ability to mitigate, prepare, and respond to floods, as well as the factors contributing to communities' perceptions of their ability to mitigate, prepare, and respond to floods. Findings indicate that floodplain managers generally perceived their communities to be very or somewhat concerned and prepared for floods. Floodplain managers also perceived their communities' ability to mitigate and respond to floods as being good. Lastly, the findings show that participation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Community Rating System was positively associated with floodplain managers' perceptions of their community's ability to mitigate, prepare, and respond to floods.

Future Changes in Snowpack, Snowmelt, and Runoff Potential Extremes Over North America	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme events; snowpack; snowmelt; climate change; regional climate model; NA-CORDEX	REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL; CHANGE IMPACTS; WATER EQUIVALENT; FLOOD; RIVER; HEMISPHERE; PRECIPITATION; TRENDS; UNCERTAINTY; TEMPERATURE	Snowpack and snowmelt-driven extreme events (e.g., floods) have large societal consequences including infrastructure failures. However, it is not well understood how projected changes in the snow-related extremes differ across North America. Using dynamically downscaled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, we found that the magnitudes of extreme snow water equivalent, snowmelt, and runoff potential (RP; snowmelt plus precipitation) decrease by 72%, 73%, and 45%, respectively, over the continental United States and southern Canada but increase by up to 8%, 53%, and 41% in Alaska and northern Canada by the late 21st century. In California and the Pacific Northwest, there is a notable increase in extreme RP by 21% contrary to a decrease in snowmelt by 31% by the late century. These regions could be vulnerable to larger rain-on-snow floods in a warmer climate. Regions with a large variability among RCM ensembles are identified, which require further investigation to reduce the regional uncertainties.

This work analyses the stormwater management master plan (SWMP) in developed and developing cities. Using content analysis, three SWMPs were compared: Joinville - SC and Porto Alegre - RS, in Brazil, and the plan and Maia city, in Portugal. NVivo version 11 software was used. Nodes were categorized and results are presented. Content analysis allowed comparative socio-hydrology by studying different coupled human-water systems across different locations. SWMPs are situated at different levels of planning with respect to water resources management: strategic and operational levels converge on the main objective, tracing different strategies related to conceptual and regulatory points of view. The SWMP is a document whose scope extends beyond mapping technical needs; it involves an element of public planning and administration to avoid the loss of lives and economics, as well as to increase resilience, and it is an essential document for urban water governance.

This study examined the relationship and reciprocal predictability between two theoretical constructs-risk perception attitude (RPA) and information-seeking efficacy (ISE)-in regard to pluvial floods. In addition, this study extended these theoretical constructs to investigate differences in RPA and ISE among potential audience segments, providing practitioners with applicable insights for designing effective flood prevention and risk management campaigns. Analysis of data from 716 residents in south Louisiana revealed a statistically strong relationship between RPA and ISE. This research also identified specific audience segments that would benefit from an increase in RPA and ISE concerning floods. These meaningful findings inform a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between RPA and ISE and guide future disaster preparation campaigns and policies.

J	Nelson, DR; Bledsoe, BP; Shepherd, JM				Nelson, Donald R.; Bledsoe, Brian P.; Shepherd, J. Marshall			From hubris to humility: Transcending original sin in managing hydroclimatic risk	ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Hydroclimate; Climate risk; Interdisciplinarity	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; TRENDS	The characteristics of hydroclimatic risk in the 21st Century are rapidly changing. Increases in extreme weather events and population densities alter exposure to floods and droughts. Water infrastructure is unable to keep pace and deterministic models can mislead. Yet, predominant strategies for managing risk continue to follow historical precedent, striving to tame nature's outbursts and mitigate disasters through conventional engineering structures. In this Viewpoint article, scholars from three disciplines address underlying limitations in contemporary risk management, each of which is rooted in the concept of hubris. They argue that effective risk management must extend beyond hubris-thinking to an approach based on humility. Extending from the three types of limitations-described as Disconnect from Nature, Engineers of a Fixed Nature. and Modelers of Nature- a collective and synthetic consideration provides insights into potential pathways forward for both science and practice. More satisfactory strategies for managing hydroclimatic risk will require a shift from a hubris-based paradigm to a more humility-based approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lavery, C				Lavery, Charne			Antarctica and Africa: Narrating alternate futures	POLAR RECORD			English	Editorial Material						Antarctica; Africa; Literature; Future; Anthropocene	CLIMATE	Africa has been marginalised in the history of Antarctica, a politics of exclusion (with the exception of Apartheid South Africa) reflected unsurprisingly by a dearth of imaginative, cultural and literary engagement. But, in addition to paleontological and geophysical links, Antarctica has increasing interrelationship with Africa's climactic future. Africa is widely predicted to be the continent worst affected by climate change, and Antarctica and its surrounding Southern Ocean are uniquely implicated as crucial mediators for changing global climate and currents, rainfall patterns, and sea level rise. This paper proposes that there are in fact several ways of imagining the far South from Africa in literary and cultural terms. One is to read against the grain for southern-directed perspectives in existing African literature and the arts, from southern coastlines looking south; another is to reexamine both familiar and new, speculative narratives of African weather - drought, flood and change - for their Antarctic entanglements. In the context of ongoing work on postcolonial Antarctica and calls to decolonise Antarctic studies - such readings can begin to bridge the Antarctica-Africa divide.

To mitigate its potential devastation, numerous exogenous chemicals (ECs) have been used to demonstrate their effectiveness on alleviating FWS for the last 20 years. This review has summarized the most recent findings on use of various ECs as either nutrients or regulatory substances on crop plants under FWS and their roles involved in improving root respiration of seedlings, optimizing nutritional status, synthesizing osmotic regulators, enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, adjusting phytohormone levels, maintaining photosynthetic systems, and activating flood-tolerance related gene expressions. The effect of ESs on alleviating plants under FWS proves to be beneficial and useful but rather limited unless they are applied on appropriate crops, at the right time, and with optimized methods. Further research should be focused on use of ESs in field settings and on their potential synergetic effect for more FWS tolerance	[Feng, Di; Wang, Lingyue; Peng, Dianliang; Xu, Haicheng; Sun, Xiaoan] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Shouguang 262700, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Chitao] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Civil Engn, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiaoan] Florida Dept Agr & Consumer Serv, Gainesville, FL 32608 USA; [Ning, Songrui] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China	Shandong Agricultural University; Xi'an University of Technology	Feng, D; Sun, XA (corresponding author), Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Shouguang 262700, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Sun, CT (corresponding author), Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Civil Engn, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Sun, XA (corresponding author), Florida Dept Agr & Consumer Serv, Gainesville, FL 32608 USA.	fengdi2008sunny@163.com; sunchitao@163.com; seannyx@outlook.com	Sun, Xiaoan/KHX-1161-2024; Feng, Di/HII-8952-2022	Sun, Xiaoan/0000-0002-1872-2584; Feng, Di/0000-0002-1406-2611	Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2021ME154]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [2022B02003]; Key Research and Development Program of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [52109059]; Natural Science Foundation of China; Weifang University of Science and Technology	Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Key Research and Development Program of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Weifang University of Science and Technology	This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (no.

Using remote sensing, we introduced two indices to describe the discrepancies between spatially integrated versus pixel-level frequency distributions under maximum inundated conditions (d(ext)) and throughout all flooding conditions (d(tot)), expressed as the relative weight of shifts on each landscape's maximum registered coverage, theoretically ranging between no displacement (<20%) to maximum displacement (<< inf). Globally, over 36 years inundations exhibited redistributions representing, on average, 25% and 45% of their peak extents revealing previously unnoticed extra engaged areas and rotational movements within events, rising up to 500% in meandering rivers (South America) and irrigated croplands (Central Asia). We also assessed the influence of natural and human variables and discussed the indices' potential for advancing flood research.

The region, which has played a central role in environmental knowledge production, has a storied history of resilience practices and flood experience. To capture histories of Driftless Area flood experience and underlying socio-ecological dynamics, we performed a qualitative analysis of regional news archives from 1866 to present on flood trends, experiences, and responses. Our analysis identified hazard response trends mediated by socio-ecological factors including crisis-induced windows of opportunity for change, conflicts over structural and nonstructural responses to flooding, and psychological dimensions of environmental crises. Finally, our analysis noted the key role of community flood knowledge in producing shifts toward enhanced resilience, suggesting the need for empowering flood response planning at the community scale.

Protected areas can alleviate poverty by providing a range of economic opportunities for people that live and work within them. Equally, however, they may also disempower and disposes local communities. For communities adapting to systemic environmental change, proximity to protected areas can act to limit potential adaptive pathways. Here, we employ social science methods to explore the impact of an internationally significant protected area on adjacent communities in the Tonle Sap Lake basin, Cambodia. Semi-structured interviews, informed by a scenario framework, reveal an awareness of declining fish yields and a perceived lack of economic alternatives. Vulnerability to hydroclimatic extremes, particularly storms, flood, drought and - increasingly - fire, are exacerbated as a result of proximity to the protected area. We conclude that the impact of protected areas on local communities is heterogenous, and that the development of adaptive and effective management policies requires sensitivity to local conditions and impacts.

Clear and complete information about hazards impending on the territory is indispensable for local authorities to define efficient territorial management strategies focused on the risk reduction. A flexible hazard tool which works at different scale and with several sources of hazard is here proposed. We drew maps of monothematic and synthetic indices to describe the hazard status of metropolitan areas. A hazard hotspot map was also elaborated to identify both the areas with high hazard for the single dangerous event and the areas characterized by the concomitance of several hazards. We computed hazard indices for Napoli and Pozzuoli, a densely populated area, located in the Somma-Vesuvio and Campi Flegrei multi-source volcanic zone and also exposed to landslide, flood and coastal erosion hazard.

They were built taking into account the existing norms and the specific environmental conditions at that time. Over time, there have been numerous changes in the parameters that define how these water reservoirs are exploited, which have questioned their safety in operation. The deforestation that has taken place over the last 30 years in Romania and the climate change have led to the emergence of extreme weather and hydrological phenomena that have put hydrotechnical structures to a challenging test. Lately, securing the ability to transit the floods through medium and small hydrotechnical arrangements safely has become a stringent problem that requires finding solutions. The fact that the hydrotechnical structures are unique and the solutions adopted in a situation cannot be adopted altogether and in another work, leads to difficulties in the safety of these types of structures. The more the problem becomes worse when the initial use of the work needs to be changed.

This article presents one of the first empirical analyses of adaptation to flooding on a global scale. Using a sample of 97 countries between 1985 and 2010, we investigate the extent and pattern of flood adaptation by estimating the effects of a country's climatological risk, recent flood experiences, and socioeconomic characteristics on its flood-related fatalities. Our results provide mixed evidence on adaptation: countries facing greater long-term climatological flooding risks do not necessarily adapt better and suffer fewer fatalities; however, after controlling for the cross-country heterogeneity, we find that more recent flooding shocks have a significant and negative effect on fatalities from subsequent floods. These findings may suggest the short-term learning dynamics of adaptation and potential inefficacy of earlier flood control measures, particularly those that promote increased exposure in floodplains. Our findings provide important implications for climate adaptation policy making and climate modeling.

We compare the net income from individuals' current livelihoods to that derived from reallocating their livelihood activities under 4 different scenarios depicting future change. Respondents generally chose to retain their current livelihood strategy under all future scenarios. Less than 10% of those who did change livelihood allocation actually experienced a gain in economic benefits. Those engaged in single livelihoods experienced an average income loss of 18% across all scenarios, compared to 9% for the multi-livelihood group. Respondents' choices generated the best economic outcome under a status quo scenario, thus suggesting a low capacity to adapt when faced with unfamiliar future scenarios. Our study contributes to identifying and understanding the economic impact of future global changes on fisheries dependent individuals in the Tonle Sap floodplain ecosystem.	[Teh, Louise S.

Natural Hazard Vulnerability (NHV) assessments can help identify variables that can increase the community's susceptibility to these losses. Several studies have assessed NHV, but few have accounted for specific losses or considered more than one dimension of vulnerability (typically, social vulnerability is assessed). This study assessed NHV at the county level in the United States, considering five dimensions (social, environmental, institutional, economic, and health) during two years (2000 and 2010) and accounting for damages and ca-sualties. Results provide valuable and generalized insights on how NVH manifests in society. It confirms that NHV should be assessed by particular impact and that it is dynamic: sets of variables associated with heightened losses can change over time and when evaluating distinct impacts (damages and casualties). This study emphasizes the importance of tailoring NHV assessments to specific impacts and underscores the dynamic nature of these assessments, providing valuable insights for both researchers and decision-makers enabling the development of more effective risk-reduction strategies.

However, whether and to what extent the enhanced extreme precipitation translates into changes in river floods remains controversial. Here we demonstrate that previously reported unapparent or even negative responses of river flood discharge (defined as annual maximum discharge) to extreme precipitation increases are largely caused by mixing the signals of floods with different generating mechanisms. Stratifying by flood type, we show a positive response of rainstorm-induced floods to extreme precipitation increases. However, this response is almost entirely offset by concurrent decreases in snow-related floods, leading to an overall unapparent change in total global floods in both historical observations and future climate projections. Our findings highlight an increasing rainstorm-induced flood risk under warming and the importance of distinguishing flood-generating mechanisms in assessing flood changes and associated social-economic and environmental risks. Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle, but how this translates into changes in river floods is not clear. Here, the authors show that changes in river flood discharge differ between flood types, with increases in rainfall-induced floods and decreases in snow-related floods.

A newly developed real-time precision multi-layer sensor (RPMS) system was used to monitor a high-speed flocculation flat-bottomed sludge blanket clarifier (HFSBC) pond in real time to solve the water quality problems caused by drought and flood conditions. The RPMS is capable of monitoring the thickness of a sludge blanket; if the coagulation and sedimentation processes of the HFSBC are not working well, the sludge blanket will be thin and have a low sludge concentration. Conversely, if the HFSBC is working properly, the sludge blanket will have a thick and highly concentrated layer of sludge. Any heavy metals that are not removed by water treatment processes will enter the water supply network, which will result in poor water quality for end users. Against the backdrop of intensifying climate change, the enhancement of automated monitoring systems and adaptation processes will be an important part of efforts to minimize and resolve acute changes in water quality.

Therefore, searching for methods to streamline and improve research and implementing solutions for solving water and spatial problems is the need of the moment. This search is essential in those countries that do not quickly and effectively implement adopted national and regional policies and regulations at the local level, and this applies among others to Poland. Our study proposes using the research by design method to identify optimal water and space management scenarios in a problematic area - the Kampinos National Park and its surroundings, located in the Warsaw agglomeration. We describe how we used this method, and first and foremost, its essence. We propose using the research by design method as an advanced planning tool, drawing attention to the advantages but also some inconveniences related to its use. The approach presented in this article and the method adopted can be applied in other places with complex water management problems.

Reframing incentives for climate policy action	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							MITIGATION POLICIES; ENERGY; RENEWABLES; DECARBONISATION; GEOPOLITICS; DIFFUSION; SCENARIO; POLITICS; IMPACTS; MODELS	A key aim of climate policy is to progressively substitute renewables and energy efficiency for fossil fuel use. The associated rapid depreciation and replacement of fossil-fuel-related physical and natural capital entail a profound reorganization of industry value chains, international trade and geopolitics. Here we present evidence confirming that the transformation of energy systems is well under way, and we explore the economic and strategic implications of the emerging energy geography. We show specifically that, given the economic implications of the ongoing energy transformation, the framing of climate policy as economically detrimental to those pursuing it is a poor description of strategic incentives. Instead, a new climate policy incentives configuration emerges in which fossil fuel importers are better off decarbonizing, competitive fossil fuel exporters are better off flooding markets and uncompetitive fossil fuel producers-rather than benefitting from 'free-riding'-suffer from their exposure to stranded assets and lack of investment in decarbonization technologies. The traditional understanding of obstacles to climate change action highlights economic costs and free-riding. Mercure et al. show that, in contrast, climate action in many regions is economically favourable and advancing rapidly, but to avoid potentially destabilizing levels of stranded fossil fuel assets demands urgent and rapid economic diversification.

This Article looks at over 300 cities globally to gauge the interactions of natural ecosystems with built infrastructure. Rapid urbanization throughout the globe increases demand for fresh water and the ecosystem services associated with it. This need is conventionally met through the construction of infrastructure. Natural infrastructure solutions have increased to provide freshwater ecosystem services, but little global research has examined the intricate relationships between built and natural infrastructure for providing freshwater ecosystem services to cities across the globe. Using network analysis, here we examine the interrelationships between built and natural infrastructure in 2,113 watersheds for 317 cities worldwide, focusing on four key freshwater ecosystem services: freshwater provision, sediment regulation, flood mitigation and hydropower production. Our results indicate that protected wetlands contribute to sustaining freshwater provision to cities. Forest cover in protected areas can improve the capacity of large dams in reducing sediment loads and producing hydropower, but cities mainly depend on reduced impervious surfaces and more green spaces within urban areas for flood mitigation. Improved understandings of the role of natural infrastructure in urban water networks must underpin strategic decision-making to sustainably provide freshwater ecosystem services to global cities.

Loss of life, damage to infrastructure, and monetary cleanup costs associated with floods are important direct effects. However, there is a lack of attention towards the indirect effects of pollutants that are remobilized and redistributed during such catastrophic flood events, particularly considering the known toxic effects of substances present in flood-prone areas. The global examination of floods caused by a range of extreme events (e.g., heavy rainfall, tsunamis, extra- and tropical storms) and subsequent distribution of sediment-bound pollutants are needed to improve interdisciplinary investigations. Such examinations will aid in the remediation and management action plans necessary to tackle issues of environmental pollution from flooding. River basin-wide and coastal lowland action plans need to balance the opposing goals of flood retention, catchment conservation, and economical use of water.

It has become an urgent issue to mitigate the water resource management challenge. To address this problem, a real-time procedure for predicting the inundation risk in an urban drainage system was developed. The real-time procedure consists of three components: (i) the acquisition and forecast of rainfall data; (ii) rainfall-runoff modeling; and (iii) flood inundation mapping. This real-time procedure was applied to a drainage system in the Sukhumvit area of Bangkok, Thailand, to evaluate its prediction efficacy. The results showed precisely that the present real-time procedure had high predictability in terms of both the water level and flood inundation area mapping. It could also determine hazardous areas with a certain amount of lead time in the drainage system of the Sukhumvit area within an hour of rainfall data. These results show the real-time procedure could provide accurate flood risk warning, resulting in more time to implement flood management measures such as pumping and water gate operations, or evacuation.

A multidisciplinary research team with expertise in architecture, ecology, economics, engineering, design, and public art surveyed existing coastal structures to elucidate criteria for a multifunctional performance assessment of these structures in South Florida. Eight coastal survey sites were evaluated to understand their function. Two key variables that affect the coastal structure function are the spatial extent of the structure and the age of the structure. The functional performance was ranked as poor, fair, or good based on (1) ecological functionality (rugosity, minimization of pollution, and coastal plant diversity), (2) engineering functionality (storm, wave, and flood resilience and affordability), and (3) stakeholder functionality (waterfront access, views, and wildlife views). These aspects of functionality were equally weighted to evaluate the impact of each component on the coastal environs. Generally, coastal structure design considers primarily engineering functionality, and these designs consequently have poor ecological functionality. Multifunctionality improved with the horizontal extent of the structure, the occurrence of coastal plants in a buffer zone, and increased public access and use.

In contemporary practice design, we recognize the importance of the soil quality to structure new discourses in landscape practice. The central role in this process is undoubtedly played by the value a healthy soil has for the community and for the environment. The strategic design of wet and hydric landscapes is certainly an essential aspect for the regular and exceptional management of the effects produced by pollution and climate change. The research develops the soil as a key subject in the landscape design, specifically in hydric environments where water represents an important factor. The essay is divided into three parts: resources and opportunities of disturbed wet soil, successfully built public space where soil remediation transformed heavy polluted industrial urban sites in fertile public ecosystems within the dense urban structures, and soil design as a domain of urban resilience. The landscape project as an integrated project has spread the seeds of a new approach to the consideration of the contemporary city in an ecological manner.

In this study, an attempt has been made to identify drainage morphometric characteristics through topographic, geologic and hydrological information to assess the extreme weather events (flood) over the Gandak River Basin (GRB). The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and rainfall anomaly index (RAI) were used for deducing extreme rainfall incidences derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation datasets. An assembled frequency distribution as well as trends in RAI and SPI was calculated to understand the hydro-climatological behaviour of the basin. During the monsoon season, the years 1998, 2007, 2011, 2013 and 2017 witnessed the extreme flood events. The variations in heavy and intense rainfall in short time can be linked to extreme flood events, which leads to channel shifting and modifications, can be deduced from provided asymmetric factors and sinuosity index. The results illustrated that both the monsoonal rainfall and the frequency of extreme rainfall over the basin are increasing, which could be a reason for a high severity and frequency of flood events in the GRB.

Fluvial archives across different morpho-climatic zones of India record variable response to monsoonal fluctuations through time as preserved in patterns of sedimentary sequences and characteristic facies. This study has compiled the fluvial records from north and northwestern India to synthesize the palaeoclimatic information available from this broad region and to assess the coherence or otherwise of these records across widely different morpho-climatic regimes. Rivers across different regions of India show widespread floodplain aggradation during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)-5 but responded quite differently during MIS-4 e.g. degradation in the Ganga plains and aeolian deposition in the western part. Significant discontinuities were developed in the interfluves of the Ganga plains during MIS-3 and 2 whereas the western Indian rivers recorded variable response. The Holocene monsoonal fluctuations are manifested in widespread incision across western India and several events of valley filing in the Ganga plains.

Decision-makers from local to national scales will be tasked with planning under conditions of high uncertainty, often with minimal data. Participatory scenario planning is a method for devising adaptation strategies under high uncertainty, and we hypothesized that it could also be used for identifying systemic, inclusive, and transformative adaptation options at the community scale, and for highlighting opportunities for cross-scalar collaboration. We conducted scenario exercises with two communities in southeastern Nigeria that have experienced increasing flooding and other challenges linked to climate variability. Both communities identified drivers of change that intersect with climate, as well as community-scale actions that would improve adaptation to a range of future scenarios. We found evidence that scenario exercises can stimulate communities to develop transformative approaches to climate adaptation that seek to reduce climate risk by creating new systems and processes. We also found that community-identified priorities for strategic action highlight how larger-scale interventions could coordinate with communities to adapt more effectively. Participatory scenario planning is therefore a potentially important tool for adaptation planning in regions in which future conditions are highly uncertain.

The aim of the transformation is to accommodate population and economic growth and at the same time enable a system which is environmentally sustainable and resilient to future challenges such as climate change. These approaches have increasingly entered mainstream dialogue over the last ten years as knowledge on the approaches has developed, and there is an acceptance that there needs to be a change to how urban water systems are designed and operated. However, there are still a range of aspects of these approaches that are maturing and require further research to realize the objectives of SUWM. The issue explored supply-side interventions, such as rainwater harvesting and stormwater harvesting, demand-side interventions, and water storage solutions that have the potential to enable a range of recycling technologies. The issue also highlighted a novel method for better managing the integrity of a conventional sewer system. Furthermore, there are articles that explore methods for integrated assessments, integrated decision making and an exploration of what factors may promote community adoption of technology.

We present a new relative climatic and regional sea-level rise record for glacial Termination 1 (Marine Isotope Stages [MIS] 2-1) based on ostracode paleoecology from the upper 8 m of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site M0080 collected on Expedition 381, in the Gulf of Alkyonides, eastern Corinth basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Results show a series of major faunal transitions from lacustrine (Ponto-Caspian, Lake Corinth) glacial-age assemblages to fully marine (Mediterranean) interglacial assemblages between 20 and 8 ka. During glacial and early deglacial intervals, the Gulf of Alkyonides was characterized by non-marine lacustrine conditions with episodic sediment input from coastal, saline lake environments. Relatively stable lake shoreline conditions marked by the distinctive Tuberoloxoconcha sp. Existed from -17.5 to 15 ka. During the peak deglacial interval, the Bolling-Allerod (B-A, -15-13.5 ka), rapid sea-level rise is indicated by a fully marine ostracode fauna colonization, which persisted from 13.5 to 7.5 ka (Late Pleistocene-Early to Middle Holocene). The transition from lacustrine to marine environments confirms that during the last glacial maximum (LGM) low sea level (130 - 125 m below present day), the Corinth-Alkyonides depocentres were lacustrine. Marine water breached the shallow Rion and Acheloos-Cape Pappas sills, which today are -50 -60 m deep, separating the Mediterranean and Corinth-Alkyonides system beginning about 15 ka. Based on Alkyonides sedimentation rates, mean rates of sea-level rise during the B-A flooding of the CorinthAlkyonides system are comparable to those obtained from coral reef sea level (SL) records, at least 10 -20 mm yr & DBLBOND;1. Changes in sedimentation and sill depths in this tectonically active region may have played a role in reconnection of the Mediterranean and Corinth/Alkyonides system over a prolonged period. However, the ages and scale of the faunal changes and their clear correspondence with previously published global sea-level curves and the regional sea-level curve based on deglacial land elevation changes predicted by the ICE-7G model suggests the M0080A deglacial is dominated by the glacioeustatic sea-level rise and records details of global climate changes during Termination 1. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

This may pose serious threats to the survival of beach systems that cannot accommodate these modifications. In this paper, the spatio-temporal shift of the shoreline was investigated along two urban beaches in the Gulf of Cagliari (Poetto and Giorgino; southern Sardinia, western Mediterranean Sea) across a time frame of 62 years (1954-2016). The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) ArcGIS (TM) extension was used to extract different statistical parameters which allowed us to quantify the erosion and accretion rates. These data were further examined in relation to a number of anthropic and natural forcings in order to disentangle the factors controlling shoreline evolution. Eight sectors with interchanging net erosive and accretion trends were identified along the Poetto and Giorgino beaches. In six decades, some sectors of the two study sites appeared to have undergone great shoreline modification as a result of the intense anthropogenic activities impacting these coastal areas. The westernmost portions of both beaches were found to be the most vulnerable to erosion processes; such conditions were likely controlled by the interplaying of local hydrodynamics and by the intense coastal development which affected these sectors. The highest retreat rates (mean end point rate (EPR) = -0.51/year) were recorded in the western limit of Giorgino beach. Along the western limit of Poetto beach, EPR erosion rates (mean EPR = -2.92/year) considerably increased in the years after the artificial beach nourishment carried out in 2002, suggesting that the majority of the nourished material was lost offshore or partly redistributed along the beach. Coastal structures, urban development, river catchment modification, industrial and port activities, beach cleaning and touristic and recreational activities have been identified as the ongoing causes of coastal alteration. If these factors remain constant, under projected climate change scenarios, these beaches are at risk of further increased flooding and erosion. In this context, the application of DSAS appeared as an essential tool, supporting a monitoring system able to provide understanding and, potentially, predictions of the short- to long-term evolution of these beach systems.

A participatory community case study of periurban coastal flood vulnerability in southern Ecuador	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; DEFORESTATION; EVOLUTION; SERVICES; POVERTY; CITIES	Background Populations in coastal cities are exposed to increasing risk of flooding, resulting in rising damages to health and assets. Adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs), have the potential to reduce the risk and impact of flood events when tailored to reflect the local social-ecological context and needs. Community perceptions and experiences play a critical role in risk management, since perceptions influence people's behaviors in response to EWSFs and other interventions. Methods We investigated community perceptions and responses in flood-prone periurban areas in the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador. Focus groups (n = 11) were held with community members (n = 65 people) to assess perceptions of flood exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic. Participatory maps were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software. Qualitative data were triangulated with historical government information on rainfall, flood events, population demographics, and disease outbreaks. Results Flooding was associated with seasonal rainfall, El Nino events, high ocean tides, blocked drainage areas, overflowing canals, collapsed sewer systems, and low local elevation. Participatory maps revealed spatial heterogeneity in perceived flood risk across the community. Ten areas of special concern were mapped, including places with strong currents during floods, low elevation areas with schools and homes, and other places that accumulate stagnant water. Sensitive populations included children, the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent migrants. Flood impacts included damages to property and infrastructure, power outages, and the economic cost of rebuilding/repairs. Health impacts included outbreaks of infectious diseases, skin infections, snakebite, and injury/ drowning. Adaptive capacity was weakest during the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Participants perceived that their capacity to take action was limited by a lack of social organization, political engagement, and financial capital. People perceived that flood forecasts were too general, and instead relied on alerts via social media. Conclusions This study highlights the challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation in coastal cities. Areas of special concern provide clear local policy targets. The participatory approach presented here (1) provides important context to shape local policy and interventions in Ecuador, complimenting data gathered through standard flood reports, (2) provides a voice for marginalized communities and a mechanism to raise local awareness, and (3) provides a research framework that can be adapted to other resource-limited coastal communities at risk of flooding.

This article reviews the current scientific literature publications (2007-2020) in order to define vulnerability in the context of coastal Bangladesh facing cyclonic flooding. Based on this review, a new metric, called the socio-spatial vulnerability index (SSVI), is defined as function of both the probability of the cyclonic flood hazard and the sensitivity of delta inhabitants. The main result shows that the districts of Shariatpur, Chandpur and Barisal situated in the tidal floodplain of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta are in the fourth quartile, i.e., highest category, the most vulnerable areas. These districts are very densely populated (from 870 up to 1400 inhabitants per square kilometer) and exposed to inundation hazards with a large number of vulnerability factors. Finally, the delta's mouth was identified as a very vulnerable area to cyclonic flooding as well.

Through historical and ethnographic investigation, I document how flood control and agricultural intensification projects underwritten by foreign institutions exacerbate vulnerability to water crises in Bangladesh. These ostensibly pro-poor water governance and economic development programs engender cycles of crop loss, groundwater and soil salinization, reduced fisheries, and impeded navigation that erode agrarian livelihoods, thereby reproducing the conditions and rationale for continued flows of aid dollars into the country. Shifting attention away from depoliticized problems and solutions, I develop the concept of the interest-shed as a broadly applicable method for intervening in cycles of failure by examining the interests that they serve. This framework can also be used in the planning process by enabling differently situated groups to evaluate how proposed schemes include, ignore, or prioritize their interests.

This paper aims to utilize the global datasets of rainfall, evapotranspiration (ET), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and Data Assimilation of GLDAS to assess the spatiotemporal variability of water resource components over the Arab region. The results indicate that the Terrestrial water storage (TWS) are declining in most of the countries over the analysis period (2002-2015). The long-term analysis indicates that 2008 was the driest year and a distinctive deflection point for a declining trend of TWS. Non-parametric trend analysis test of Man-Kendall showed that trend of rainfall, NDVI, ET are not statistically significant except in some regions. The highest TWS volume of about +1586.9 Million Cubic Meter was found in Sudan, evidenced by rainfall. The study provides a guide for stakeholders to manage water resources in all countries separately.

Users' Perspectives About the Potential Usefulness of Online Storylines to Communicate River Research to a Multi-disciplinary Audience	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Multi-disciplinary communication; narrative elements; river management; user-centered design	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEMS; FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; THOUSAND WORDS PAINT; NARRATIVE COMMUNICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCIENCE; CHALLENGES; IMPLEMENTATION; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION	Effective communication practices are needed to support adaptive, collaborative and integrative environmental management. We propose the use of online storylines to communicate scientific outcomes in a way that is captivating, easily understood and accessible. Based on 20 interviews, we identified important attributes for the storyline content, structure and user interaction. We designed a storyline example about stakeholders' perceptions of a river management intervention with consequences on the landscape. The intended audience consists of multi-disciplinary researchers and practitioners that could consider or apply research solutions outside their field of expertise in river management. We introduced the example in a workshop with 14 participants from research and practice. Our findings highlight the importance of including narrative elements via images, interactive figures and timelines to illustrate the research context. Moreover, storylines should explicitly state benefits as well as the limitations of the river research and include a glossary to clarify specific terms.

The objectives of this study were to identify the best fit probability distribution to the streamflow data and estimate the return period of the extreme flood events. The L-moment method was implemented to estimate the parameter of probability, by using distributions namely Gamma, LAT3, GEV, PE3, GLO and Kappa. It was found that Kappa distribution was the best fitting distribution to the data after being tested using the goodness-of-fit tests. The Kappa distribution gave the most appropriate to the annual maximum series data of Sungai Langat, Kajang, Selangor. The return values were calculated using Kappa distribution model. The return period of 2 years gave the return value of 49.09 m(3)/s, while return period of 100 years gave the return value of 390.54 m(3)/s.

Costs are expected to increase due to urbanization and climate change. Mitigation is needed. Different stakeholders with different motivations unfortunately often evaluate vulnerability by using fragmented and incomplete data sources. This paper intends to review the different approaches for collecting and analyzing data, and to evaluate their usefulness within the proposed framework for a smart use of data. The objectives of this work have been to review qualitatively and quantitatively a selection of Norwegian stormwater-related databases and to propose measures for improvement. The findings are seen according to the climate services literature and show that that data is spread around a heterogeneous community of stakeholders concerned with different motivations, different needs, and different levels of data processing. In general, the needs of the different stakeholders have not been surveyed and defined systematically enough and there is a substantial potential in upgrading from the delivery of passive raw data to the delivery of knowledge-driven decision-support tools.

The development of hydropower potential in the Mekong River has long been of interest to governments in the region. Among the existing 64 dams, 46 dams have been built in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) to produce up to 8650 MW of electricity. Additionally, of the 123 proposed built hydropower dams, eleven hydropower plants have been nominated for the river mainstream and are expected to install a total of 13,000 MW in the LMB countries. However, serious concerns have intensified over the potential negative economic consequences, especially on fisheries and agriculture in Cambodia and Vietnam. To date, most of the concerns have concentrated on the impacts on hydrology, environment, livelihood, and diversity in the LMB attributed to hydropower development. This paper, however, discusses the fishery and agricultural sectors of the LMB and focuses on the downstream floodplains of Cambodia and Vietnam. The dam construction has caused greater losses of biodiversity and fisheries than climate change in the LMB. The reduction of 276,847 and 178,169 t of fish, 3.7% and 2.3% of rice, 21.0% and 10.0% of maize will contribute to a decrease of 3.7% and 0.3% of the GDP of Cambodia and Vietnam, respectively. Lao PDR may benefit the most revenue from electricity generation than the other country in the LMB, as most of the proposed dams are projected in the country. Cambodia burdens 3/4 of the reduction of total capture fishery destruction, whilst Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam endure the remaining 1/3 losses. The tradeoff analyses reveal that losses of capture fisheries, sediment or nutrients, and social mitigation costs are greater than the benefits from electricity generation, improved irrigation, and flood control of the LMB region. The socioeconomic and environmental damage caused by hydropower dams in developing countries, including the Mekong, is greater than the early costs in North America and Europe. It is proposed that dam construction for hydropower in the Mekong River, as well as other rivers in developing countries, should be gradually removed and shifted toward solar, wind, and other renewable resources.

Projected Changes to Cool-Season Storm Tides in the 21st Century Along the Northeastern United States Coast	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article							EXTRATROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY; NORTH-AMERICA; CMIP5; SENSITIVITY; ATLANTIC	This study investigates changes and uncertainties to cool-season (November-March) storm tides along the U.S. northeast coast in the 21st century under the high RCP8.5 emission scenario compared to late 20th century. A high-fidelity (50-m coastal resolution) hydrodynamic storm tide model is forced with three dynamically downscaled regional climate models (RCMs) over three decadal periods (historical, mid-21st century, and late-21st century) to project future changes in peak storm tide elevations at coastal counties in the region. While there is no absolute consensus on future changes to storm tides, for any one future decade two out of the three RCMs project an increase at counties along the Hudson River, Delaware River, and northern Chesapeake Bay due to more intense cyclones that track inland of these locations leading to favorable surge generating conditions. The same RCMs also project a decrease at counties facing the open ocean in the mid-Atlantic Bight as cyclone densities just offshore of the coastline decrease, particularly by late-century. The greater tidal range in northern areas of the region leads to uncertainty in the magnitude and sign of the projected changes to storm tide levels due to the arbitrary timing of the local tidal stage and the surge-producing weather event. This random tide-weather timing is less important in the Chesapeake Bay and unimportant in Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound. Similar to other recent studies, we highlight that sea level rise is likely to be more critical than storm climatology for future changes to the cool-season coastal flooding potential. Plain Language Summary Winter storms (e.g., nor'easters) that develop during the North American cool-season (November-March) can generate high water levels (storm tides) along the northeast coast of the U.S. that can potentially result in coastal flooding. This study is concerned with how winter storm tides along the northeastern U.S. coast could change into the 21st century under a high emissions climate change scenario. Highly resolved computer models of the ocean and the atmosphere are used to investigate this question. We find that changes to storm tides are generally less significant than expected sea level rise under the corresponding climate change scenario. However, we find evidence of decreasing storm tides at counties along the mid-Atlantic Bight coastal region and increasing storm tides at counties along the Hudson River, Delaware River, and northern Chesapeake Bay. Expected changes to storm tides are more uncertain in northern areas (New England, Long Island Sound, New York Bight, and Delaware Bay) because of the random timing of the storm and the everyday tide level, which is larger in these areas. Coastal planning should consider the combination of sea level rise and storm tides taking into account the full range of possibilities based on this random tide-weather timing.

Applying the Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy as a Tool for Flood Resilience	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						abstraction hierarchy; resilience; complex adaptive systems; flooding; urban systems	CITIES; SUSTAINABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; METAPHOR; RISK	Climate change will mean cities are exposed to more frequent short-term shocks such as floods. City-scale resilience is achieved by understanding how these shocks interact with longer-term stressors (e.g., social inequality). The Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy (USAH) has been developed for this purpose. In this paper, Glasgow (UK) is used as a case study application, to demonstrate how resilience theory can be operationalized through the application of the USAH. Results demonstrate how the USAH can quantify interdependencies between tangible physical entities in the city and intangible outcomes that monitor city stressors, and specifically how these outcomes change in response to a 1:200-year fluvial flood return period in Glasgow. Resilience concepts such as multifunctionality, redundancy and diversity are applied to interpret the results and their implications for longer-term resilience in Glasgow. The findings from the application of the USAH show that the outcome Social equality and equity is influential for longer-term resilience in Glasgow, whilst Reliable communications and mobility is an important outcome for flood resilience.

Key to successful adaptation will be engineering projects, and critical to the success of those projects will be community engagement and support. Despite the recognized importance of community engagement when addressing complex issues like coastal flooding on which engineers work, most undergraduate engineering programs offer little to no training in community engagement. In this paper, we describe our experiences working with undergraduate engineering students to develop community-driven designs to address flooding and water quality issues in the Lake Mattamuskeet watershed in eastern North Carolina. Through an interdisciplinary approach, student teams learned to engage with local stakeholders to better integrate local knowledge and address issues identified by community members in their designs. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, all community engagement aspects of the project moved to virtual forums, and we discuss the impact this shift had on the engineering designs as well as student learning outcomes and community connections.

While limited recent research has looked into WASH among people experiencing homelessness in HICs, and while some work has considering the implications of climate change on WASH and health, the nexus of WASH, extreme weather events and homelessness in HICs have not been studied thus far. We conducted the first systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature on this nexus, which is understudied and marked by complexity, involving a range of systems and forms of impact. A total of 50 publications were included in our analysis.We found that public facilities like drinking water fountains, toilets, handwashing facilities, and showers are scarce, frequently unavailable, often pose safety and cleanliness issues, and access to non-public facilities may be cost-prohibitive for homeless populations. Consequently, people experiencing homelessness, including those sleeping rough, in encampments, or shelters, are often forced to limit drinking water consumption, forego healthy hygiene behaviours, and resort to open urination and defecation, all of which carry health risks. Extreme weather events, like heatwaves, extreme cold, heavy rain and flooding exacerbate challenges for people experiencing homelessness, further complicating their access to WASH, and reducing the ability of service providers to deliver extra relief, creating a dual WASH and health burden.Our review highlights that the Human Right to Water and Sanitation is not met for people experiencing homelessness in urban areas of high-income countries, with women emerging as one of the most vulnerable subgroups. It reveals that the impact of certain WASH issues (e.g. drinking water) on homeless populations are better understood than others (e.g. waste), and, similarly, the effects of certain extreme weather events (e.g. heatwaves) on the health and WASH conditions of people experiencing homelessness are better understood than others (e.g. flooding). Data gaps and the lack of information on limited WASH access and health circumstances of people experiencing homelessness, further minimize their representation and consequently impose obstacles to improve their situation.Based on our analysis, we established a framework which operationalizes the nexus of WASH, extreme weather events and homelessness. This framework improves our understanding of the underlying complexities at the intersection of these three issues and provides a foundation for enhanced preparedness and health-oriented planning.

Tectonics, climate variability and erosion are major recurrent processes reshaping fluvial landforms ending up in self-affine pat-terns. In the case of the Pantanal, the largest wetland in South America, its depositional tract can be subdivided as fluvial megafans, interfans and the main trunk system. Here we provide an outlook of their origins by means of self-affine landforms and on the feedback of climate changes over landform functionalities. Climate variability modulates the magnitude of interannual fluvial discharge and sediment load from highlands to plains, affects groundwater recharge, as well as the subsidence and generation of accommodation in the depositional tract through river avulsion. Scenarios are envisaged by analyzing long-term summer rainfall intensity and the number of dry days in autumn/winter over the Upper Paraguay River Basin, and annual flood peaks measured at fluvial gauge stations in the Paraguay River at Lad ' ario (Brazil) and Asunci ' on (Paraguay). The frequency distributions of the annual flood peaks are found unimodal for Asunci ' on and bimodal for Lad ' ario, which suggests an unknown water supply at Asunci ' on, likely from Pilcomayo River and Pantanal's groundwater. The latter might play a delayed role on Pantanal's hydrologic functioning at 20-40 years timescales. Besides the Paraguay River flood peaks, summer rainfall intensity and the number of dry days in autumn/winter are quasi-periodic at interannual and decadal scales. Cross-correlations analyses indicate a long-range memory between river floods and rainfall intensity, and 15-20 years lag between river floods and the number of dry days in drought seasons. Trends analysis suggests that summer rainfall intensity and the number of dry days in autumn/winter have been consistently increasing by about 0.6 mm/day/decade and 1 day/decade, respectively. Therefore, magnifications of fluvial discharge and sediment load at wet seasons and water deficits at drought seasons are anticipated. Such a scenario indicates extreme dry cycles over all self-affine functional landforms, particularly on abandoned lobes relying exclusively on rainwater, whereas extremes of rainfall intensity at rivers headwaters may amplify the risks of large-scale avulsions at active lobes of the fluvial megafans. In contrast, active lobes of megafans, interfans and the main trunk river system emerge as hotpots for wildlife refuge and ecosystem services.

J	White, E; Kaplan, D				White, Elliott, Jr.; Kaplan, David			Identifying the effects of chronic saltwater intrusion in coastal floodplain swamps using remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Saltwater intrusion; Sea level rise; Coastal floodplain swamps; Remote sensing; EVI; MODIS; Climate change; Google Earth Engine; Ghost Forest	SEA-LEVEL RISE; FRESH-WATER; SOUTH-CAROLINA; FOREST SUCCESSION; CHESAPEAKE BAY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROUND-TRUTH; DATA FUSION; EAST-COAST; SALINITY	Coastal floodplain swamps (CFS) are an important part of the coastal wetland mosaic, however they are threatened due to accelerated rates of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion (SWI). While remote sensing-based detection of wholesale coastal ecosystem shifts (i.e., from forest to marsh) are relatively straightforward, assessments of chronic, low-level SWI into CFS using remote sensing have yet to be developed and can provide a critical early-warning signal of ecosystem deterioration. In this study, we developed nine ecologically-based hypotheses to test whether remote sensing data could be used to reliably detect the presence of CFS experiencing SWI. Hypotheses were motivated by field- and literature-based understanding of the phenological and vegetative dynamics of CFS experiencing SWI relative to unimpacted, control systems. Hypotheses were organized into two primary groups: those that analyzed differences in summary measures (e.g., median and distribution) between SWI-impacted and unimpacted control sites and those that examined timeseries trends (e.g., sign and magnitude of slope). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as a proxy for production/biomass and was generated using MODIS surface reflectance data spanning 2000 to 2018. Experimental sites (n = 8) were selected from an existing network of long-term monitoring sites and included 4 pairs of impacted/non-impacted CFS across the northern Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida. The four best-supported hypotheses (81% across all sties) all used summary statistics, indicating that there were significant differences in the EVI of CFS experiencing chronic, low-level SWI compared to controls. These hypotheses were tested using data across a large and diverse region, supporting their implementation by researchers and managers seeking to identify CFS undergoing the first phases of SWI. In contrast, hypotheses that assessed CFS change over time were poorly supported, likely due to the slow and variable pace of ecological change, relatively short remote sensing data record, and/or specific site histories. Overall, these results show that remote sensing data can be used to identify differences in CFS vegetation associated with long-term, low-level SWI, but further methodological advancements are needed to reliably detect the temporal transition process.

J	Liang, C; Guo, KH; Guan, MF				Liang, Chen; Guo, Kaihua; Guan, Mingfu			Computational hydraulics and hazard assessment of flooding on underground staircases	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Underground flooding; Staircase; Instability; Hazard degree; 2D shallow water equations	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; SHANGHAI; MODEL; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; FUTURE; SYSTEM; RISK	Underground flooding is intensifying due to urban expansion and more frequent extreme precipitation. Staircases are crucial for accessing underground spaces and evacuation during floods and it is of both academic and practical value to investigate how floodwater and the induced hazard evolve over underground staircases. This study examines flood dynamics on underground staircases and its relationship with staircase characteristics through a series of numerical experiments using a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model. The study also uncovers how staircase design influences flood hazard levels. Results indicate that shorter or higher steps lead to shallower water depths but higher flow velocities. The branch staircase experiences smaller water depths and flow velocities than the main one. The presence of staircase transforms a subcritical flow into a supercritical flow. Except in extremely deep floodwaters, pedestrians are more vulnerable to sliding than toppling on staircases. The stability of the human body is greater on steps with longer length and lower height (26.56 degrees) or the branch line of the junction type. The relative stability of the human body is not necessarily a guarantee of complete safety and must be analyzed in conjunction with the comprehensive safety factor.

This study investigates nonstationary partial duration series (PDS) records for the period 1971-2017 at 14 hydrological stations across the Gorganrood River Basin, Iran. The Gorganrood Basin is very diverse in terms of climate such as humid, semihumid, Mediterranean, semiarid, and arid climates. Change points are analyzed using the Pettitt technique. Trends of PDS are detected using the Mann-Kendall method. The nonstationarity of the PDS series is examined by generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Results indicate that abrupt changes are significant for the PDS series in the Gorganrood River Basin. Change points have a considerable effect on trend detection, and these may be attributed to the fact that an abrupt increase or decrease in mean values affects trend changes. In addition, the GAMLSS results showed that the most suitable performance distribution was LNO distribution and then RGE distribution in the Gorganrood River Basin. On other hand, the GAMLSS model and the Pettitt test have good capability in detecting stationary and nonstationary PDS series.

This paper used a hydrological model combined with the Computational Fluid Dynamics software to assess the drainage efficiency, predict the hydrological processes under different precipitation intensities and establish the relationship between rainfall intensity and inundation depth under extreme rainstorm events. The study proposed several thresholds such as specific rainfall intensities (that is, RI95% and RI50%), drainage efficiency, and the limited flow rate of pipes. Based on 2021 July 20, 0:00 to 24:00 precipitation monitoring data from the "7.20 Zhengzhou Rainstorm Extreme Event," the relationship between rainfall intensity and road-pipe overflow patterns was determined by analysing these thresholds for different drainpipe diameters and spacings of catchment wells. The results demonstrated the evaluation parameters varied with rainfall intensities and pipe characteristics and revealed the main limitation of drainage efficiency and flow rate of drainpipes. The simulation helped the drainage systems design for different precipitations and proposed several relative suggestions for drainage-system improvements, wherein the diameter of the branch pipes plays a dominant role in coping with extreme rainstorm events.

POLAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Alaska; Aleutian Low; Beaufort High; Polar jet stream; Regime shift	BERING-SEA; WINTER	Recent fingerprints of Alaskan Arctic climate change include new weather patterns whose impacts propagate through the Alaskan marine ecosystem. Multiple lines of observational evidence draw attention to the last five years (2017-2021) as a remarkable period of change. Bering Sea winter and spring ice coverage was remarkably low in 2018 and 2019 associated with a shifted Aleutian Low (AL) into the western Bering Sea, and ridging of the overlying polar jet stream (PJS) that supported southerly winds and reduced ice growth. The climatological Beaufort High and associated Beaufort Gyre saw multiple winter-long collapses (2017 and 2020), the only two such events of the modern reanalysis era. In contrast, from 2012 to 2016 the AL and PJS were located southeastward across the Gulf of Alaska, which supported sea ice growth. The recent collocation of the exposed ocean surface and atmospheric anomalies supports the emergence of a regional atmospheric circulation response to seaice loss. We propose that the regional system shift after 2017 foreshadows the beginning of a period with an increasing frequency of major sea-ice loss events and associated impacts - floods, delayed spring blooms, and marine food chain disruptions - which is sooner than projected by climate models.

In response to urbanization in at risk areas, the concept of territorial resilience has potential as an approach to urban flood issues. The objective of this research is to develop a spatial decision support tool based on a collaborative assessment method of territorial resilience. The proposed methodology consists of: the adaptation to the French Polynesian context, three existing resilience assessment methods applied to a case study in the Punaruu Valley's (Punaauia, French Polynesia) and the use of geovisualization techniques: use of GIS for data processing and analysis, visualization, mapping and model processing. This methodology integrates the technical, urban and social components of the territory, while highlighting the various levers available to improve territorial resilience and facilitate its understanding through collaborative work efforts and the use of a visual tool. The results demonstrate the reproducibility of these methods for assessing resilience in French Polynesia. They underline the potential of a collaborative approach to highlight critical infrastructures and generate possible decision support to improve the territory's ability to function despite a disruption and the ability to rebuild following this disruption.

Specifically, this study uses sea level scenarios through 2050, projected by linear estimation of the Semarang tide gauge record from 1997 to 2015. In addition, we calculated extreme water levels along Semarang, Indonesia, using the modern extreme value theory introduced by Gumbel (1958) and Jenkinson (1955). Simulations of coastal flooding show that subsidence in Semarang may be the leading reason that coastal flooding is getting worse, followed by sea level rise (SLR). Compared to the average subsidence scenario, the scenario with SLR projection and subsidence interpolated based on the local measurements in the research area by 2050 shows the highest flood volume with an increase at 1,483,251 m(3) and a flood area increased by up to 1.5 km(2) (6.8% increase).

Together with continuous urbanization, extreme weather events are likely to increase the magnitude and frequency of flood hazards and exposure in populated regions. This article examines the changing pathways of flood risk management (FRM) in Portland, Oregon; Seoul, South Korea; and Tokyo, Japan, which have different histories of land development and flood severity. We used city governance documents to identify how FRM strategies have changed in the study cities. Using a combined framework of social learning with an integrated social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) lens, we show what components of SETS have been emphasized and how FRM strategies have diversified over time. In response to historical flood events, these cities built hard infrastructure such as levees to reduce flood risks. The recent paradigm shift in urban FRM, such as the adoption of socioecological elements in SETS, including floodplain restoration, green infrastructure, and public education, is a response to making cities more resilient or transformative to the anticipated future extreme floods. The pathways that cities have taken and the main emphasis across SETS elements differ by city, however, suggesting that opportunities exist for learning from each city's experience collectively to tackle global flooding issues.

Behavioral motivations for self-insurance under different disaster risk insurance schemes	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Behavioral insurance; Self-insurance; Homeowners; Lab-in-the-field experiment; Disaster damage reduction; Flood preparedness	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION MEASURES; ADVANTAGEOUS SELECTION; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; FLOOD EXPERIENCE; PROSPECT-THEORY; MORAL HAZARD; PERCEPTIONS; LOSSES; DETERMINANTS	This paper presents a lab-in-the-field experiment with 2111 Dutch homeowners in flood plain areas to examine the impacts of financial incentives and behavioral motivations for self-insurance under different flood insurance schemes. We experimentally varied the insurance type (mandatory public versus voluntary private) and the availability of a premium discount incentive for investing in flood damage mitigation measures. This set-up allowed us to examine the existence of moral hazard, advantageous selection and the behavioral motivations of individual agents who face these different insurance types, without the selection bias that makes a causal inference from survey studies problematic. The main results show that a premium discount can increase investments in self-insurance under both private and public insurance. Moreover, we find no support for moral hazard in our natural disaster insurance market, but we do find a substantial share of cautious people who invest both in private insurance as well as in self-insurance, indicating advantageous selection. The results have implications for the design of insurance schemes to cope with increasing natural disaster risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Mol, Jantsje M.; Botzen, W. J.

Insured flood damage in Sweden, 1987-2013	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						climate change; extreme rainfall; flood damage; insurance claims	CLIMATE; LOSSES; PRECIPITATION; VULNERABILITY; PROJECTIONS; DISASTERS; EXTREMES; EUROPE; IMPACT; RISK	This study uses insurance claims as a proxy for property damage to analyse flood damage in Sweden between the years 1987 and 2013. The number of compensated insurance claims per year has risen rapidly during this period. As much as 70% of the claims are caused by flood damage occurring during the summer months June, July, and August, when intense rain with low predictability is common. To explore the damage trend a time series cross sectional analysis using four different fixed effect models was applied to the data set. Due to data scarcity, the time series had to be limited to 16 years and contain a total of 304 damage observations. The potentially explanatory climate related factor extreme rain, defined as >6 mm/15 min, and the socioeconomic factors gross regional product (GRP) per capita and housing stock were tested as explanatory factors. The GRP per capita and housing stock were found to be significant in two regression models. The estimated effect of extreme rainfall events exceeded the effects of GRP per capita and housing stock in the models. Extreme rain was robust to model specification and was found to have a highly significant impact on Swedish flood damage.

Does geography of informal settlements inform city-led flood management agendas? And in what ways have residents of informal settlements responded to city-led flood management approaches? The paper argues that the supposed city managers - both state institutions and professional bodies - have consistently acted in their own interest while successfully using 'blame game' to alienate their responsibility of successfully implementing flood management agendas in informal settlements. Using Accra (Ghana) as a case study, the study used multiple qualitative methods such as interviews, focus group discussion and secondary data analysis. Findings indicate that, overall, residents of informal settlements are gradually embracing the reality that city managers do not promote their interests in addressing perennial flood events. In turn, the flood management outcomes that policies and plans ostensibly seek to achieve have only been modestly realised. Instead, flood management agendas have had perverse implications for residents of informal settlements. Recommendations to improve the situation are proffered.

The methodology applies a direct spatial and probabilistic relation among the physical processes of riverine flooding with a given vulnerability. First, we calculated the design peak discharges using a rainfall generation model and rainfall-runoff model - in particular, the Stochastic Rainfall Generator (STORAGE) and the Continuous Simulation Model for Small and Ungauged Basins (COSMO4SUB). After that, we used the obtained flood scenarios for hydraulic modelling with the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). The modelled flood extent, flow depth, and flow velocity were considered hazard indicators. The results were expressed in terms of a flood hazard index (FHI), flood vulnerability index (FVI), and flood risk index (FRI): the highest values were obtained for municipalities located in the northern-central part of the investigated area.

To place future changes in a long-term perspective, we produce a 382-year precipitation reconstruction for the basin using seven tree-ring chronologies of old-growth conifers from the Hindu Kush Mountains, a monsoon-shadow area. The reconstruction proves robust over rigorous cross-validations (R-2 = 0.60, RE = 0.60, CE = 0.53). The full reconstruction (1637-2018) reveals a steady decline in the low end of the precipitation distribution, implying increasing drought risks. We show that droughts are getting more severe, shorter, and more frequent, interspersed with more frequent pluvials in the past century. Drought risks, compounded with projected flood intensification, pose significant threats for this transboundary river. Therefore, future water management needs to account for both flood and drought risks and be informed by long-term hydroclimatic variability.

In this context, this study aimed to understand the inner workings of the social learning processes in the riverside community 'Sao Carlos do Jamari' triggered by its historical flood. An in-depth case study was jointly constructed, and semi-structured interviews and focus groups were developed with residents of the community, leaders of the Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB) and workers of the local civil defense. Our findings indicate that the main shifting elements that fostered and were driven by social learning processes are related to Community-Community relationships, Community-Territory relationships, and the Community-State relationships. MAB's role as an educational agent is highlighted, while public authorities hinder social participation in shared management. The proposals of social learning framework are taken as a possible way of overcoming local vulnerabilities and expanding social participation.

In this study, we developed a waterlogging process simulation model comprising two parts: runoff generation module and runoff confluence module. An improved tank model and hydrodynamic model based on Saint-Venant equations were adopted in the runoff generation and confluence module, respectively. The results show that the model's relative error and root mean square error are 2.1% and 0.17 mm/h, and the Nash coefficient of the model is 0.91. The relative error of river level simulation was within 5%, and the Nash coefficient was higher than 0.9. The proposed waterlogging simulation model could be a valuable tool for describing the process of waterlogging generation, accumulation, and confluence in the studied irrigation district or other regions with similar climatic conditions.

This article explores the implementation of NbS in two distinct cities, Singapore and Lisbon, to demonstrate that NbS can work in very different contexts and spark new thoughts on the urban-nature relationship and to identify commonalities that drive and enable the implementation of NbS in different context. Literature review-based research was conducted to examine the types of NbS implemented, the common drivers, the governance model, and the plural functionalities of the solutions. The research shows that, despite the differences, the two cities shared common drivers (including water supply, flood control, and resident demand for green space) and goals, such as improving water quality and overall quality of life, through the deployment of NbS. With rapid urban expansion, water use increase, and the impacts of climate change, NbS can be effective tools to deliver integrated benefits and improve the liveability of cities.

Environmental Performance Index report states that Pakistan is on 169 among 180 countries due to ill-planned development on prime agriculture land, poor air, water quality, and jeopardizing ecosystem of the country. The change of land uses from the natural to the built environment has created problems like loss of vegetation and habitat, enlarged surface flow, and heavy floods. However, this study addresses this core issue by taking responses from the residents of Lahore, Pakistan. Current research focuses on the willingness and perception of residents regarding the adaptation of green roof technology. The resident perceptions are obtained by a structured questionnaire and analyzed by using statistical techniques. The findings of the research highlight that adaptation of green roof is primarily linked with the four factors, i.e., awareness of green roof among all stakeholders, special provision in building regulation concerning green roof, sustainable environmental consciousness, and subsidized cost of green roof materials.

J	Jensen, CB				Jensen, Casper Bruun			A flood of models: Mekong ecologies of comparison	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE			English	Article						hydrology; Mekong; modeling; science policy; water resources	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; SEDIMENT; POLITICS; IMPACT	In recent decades, scientists have developed a wide array of hydrological, hydrodynamic, and other models to understand the dynamics of the Mekong River Basin. Indeed, the area has been described as 'flooded' with models. Drawing on STS and the philosophy of modeling - which has described models as mediating instruments - the first half of this article discusses how and why this proliferation has occurred, focusing on the Cambodian context. Highlighting that models are developed comparatively, with reference to one another, the analysis shows how they have generated a partially connected ecology of comparisons. As each model makes its own image of the Mekong, the ecology as a whole creates a kaleidoscopic effect. In principle, this ecology is important for that of environmental policy-making. In practice, however, it is tremendously difficult for scientists to bridge the ecologies. Examining two cases of NGO-based modeling aiming to influence policy, the second half of the paper offers a comparative analysis of the challenges modeling knowledge faces in Mekong environmental politics.

ICT, which is itself responsible for global warming due to its high carbon footprint, can play a role in alleviating the consequences of such hazards by providing reliable, resilient means of communication during a disaster crisis. In this paper, we explore the provision of wireless coverage through UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to complement, or replace, the traditional communication infrastructure. The use of UAVs is indeed crucial in emergency scenarios, as they allow for the quick and easy deployment of micro and pico cellular base stations where needed. We characterize the movements of UAVs and define an optimization problem to determine the best UAV coverage that maximizes the user throughput, while maintaining fairness across the different parts of the geographical area that has been affected by the disaster. To evaluate our strategy, we simulate a flooding in San Francisco and the car traffic resulting from people seeking safety on higher ground. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition, the estuary has been suffering with increasing discharges from shrimp farm and urban effluents. We monitored surface water and atmospheric CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), temperature, salinity, and wind speed with continuous real-time measurements during two eulerian surveys in October 2017 (33 h) and September 2018 (44 h), during spring tides in the dry season. Additionally, pH, total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), carbonate (CO32-), and saturation state of calcite (omega(cal)) and aragonite (omega(ara)) were monitored hourly. Higher salinity (>38) during ebb tides confirmed the hypersalinity and negative estuarine circulation. TA and DIC concentrations in the estuary were higher than in the adjacent coastal ocean due to evaporation, showing positive correlation with salinity and negative correlation with tidal height. Measured TA and DIC concentrations were slightly higher than those calculated by the conservative evaporation model, suggesting their production in the estuary by aerobic and anaerobic processes. CO32-, omega(cal), and omega(ara) showed a clear semi-diurnal (tidal-driven) and diel (24 h; biological-driven) patterns: lowest values occurred at flood tide during night-time (respectively, 185 mu mol kg(-1), 4.3 and 2.8), whereas highest occurred during ebb tide and daytime (respectively, 251 mu mol kg(-1), 5.7 and 3.8). DIC/TA ratios were higher at night-time supporting a diel control (linked to solar irradiance) of the carbonate buffering capacity. pCO(2) was oversaturated comparing to the atmosphere (512-860 mu atm) and the estuary was a source of CO2, with fluxes ranging from 2.2 to 200.0 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) (51.9 +/- 26.7 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)), which are higher than emissions normally found in low-inflow, marine-dominated estuaries. The diel variability of DIC indicated a net heterotrophic metabolism averaging -5.17 +/- 7.39 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). Eutrophication amplifies the diel variability of the CO2 system generating large differences between daytime and night-time. The results highlight the importance of considering diel variability when estimating CO2 fluxes and carbonate chemistry in eutrophic, semi-arid, and tidally dominated estuaries under rapid environmental changes, and may represent future conditions in estuaries worldwide experiencing warming, increasing aridity and eutrophication.

J	Lagmay, M; Racoma, BA				Lagmay, Mahar; Alan Racoma, Bernard			Lessons from tropical storms Urduja and Vinta disasters in the Philippines	DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Disasters; Hazards; Risk perception; Disaster and emergency management; Early warning systems; Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment; Tropical storm Urduja; Tropical storm Vinta	EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS; HAZARDS	Purpose Tropical storms Urduja and Vinta battered the Philippines in December 2017. Despite advances in disaster risk reduction efforts of the country, the twin December storms caused numerous deaths in the Visayas and Mindanao regions. Analysis of these events shows that alerts raised during the Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment (PDRA) for both storms were largely ineffective because they were too broad and general calling for forced evacuations in too many provinces. Repeated multiple and general warnings that usually do not end up in floods or landslides, desensitize people and result in the cry-wolf effect where communities do not respond with urgency when needed. It was unlike the previous execution of PDRA from 2014 to early 2017 by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), which averted mass loss of lives in many severely impacted areas because of hazard-specific, area-focused and time-bound warnings. PDRA must reinstate specific calls, where mayors of communities are informed by phone hours in advance of imminent danger to prompt and ensure immediate action. Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction information using probabilistic (multi-scenario) hazard maps is also necessary for an effective early warning system to elicit appropriate response from the community. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Methods of early warning through the PDRA of the National Disaster Mitigation and Management Council (NDRRMC) of the Philippines during tropical storm Urduja and Typhoon Vinta were assessed in this study and compared to the previous PDRA system from 2014 to early 2017. Findings It was found out that the numerous casualties were due to inadequate warning issued during the approach of the tropical cyclones. During an impending hazard, warnings must be accurate, reliable, understandable and timely. Despite the availability of maps that identified safe zones for different communities, warnings raised during the PDRA for both tropical cyclones were deemed too general calling for evacuations of whole provinces. As such, not all communities were evacuated in a timely manner because of failure in the key elements of an effective early warning system. Originality/value To avoid future disasters from happening, it is recommended that the PDRA reinstate its hazards-specific, area-focused and time-bound warnings. Similarly, to increase the resilience of communities, more work on mainstreaming of Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk and Vulnerability Reduction systems for communities must be done as well. Learning from the lessons of these previous disasters will enable communities, their leaders and every stakeholder, not to repeat the same mistakes in the future.

Therefore, large-scale and high-resolution pluvial flood hazard mapping is required to identify hotspots where mitigation measures may be applied to reduce flood risk. Depressions or low points in urban areas where runoff volumes can be stored are prone to pluvial flooding. The standard approach based on estimating synthetic design hyetographs assumes, in a given depression, that the T-year design storm generates the T-year pluvial flood. In addition, urban areas usually include several depressions even linked or nested that would require distinct design hyetographs instead of using a unique synthetic design storm. In this paper, a stochastic methodology is proposed to address the limitations of this standard approach, developing large-scale ~ 2 m-resolution pluvial flood hazard maps in urban areas with multiple depressions. The authors present an application of the proposed approach to the city of Pamplona in Spain (68.26 km(2)). The Safer_RAIN fast-processing algorithm based on digital elevation models (DEMs) is compared with the IBER 2D hydrodynamic model in four real storms by using 10-min precipitation fields. Precipitation recorded at rainfall-gauging stations was merged with continuous fields obtained from a meteo-rological radar station. Given the hydrostatic limitations of Safer_RAIN, the benchmarking results are adequate in terms of water depths in depressions. A long set of 10 000 synthetic storms that maintain the statistical properties of observations in Pamplona is generated. Safer_RAIN is used to simulate runoff response, and filling and spilling processes, in depressions for the 10 000 synthetic storms, obtaining the probability distribution of water depths in each cell. Maps of pluvial flood hazards are developed in the Pamplona metropolitan area for 10 return periods in the range from two to 500 years from such pixel-based series of simulated water depths. Bivariate return -period curves are estimated in a set of cells, showing that several storms can generate a given T-year pluvial flood with an increasing precipitation with storm duration that depends on the draining catchment soil char-acteristics. The methodology proposed is useful to develop maps of pluvial flood hazards in large multi-depression urban areas in reasonable computation times, identifying the main pluvial flood hotspots.

Recognizing Allogenic Controls on the Stratigraphic Architecture of Ancient Alluvial Fans in the Western US	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						stratigraphic architecture; alluvial fan; allogenic; autogenic; paleoclimate; fan dynamics; Western US	GREEN RIVER FORMATION; COMPENSATIONAL STACKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEATH-VALLEY; LAKE SYSTEM; BASIN; QUATERNARY; DEPOSITION; FLOW; UTAH	Alluvial fans are a significant part of the sediment routing system, forming distinctive steep, fan-shaped deposits of coarse-grained detritus where rivers lose flow velocity after exiting confined mountain drainages. Processes on the fan are influenced by both internal (autogenic) feedback cycles like channel avulsion and by external (allogenic) conditions such as climate and tectonics. These conditions in turn influence the stratigraphic architecture (i.e., the pattern of channel stacking and sizes) within the fan. Studying stratigraphic architecture of alluvial fans can, therefore, provide insight into controls on fan deposition. We employ UAV-based photogrammetric models to analyze the stratigraphic architecture of two well-exposed ancient alluvial fans in the western US - the Eocene Richards Mountain Conglomerate and the Cretaceous Echo Canyon Conglomerate. Both fans were deposited under relatively warm, wet climates and compressional tectonic regimes. We use a seven-fold hierarchy of bounding surfaces and associated lithosomes to describe alluvial fan architecture. First- through fourth-order surfaces and lithosomes represent bedform to channel-scale features influenced primarily by autogenic processes on the fan. Controls on fifth-order surfaces/lithosomes have historically been poorly understood, but probably represent fanhead trench migration and lobe construction. Sixth-order surfaces bound individual alluvial fans and seventh-order surfaces correspond to formation boundaries. These are controlled primarily by tectonics. The fifth-order architectural style of the deposits in our two study areas is significantly different and we use this difference to try to isolate a primary control on fifth-order alluvial architecture. Average width:height ratios of fifth-order lithosomes are nearly twice as high for Echo Canyon (112:1) than for Richards Mountain (64:1). This indicates that active channels on the Echo Canyon fan were more mobile than those on the Richards Mountain fan. We attribute this to a more seasonal climate and less vegetation during the deposition of the Echo Canyon Conglomerate (relative to Richards Mountain). This would have increased lateral migration by destabilizing channels through increased sediment flux and flood events. Our results imply that fifth-order stratigraphic architecture of ancient alluvial fans may provide insight into allogenic processes related to paleoclimate. They also indicate risk of increased geologic hazards on alluvial fans where anthropogenic climate change increases future climate variability.

The coupling between climate change and the sedimentary system evolution of the Changjiang distal mud since the Holocene is widely debated. In this study, based on a 14C chronological framework, we investigated the sedimentary system evolution of the Changjiang distal mud since 8 ka. The provenance identification and climate conditions indicated that the climate oscillation largely determined the sediment source-to-sink processes. The sedimentary system was controlled by monsoon system oscillation from 8 to 3 ka. Specifically, during 8-5.4 ka, the prevailing Indian and east Asian summer monsoons increased the sediment flux to the Changjiang distal mud, and the proportion of the Changjiang sediments increased across the entire Changjiang distal mud. Notably, the southern regions were significantly influenced by western Taiwan rivers. Additionally, the prevailing east Asian winter monsoon enhanced the Zhejiang-Fujian coastal current, resulting in the deposition rates increased in south while declined in north. During 5.4-3.0 ka, the summer monsoon systems attenuated, causing decreased sediment discharges from the Changjiang and Taiwan, and the deposition rates declined across the entire Changjiang distal mud. In the southern regions, the intensified Taiwan warm current increased the proportion of Taiwan sediments. Since 3 ka, the monsoon system has become stable, and anthropogenic activities in south China have increased remarkably. The anthropogenic activities resulted in increased Changjiang sediments and rose deposition rates across the entire Changjiang distal mud. During 1.2-0 ka, the frequent floods in the Changjiang basins and typhoons in Taiwan, caused by increased El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) frequency, resulted in provenance fluctuation at the Changjiang distal mud. In addition, the attenuated east Asian winter monsoon caused a northward depocenter shift, which was reflected in spatially different deposition rates, i.e., retained high values in the north but declined in the south. Our findings emphasized the dominant roles of different climatic factors in different stages, and enhance our understanding of the east Asia land-ocean in-teractions and the relationships among the Earth's spheres since the mid-Holocene.

Therefore, we analyzed the changes in flood regime at various spatial and temporal scales and their possible causes, which is accomplished by using flood indicators, trend analysis, change point analysis, and hydrological modeling. The results showed that the northern and northwestern parts of the KRB were more exposed to flood hazard than the southern parts under long-term scenario (1961/64-2015). However, after the change points, the flood risk decreased in the northern and increased in the southern regions. This spatial shift increased the vulnerability of population to the flood hazard, because the majority of population resides in the southern region. The extreme precipitation has also increased, especially the maximum one-day rainfall and maximum five-day rainfall throughout the basin. Particularly, the major cause of the decrease in different flood indicators in the northern parts of the KRB is the corresponding decrease in the annual and monsoonal rainfall and corresponding positive mass balance of glaciers in the northern region after the occurrence of change point in flood regime. However, the major cause of the increase in flood hazard on the southern part of the KRB is associated with maximum five-day rainfall. A 68% variability of annual maximum flood for the Kabul River at Nowshera and an 84% variability of annual maximum flood for Bara River at Jhansi post are explained by maximum five-day rainfall. In addition, a considerable decrease in forests (-5.21%) and increase in the urban area (88.26%) from 1992-2015 also amplifies the risk of higher flood peaks. The results of hydrological modeling suggest that the six-hourly flood peak increased by 6.85% (1992-2010) and 4.81% (2010-2015) for the extreme flood of 2010 for the Kabul River at Nowshera. The flood peak per decade will increase by 8.6%, as compared to the flood peak under the land use scenario of 2010. Therefore, consideration of proper land use planning is crucial for sustainable flood management in the KRB.

This paper presents a systematic study using databases from Springer Link, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Web of Science. The study employs the PRISMA report analysis method to examine 11 flood disaster case studies between 2010 and 2022. The findings reveal that demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare crucially determine social vulnerability to adverse flood events. Notably, risk perception and coping capacity also received substantial attention in the case studies. Unfortunately, many indicators of social vulnerability fail to adequately consider the influence of these factors. The effects of factors that make communities vulnerable vary across disaster stages and countries. This emphasizes the importance of considering specific situations and locations when understanding the origins and consequences of vulnerability. The article concludes by offering recommendations to customize quantitative indicators of social vulnerability to flood contexts, covering aspects such as temporal context, measurability, and indicator relationships.

Adaptations of Pre-Columbian Manioc Storage Techniques as Strategies to Adapt to Extreme Climatic Events in Amazonian Floodplains	HUMAN ECOLOGY			English	Article						Ribeirinhos; Traditional Ecological Knowledge; adaptive strategies; Indian bread; Brazil	KNOWLEDGE; FOODS	In Amazonian floodplains, manioc flour is the main plant food product and source of income for local populations. In the context of climate change, extreme flooding is more frequent and intense, making it difficult to cultivate and process manioc. As local knowledge is dynamic and fundamental to adapt in critical times, we studied local techniques for storing manioc roots, which allow them to be processed later. We conducted semi-structured interviews in three floodplains (varzea) communities (36 families) and three paleo-floodplain (paleovarzea; 1-3 m higher) communities (52 families) in the middle Solimoes River basin (Brazil). Residents mention four techniques for storing fresh manioc; two were cited in archaeological or ethnographic studies (burial and basketing), and two were not cited before in the region (bagging and kanaka). In the paleovarzea, where manioc production is more important as a source of income, residents have more knowledge of manioc storage techniques. However, this knowledge also persists in areas where manioc has less importance for income generation. Residents of the study area express demand for disseminating these practices, as they can contribute to adaptation in critical periods.

Taking advantage of a dense network of rain gauges, most of them with records length of 50-60 years and some others exceeding 85 years, the evolution of these monthly and annual amounts is quantified by means of their time trends, statistical significance and several irregularity parameters. In agreement with the evolution of the CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and the increasing concentration, in parts per million (ppm), of this greenhouse gas, different time trends at annual scale have been detected up to approximately years 1960-1970 in comparison with the interval 1960-1970 to nowadays. Consequently, besides the greenhouse effects on the temperature regime, the influence on the pluviometric regime could not be negligible.

J	Whalley, WB				Whalley, W. Brian			The science tradition in physical geography: 2016 A level specifications and 'powerful geography'	GEOGRAPHY			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE	In this article an overview is made of the subject content of A level 2016 specifications of physical geography by contextualising physical geography and by examining the concept of 'powerful geographical knowledge'. A review of several current (2016) examination board A level specifications of physical geography is presented; all have optional components, especially for 'landforms'. These 'options' restrict coverage in certain topics compared with what has traditionally been thought of as physical geography. The option structure is reflected in the content of two current texts examined with respect to physical geography and geomorphology in Monkhouse's textbook of the 1970-80s. In the exam boards' 2016 specifications of physical geography, treatment of 'systems', especially climate/meteorology and oceanic systems, is incomplete. Climate change is poorly discussed in terms of physical principles as are flooding and changes in frequency of events. As the article demonstrates, although physical geography can be presented as a 'science' subject, the errors and misinformation in some current textbooks supporting exam boards' specifications needs to be addressed. The article suggests that physical geography needs a separate and more scientifically-based A level, perhaps based on 'Critical Zone' science.	[Whalley, W.

Thus, the question of how to reduce the impact of floods and achieve rapid recovery has attracted much attention. We use the urban community as the basic unit to examine the living environment, internal facilities, and surrounding environment characteristics of six different types of communities in the Jianye District of Nanjing City. First, we use factor analysis and the binary logistic regression model to analyze pre-disaster preparation, disaster response, and post-disaster recovery. Second, we analyze the resilience of the community at different stages. Then, we explore the influencing factors of the built environment on the resilience of the community. Results show that the built-up environmental factors, such as topography, riverfront, building coverage ratio, green space rate, and land use diversity, have a significant impact on community resilience. Finally, we proposed several suggestions for improving the flood resilience of Nanjing City.

J	Rouhani, H; Leconte, R				Rouhani, Hassan; Leconte, Robert			Uncertainties of Precipitable Water Calculations for PMP Estimates in Current and Future Climates	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROBABLE MAXIMUM FLOOD; SUMMER PRECIPITATION; RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; SOUTHERN QUEBEC; RIVER-BASIN; DEW-POINT; MODEL; METHODOLOGY; TEMPERATURE; PROJECTIONS	Probable maximum precipitation (PMP) is the design criterion for many hydraulic and hydrologic structures. Despite its significance in water resource engineering, estimation of PMP values carries uncertainties. On the other hand, recent research suggests that PMP values are subject to change as a consequence of climate change. To study these issues, PMP estimates from three precipitable water calculation methods were first compared to evaluate sensitivity of PMP values to the selected estimation methods. All required data for PMP estimates were obtained from climate models' outputs to ensure consistency in comparing results. Seven climate simulations of the 1961-1990 horizon were used to produce PMP values for three watersheds in the south, center, and north of the Province of Quebec (Canada). To analyze the future climate influence on PMP, climate projections of the 2041-2070 horizon were used. Results show that a general increase in PMP in a future climate for the three watersheds studied is ubiquitous in all methods employed, reinforcing the conclusion that PMP will be rising in the future in these regions.

The Evolution of Agricultural Drainage from the Earliest Times to the Present	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						agricultural drainage; irrigation; land reclamation; water and civilization; sustainable drainage	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-RESOURCES; FRESH-WATER; LAND; IRRIGATION; QUALITY; DESIGN; HISTORY; SYSTEMS; MINOAN	Agricultural developments require changes in land surface and subsurface hydraulic functions as protection from floods, reclamation of flooded land, irrigation, and drainage. Drainage of agricultural land has a long history and apparently traces back to the earliest civilizations of Mesopotamia and Iran before 4000 BC. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations developed techniques and strategies of drainage of agricultural lands from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. After the collapse of the Aegean Bronze-age civilizations, society building and agricultural innovation in the archaic and Classical periods (ca. 800-300 BC) included successful attempts at controlling drainage and irrigation techniques. In addition, China, India, and Mesoamerica have extensive histories of drainage. The aim of this review paper is to trace the evolution of the main foundings on agricultural drainage technologies through the centuries until the present. This historical review reveals valuable insights into ancient hydraulic technologies as well as irrigation and drainage management that will help to find bright horizons for sustainable agriculture in future.

J	Langill, JC; Abizaid, C				Langill, Jennifer C.; Abizaid, Christian			What is a bad flood? Local perspectives of extreme floods in the Peruvian Amazon	AMBIO			English	Article						Amazon; Climate change; Extreme floods; Floodplain livelihoods; Local knowledge; Peru	WESTERN AMAZONIA; RAIN-FOREST; RIVER; UCAYALI; VULNERABILITY; RISK; ACCESSIBILITY; AGRICULTURE; COMMUNITIES; DISTANCES	The annual flood cycle is integral to rural life and livelihoods in riparian Amazonia. Livelihoods are built around the flood cycle, which facilitates transportation and affects soil fertility and fish migrations. Flood extremes, however, can have devastating impacts for riverine populations, yet there is minimal understanding of what distinguishes a 'normal' flood from a 'bad' flood, or flooding as integral to riverine settlement from flooding as environmental hazard. We address this limitation by drawing upon hydrograph data and field data collected in a riverine village in the Peruvian Amazon. We define four extreme flood types based on height, duration, and timing of onset, and illustrate how they each create a unique combination of negative and positive implications. We discuss the integral role of fishing to floodplain livelihoods during the flood season, and the implications of flood extremes for health, safety, and food provision. The article proposes a more nuanced conceptualization of flooding in riverine Amazonia to better inform policies and practices aimed at supporting local populations during extreme floods.

This paper seeks to add to the growing literature on public perceptions of the benefits of managed realignment by examining local resident's knowledge of estuarine management issues and identifying their willingness to pay towards a new managed realignment scheme on the Tay Estuary, Scotland. Results showed that the majority of respondents were not aware of flood risk issues on the estuary or of different flood defence options. Household mean willingness to pay for a specific managed realignment scheme was calculated at 43 per annum. Significant drivers of willingness to pay included respondents perceived flood risk and worries about the state of existing flood defences. There was also spatial heterogeneity with those living closest to the scheme being willing to pay the most. Prior knowledge of flood risk issues were found not to significantly influence willingness to pay.

The nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon compounds play an essential role in phytoplankton growth. However, the way that nutrients and phytoplankton interact and how this relationship varies seasonally in tropical freshwater ecosystems is not clear. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between phytoplankton-nutrients over the hydrological cycle in Amazonian floodplain lakes and verify if this relationship influences the biomass of cyanobacteria. We also check what factors linked to nutrients act in structuring phytoplankton community. Using the phytoplankton functional approach, we verified how their ability to respond to hydrological and environmental variations reflects the ecological conditions and investigated how these interactions work. The results show that the Amazonian floodplain lakes could maintain long-term nutrient enrichment status. The nutrients input conduces to cyanobacteria dominance, that allied to other factors, play an essential role in supporting the stability of the phytoplankton-nutrients relationship over the hydrological cycle.

This "gravel-sand transition" is characterized by an abrupt greater-than-one-order-of-magnitude drop in both gradient and sediment grain size, suggesting a degree of long-term stability. However, the stratigraphic record of the gravel-sand transition in the Miocene Siwalik Group demonstrates intermittent transport of coarse gravels tens of kilometres downstream of the transition; such events in contemporary channels would drive channel avulsion(s) and increase flood risk, devastating communities across the plains. We combine sedimentological analysis of Siwalik deposits with entrainment calculations which demonstrate that hyperconcentration is required to transport coarse bedload over low-gradient plains. Transport conditions are attainable when intense monsoon precipitation (a 200- to 1000-year event) is combined with increased suspended sediment concentrations in channels. Predicted climate change and ongoing seismicity increase the likelihood of such extreme events within this century.

However, while disaster risk modelling studies have made progress in quantifying the exposure of populations, limited advances have been made in determining the socioeconomic characteristics of these exposed populations. Here, we generate synthetic structural and socioeconomic microdata for around 9.5 million persons for six districts in Bangladesh as vector points using a combination of spatial microsimulation techniques and dasymetric modelling. We overlay the dataset with satellite-derived flood extents of Cyclone Fani, affecting the region in 2019, quantifying the number of exposed households, their socioeconomic characteristics, and the exposure bias of certain household variables. We demonstrate how combining various modelling techniques could provide novel insights into the exposure of poor and vulnerable groups, which could help inform the emergency response after extreme events as well targeting adaptation options to those most in need of them.

Sediment cores were retrieved from three wetlands to trace changes to their ecological state over time. The basal sediments of the wetlands date back to the beginning of river regulation in the 1930s, suggesting that only after then were they inundated sufficiently often to allow for net sediment accumulation. The diatoms preserved in the lower levels of all cores suggest clear, freshwater conditions prevailed during that period. Increased sediment and nutrient loads are inferred by increased epiphytic forms and nutrient indicators. Over recent decades the wetlands have transitioned to plankton dominance, reflecting greater connectivity to the river and distributary, and a reduced light environment. This pattern resembles to that recorded both upstream and downstream, suggesting a regionalscale change in the wetlands of the southern Murray-Darling Basin.

The Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) were used as the core of flood alert system. As an input of the calibrated HEC-HMS model, we used the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). The application based on Progressive Web Application (PWA) was developed to support the visualization of flood forecasted and to deliver early warning messages for mobile devices. Our findings show the proposed flood alert system is able to simulated flood events using QPF of WRF and with a 48 h lead time. The DSS developed here is an important information to decision making by the public authorities as well as to ordinary people for reducing flood disasters.

To document potential recovery, this study replicated benthic and sediment surveys conducted immediately following the event and 15 years later. Coral cores were analyzed to determine coral growth rates and density. Our results suggest that significant reduction in terrigenous sediments has led to partial ecosystem recovery based on coral species and colony increases, more balanced size frequency distributions, improved coral condition, and enhanced coral recruitment despite lack of recovery of large dead coral colonies. However, within this 15-year period, episodic storms and a bleaching event impeded the recovery process, preventing full recovery and continuously threatening the coral reef community. As climate change progresses, the intensity and frequency of these disturbances are predicted to increase.

Differential residential perspectives on in situ protection and retreat as strategies for climate adaptation	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Structural equation model (SEM); Climate change adaptation; Adaptation thresholds; Flood risk; Environmental migration	SEA-LEVEL RISE; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; FLOOD; PERCEPTION; MIGRATION; RESILIENCE; EXPERIENCE; FRAMEWORK; ATTITUDE; LOSSES	The growing cost of climate-driven coastal impacts requires an improved understanding of how coastal populations engage with adaptation decisions. While many studies explore factors driving coastal adaptation, generally, few evaluate how residents consider relationships between in situ, protective adaption vs. retreat from at-risk areas. What is the relationship between residents' exposure, perceptions of climate trends, and concerns about the future? How do these factors influence openness to different adaption strategies? Are these strategies considered to be progressive-where protection is indexed to minor threats and retreat occurs when protection measures fail-or are these dichotomous choices? We apply structural equation modeling to evaluate these decision pathways using a 2017 household survey in North Carolina's (USA) Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula (n = 147). Our results reveal that residents commonly view protection and retreat as mutually exclusive, rather than progressive, methods for reducing risk, and that their preferences are correlated with different understandings of climate threats.

National and municipal administrations have responded to the increased probability of extreme precipitation events by expanding drainage facilities, or by warning the public in time. In this study, we applied a dynamic system framework to examine how the interdependent factors in extreme precipitation from engineering and society interact with each other and form an adaptive system. Based on the concept of a complex adaptive system, we identified the adaptive units and paths of the system. We set the model parameters using data from Shanghai, and simulated the dynamic process of the system to 2032. We found that the effects of extreme precipitation on an urban transportation infrastructure can be controlled based on the longterm operation of the adaptive system, and that the adaptive units in the physical, social, and economic subsystems are connected with each other.

This study is the first to investigate the interannual variability, and return periods, of both rainfall erosivity and ED over the Mediterranean for the period 1680-2019. By capturing the relationship between seasonal rainfall, its variability, and recorded hydrological extremes in documentary data consistent with a sample (1981-2015) of detailed Revised Universal Soil Loss Erosion-based data, we show a noticeable decreasing trend of rainfall erosivity since about 1838. However, the 30-year return period of ED values indicates a positive long-term trend, in tandem with the resurgence of very wet days (>95th percentile) and the erosive activity of rains during the past two decades. A possible fingerprint of recent warming is the occurrence of prolonged wet spells in apparently more erratic and unexpected ways.

Stormwater inflow from the ground to the pipeline is managed by smart gullies. The gullies are real-time controlled and therefore capable of predicting the weather conditions. Drainage facilities are usually unable to cope with excessive flows that exceed their design limits. This results in pluvial floods and activation of combined sewer overflows, both of which have negative consequences. Northern Europe is expecting to receive more intense rainstorms in the future; therefore, innovative solutions are needed for flow management. The inlet control presented in our work is financially feasible and efficient to be applied to small catchments with substantial permeable surfaces to reduce the peak run-off. The control system is autonomous; therefore, it is suitable for sites scattered around the urban catchment. The concept was successfully tested in a 12 ha catchment area in Tallinn, Estonia.

Trend analyses were performed on the frequency of occurrence of each of the flood types continentally and in five geographical regions of Europe. Continentally, the annual frequency of flood events did not show a significant change over the investigation period. However, the frequency of both winter and summer long-rain events increased significantly, while that of summer snowmelt events decreased significantly. Regionally, the frequency of winter short and long-rain events increased significantly in Western Europe, while the frequency of summer snowmelt and short-rain events decreased in Northern Europe. The frequency of summer snowmelt events in Eastern Europe and winter short-rain events in Southern Europe showed a declining trend.

A preliminary assessment of coastal GI's role during Hurricane Sandy: a case study of three communities	URBAN WATER JOURNAL			English	Article						Green infrastructure; resilience; coastal protection; Hurricane Sandy; New York City; climate change	STORM-SURGE; WETLANDS; PROTECTION; MANGROVES; DAMAGE	New York City's coastlines are a mosaic of natural and man-made habitats intermixed with housing and industry, all of which are extremely vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, and damaging wave action. Risks are projected to increase over time as sea levels rise, population grows, and the frequency and severity of extreme events increase. This paper investigates the potential role of green infrastructure (GI) as a risk reduction measure, using Hurricane Sandy as a case study. Specifically, this research examines whether the type, size, and configuration of GI played a role in determining the odds of building damages. Results suggest that proximity to different GI types did affect the odds of damage, both positively and negatively, and that the impacts of both small-scale and large-scale natural features varied geographically. Results suggest that nature-based solutions to coastal flooding must be tailored to specific local conditions in order to be effective.

Consequently, the water saturation of the dike can vary significantly both in space and time, and the resulting groundwater flow can affect the free-surface flow in case of overtopping. Conversely, the free-surface flow can modify the pore water content, which controls erosion and slope instabilities. In this paper, a combined approach to such situations is presented, in which the degree of saturation and the flow through the embankment are simulated by solving the two-dimensional Richards equation on an unstructured mesh with an implicit finite volume scheme that is coupled to the system of shallow-water equations solved in one dimension using an explicit finite-volume scheme. The coupled model is validated on several situations of flows through and over earthen embankments with different constitutive materials.

Time series analysis of several rain gauges shows that the mid-latitudes of Brazil experienced an increase in both annual and extreme rainfall over the last 60 years (1961-2020). The annual time series shows a significant upward trend, while changes in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall indicate a shortening of the recurrence interval for extreme precipitation events. In support of these results, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) also shows a positive trend for rainfall anomalies. Thus, the flood risk is higher at present than a few decades ago, while drought intensity is lower for both short and long monthly intervals used for the SPI calculation. The 60-year instrumental rainfall data for southern Brazil shows that the amount of rainfall and changes in intensity could be higher than climate projections from models based on a broader spatial scale.

This debate is also one in which the subdiscipline of political geography has been inadvertently complicit by accepting positivist approaches, that erase the subject and their subjectivities from this discussion, and frame them as science. The argument in this paper problematises the fundamental understanding of 'climate conflict', as defined and universalised by Western science in the Western academy. Instead, it argues that the subaltern's lived experience and interpretation of hazards and their relationship with conflicts needs to be located and centred in this conversation - not just as that of a hapless victim but as knowledge producers able to set the agendas and re-orient the focus of this field. Research examining conflicts around floods and evictions begins to map a new future for how that might be possible.

Scientific evidence increasingly reveals that wetlands play critical hydrologic roles in landscapes, helping to mitigate flood, drought, and, in some cases, fire risks. However, wetland protective services have not received sufficient policy action. We propose national wetland commissions, modeled after the concept of lake and river commissions, as one way to strategically link wetland protection to other societal objectives, including human disaster risk planning, infrastructure investments, and climate adaptation strategies. We offer an example applicable to the United States, describing an institutional design for a National Interagency Wetland Commission. We suggest it could be patterned after existing federal commissions statutorily created by Congress with delegated administrative and regulatory authority and designated independent agency status within the executive branch. It is time for bold and innovative policy action to incorporate wetland protective services into societies' defenses against extreme weather events.

Australia's Murray-Darling Basin is an example of a major system undergoing substantial water reform to balance the needs of competing users, including the environment, within the constraints of an arid climate. This reform revolves around accounting for finite volumes of water that have been shared amongst water users. We argue that while recovering water will provide good outcomes, as a sole intervention, it is not enough to deliver the desired environmental benefits of the reform given the significantly altered state of the catchment. Here, we present 10 measures that could be used to complement planned water recovery actions. These "complementary measures" integrate recovery actions, which when strategically combined with water delivery would significantly enhance water reform efforts to generate environmental outcomes in a highly modified system.

Developing indexes that can be used to assess channel connectivity is a key issue in the lower Yellow River and beyond. We propose a suite of connectivity indexes based on several components of a river channel, including boundary, flow, and sediment indicators. Through an analysis of river connectivity over time in the lower Yellow River, we found that a decrease in precipitation was the main cause of poor river connectivity conditions in the 1990s. Since 1999, the year of impoundment of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, river connectivity has improved, as shown by boundary, sediment, and ecology indexes, as a result of reservoir operation and regulation. However, water diversion may increase channel sedimentation, leading to a decline in sediment connectivity. The suite of river connectivity indexes developed in this paper and applied to the Yellow River can be used in similar sediment-laden streams in other semiarid regions worldwide.

Considering this, the use of engineering techniques that reduce runoff and promote urban requalification are an efficient option for managing rainwater. This paper presents a case study of a flood control project using a storm water detention pond, designed to allow multiple uses of an urban space. The operation of the system is evaluated by an urban flow-cell model, known as MODCEL. This application seeks the best configuration for the layout of 'Celso Pecanha' Detention Basin, considering the local restrictions imposed by the City of Mesquite - Brazil, and optimized to damp storm flows resulting from rainfall events with return periods up to 50 years. The solution proposed considers the possibility of social urban space uses in flood control projects, revitalizing degraded areas and giving them multiple functions.

Despite advances in network science and risk analysis, we lack a systematic mathematical framework for road network percolation under the disturbance of flooding. The difficulty is rooted in the unique three-dimensional nature of a flood, where altitude plays a critical role as the third dimension, and the current network-based framework is unsuitable for it. Here we develop a failure model to study the effect of floods on road networks; the result covers 90.6% of road closures and 94.1% of flooded streets resulting from Hurricane Harvey. We study the effects of floods on road networks in China and the United States, showing a discontinuous phase transition, indicating that a small local disturbance may lead to a large-scale systematic malfunction of the entire road network at a critical point. Our integrated approach opens avenues for understanding the resilience of critical infrastructure networks against floods.

A continuous modelling approach for design flood estimation on sub-daily time scale	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Article						derived flood frequency; continuous modelling; temporal disaggregation; flood hazard; synthetic flood events	CONTINUOUS SIMULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; STOCHASTIC RAINFALL; CASCADE MODEL; FREQUENCY; DISAGGREGATION; PEAK; UNCERTAINTY	Design flood estimation is an essential part of flood risk assessment. Commonly applied are flood frequency analyses and design storm approaches, while the derived flood frequency using continuous simulation has been getting more attention recently. In this study, a continuous hydrological modelling approach on an hourly time scale, driven by a multi-site weather generator in combination with a -nearest neighbour resampling procedure, based on the method of fragments, is applied. The derived 100-year flood estimates in 16 catchments in Vorarlberg (Austria) are compared to (a) the flood frequency analysis based on observed discharges, and (b) a design storm approach. Besides the peak flows, the corresponding runoff volumes are analysed. The spatial dependence structure of the synthetically generated flood peaks is validated against observations. It can be demonstrated that the continuous modelling approach can achieve plausible results and shows a large variability in runoff volume across the flood events.

The melting of Folgefonna has implications for meltwater drainage and hydropower production, as well as the potential for geohazards and impacts to tourism, the communities and infrastructures surrounding the glacier. To support future adaptation strategies, we need to know the subglacial topography of the ice caps to identify water divides and possible areas for geohazards. Therefore, we mapped the subglacial topography at Sorfonna, the largest of the Folgefonna ice caps, using an ice-penetrating radar (2.5 MHz antennas; 1,000 x 500 m grid). The results show a highly irregular subglacial landscape, with deep valleys and high mountain peaks. The maximum ice thickness is 570 m and the mean ice thickness is 190 m. We examined the retreat pattern of Sorfonna using the subglacial topography map in combination with a simple ice flow model and simulated the ice retreat 150 years into the future. We used two climate scenarios (one with a 1.5 degrees C warming and a 3% increase in precipitation, and a second with a 3.5 degrees C warming together with 15% increase in precipitation) and focused on how the glacial retreat will cause hydrological changes in the catchments surrounding the glacier. The main drainage pattern shifts during glacial retreat, with a larger proportion of southward drainage compared to the present day. The ice flow modelling also reveals that the southern part of Sorfonna is more durable during climate change whereas the thinner part of the ice cap, in the north, melts faster. We suggest that increased winter precipitation in a future warmer climate makes the southern part of Sorfonna more resilient than many other glaciers in southern Norway. The subglacial topography map and the retreat pattern also reveal areas that may accumulate water and could potentially generate a future glacial outburst flood. Sediments from distal glacier-fed lakes around Sorfonna have been used to constrain the thresholds identified on the subglacial topography map. Combining sedimentological evidence from distal glacier-fed lakes with the new subglacial topography map confirms that the retreat of specific outlet glaciers, such as Bondhusbreen, Buerbreen, and Mosevassbreen, will have a large impact on meltwater routing, as they are situated behind bedrock thresholds in the upper part of the glacier's catchment area.

In this paper, we investigated the future changes in some pivotal climatic variables (mean temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration) under 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C specific warming levels (SWLs) across the Indus River Basin of South Asia. The seven global climate models output under seven different emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP4-3.4, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5) from the latest Sixth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) are used for this purpose. The Penman-Monteith approach is applied to estimate PET, and the water balance equation is for reflecting water surplus/deficit. Results indicate that except for precipitation, the greater increases in temperature and PET are inclined to happen with continued global warming. The highest increase in temperature is accounted for 14.6% (2.4 degrees C), and the enhanced PET is estimated at 5.2% higher than the reference period (1995-2014) under 3.0 degrees C SWL. While the precipitation is projected to increase by the highest 4.8% for 2.0 degrees C warming level. The differences in regional climate for an additional 0.5 degrees C (2.0-1.5 degrees C) and 1.0 degrees C (3.0-2.0 degrees C) of warming, the temperature is projected to increase by 0.4 degrees C and 0.9 degrees C in the entire IRB respectively. The highest increase in mean temperature (5.1%) and PET (2.4%) in the IRB are predicted to intensify for an additional 1.0 degrees C than that of 0.5 degrees C of warming, but precipitation is intended to decrease by 0.4%. Spatially, the increase in temperature, precipitation, and PET are dominated towards high elevation in the upper basin (north) under all the SWLs. The increased variability in climatological parameters across IRB depicts an evident occurrence of both wet events (upper basin) as well as dry events (lower basin) with the increase in global average temperature rise. However, these findings provide an insightful basis for water resource management as well as initiating mitigation and adaptation measures in the IRB related to water surplus (floods) and water deficit (droughts).

We studied Theobroma cacao L. rootstocks for 60 d of flooding and 30 d post-flooding, grafting PS-1319 scions onto five rootstocks (TSH-1188, Cepec-2002, Para, Esfip-02, SJ-02). Photochemical performance remained stable across rootstocks, while flooding progressively reduced electron transport efficiency. Photochemical damage emerged after 7 d, worsening occurred at 19 d. Although post-flooding efficiency improved, recovery time was insufficient for full restoration. Stem diameter increased less in Esfip-02. TSH-1188 had the highest stem dry mass during flooding and the most root and total dry mass during post-flooding. SJ-02 had the lowest stem dry mass and post-flooding total dry mass. Principal component analysis revealed stem and root development as a key for recovery. SJ-02 and Esfip-02 showed lower flooding tolerance and recovery, while TSH-1188 and Para exhibited higher resilience.	[Pinto, M. L. P. B.; Falqueto, A.

The ADCIRC + SWAN coupled model was simulated using various scenario simulations based on Super Typhoon Hato to quantify the nonlinear interactions of tide-surge-river during extreme events. The results reveal that three drivers, including (1) tide-surge phases, (2) typhoon tracks and wind speeds (3) upstream runoff, affect the extreme water levels by different nonlinear interactions. Changes in tide-surge phases remain the most constructive factor controlling nonlinear effects, with the maximum contribution exceeding 50.46% of the extreme water level. The tide-surge nonlinear residual water level contributing to the extreme water level at high tide falling can reach 0.92 m. The nonlinear effects are exacerbated as typhoon wind speeds and upstream discharges increase. Peak water levels from the compound floods are more than 25% higher than storm surges alone at the river outlets. The nonlinear effects are mainly generated by the convection terms from the tide-surge -river interactions in the estuarine rivers.

It utilized a cross-sectional survey of 802 mostly Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in 27 counties in Kenya that are prone to droughts and floods. The study covered firms in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and accommodation and food services sectors. Bivariate probit regressions reveal that choice of finance coping mechanisms varies by firm-specific characteristics, sector and locational features. Sectors with predominantly informal firms reveal higher usage of informal finance, signalling vulnerabilities. Micro firms and female-owned firms show dependence on informal finance, while educational attainment of the firm's owner, location within urban clusters and larger firms are associated with use of formal finance in coping with droughts and floods. The findings reveal that firms' adaptations to climate change risks require measures to facilitate access to formal finance and promoting interventions tailored around firm-specific variables, sector characteristics and business environment.

The most predominant amongst these challenges are abiotic and biotic stresses caused by increased incidences of temperature extremes, drought, unseasonal flooding, and pathogens. These threats, mostly due to anthropogenic activities, resulted in severe challenges to crop and livestock production leading to substantial economic losses. It is essential to develop environmentally viable and cost-effective green processes to alleviate these stresses in the crops, livestock, and fisheries. The application of nanomaterials in farming practice to minimize nutrient losses, pest management, and enhance stress resistance capacity is of supreme importance. This paper explores innovative methods for synthesizing metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles using plants, animals, and fisheries wastes and their valorization to mitigate abiotic and biotic stresses and input use efficiency in climate-smart and stress-resilient agriculture including crop plants, livestock, and fisheries.

Research that examines the compositional and contextual characteristics of places with elevated flood risk is largely limited to urban-centric analyses and case studies. However, rural areas of the USA are not immune to flooding. In this paper, we integrate social and physical data to identify the social correlates of flood risk and determine if and how they vary across the rural-urban continuum for all census tracts in the coterminous USA. Our results show that risk of flooding is higher in rural tracts, in tracts with larger relative shares of socioeconomically vulnerable populations, and in tracts reliant on flood-vulnerable industries. We also show that compositional social correlates of flooding are not consistent across rural-urban areas. This work widens the scope of discourse on flooding to attend to the heterogeneity of social correlates and the implications for policy and future research.

Integrative and innovative risk management is needed to reduce the impacts of such a disturbance. To pursue this, a better understanding of the current level of disaster risk management is indispensible. Following this line of thinking, the present work was intended to evaluate the various aspects of flood risk management in Japan using a recent case of major flooding that occurred last autumn as a result of a major storm. The focus was on the vulnerability assessment for the disaster-stricken area using various kinds of information including topographic features, land use, flood warning system, evacuation behavior, levee structure, insurance system and government support for recovery. Such an integrative assessment shed new light on vulnerability-generating mechanisms. In particular, it found that the disaster-stricken area has a high level of coping capacity related to flood disasters. However, the high level of coping capacity hinders the reduction of susceptibility to the impacts of flooding. Based on this finding, a new, simple but operational vulnerability management framework was proposed, which may help decision-makers prioritize actions for vulnerability reduction.

The end of Miocene in the Siwaliks of Pakistan marks faunal turnover due to climatic change with higher rates of aridity and an expansion of C-4 grasslands. But after the Miocene, the studies regarding diet and climate of herbivore communities are still highly un-explored. We present here the analysis of delta C-13 and delta O-18 to estimate the diet and climate endeavored by herbivore communities from the Plio-Pleistocene Siwaliks of Pakistan. Our results indicate that the proportion of C-3 diet in the Pliocene fauna was diminished but not absent while Pleistocene fauna do not report any evidences of C-3 vegetation. The Pliocene and Pleistocene time span reports the flood plain environment with increased aridity which favored more C-4 grasses from 3.6 to 0.6 Ma. We found that Pliocene and Pleistocene Siwalik faunas have close affinities with African faunal communities with respect to their dietary and ecological niche.	[Khan, A. M.; Iqbal, A.; Waseem, M.

Sudden, heavy rainfall in a short time as well as the summer drought periods can be a major concern for urban water management systems. In addition to overloading the urban sewer system, urban flash floods caused by large amounts of precipitation can lead to serious damage in connection with surface runoff; furthermore, this significant amount of water is removed from the water cycle of the city without utilization (infiltration, storage). Various water management and hydrology models, such as UFORE-Hydro used in our analyses, can serve as suitable tools for investigating these processes. In our research, we examined the role of vegetation covered areas in urban water cycle, paying special attention to their impact on surface runoff. The results of modeling in Szeged sample areas show that vegetation can considerably reduce the volume and amplitude of surface runoff. In the scenario studies, vegetation has always changed the rate of runoff in a favorable direction, thus our findings support the necessity of green infrastructure developments.

J	Volpi, E				Volpi, Elena			On return period and probability of failure in hydrology	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						probability of failure; return period; stationarity; time-dependence	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; EXTREME EVENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; STATIONARITY; DESIGN; FLOODS; DEAD	The return period measures the rareness of extreme events such as floods and droughts that might cause huge damages to the society and the environment; hence, it lies at the heart of hydraulic design and risk assessment problems. Indeed, return period is a commonly applied probabilistic concept in the hydrologic literature, which has attracted renewed interest stimulated by the need of efficiently dealing with complex processes in a changing environment. In this study, the concept of return period and the related risk of failure are presented by making use of a general mathematical framework. It helps for a better understanding of the return period and risk of failure formulations that are commonly adopted in practical engineering applications. The framework can be further applied under more general conditions. In particular, the extension of the return period concept to nonstationary and time-dependent cases is discussed herein, by relaxing the hypotheses commonly (and sometimes implicitly) assumed that allows to derive simple analytic formulations.

These ungulate footprints documented from the late Oligocene of the Karayun Formation in southern Sivas represent the first reported vertebrates in Anatolia. The footprints of three different species of ungulates were identified. The shapes, depth, and widths of the footprints provided some basic ichnotaxonomic and Track Maker information, but based on the poor preservation of the footprints, ichnotaxa identification is difficult. This study aimed to use an ichnotaxonomic approach to contribute to the late Oligocene biochronology in Anatolia due to the small amount of footprint findings in the literature. Ungulate herds left mixed footprints in wetland areas along the banks of flooding rivers. The late Oligocene period was a time characterized by large climate changes in Anatolia; hence, it may have hosted different ecosystems and taxa.

J	Hughes, S; Resor, C; Newberry, H				Hughes, Sara; Resor, Caroline; Newberry, Heather			State policy and local resilience: evaluating state policies for flood resilience in the Great Lakes region of the United States	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						Flood planning; adaptation policy; governance; environmental justice	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANS; IMPACTS	Flood resilience policy and planning are highly localized in the United States (US) and many parts of the world, with local governments responsible for a wide range of land use and infrastructure investment decisions that drive flood risk and response. However, many local governments lack the resources to plan for and adapt to increased flooding without external support. State governments can help by promulgating rules and providing guidance and resources that make flood resilience planning at the local level easier, more likely, and more equitable. However, very little is known about the programmes and policies US states can and do develop to support local flood resilience, how much these programmes and policies vary between states, and the extent to which states are going beyond required or standard practice. In this study, we develop an evaluation framework for state flood policies and programmes that captures the types of programmes and policies used by states in the US, distinguishing between required or standard practices and more advanced approaches. We use a numeric scoring system to operationalize four distinct categories of state policy: information provision, planning guidance, regulations and standards, and funding and financing. The scoring system accounts for whether states incorporate climate change and social equity into their resources. We then apply the framework and scoring system to the eight states of the Great Lakes region: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Our findings demonstrate both the consistencies and variation in state-level flood management programmes and policies, identify policy leaders in the region, and reveal areas where states can prioritize further investment and policy development for better flood risk management. The study provides an evaluation framework for scholars and practitioners of subnational flood policies and programmes, and descriptive insights into the status of state-level flood resilience policy and planning in the Great Lakes region.Key policy insightsEvaluations of state and other subnational government support for local flood resilience should centre on information provision, planning guidance, setting regulations and standards, and providing funding and financing to support better planning and implementation of relevant policies.In the Great Lakes region of the US there is wide variation between states in their adoption of standard and more advanced strategies for supporting local flood resilience, and the emphasis they give to justice and equity.States that have adopted more advanced strategies can serve as an important resource for learning and sharing of experience across localities or subnational regions.

Green infrastructure (GI), a stormwater management tool in use worldwide, can reduce the risk of urban flooding significantly. This paper used bibliometrics to present the state of the literature on GI planning principles for stormwater management. The analysis reveals that the number of GI-related studies has grown exponentially in recent years and is most closely related to the discipline of environmental sciences/ecology, with the majority of output coming from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Furthermore, the inductive analysis of a database served to identify the nine most widely discussed principles for GI planning, which are adaptability, connectivity, diversity, multifunctionality, multiscale, informatisation, integration, public participation, and sustainability. These findings can inform GI efforts to cope with the risks of stormwater in the context of climate change.

Across probabilistic phenomena, climate change is an exemplar of paramount uncertainties. These uncertainties have been em-braced in supporting governments' decisions; yet receive scarce attention when studying individual behavior. Analyzing a survey conducted in the USA, China, Indonesia, and the Netherlands (N=6242), we explore socio-economic, psychological, and behavioral differences between individuals who can subjectively assess risks, and those who are risk-uncertain. We find that risk-uncertain individuals are more likely to belong to societal subgroups classically considered as vulnerable, and have reduced capacities and intentions to adapt to hazards-specifically floods. The distinctions between risk-aware and risk-uncertain individuals indicate that ignoring differences in individuals' capacity to assess risks could amount to persistent vulnerability and undermine climate-resilience efforts. While we use floods emblematically, these finding have consequences for the standard practice of dropping or bootstrapping uncertain responses, irrespective of the hazard, with implications for environmental management.

These recent precipitation swings represent an increasing trend in variability of California's hydroclimate over the past decades. Here, we put this trend in a longer-term context using tree-ring-based precipitation, streamflow, and snow water equivalent reconstructions. We show that the statewide rise in hydroclimate variability in the 20th century is driven by an increasing trend in the magnitude of wet extremes. A prior period of strong variability in the 16th century, in contrast, is related to an increasing trend in the magnitude of dry extremes. Our results are consistent with climate model simulations that suggest an increasingly volatile future for California's hydroclimate and highlight the importance of collaboration between scientists and water resource managers to incorporate this increased variability into their decision-making and planning, acknowledging higher risks for compound events.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						groundwater-fed irrigation modelling; water management; groundwater depletion; Indo-Gangetic plain	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; STORAGE; IMPACTS; RECHARGE; SUSTAINABILITY; MODEL	Indian river basins are intensively managed with country-specific agricultural practices of cultivating submerged paddy and uncontrolled groundwater (GW) irrigation. Numerical experiments with the state-of-the-art land surface models, such as variable infiltration capacity (VIC), without incorporating region-specific practices, could be misleading. Here, we coupled VIC with 2D GW model AMBHAS, incorporating India-specific irrigation practices and crop practices, including submerged paddy fields. We performed numerical experiments to understand the causal factors of GW depletion in the northwest Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP). We identify widespread flood irrigation and cultivation of water-intensive paddy as critical drivers of the declining GW scenario. Our numerical experiments suggest that the introduction of drip irrigation reduces GW depletion in the northwest, but does not change the sign of GW level trends. The GW levels in the non-paddy fields of the middle IGP are less sensitive to irrigation practices due to the high return flow to GW for flood irrigation.

In this study, based on three statistical learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest regression (RF), and gradient boosting regressor (GBR), we proposed an efficient downscaling approach to produce high spatial resolution precipitation. In order to demonstrate efficiency and accuracy of our models over traditional multilinear regression (MLR) downscaling models, we did a downscaling analysis for daily observed precipitation data from 34 monitoring sites in Bangladesh. Validation revealed that R-2 of GBR could reach 0.98, compared with RF (0.94), SVM (0.88), and multilinear regression (MLR) (0.69) models, so the GBR-based downscaling model had the best performance among all four downscaling models. We suggest that the GBR-based downscaling models should be used to replace traditional MLR downscaling models to produce a more accurate map of high-resolution precipitation for flood disaster management, drought forecasting, and long-term planning of land and water resources.

However, little is known about coastal hazards associated with these events. We elucidate high-tide floods (HTFs) and storm surges during ARs on the US West Coast during 1980-2016. HTFs and ARs cooccur more often than expected from chance. Between 10% and 63% of HTFs coincide with ARs on average, depending on location. However, interannual-to-decadal variations in HTFs are due more to tides and mean sea-level changes than storminess variability. Only 2-15% of ARs coincide with HTFs, suggesting that ARs typically must cooccur with high tides or mean sea levels to cause HTFs. Storm surges during ARs reflect local wind, pressure, and precipitation forcing: meridional wind and barometric pressure are primary drivers, but precipitation makes secondary contributions. This study highlights the relevance of ARs to coastal impacts, clarifies the drivers of storm surge during ARs, and identifies future research directions.

We integrate narrative theory, narrative persuasion, and risk theories into a Narrative Risk Communication Framework and then assess the effectiveness of character selection as a narrative mechanism in scientific risk communication as compared to conventional science messaging alone. We utilize a survey experiment with residents along the flood-prone Yellowstone River in Montana and analyze the resulting data with a parallel and serial mediation statistical model. We find that positive affective response mediates the influence of narratives featuring hero character language. Positive affective response appears to overcome the risk perception paradox both by circumventing rational analysis of risk and by shaping risk perception. Overall, the results suggest that inspirational hero language is superior to language of fear or victimization in encouraging preparation - an important lesson for practitioners working to help citizens prepare for environmental disasters.

Landsat images and remote sensing (RS) techniques, Maximum Likelihood Classification approach of Supervised Learning of image processing has been utilized to detect and monitor the glacier cover changes of Bhutan over the years (1978-2017). The study results revealed that total area of the glacier changes in 1978 and 2017 has decreased by 2.54%. Most of the glacier zones are found in the northern part of the country, basically near the Greater Himalayan Mountain Range. Gasa, Bamthung and Lhuentse districts of Bhutan were found to have more glacier changes area than the other districts, that the areas experienced more changes of glacier cover over 40 years. Where more changes in the glacier are detected, the area should be more vulnerable in terms of both landslide, unreliability in growing useful land covers and Glacier Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFS) in downstream area.

A new plumbing system framework for mantle plume-related continental Large Igneous Provinces and their mafic-ultramafic intrusions	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH			English	Article							U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY; LONG-DISTANCE TRANSPORT; GIANT DYKE SWARMS; FLOOD BASALTS; SULFIDE MINERALIZATION; SUPERIOR PROVINCE; MECHANICAL MODELS; MAGMA TRANSPORT; MASS EXTINCTION; CRUSTAL GROWTH	The magmatic components of continental Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) indude flood basalts and their plumbing system of giant mafic dyke swarms (radiating, linear, and the recently discovered circumferential type), mafic sill provinces, a lower crustal magmatic underplate, mafic-ultramafic (M-UM) intrusions, associated silicic magmatism, and associated carbonatites and kimberlites. This paper proposes a new plumbing system framework for mantle plume-related continental LIPs that incorporates all of these components, and provides a context for addressing key thematic aspects such as tracking magma batches "upstream" and "downstream" and their geochemical evolution, assessing the setting of M-UM intrusions and their economic potential, interpreting deep magmatic component identified by geophysical signatures, and estimating magnitudes of extrusive and intrusive components with climate change implications. This plumbing system model, and its associated implications, needs to be tested against the rapidly improving LIP record. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Ernst, R. E.; Liikane, D.

As the intensity and frequency of such events is projected to increase in a warming climate, there is an urgent need to advance the existing knowledge on extreme precipitation processes, statistics and impacts across scales. To this end, a working group within the Germany-based project, ClimXtreme, has been established to carry out multidisciplinary analyses of high-impact events. In this work, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the 29 June 2017 heavy precipitation event (HPE) affecting the Berlin metropolitan region (Germany), from the meteorological, impacts and climate perspectives, including climate change attribution. Our analysis showed that this event occurred under the influence of a mid-tropospheric trough over western Europe and two shortwave surface lows over Britain and Poland (Rasmund and Rasmund II), inducing relevant low-level wind convergence along the German-Polish border. Over 11 000 convective cells were triggered, starting early morning 29 June, displacing northwards slowly under the influence of a weak tropospheric flow (10 m s(-1) at 500 hPa). The quasi-stationary situation led to totals up to 196 mm d(-1), making this event the 29 June most severe in the 1951-2021 climatology, ranked by means of a precipitation-based index. Regarding impacts, it incurred the largest insured losses in the period 2002 to 2017 (EUR 60 million) in the greater Berlin area. We provide further insights on flood attributes (inundation, depth, duration) based on a unique household-level survey data set. The major moisture source for this event was the Alpine-Slovenian region (63 % of identified sources) due to recycling of precipitation falling over that region 1 d earlier. Implementing three different generalised extreme value (GEV) models, we quantified the return periods for this case to be above 100 years for daily aggregated precipitation, and up to 100 and 10 years for 8 and 1 h aggregations, respectively. The conditional attribution demonstrated that warming since the pre-industrial era caused a small but significant increase of 4 % in total precipitation and 10 % for extreme intensities. The possibility that not just greenhouse-gas-induced warming, but also anthropogenic aerosols affected the intensity of precipitation is investigated through aerosol sensitivity experiments. Our multi-disciplinary approach allowed us to relate interconnected aspects of extreme precipitation. For instance, the link between the unique meteorological conditions of this case and its very large return periods, or the extent to which it is attributable to already-observed anthropogenic climate change.

Stomata contribute greatly to plant adaptation to stressful environments by governing transpirational water loss and photosynthetic gas exchange. Increasing evidence has revealed that stomata formation is shaped by transcription factors, signaling peptides, and protein kinases, which could be exploited to improve crop stress resistance. The past decades have seen unprecedented progress in our understanding of stomata formation, but most of these advances have come from research on model plants. This review highlights recent research in stomata formation in crops and its multifaceted functions in abiotic stress tolerance. Current strategies, limitations, and future directions for harnessing stomatal development to improve crop stress resistance are discussed. Plant stomatal development responds to water deficit, salinity, extreme temperatures, soil flooding, and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and has potential for exploitation in crop breeding for abiotic stress resistance.

Development of a new agro-meteorological drought index (SPAEI-Agro) in a data-scarce region	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Article						agro-meteorological drought; climatology; SPEI; SSDI; SWAT; Tunga-Bhadra	UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; RIVER-BASIN; HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHT; MODEL CALIBRATION; WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT; FLOOD FREQUENCY; SWAT; CATCHMENT; CLIMATE	Drought complexity may not be accurately characterized by univariate meteorological or hydrological drought indices under the intensification of hydrological cycle due to climate change and human activities. In particular, such drought indices require long series of hydro-meteorological data, which are unavailable over ungauged and data-scarce catchments. In this study, a multivariate drought index, Standardized Precipitation Actual Evapotranspiration Index-Agro (SPAEI-Agro), is proposed, which combines meteorological and hydrological variables as precipitation (P), actual evapotranspiration (AET), runoff and groundwater (GW) of ungauged catchments and sub-catchment scales with diverse climatology. SPAEI-Agro was able to characterize severe drought events more accurately in humid and dry sub-humid sub-catchments compared to Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Streamflow Drought Index (SSDI) for Tunga-Bhadra River, India. SPEI (based upon potential evapotranspiration) and SSDI (based on streamflow) showed intensified drought characteristics compared to the new P, AET and GW-based drought indicator SPAEI-Agro in semi-arid and dry sub-humid climates.

Global transportation infrastructure exposure to the change of precipitation in a warmer world	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							FUTURE CHANGES; FLOOD RISK; CLIMATE; EXTREMES; DRAINAGE	Transportation infrastructures are generally designed to have multi-decadal service lives. Transport infrastructure design, however, is largely based on historical conditions. Yet, in the face of global warming, we are likely going to experience more intense and frequent extreme events, which may put infrastructure at severe risk. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the exposure of road and railway infrastructure assets to changes in precipitation return periods globally. Under similar to 2 degrees of warming in mid-century (RCP 8.5 scenario), 43.6% of the global transportation assets are expected to experience at least a 25% decrease in design return period of extreme rainfall (a 33% increase in exceedance probability), which may increase to 69.9% under similar to 4 degrees of warming by late-21st century. To accommodate for such increases, we propose to incorporate a safety factor for climate change adaptation during the transportation infrastructure design process to ensure transportation assets will maintain their designed risk level in the future. Our results show that a safety factor of 1.2 would work sufficient for most regions of the world for quick design process calculations following the RCP4.5 path.

J	Pagliari, MS				Pagliari, Maria Sole			LSIs' Exposures to Climate-Change-Related Risks: An Approach to Assess Physical Risks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CENTRAL BANKING			English	Article							PANEL-DATA	This paper proposes an approach to estimate the impact of adverse climatic events on the profitability of small European banks (LSIs). By considering river flooding phenomena, we construct a unique database matching the information on location, frequency, and severity of floods with the location and balance sheet data of institutions mainly operating in the areas where they are headquartered (territorial LSIs). We compare the performance of territorial LSIs across regions at low and high flooding risk and test for the "core lending channel" hypothesis, whereby lending to the real economy is a catalyst of physical risks. Results show that an adverse event dropping loans to households and non-financial corporations by 1 percentage point of total assets entails a decrease in the return on assets (ROA) of territorial LSIs in riskier areas by 0.001 percentage point (3.1 percent). Moreover, if all territorial LSIs were located in riskier areas, the average ROA would drop by between 0.0001 and 0.52 percentage point for half of the banks in the sample, accounting for around 17 percent of the LSI sector's assets.

Spatial planning can reduce climate risk not just by influencing the exposure, but also by addressing social vulnerability. This requires that relevant information is available to planners and that plans are implemented and coordinated between sectors. This article is based on a research project in Thailand, particularly on the results of multi-sectoral workshops in the case study region of the Andaman Coast in southern Thailand, and draws upon climate risk, spatial planning, and systems thinking discourses. The article formulates recommendations for planning in the context of Thailand that are relevant for other rapidly growing and urbanizing regions. Among other conclusions, it suggests that systems thinking approaches and cross-sectoral strategies are ways to grasp the interdependencies between and within climate risk and spatial development challenges.

Building on the theoretical frame of authoritarian environmentalism, it peruses fieldwork material collected during 2009-2019 to determine the most prominent features of recent collaborative governance efforts in the field of water management in Vietnam, a historically seasonal flooding-dependent country. A key feature is technocratisation, where top-down management structures and practices prioritise technocratic solutions to environmental challenges over deliberation, awareness raising, and integration of local knowledge. Another equally important feature is authoritarian intensification, by which increasingly complex environmental management functions, coupled with the state's determination to retain political control, reinforce authoritarian governance. We jointly refer to these features as captured collaboration, signifying a strong authoritarian regime dominance in both vertical and horizontal relations of environmental governance. However, while captured collaboration still appears to be a defining collaborative characteristic, the article acknowledges rising calls for deliberative government in Vietnamese society. This is particularly outspoken in relation to the highly contested issues of hydropower construction and enhanced floods, debates that simultaneously have paved the way for a burgeoning, though much delayed, paradigm shift.

Surface runoff is an essential feature of watershed's hydrological process. The evaluation runoff volume of a watershed can be helpful for analyzing the flood risk and efficient design of hydraulic structures. The present study focus on modeling of rainfall runoff using ArcSWAT model where soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model was incorporate into ArcGIS software for Poondi Micro-Watershed, Thiruvallur, Tamil Nadu. The validation and calibration and of ArcSWAT version was done with SUFI-2 within SWAT-CUP for every month time periodic. And the calibration in the model was carried out during the years 2007 to 2014 and validated for the period of 2015-2018. The Nash-Sutcliffe value (NS) and determination in the co-efficient (R-2) are used to analyze in the correlation between the design model calibration and validation and it shows significant values greater than 0.70 in both the cases. Overall the performance the SWAT model was good and can be used for simulation of runoff.

Several regions of the world with different climatic conditions face the challenge of floods in different magnitudes. Here we estimate flood susceptibility based on Analytical neural network (ANN), Deep learning neural network (DLNN) and Deep boost (DB) algorithm approach. We also attempt to estimate the future rainfall scenario, using the General circulation model (GCM) with its ensemble. The Representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenario is employed for estimating the future rainfall in more an authentic way. The validation of all models was done with considering different indices and the results show that the DB model is most optimal as compared to the other models. According to the DB model, the spatial coverage of very low, low, moderate, high and very high flood prone region is 68.20%, 9.48%, 5.64%, 7.34% and 9.33% respectively. The approach and results in this research would be beneficial to take the decision in managing this natural hazard in a more efficient way.

Substrate temperature as a primary control on meiofaunal populations in the intertidal zone: A dead zone attributed to elevated summer temperatures in eastern Bahrain	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Bahrain; Thermal stress; Meiofauna; Peneroplis; Climate change	FORAMINIFERA	Summer temperatures in excess of 52 degrees C, have been measured at the high tide mark in surficial substrates in the exposed areas of an intertidal mudflat in Bahrain. The incoming flood tide may have a temperature as high as 42 degrees C. As a result, large swaths of the upper intertidal zone are barren of living meiofauna (e.g., foraminifera, ostracods, gastropods, and worms) during the hottest months of the year. Samples collected from the intertidal zone in August present only dead assemblages of foraminifera, ostracods, and gastropod shells. Dead assemblages of the foraminifer Peneroplis collected from the upper reaches of the intertidal zone consist largely of juvenile specimens, implying that the living populations, when present, do not reach maturity. The full range of living meiofaunal organisms is only observed in tidal channels that remain submerged during low tide. The presence of a summer dead zone for intertidal meiofaunal organisms is consistent with predictions of climate models that suggest portions of the Arabian Gulf may become too extreme to support eukaryotic life.

These exposures to flood variability show persistent increases in FARs, but to flood magnitude only in East and South Asia. Globally, the increases in these exposures are not projected in moderate but extreme floods. Specifically, the areal exposure would be decreased (increased) by 1.8%/degrees C (1.9%/degrees C) for moderate (extreme) floods; the reduced population exposure to extreme floods can be three times higher than that to moderate floods when limiting 2 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C warming. Rapid regional economic growth of East and South Asia (whose GDP accounts for 9.8% of FARs in year 2000 to 18.5% in year 2025) would shift global GDP exposure from a decrease of 2.5%/degrees C to an increase of 1.7%/degrees C.

While all countries in this region invest substantial resources into urban flood risk management, all property owners have unequal opportunity to have their flood risk managed. This paper presents the notion of equity in the urban flood risk management, focusing on urban flood exposure and compensation after sewage surcharge on the 31 August 2014 cloudburst over Malmo in Sweden. All damage claims and the procedures assessing them were analysed based on the type of sewer system (combined or separated) that affected the properties. The results demonstrated considerable systemic inequity in both flood exposure and damage compensation. The owners of properties connected to combined systems were four times more likely to make a damage claim, while having their damage claims approved just over half as often, compared with owners of properties connected to separated sewage systems. Considering the multifaceted nature of both inequities and their possible resolution, current praxis is not sufficient for the management of future urban drainage systems; not only concerning changing climatic conditions but also concerning social conditions.

However, little is known so far about the bias induced in such cases by the model geometric distortion. Here, we use 2-D computational modeling to provide a first systematic quantification of this bias in the case of a synthetic urban layout. The bias is found to be generally small, with the maximum deviations of the upscaled flow depth and discharge partition from the corresponding values of the undistorted model being around 10% in the case of relatively rapid and shallow flow conditions. When the geometric distortion is increased, the computations reveal a nonmonotonous pattern of the flow variables (depth, discharge partition, and size of flow separation zones), which results from a competition between declining frictional losses and growing local losses in the model. These findings may guide the design of distorted scale models of urban flooding and assist the interpretation of laboratory observations for assessing flood protection measures, for process understanding or for validating computational modeling.

A recent flood management review has indicated the need for better flood education for the communities residing in the floodplains of the catchment. This research article describes the perceptions of residents to flood risks to their property and factors that can influence this perception. The data was collected through on-line, face-to-face and postal surveys, and the results were derived from the 172 responses received. This article aims to provide a better understanding of the perceptions of the community residing in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment, and to help develop more effective risk communication strategies, to enable better management of floods, and greater level of support from the communities on flood management. Findings of this research show that the communities have a low perception of flood risks in the region and that factors such as proximity to the rivers, gender, age and duration of living in the area can influence perceptions of flood risks to property.

The performance of four bias correction methods was compared, and the most suitable method was used for downscaling of GCM simulated daily rainfall to the spatial resolution (0.25 degrees) of APHRODITE rainfall. The multi-model ensemble (MME) mean of the downscaled rainfall was developed using a random forest regression algorithm. The MME projected rainfall for four RCPs were compared with APHRODITE rainfall for the base year (1961-2005) to assess the annual and seasonal changes in eight extreme rainfall indices. The results showed power transformation as the most suitable bias correction method. The maximum changes in most of the annual and seasonal extreme rainfall indices were observed for RCP8.5 in the last part of this century. The maximum increase was observed for 1-day and 5 consecutive days' rainfall amount for RCP4.5. Spatial distribution of the changes revealed higher increase of the extremes in the northeast region where rainfall extremes are already very high. The increase in rainfall extremes would increase the possibility of frequent hydrological disasters in Peninsular Malaysia.

Culverts are sized for a road to accommodate the volume of water crossing the road network to avoid flooding. Ghana Highways has a standard manual for culvert sizing at channel crossing. This manual serves as a guide for the proper sizing of culverts, however, lots of culverts have been found to have failed. Among the reasons for the failure of culverts could be under-sizing, urbanization, climate change, lack of maintenance, etc. The Daboya-Mankarigu Road is situated in the Savanah Region of Ghana in the North Gonja District. The section of the road from Chainage 9 + 075 to 10 + 200 has been experiencing flooding from 2020 to 2021 with a flood depth of 3.315 m in 2020 and 2.00 m in 2021. This study seeks to use integrated GIS and hydrological-based methods to propose new culverts to supplement the existing culverts to control flooding at section (9 + 075 to 10 + 200) of Daboya-Mankarigu Road (IR10). Geographic Information system (GIS) model (SWAT), Hydrological and hydraulic models were used to determine the peak flow at the catchment to Propose new culverts to supplement the existing culverts. Using a design period of 25 years for culverts, the modified rational method was used to determine the Peak flow of the catchment. A 25-year peak flow of 367.155 m3/s was determined and used for hydraulic analysis of the existing culverts. From the study, the existing culvert structures at the section had a hydraulic capacity of 78.732 m3/s which could not accommodate the remaining flow of 288.423 m3/s in the catchment. An observation was made that the changes in the rainfall can cause a change in rainfall intensity. An increase in built-up areas in the catchment can also increase the runoff coefficient which can result in higher peak flow in the catchment. Climate change, change in slope, and Land use in the catchment were also determined to have a huge influence on the adequacy of culverts since the peak flow is dependent on these parameters in the catchment as the years go by. A 4No. 4 m x 4 m box culvert, 3No. 3.5 m x 3.5 m box culvert, and 13 No. 1200 mm pipe culverts with 2 each at different chainages were proposed at suitable locations to supplement the existing culverts using the HDS-5 equations in AutoCAD Civil 3D. A recommendation is made to consider the installation of these new culverts at the flood section to control flooding and avoid overtopping of water on the IR10 road section (Daboya-Mankarigu) in the north Gonja District.

Quantifying flood vulnerability is useful for identifying the system's weakness, monitoring its evolution, and supporting targeted flood risk adaptation policies. One of the vital aims of assessing urban flood vulnerability is to create an understandable link between flood vulnerability conceptual theories and the daily decision-making process through an easily accessible tool. Although several studies have described the development of an integrated flood vulnerability index (FVI) combining physical, social, and economic dimensions in urban areas, this index has not been assessed in developing countries. Therefore, this study focuses on an integrated indicator-based approach to develop an urban FVI based on exposure, susceptibility, and resilience to urban flooding at the neighbourhood scale. To evaluate the flood vulnerability of the population, we used the Improvement of Vulnerability Assessment in Europe (MOVE) framework. Accordingly, the vulnerability indices cover exposure, susceptibility and resilience aspects. The index is applied to Alexandria, one of the most important coastal cities of Egypt, which is highly vulnerable due to its dense population, low adaptive capacity, flat topography, and exposure to various water-related disasters, such as cyclones, storm surges, bank erosion, sea-level rise, tidal floods, and frequent urban floods. In this study, we use inductive principal component analysis (PCA) to develop a composite indicator for the FVI and to evaluate the vulnerability of 101 census administrative units (sheyakhahs) in Alexandria. We apply the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test and Bartlett's test of sphericity to assess sample adequacy and perform data standardization for all indicators. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted for simplicity and comparison with the PCA results to assess their robustness. We clustered 58 and 13 flood vulnerability-related indicators into three major dimensions, i.e., physical, social, and economic, through PCA and the AHP, respectively. Official collected data are analysed using combined methods using advanced statistical analysis (SPSS) software and a geographic information system (GIS). The findings highlight the variability in flood vulnerability across highly urbanized and suburban areas. Based on the PCA, 38 indicators were defined as the most comprehensive flood vulnerability assessment (FVA) used in Egyptian cities. Additionally, due to reliability of the approach to indicator selection and the weighting process, the chosen 13 indicators for the AHP analysis yielded similar results. This research provides spatial planners and decision-makers with an integrated, comprehensive, and unified urban FVI to assess vulnerability and, thus, improve flood resilience in Egypt and countries in similar situations.

Exploring the linkage between dew point temperature and precipitation extremes: A multi-time-scale analysis on a semi-arid Mediterranean region	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Extreme precipitation; Dew point temperature; Scaling; Quantile regression; Clausius-Clapeyron; Semi-arid region	RAINFALL EXTREMES; CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION; FUTURE CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INCREASE; INTENSIFICATION; REGRESSION; CYCLE; AIR	Understanding warming climate implications on precipitation is of crucial importance, especially for areas particularly subjected to climate changes and land use/cover modifications, which could be extremely vulnerable to phenomena typically caused by rainfall extremes, such as floods and landslides. Past decade has been witnessing an increasing interest on simple modeling approaches based on the observation of commonly available meteorological variables and their physical linkages. In particular, based on the well-known thermodynamic Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) equation, it was widely investigated the scaling relation between rainfall extremes and variables representative of the near surface humidity, typically the surface air temperature, through the use of general regression models. In some cases, conventional approaches have shown some evident limitations related to the use of surface temperature as covariate, limited size of the analyzed datasets and some climatic peculiarities of the investigated areas, especially for tropical, arid and semi-arid environments. The use of quantile regression instead of general regression and dew point temperature instead of surface temperatures have recently revealed promising potentialities for overcoming some of the above limitations for wet areas, while it has been scarcely tested in arid and semi-arid regions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the suitability of a quantile regression-based approach in a semi-arid Mediterranean region and to explore the impact of different modeling choices on the estimation of the scaling rate. More specifically, the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to dew point temperature is investigated through a multi-time-scale analysis, performed on a wide regional dataset of Sicily (Italy) including high temporal resolution climatic data from 86 gauges. The role of the considered rainfall accumulation period, conditional quantile and time-lag between precipitation-dew point temperature paired data is investigated considering different spatial and temporal data aggregation. The results reveal scaling rate values always below the theoretical CC-rate. Hourly and sub-hourly rainfall extremes are more sensitive to changes in dew point temperature than longer precipitation. The analysis of the driest and hottest season shows a dew point temperature dependence of extreme rainfall more complex than for the other seasons. Compared to the use of general regression, the scaling relationship observed with the quantile regression approach, here used, is more regular across different gauges and sub-regions, rainfall accumulation periods and seasons, with similar scaling rates, confirming promising potentialities areas also for semi-arid regions.

Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.

Human-water interactions have shown unprecedented scale and intensity. Traditional hydrological methods have difficulty systematically analyzing the process of water utilization, transformation, transportation and redistribution in the production and consumption of products. This paper reviews the literature surrounding sociohydrology to illustrate its useful exploration in the study of human-water coupling. The paper begins by presenting background information before conducting a bibliometric analysis of the development trends. Four perspectives of sociohydrology revealing the interaction between humans and water are introduced: the evolution of basin-scale water allocation patterns; human activities and hydrological disasters under climate change; virtual water-a useful tool for analyzing water utilization and transformation in the production and consumption of products; and public participation and water management policies. Subsequently, major methods and their potential applications are covered: sociohydrological modeling, field surveys and statistical models. A literature review suggests that the focus of research on human-water coupling lies in the selection and modeling of elements. The macro-element describing system changes should be extended at the political and cultural levels. Research on structural and institutional indicators on a long historical scale should be deepened and expanded. Interdisciplinary research still needs further development.

Focusing on the Dutch and British colonial periods of governance, it shows the ways in which these colonial periods have shaped the physical and social structures of the city, and influenced many of its present-day processes and institutions, some of which are incapable of reducing the city's vulnerability to climate risks and impacts, including sea-level rise, coastal inundation, and flooding. It finds that the maintenance of critical infrastructure for building adaptive capacity such as the colonial era seawall and drainage system has been inconsistent, largely due to financial constraints. And although various international organizations have financed other large-scale hard infrastructure projects for sea and river defenses, community-based drainage projects have proven to be more successful in mitigating flood risks, illustrating the effectiveness of contemporary grassroots interventions. Beyond these, this article highlights the need for more long-term resilience and transformational measures, particularly relating to knowledge-and meaning-making, and to financing and strengthening local institutions, in order to improve the city's adaptive capacity both now and in the future.

The aim of the research is to assess the connection between rainfall and river flood risk. The proposed methodology is presented on the example of the upper Nysa Klodzka River (NKR) catchment and Klodzko town located on NKR, which are two of the most flood-prone areas in the Odra River basin. The methodology is based on the well-established methods of potential flood losses (PFL) estimation and the copula-based model, allowing an assessment of connections between rainfall and flood losses in a probabilistic way. The results are presented using the 'synchronicity' measure. Seventeen significant summer (rainfall-driven) flood waves were selected, for which PFL were estimated and cumulative rainfall was calculated for 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h preceding the flood peak. It was found that the synchronicity of PFL and the 24 h rainfall was the lowest among the analyzed variants, while for the 48 to 120 h rainfall the highest synchronicity was identified at precipitation gauge Podzamek.

However, the relationship between the CPE and turbidite deposition remains poorly known. Here we investigate a giant lacustrine turbidite system of the Triassic Ordos Basin in North China Plate, to determine how the CPE influenced turbidite deposition, by integrating geochronology, organic carbon isotope, major and trace elements, clay minerals and turbidite sedimentology. Results show that the lacustrine turbidite deposition in the Ordos Basin was strongly associated with the CPE. Although there is a temporal lag, the intensified turbidite deposition is considered as a response to the three humid periods during the CPE. Compared with marine environments, continental depositional settings tend to be more sensitive to the humid climate changes, and can record more detailed and long-term carbon fluctuations. This study highlights the potential for turbidite deposition affected by extremely humid events, and provides new insights into the prediction of deep-water turbidite systems. Furthermore, it enriches the theory of the CPE in terrestrial environments.

While observations have recently confirmed the presence of flood anomalies in Europe, their exact causes are not clear. Here we analyse streamflow and climate observations during 1960-2010 to show that shifts in flood generation processes contribute more to the occurrence of regional flood anomalies than changes in extreme rainfall. A shift from rain on dry soil to rain on wet soil events by 5% increased the frequency of flood-rich periods in the Atlantic region, and an opposite shift in the Mediterranean region increased the frequency of flood-poor periods, but will likely make singular extreme floods occur more often. Flood anomalies driven by changing flood generation processes in Europe may further intensify in a warming climate and should be considered in flood estimation and management. Changes in the processes that can generate floods, such as rain falling on wet rather than dry soil, affect the occurrence of regional floods more than changes in extreme rainfall, according to an analysis of flood anomalies observed in Europe combined with a flood process typology.

Recent studies have revealed the need for the multidimensional assessment of flood disasters in this area. Consequently, this present study was conducted to provide comprehensive information on the flood vulnerability of 26 watersheds in Ardabil province. Here, six components, including meteorological, hydrological, physical-environmental, social, economic, and countermeasures, were computed at a watershed scale based on 19 different criteria. Finally, the flood vulnerability index (FVI) for each watershed was calculated. The results revealed the need for different management approaches for flood hotspots based on the vulnerability to the six components studied. The integrated FVI showed that 46.97%, 33.63%, 18.10%, 1.20%, and 0.10% of the province have very high, high, medium, low, and very low flood vulnerability, respectively. The spatial mapping also revealed that all study areas were under flood stress, except small parts in central, east, and north. The preliminary version of the flood vulnerability atlas is presented, which estimates the flood disaster risk throughout the province. In addition, the developed regional framework in this study also allows for more comprehensive and extensive dataset analysis.

J	Cohen, AN; Fischhendler, I				Cohen, Avigail Newman; Fischhendler, Itay			An archetype for insurance thresholds for extreme natural events in the agricultural sector	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Crop insurance; Disaster definition; Insurance mechanism; Insurance thresholds; Natural hazards insurance	FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; FLOOD INSURANCE; DISASTER RISK; AQUACULTURE INSURANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROGRAM; FARMERS; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE	The use of insurance against disasters triggered by natural hazards has become a common mechanism in the agricultural sector. Typical insurance policies, including those in the agricul-tural sector, specify an event or threshold beyond which insured payments are triggered. How-ever, there is an absence of studies situating agricultural insurance against natural disasters in the wider insurance framework or depicting the range and evolution of thresholds for extreme events in the agricultural sector. As a result, there is no conceptual framework for understanding how a threshold is selected in real life situations. This study comes to address this gap by developing an archetype for threshold selection under conditions of climate mitigation and adaptation uncer-tainty. To this end, the study first unpacks the concept of insurance thresholds and identifies its evolution over time as well as its main building blocks: insurance realm, primary thresholds, and risk indicators. It then assembles these building blocks into three generic trajectories (climate exposure, location exposure, and sensitivity), each driven by different external and internal variables. Finally, it lays the foundation for treating the topic of insurance threshold as a research agenda.

In the first step, the contents of the grim disaster situation and the information framework of ecohydrology with disasters were evaluated. Nest, the creation of ecohydrology and its work with related disasters were summarized. Three disasters including flood, drought, and geohazard were evaluated and three examples (Dujiangyan Irrigation Project, Karez, and Ecological slope) have been separately discussed for considering the concept of the problem. Depending on the characteristics and potential for an effect in different disasters, there needed to be some challenges and opportunities for ecohydrology facing related disasters in various fields, such as National Space Planning, Sponge City and the 'One Belt And One Road' Initiative. Finally, some valuable conclusions were drawn on the application of ecohydrology to disaster prevention and mitigation. Furthermore, the key systemic settings between water management, hydrology, and ecology were described which is of the main importance for social disaster reduction, emergency management, and protection accident prevention.

The presence of Superfund sites as a determinant of life expectancy in the United States	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; CONTAMINATION; POPULATIONS; REGRESSION; PROXIMITY; EXPOSURES; CHEMISTRY; SMOKING	Superfund sites could affect life expectancy (LE) via increasing the likelihood of exposure to toxic chemicals. Here, we assess to what extent such presence could alter the LE independently and in the context of sociodemographic determinants. A nationwide geocoded statistical modeling at the census tract level was undertaken to estimate the magnitude of impact. Results showed a significant difference in LE among census tracts with at least one Superfund site and their neighboring tracts with no sites. The presence of a Superfund site could cause a decrease of -0.1860.027 years in LE. This adverse effect could be as high as -1.22 years in tracts with Superfund sites and high sociodemographic disadvantage. Specific characteristics of Superfund sites such as being prone to flooding and the absence of a cleanup strategy could amplify the adverse effect. Furthermore, the presence of Superfund sites amplifies the negative influence of sociodemographic factors at lower LEs. Superfund sites have hazardous wastes that could affect the health of those who live near them, but this has not been assessed across the USA. Here the authors find that proximity to superfund sites decreases life expectancy and is further exacerbated by sociodemographic and climate change factors.

This increase in intensity coupled with the increase in population density, particularly along the coasts, is only magnifying the impact of such events. In order to quantify and mitigate the risk due to the hazards and to prepare for the potential impacts in a region, it is necessary to collect the information of existing buildings that are pertinent to natural hazard analysis and risk management. Gathering the building information in a regionor city-scale is a laborious and expensive undertaking. This paper presents a framework for regional scale building information generation/gathering to support regional hazard analysis. In this framework, different types of data are acquired from multiple sources (satellite and street view images, property tax assessment data, etc.) and are fused to semantically profile each building in a city. Specifically, deep learning technique is employed to extract building information from street or satellite images. A novel data mining tool is developed to overcome the data scarcity issue, quantify the uncertainty and enrich the data repository. With this framework, building inventories of cities are created to provide the data needed for disaster and risk management planning and simulations.

Based on the above security indexes, a novel water security comprehensive evaluation model is established by combining the coupling coordination degree model and the state space model. The proposed model has the advantage of simple operation and fast data speed, which is convenient for water security evaluation in different periods and regions. Taking China as an example, the water security conditions were evaluated from 2007 to 2016 for 31 provincial-level administrative regions in China, including flood control security index, resource security index, ecological security index and water security level of each region, and the specific problems of water security in each region were obtained. The evaluation results are consistent with the actual situation in each region, which provides the scientific basis for the local government authorities to formulate the corresponding regional water security policy.

Recent observations in the desert environment of Kuwait witnessed an increase in rainfall extremes, and the currently adopted intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves constructed three decades ago did not produce reliable design frequencies for existing stormwater drainage systems in residential areas. In this study, the IDF curves for the urban zone of the State of Kuwait were updated with recent records of annual maximum rainfall intensity from January 2006 to December 2017, and the Extreme Value type-I probability distribution was implemented to perform frequency analysis and estimate the design storm. The study concluded that frequent updating of IDF curves is necessary for the examined rainfall data to account for harmonic climatic variations in compliance with sunspot cycles. The updated IDF curves confirmed the pronounced increase in rainfall intensities within short durations of 5-15 min, thereby affecting water-related infrastructure in small urban catchments. Here we call for urgent action to be taken to adopt flood mitigation plans in residential areas to avoid the catastrophic impacts of extreme flash floods.

Water managers and urban planners try to cope with flood risk by enhancing urban flood resilience. Three main discourses of resilience are engineering, ecological, and socio-ecological resilience. Whereas the discourse of engineering resilience emphasizes the use of flood protection infrastructures, the discourses of ecological and socio-ecological resilience advocate river restoration and spatial strategies to reduce flood risk. In this paper, we investigate which resilience discourse is dominant in the Lambro river basin (Metropolitan City of Milan), and how this discourse has been translated into institutions (rules-in-use) and outcomes, such as flood protection infrastructures or building regulations. Our discursive-institutional analysis is informed by the (politicized) Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which highlights the role of discursive, institutional, and contextual factors in explaining the outcomes of strategic interactions within action arenas. It is shown that whereas bottom-up initiatives try to foster socio-ecological resilience, the engineering resilience discourse still dominates within the Lambro river basin because national policies and funds are geared towards hard infrastructure measures.

J	Valizadeh, N; Shamseldin, AY; Wotherspoon, L				Valizadeh, Nariman; Shamseldin, Asaad Y.; Wotherspoon, Liam			Quantification of the hydraulic dimension of stormwater management system resilience to flooding	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stormwater Management System; Resilience; Hydraulic Dimension; Flood Control; Hydraulic Performance; Stormwater Piped Network		Climate change, increasing urbanisation and a growing concern over existing stormwater management systems (SWMSs) has resulted in the development of various approaches to improve urban resilience to flooding and the performance of SWMSs. However, previous studies have focused on urban resilience and the hydraulic reliability of urban drainage systems, without considering all dimensions of a SWMS as the main urban flood control infrastructure. This paper presents an approach to quantify the resilience of the hydraulic dimension of primary SWMSs to flooding. Resilience was quantified based on the Hydraulic Performance Capacity (HPC), a new metric developed to represent the functionality of a SWMS over time using the temporal hydraulic characteristics across a catchment. The effect of network properties, catchment characteristics, and design storm events can be assessed through this approach based on the outputs of standard One Dimensional (1D) hydraulic modelling. The approach was applied to a case study urban catchment and was able to demonstrate the effect of different storm events and pipe material properties on resilience, robustness, and recovery. This framework can be used by decision makers to benchmark SWMS network resilience, optimise network capacity for design, and assess methods for reducing flood hazard in urban catchments.

The presence of a pressure flow is generally associated with scouring processes in proximity to the bridge. Scouring can also occur around bridge piers, possibly causing infrastructure failure. Although there is a vast literature on bridge pier scour and pressure flow scour, only a few studies have investigated their combined effect. This study will provide a new overview of the main features of bridge pier scour under pressurized flow conditions, based on laboratory experiences. Special focus is placed on the analysis of the flow features under pressure and free surface conditions and to the temporal evolution of the scour. A comparison with existing literature data is also conducted. The results highlight the nonlinear nature of scour processes and the need to consider pressurized flow conditions during structural design, as the interaction between pressure flow and the bridge pier strongly influences scour features and leads to scour depths much greater than the sum of the individual scours created only by pressure flow or pier presence.

Natural disasters and economic losses: controlling external migration, energy and environmental resources, water demand, and financial development for global prosperity	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Natural disasters; Economic losses; Health expenditures; Energy demand; Environmental resources; Poverty; Migration; Asian countries	EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH; POVERTY; INCOME; IMPACT; INEQUALITY; GROWTH; RISK; EXPENDITURES	The objective of the study is to examine the impact of natural disasters on external migration, price level, poverty incidence, health expenditures, energy and environmental resources, water demand, financial development, and economic growth in a panel of selected Asian countries for a period of 2005-2017. The results confirm that natural disasters in the form of storm and flood largely increase migration, price level, and poverty incidence, which negatively influenced country's economic resources, including enlarge healthcare expenditures, high energy demand, and low economic growth. The study further presented the following results: i) natural resource depletion increases external migration, ii) FDI inflows increase price level, iii) increase healthcare spending and energy demand decreases poverty headcount, iv) poverty incidence and mortality rate negatively influenced healthcare expenditures, v) industrialization increases energy demand, and vi) agriculture value added, fertilizer, and cereal yields required more water supply to produce greater yield. The study emphasized the need to magnify the intensity of natural disasters and create natural disaster mitigation unit to access the human and infrastructure cost and attempt quick recovery for global prosperity.

There is an urgent need to understand (a) how climate shocks manifest in food systems, and (b) what strategies can enhance food system resilience. Integrating satellite, household and trade data, we investigate the cascading impacts after two consecutive hurricanes on smallholder banana farmers in Dominican Republic, and determinants of their recovery. We found that farmers experienced an 'all-or-nothing' pattern of damage, where 75% of flooded farmers lost > 90% of production. Recovery of regional production indicators took ca. 450 days. However, farm-level recovery times were highly variable, with both topographic and human capital factors determining recovery. Utilising this case study, we show that engaging in a GFVC impeded recovery via 'double exposure' of production loss and losing market access. Our results suggest that strategies to enhance resilience, with a particular focus on recovery, in GFVCs should promote trader loyalty, facilitate basin-scale collaboration and expand risk-targeted training.

Coupled human-natural system impacts of a winter weather whiplash event	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY			English	Article						climate change; compound extremes; coupled natural and human systems; vulnerability; winter weather whiplash	POPULATION-DENSITY; DATABASE; FLOOD; DROUGHTS; RISK	. In October 2011, the Halloween Nor'easter produced unusually early and heavy snowfall while leaves were still on the trees, causing extensive damage throughout the northeastern United States. This storm is an example of winter weather whiplash, in which an abrupt, back-and-forth swing in winter weather affects coupled human and natural systems. Research on the social-ecological drivers and impacts of winter weather whiplash is scarce because most studies only consider meteorological causes and consequences of extreme events. In this study, we used publicly available data of snowfall accumulation, vegetation phenology, road density, and per capita income to predict storm impacts, which we estimated with textual analysis of Halloween Nor'easter newspaper coverage. We demonstrated that a combination of meteorological, natural, and human system drivers was better able to predict the impact of the storm than meteorological drivers alone. Although we focused on the Halloween Nor'easter, our work highlights the necessity of understanding how multiple drivers and hazards can intersect to create rare and possibly novel conditions that may become more common as the climate warms and becomes more variable.

Late Quaternary hydroclimate and vegetation changes in an upland lake in southeastern Amazonia	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS			English	Article						Amazonia; Holocene; paleopalynology; paleovegetation; paleoclimate	MODERN POLLEN-RAIN; HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; SEDIMENTARY ORGANIC-MATTER; SERRA DOS CARAJAS; LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS; LATE PLEISTOCENE; TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION; CLIMATE CHANGES; BRAZIL; FOREST	An integrated approach considering facies, isotopic, and palynological analyses of lake sediments from the Serra Norte de Carajas, southeastern Amazonia, is presented in this work to refine paleoclimate and paleohydrological changes based on upland lake sediments during the late Quaternary. The sediments have a fining-upward deposition cycle typical of upland swamps/lakes. The origin of organic matter is autochthonous mainly related to C3 terrestrial plants, macrophytes and algae. The pollen records of Hedyosmum during the Early Pleistocene suggest lower temperatures than those observed along Holocene. In the transitional period between the Pleistocene and the Holocene, rainfall decreased, causing the retraction of the flooded area, favoring the development of marshy conditions. The Late and Middle Holocene were marked by higher temperatures and lower humidity. Afterward, the increased pollen concentration from canga and forest vegetation, macrophytes, palms, and algae suggested increased humidity in the Early Holocene. The relative contribution of forest pollen along the records indicated that drier conditions were not strong enough for an extensive expansion of canga over forested areas.

Similarly, there is increasing consideration of cumulative vulnerability to multiple stressors, yet empirical studies are scant. This study seeks to assess the geophysical and socioeconomic determinants of households' vulnerability to the cumulative impacts of three coastal hazards - flooding, erosion and salinity - using evidence from the Volta Delta in Ghana. The study employed multiple linear regression and bi-nary logistic regression functions to assess cumulative vulnerability and exposure to individual hazards, respectively. Results indicate that while exposure to hazards is determined largely by geophysical factors, the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households determine the extent of vulnerability to their impacts. In addition, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households, particularly higher wealth levels, non-agricultural occupation, and improved drinking water source, are associated with lower levels of vulnerability to the cumulative impacts of coastal hazards. In developing contexts, resilience to coastal hazards requires improved access to social amenities as well as alternative livelihood options.	[Atiglo, D.

In urban areas at high risk for flooding and lacking proper land-use controls, communities are vulnerable to environmental contamination from industrial land uses during flood events. This research uniquely applied a series of landscape pzerformance models to evaluate such associations including (1) the Green Values National Stormwater Calculator, (2) the Value of Green Infrastructure Tool, and (3) the Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment Model. This paper presents a framework for combining landscape performance models, which are often only individually applied, to evaluate green infrastructure impacts on flood mitigation and pollutant transfer during flooding events using the Sunnyside neighborhood in Houston, Texas, USA, as a case site. The results showed that the plan reduced the risk of flooding, decreased stormwater runoff contaminants, and provided a possible direction to protect vulnerable communities.

The Boltysh impact structure: An early Danian impact event during recovery from the K-Pg mass extinction	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							CRETACEOUS-PALEOGENE BOUNDARY; CANYON SANIDINE STANDARD; K-40 DECAY CONSTANTS; JOINT DETERMINATION; HYPERTHERMAL EVENT; IMPROVED ACCURACY; PLANT ECOSYSTEMS; DECCAN VOLCANISM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-LEVEL	Both the Chicxulub and Boltysh impact events are associated with the K-Pg boundary. While Chicxulub is firmly linked to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, the temporal relationship of the similar to 24-km-diameter Boltysh impact to these events is uncertain, although it is thought to have occurred 2 to 5 ka before the mass extinction. Here, we conduct the first direct geochronological comparison of Boltysh to the K-Pg boundary. Our 40Ar/39Ar age of 65.39 +/- 0.14/0.16 Ma shows that the impact occurred similar to 0.65 Ma after the mass extinction. At that time, the climate was recovering from the effects of the Chicxulub impact and Deccan trap flood volcanism. This age shows that Boltysh has a close temporal association with the Lower C29n hyperthermal recorded by global sediment archives and in the Boltysh crater lake sediments. The temporal coincidence raises the possibility that even a small impact event could disrupt recovery of the Earth system from catastrophic events.

Dhaka, the capital and a megacity at the forefront of rapid, unplanned urbanization, has been experiencing consistent challenges and threats of flood since 1954. Since then, to ensure flood protection and control, the city authorities have adapted diverse flood risk management strategies (FRMS). Regardless of the overall progress in flood risk management policies in the national development agenda, the inertness of their implementation means the city remains vulnerable. Along with that, several divergences from the development plans, for instance, the new town development in flood flow zone, the declaration to convert a residential zone into a retention area, illegal acquisition of wetlands for property development have also been observed. Therefore, the objective is to review the diversification of FRMS at the national level and to identify the convergence or divergence on the development plans at the sub-national level, in this case, Dhaka Metropolitan Area. This study provides a commentary to support policy-makers and researchers in integrating FRMS with the development plans at the local level.	[Fatemi, Md.

The results indicated that the inner-annual distributions of rainfall and runoff were uneven and slightly different, as the concentration period of rainfall (from April to October) was earlier; there was a delay of about a month before the runoff (from May to September), and the concentrated volume accounted for 87% of annual precipitation or annual streamflow. Interannually, rainfall changed more significantly than runoff, the wet years lasted longer than the dry years (rainfall), while the high and low flow years were equal for runoff. In addition, judging from the value of the Mann-Kendall test, the average annual change of rainfall (-2.36) was more significant than that of runoff (-2.05), and the seasonal pattern of runoff maintained an opposite tendency in autumn and winter before 1990. The changes in runoff were mainly associated with rainfall and the formation conditions in the karstic area, and the reservoir in this basin should be operated with different flood limiting water levels, and the vegetation coverage should be improved.

However, to date, no studies have disentangled the contribution of annual thermal variability from the contributions of annual thermal mean and other environmental variables to spatiotemporal patterns of macroinvertebrate assemblages in mountain streams. In this study, we explored patterns of macroinvertebrate biodiversity within and among 5 mountain stream sites in the Serio watershed (Orobic Alps, Northern Italy) along a gradient of annual water thermal variability (annual range: similar to 1-16 degrees C) but with similar means. At each site, macroinvertebrates were sampled; physicochemical variables, flood disturbance, and resource availability were measured monthly over a year; and water temperature was monitored continuously. The relationship between macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental conditions was described by separating time and space through co-inertia analyses. Results showed a strong temporal co-inertia, with floods and mean monthly temperature most associated with within-site macroinvertebrate temporal patterns (70% of total variance) and with the greatest effects on the abundance of stoneflies. Synchronous floods occurred in all sites and promoted changes in macroinvertebrate community composition through a loss of taxa and individuals, whereas monthly water temperature variations were associated with the replacement of individuals among taxa. Spatial differences (30% of the total variance) were mainly linked to geographical proximity, although annual thermal variability covaried with annual temporal dissimilarity in taxonomic composition, suggesting that temporal patterns also explain spatial differences. Overall, the study indicates that even when accounting for the overall environmental setting, the thermal regime remains an important driver of macroinvertebrate spatiotemporal patterns. Mountain streams are particularly subject to thermal variation, and an increase in mean water temperature and thermal variability will substantially influence community composition, with the strongest effects on cold stenothermal taxa. Large-scale research across mountain ranges is essential to properly assess how spatiotemporal thermal heterogeneity influences the distribution of macroinvertebrates, as well as to guide conservation strategies in the context of increasing global warming.

Groundwater dominates terrestrial hydrological processes in the Amazon at the basin and subbasin scales	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Amazon basin; Dominant hydrological processes; Groundwater; Process -based modeling; Forest management	LAND-USE CHANGE; DRY-SEASON; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; WATER AVAILABILITY; TIPPING ELEMENTS; TROPICAL FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEFORESTATION; STORAGE; CYCLE	The hydrology of the Amazon River basin (ARB) has been extensively studied; however, critical scientific gaps remain regarding key processes that govern hydrologic dynamics and the resilience of the rainforest. This inhibits the understanding of hydrological considerations needed for sustainable forest management under climate change and growing human stressors. Here, using high resolution (similar to 2km), long-term simulations from a process-based hydrological model (LEAF-Hydro-Flood), we investigate the dominant hydrological processes across the ARB, their key roles in shaping basin functions, and the decadal evolution therein. Results indicate that shallow groundwater (<5m deep) strongly modulates the seasonality of the surface fluxes across the ARB and at least 34% of the Amazonian Forest is supported by groundwater during the dry season. A two-month lag between the seasonal peak of evapotranspiration (ET) and river discharge is a key mechanism that potentially prevents the rainforest from tipping into savanna. The dry season in the ARB is getting drier and the wet season is getting wetter, pointing to an accelerating hydrologic cycle. The ARB is dominantly energy limited, however, our results imply that in the absence of groundwater support, and with less than similar to 125 mm/month of precipitation, the basin could have become water-limited over some regions. The long-term basin-averaged ET-dominated by transpiration-changed with a split pattern of +/- 9% in the past three decades. Similarly, water table depth (+/- 19%) and runoff (+/- 29%) changed with heterogenous patterns across the ARB. Further, the contribution of canopy interception loss and ground evaporation changed heterogeneously across the ARB in response to deforestation. River discharge did not change substantially due to the crucial buffering role of groundwater, but terrestrial water storage (TWS) decreased (increased) in the 2000s (2010s) compared to that in the 1990s. Although groundwater is the dominant contributor to total TWS, the dynamics of TWS over the major river channels are controlled by flood water, given relatively shallow groundwater. This study provides crucial insights on the dominant hydrological processes in the ARB to inform forest management practices.

Currently, there is limited information on the effects of changes in precipitation extremes on river sediment load over a long time period at the basin scale. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of variations in precipitation extremes on sediment load in the Second Songhua River Basin (SSRB), northeast China.Materials and methodsDaily precipitation data from 10 meteorological stations within the SSRB and sediment load data during 1960-2014 from the basin outlet hydrological station were collected. Six extreme precipitation indices, such as erosive precipitation (ERPTOT), wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT), very wet day precipitation (R95pTOT), flood season precipitation (FSPTOT), maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) and heavy precipitation (HP), were used to detect the precipitation extremes. The Mann-Kendall non-parametric trend analysis was used to analyze the dynamic changes in precipitation extremes and sediment load. The double cumulative curve method was used to assess the effects of changes in precipitation extremes on sediment load.Results and discussionThe results indicated that six extreme precipitation indices showed periodic variations from 1960 to 2014, while they did not show any significant change trend in the SSRB (p > 0.05); however, the sediment load showed an extremely significant decreasing trend (p < 0.01) over the past 55 years. Sediment load significantly correlated with six precipitation extremes indices (p < 0.05). Compared with the baseline period (1960-1977), the sediment load was reduced by 1.12 x 10(6) ton per year (1977-2014). The contribution of precipitation extremes to the sediment load ranged from -22.83% to 6.97%. The corresponding contribution of the non-precipitation factor to sediment load was from 93.03% to 122.83%.ConclusionsThe change in precipitation extremes was not the main reason for the sediment load reduction. Sediment load reduction in the SSRB was due to the interactions between multiple factors. Non-precipitation factors, such as reservoir construction, were the main reasons for the sediment load reduction.

However, forest fire amplification of floods is not well understood at a large scale due to the complex compound impacts of forest fires and climate variability, while available small-scale cases may not represent regional changes. Here, we show that the 2019-2020 mega forest fires in southeast Australia, with unprecedented burned areas, significantly (p < 0.05) increased the peak discharges of floods during the 2 years after the fires. Spatially, fire impacts on these floods are much stronger in regions with winter-dominated and uniform rainfall but insignificant in regions with summer-dominated rainfall. The regional divergence reveals that burned areas can aggravate floods by exacerbating infiltration-excess runoff processes but may not exert significant effects where saturation-excess processes dominate. People may be increasingly exposed to such flood hazards, especially in regions where forest fires have become more frequent under climate change.

This paper presents case studies of AC pavement sections in the U.S. that withstood high moisture events with limited effect on pavement performance and no immediate need for major maintenance or rehabilitation actions. The case studies comprise pavement sections in Florida and Louisiana that were subjected to catastrophic flooding events, a pavement section in Delaware that is constantly exposed to tidal water level variations, and pavement sections in Montana and Minnesota that experience seasonal freeze-thaw. These cases illustrated that flexible pavements could withstand climatic changes when appropriately designed and constructed. Mechanically or chemically stabilized subgrade, proper drainage, and/or minimizing plastic fines in unbound layers are all techniques that could effectively control moisture damage.

However, these bivariate compound flood-hot extreme (CFH) hazards have not been comprehensively examined at the global scale, and their evolution under climate warming remains unstudied. Here, we present the first global picture of projected changes in CFH hazards by using a cascade modeling chain of CMIP6 models, satellite and reanalysis data sets, bias correction, and hydrological models. We find an increasing percentage of floods will be accompanied by hot extremes under climate change; the joint return periods of CFHs are projected to decrease globally, particularly in the tropics. These decreasing joint return periods are largely driven by changes in hot extremes and indicate a likely increase of CFH hazards, and ultimately highlight the urgent need to conduct adaptation planning for future risks.

An overview of enclosure culture in inland open waters of India: Responding to socio-economic, ecological, and climate change issues in inland fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cage aquaculture; pen aquaculture; climate resilience; floodplain wetlands; reservoirs	WETLAND	Inland open-access fisheries of India are important resources that contribute significantly to the national economy while providing livelihood to millions. The majority of these resources are suitable for aquaculture, with a high potential for enhanced inland fish production. Enclosures (cages and pens) installed in such waters are useful for rearing fingerlings for enhancement programmes and table-fish production. Floating cages are most suitable for waterbodies vulnerable to occasional flooding, while pen enclosures installed in marginal areas of floodplain wetlands can be suitably reinforced to protect the fish during floods. Small indigenous fishes can be introduced into pens to increase their productivity. This paper reviews enclosure technologies in the inland open waters of India and discusses the socioeconomic benefits, ecological advantages, and climate resilience of these technologies. These factors may encourage their adoption and lead to an increase in fish production in the large inland waters of India.	[Debnath, D.; Bhattacharjya, B.

The economic damage expected as a result of floods will affect households differently across income levels. A method, rooted in economic theory, is proposed to estimate changes in household welfare and income inequality resulting from expected flood damage. It is found that welfare losses after floods disproportionately harm low income households and increase inequality by 0.14%. Families with dependent children and householders of retirement age in the lowest income quartile are the most affected. In order to collect additional resources to cover the cost of the financial relief, the of additional income, real estate and energy taxes are investigated. These instruments yield a reduction in income inequality. It is also shown that rewarding investment in mitigation and insurance, and supporting low income households can be jointly achieved when re-allocating additional energy-tax revenues.

Ocean model resolution dependence of Caribbean sea-level projections	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OCEAN; IMPACT; VARIABILITY; TRENDS; RISE	Sea-level rise poses severe threats to coastal and low-lying regions around the world, by exacerbating coastal erosion and flooding. Adequate sea-level projections over the next decades are important for both decision making and for the development of successful adaptation strategies in these coastal and low-lying regions to climate change. Ocean components of climate models used in the most recent sea-level projections do not explicitly resolve ocean mesoscale processes. Only a few effects of these mesoscale processes are represented in these models, which leads to errors in the simulated properties of the ocean circulation that affect sea-level projections. Using the Caribbean Sea as an example region, we demonstrate a strong dependence of future sea-level change on ocean model resolution in simulations with a global climate model. The results indicate that, at least for the Caribbean Sea, adequate regional projections of sea-level change can only be obtained with ocean models which capture mesoscale processes.

The analysis focuses on the differences in planning procedures and planning mandates (determined by different plans in authority) before and after the launch of the Sponge City Plan which calls for numerous spatial resilience measures to address the increasing flood risk. The analysis reveals that the introduction of the Sponge City Plan has changed the role of planning from onlooker to active participant in the arena of flood governance.

The threat of flash floods is exacerbated with climate change and increased human activities, such that the number of disasters has shown a clear upward trend in recent years. However, due to the scarcity of instrumental data or overly short timeseries, we are still lacking critical data to understand spatio-temporal patterns and driving factors of extreme flash floods. This missing knowledge is however crucial for a proper management of these hazards, especially in remote mountain environments. In forested catchments, dendrogeomorphology allows the reconstruction of past process activity based on growth disturbances (GDs) in trees that have been affected by past flash floods. Therefore, in our study, for the first time, we reconstruct past flash floods in the Qilian Mountains, northeast Tibetan Plateau, over past centuries. To this end, we sampled 99 Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) trees affected by flash floods, with a total of 194 increment cores, and identified 302 GDs induced by past flash floods. These GDs have been caused by at least 21 flash floods that we are able to reconstruct over the last 170 years. The position of GDs within tree rings and the intra-seasonal dating of past events also allowed discussion of the likely synoptic situations that may have led to the triggering of flash floods in the past. Logistic regression analysis confirms that significant correlation exists between cumulative maximum 5-day August-September precipitation and reconstructed flash floods, which is corresponding to the majority of scars and related tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts (TRDs) found in the latewood portion of growth rings. These results support the idea that abundant precipitation occurring at the end of the summer season and early fall is the key factor driving flash floods in our study area. Our research not only fills the gaps regarding historical flash flood histories in the Qilian Mountains, but also provides a scientific basis for the region's response to climate change and flood prevention and reduction.

Quantifying flow and nonflow management impacts on an endangered fish by integrating data, research, and expert opinion	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						adaptive management; Bayesian model selection; Beverton-Holt; condition-dependent management; Delphi method; designer flows; floodplain restoration; forecasting; intermittency; natural flow paradigm; out-of-sample prediction; stock assessment; stocking	GRANDE SILVERY MINNOW; RIO-GRANDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL	Managers charged with recovering endangered species in regulated river segments often have limited flexibility to alter flow regimes and want estimates of the expected population benefits associated with both flow and nonflow management actions. Disentangling impacts on different life stages from concurrently applied actions is essential for determining the effectiveness of each action, but difficult without models that integrate multiple information sources. Here, we develop and fit an integrated population model for endangered Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) in the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico. We integrate catch per unit effort monitoring data collected during 2002-2018 with population estimates, data collected during rescue of minnow from drying pools, habitat availability estimates, laboratory results, releases of hatchery reared minnow, and expert opinion. We use expert elicitation to develop a larval carrying capacity index as an informed proxy for the complex interactions among flow, habitat, and life history in this species. We evaluate the model using out-of-sample forecasts of 2019 and 2020, develop an algorithm to identify supplemental water releases that maximize benefits to the minnow, and quantify the effectiveness of various actions. Experts generally agreed on the duration and timing of flow requirements and disagreed regarding the importance of different magnitudes. The integrated model with the larval carrying capacity index outperformed two alternative models in forecasting catch in 2019 and 2020. The model estimates that minnow abundance varied by more than three orders of magnitude between 2002 and 2018 and that in a few years recruitment was limited by spawner abundance. Evaluation of the expected benefits of flow and nonflow management actions to fall population abundance across different years suggests that efficient addition of water to the base hydrograph is the most effective action in most, but not all years. Many actions are effective only under certain hydrologic and population conditions and the effectiveness of different actions varies in different sections of the study area. Widespread water extraction and river regulation combined with periodic drought and ongoing climate change may necessitate creative management of federally listed fish species in arid systems informed by thorough analyses of management effectiveness.

The Aiximan wetland, a major lacustrine wetland in Xinjiang, China, has shrunk in area by approximately 80% over the last 30 years. An ecological water transfer project (EWTP) was implemented in 2017 in an attempt to reverse this shrinking. The project involves seasonal flooding through three canals during the growing season of the wetland. In this paper, we explore the history of the Aiximan wetland over the last 30 years using a dense time series of remote sensing images to analyse the spatio-temporal changes of the wetland. We focus on intermittent flood inundation and wetland vegetation growth before and after the EWTP initiation, as well as the role of agricultural expansion in the decline of the wetland. The results indicate the following: (1) The annual maximum of open water area, which had fallen to 25.91 km(2) by 2016, increased to 47.54 km(2) in 2019 due to the water transfers. However, although the area of wetland vegetation also increased following the water transfers, it did not regain the maximum extent it had in 2013. (2) The percentage of the total wetland area with vegetation cover steadily declined from 54.2% in 1990 to 13.4% in 2019, and 72.84% of the loss of wetland was due to conversion to farmland. (3) The loss of wetland vegetation over the last 20 years corresponds to a period when the wetland water area fell below a threshold of 30 km(2), and the wetland vegetation accounted for less than 60% of the wetland area. (4) The Aiximan wetland has recently shown signs of recovery due to the EWTP. However, the remote sensing time series suggests that wetland vegetation restoration will require the wetland water area to exceed 30 km(2). Adjusting the timing of intermittent flood inundation to encourage vegetation growth may also be important for sustainable restoration of the Aiximan wetland ecology.

J	Wu, YY; Fang, HW; Huang, L; Ouyang, W				Wu, Yuyang; Fang, Hongwei; Huang, Lei; Ouyang, Wei			Changing runoff due to temperature and precipitation variations in the dammed Jinsha River	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological process; Climate variations; Snowmelt; Hydropower reservoir; Watershed; Modelling	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACT; LINEAR-REGRESSION MODEL; YANGTZE-RIVER; TIBETAN PLATEAU; SOIL-EROSION; HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES; SNOWMELT RUNOFF; WATER-QUALITY; SEDIMENT LOAD; HYDROPOWER	Impacts of climatic variations and human activities on water discharge in the lower streams of dammed rivers have been widely studied due to the rich water resources and hydropower potential. However, the effects of climate variations in upper streams on the whole river system are always ignored. Therefore, integrated methods of hydrological modelling and numerical analysis were employed to identify runoff characteristics in response to climatic variations in conjunction with hydroelectric exploitation in the Jinsha River in the "Asian Water Tower" region. While there was no significant rise in annual precipitation for most areas from 1970 to 2017, highly significant upward trends in temperature were observed in areas along the mainstream. Snowmelt periods varied between upper and middle streams due to constantly varying geographic conditions. Peaking runoff of 56.67 m(3) s(-1), 1350.12 m(3) s(-1), 175.63 m(3) s(-1), 2343.89 m(3) s(-1), 1855.02 m(3) s(-1), 3285.61 m(3) s(-1), and 10,922.65 m(3) s(-1) occurred during July in Tuotuohe, Qingshuihe_Jinsha, Qingshuihe_Yalong, Batang, Kangding, Xianggelila, and Yibin, respectively, along the Jinsha River. During snowmelt periods, runoff in the upper stream was greatly influenced by temperature changes. However, during recent periods, runoff in the middle stream has also become sensitive to rising temperatures, as indicated by change points. The contribution of runoff from upper streams to the outlet increased from 10.57% (naturalised river period) to 13.01% (individual reservoir period), followed by a further increase of 13.37% (cascade reservoirs period). Seasonal differences were observed up to the middle streams, where more runoff occurred at the outlet during flood seasons due to hydroelectric exploitation after 1999. Annually, runoff contribution in different areas increased in response to climatic variations during 1999-2017. This study highlights the vulnerability of runoff variations in upper streams to climate change. Watershed management rather than river regulation alone is needed, which could help water resources management for the entire river system.

Between August 28 and 29 of 2011, an average of 31 cm of rain from Tropical Storm Irene fell across Eastern New York State in less than 24 h and caused historic flooding in numerous streams of the Catskill Mountain Region. Peak discharges exceeded the 0.01 annual exceedance probability (>100 year flood) in many Catskill Mountain streams. Approximately one week later, the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee deposited another 19 cm of rain onto saturated soils and caused additional flooding. Data from annual benthic macroinvertebrate surveys completed at 5 sites in the Upper Esopus Creek, a premier trout stream in the region, during August 2009-2011 (before the floods) were compared to data collected from the same sites in September 2011, November 2011, March 2012 and August 2012 (after the floods). The impact, rate of recovery and the factors which might affect the resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities were evaluated. The results of biological water quality assessment metrics immediately after the floods resembled those of highly polluted waters, yet severe floods were the only disturbance. Prior to the floods, standard biological assessment metrics showed that communities were not impacted and water quality was pristine. A large decrease in macroinvertebrate density was evident in the September 2011 surveys following the floods and bioassessment metrics reflected highly degraded water quality conditions. Most community metrics rebounded in 3-7 months (November 2011 and March 2012), and full recovery was evident in 12 months (August 2012) which suggests that macroinvertebrate assemblages are relatively resilient to the effects of extreme floods in these low-order streams. Therefore, macroinvertebrate samples collected from a flood-impacted stream before full recovery occurs might reflect loss of diversity and abundance from the flood disturbance and incorrectly attribute the impact to impaired water quality. The strong short-term impacts and the relatively rapid recovery of macroinvertebrate communities following catastrophic floods have important ramifications for routine bioassessment programs considering changing hydrologic regimes in streams across the Northeast and elsewhere.

Although erosion rates are relatively low in western Europe, the agricultural landscape is confronted by the need to mitigate the off-site impacts of erosion. An important challenge is that of disrupting connectivity between runoff and sediment sources, often farmers' fields, and freshwater systems or local communities. Mitigation strategies should include monitoring of erosion rates and off-site impacts and a mix of engineered and alternative measures such as buffer strips and retention ponds. Also needed are supportive government policies and actions including awareness of institutional memory problems and the promotion of farmer education. For the future, the risk of climate change must be appreciated and built into the planning of comprehensive mitigation strategies. Our perspective is that the overall aim should be a 'sustainable agricultural landscape' and not simply a reduction of erosion and runoff on farmers' fields.

In dialogue with the anthropology and science and technology studies literature on disasters and its focus on technopolitical regimes of disaster anticipation and risk mitigation, we offer an analysis of the "affective publics of slow catastrophe" that have emerged in Houston in response to a situation that experts and citizens alike fear represents a "new normal" in the context of climate change. We focus on three affective orientations around which floodies are clustering: diluvial individualism (a wounded retreat from public engagement in favor of highly individualized recovery strategies), hydraulic citizenship (an activist political subjectivity oriented around creating better infrastructures of water management), and amphibious acceptance (an emergent affective orientation oriented to learning to live with rather than against floodwater). Although we ultimately argue that amphibious acceptance's time has not yet come in Houston, our fieldwork suggests that the repetitive experience of catastrophic flooding is changing the affective presence of water in Houston.

Population growth with global warming and climate changes increases the impact of floods on people every year. Combating natural disasters such as floods is possible with effective disaster management. An effective disaster management can only be possible with a comprehensive risk analysis. Flood risks depend on many factors such as precipitation, flow, earth slope, soil structure, and population density. A holistic flood risk analysis considering all these factors will provide a more effective disaster management. This study focuses on an assessment of flood hazard analysis in Bitlis province of Turkey using analytical hierarchy method which is a multi-parameter modeling technique. Flood hazard zones were mapped according to the weight of the selected factor by using geographic information system. It is concluded that while especially the south-western regions are exposed to high flood risk due to high stream density and precipitation, the high slope and rugged nature of this region restrict the risk mainly to the vicinity of low elevation streams and high population regions.

Water in the Lumbee World: A River and Its People in a Time of Change	ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY			English	Article							NORTH-CAROLINA	This article explores relationships between Lumbee people and the riverine landscapes of their home. I draw upon my lived experience as a Lumbee person and my training as an environmental scientist to evaluate the riverine environment of the Lumbee River as both a template for change and a fragile resource. The river shapes Lumbee culture and community, on the one hand, and it is subject to human impacts, on the other. Here, I examine the bidirectional relationship between river and people in a historical context and also in the context of contemporary issues facing Lumbee people, who collectively make up one of the largest Indigenous groups in the United States and constitute the nation's largest non-federally recognized Indian tribe. I frame historical issues related to isolation and connectivity of the landscape around a novel topological analysis of historical maps. I use contemporary issues, including industrialized agriculture and climate change, to emphasize the complex and evolving relationship between Lumbee people and their riverine environment. Recent events, including Indigenous resistance to fossil fuel pipelines and flooding of the community following Hurricane Matthew, reveal challenges and opportunities faced by the tribe in the areas of environmental justice and sovereignty.

Recent studies have documented the increasing intensity of summer frontal rainfall over recent decades. However, the extent of ongoing climate change on the intensification of the EA frontal precipitation system remains uncertain. Using an objective method for detecting frontal systems, we found a 17 +/- 3% increase in observed frontal rainfall intensity during 1958 to 2015. Climate model simulations with and without greenhouse gases suggest that anthropogenic warming plays a key role in the intensification of EA summer frontal precipitation by 5.8% from 1991 to 2015. The analysis highlights that enhanced water vapor convergence and reinforced western North Pacific subtropical High collectively increased moisture transport to the region, resulting in intensified EA frontal precipitation. The results lend support to the anthropogenic warming-induced enhancement of the EA frontal precipitation and its persistence in the future.

Exploiting the timing and siting of different adaptation projects in Miami-Dade, we are able to identify significant gains in property values after completion of adaptation infrastructure projects. These gains are concentrated in areas close to the project and for projects that are visually identifiable. Our results suggest an aggregate mean benefit, net of adaptation cost, of about $0.68 million per project and almost $300 million in aggregate net benefits for all projects in our sample. Most projects generated positive net benefits, indicating that the vast majority of adaptation efforts are being placed in areas passing a benefit-cost test.

The effect is strengthened when media attention on climate change is high, when the firm has a high level of prior long-term investment and when the firm is managed by a young CEO and a CEO who has a greater tendency to avoid uncertainty, whereas it is weakened when the firm's CEO is near retirement and when the firm is geographically diversified. Overall, we document a negative relationship between flood risk exposure and corporate future orientation, suggesting that firms change their future-oriented attitude in response to concern over climate risks.

Extreme Water Vapor Transport During the March 2021 Sydney Floods in the Context of Climate Projections	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extreme rainfall; floods; CMIP6; integrated water vapor transport (IVT); moisture; climate change	ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; PRECIPITATION	During March 2021, large regions of Eastern Australia experienced prolonged heavy rainfall and extensive flooding. The maximum daily mean column integrated water vapor transport (IVT) over Sydney during this event was within the top 0.3% of all days since 1980, and the 10-day mean IVT was in the top 0.2%. In this study, we have examined the change in frequency of extreme IVT events over Sydney in 16 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245 and SSP585). Generalized Extreme Value modeling was used to further analyze the change in frequency of extreme IVT events. We found the probability of long duration high IVT events is projected to increase by 80% at the end of the century, but the future change in IVT is correlated to the rate of global and regional warming in each model.

This paper aims to assess the temporal expansion of waterbodies during flooding using geospatial techniques. Several water indices were applied to classify the satellite images at various temporal scales. Among them, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) showed the highest correlation (r = 0.831; where p = 0.01) with rainfall data. Specifically, the NDWI results showed that perennial waterbodies measured 37 km(2) and 60 km(2) in Sunamganj District in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The area of waterbodies notably increased 52-fold from March to April (37 km(2) to 1958 km(2)) during the pre-monsoon flash flood of 2017. During the July 2019 monsoon flood, waterbodies started to extend after May and flooded 2784 km(2) in area. NDVI analysis showed that in 2019, floodwater submerged 361.7 km(2) of vegetation cover. At the same time, the Surma River's flooding resulted in a 73.9 per cent inundation of the total area of the Sunamganj District. We hope that this study will provide better understanding of the varying nature of floods that occur in the low lying bowl shaped Haor region which will in turn assist the government with flood mitigation.

In order to reveal the impact of flooding on the spatial accessibility of emergency response to stadiums in the central urban area within the outer ring of Shanghai, this article evaluates the accessibility of medical emergency services in the central urban area under the impact of flooding based on flood scenario simulations and GIS network analysis. Results show that under the different flooding scenarios, as the intensity of flooding increases, urban road traffic in flood-prone areas is blocked by ponding, and some stadiums are inaccessible to emergency vehicles. The scope of emergency response services for some medical institutions along the Huangpu River is significantly reduced, while emergency response times for stadiums in the riverside area are delayed considerably.

Traditional rigid defense methods cannot meet the needs of modern disaster mitigation and should shift to resilience approaches. However, most existing resilience studies stopped at qualitative analysis and static evaluation. Quantitative evaluation of dynamic resilience is quite rare. In this study, focusing on flood resilience, we applied the process-based "Robustness-Resistance-Recovery (3Rs)" quantitative assessment framework, and used the Dongting Lake Basin as an empirical area. The results showed that the resilience of the whole Dongting Lake Basin was high, but the Dongting Lake Eco-economic Zone had poor flood resilience. The low value of robustness was concentrated in the north and central part of Hunan Province, affected by the distribution of water systems. The resistance was relatively low and the administrative units with the top two low levels accounted for 61.99%, while the recovery level was high with obvious good performance in the west. In addition, the synergy of robustness and resistance dominated the flood resilience. This study proposed a resilience assessment framework based on the "3Rs" and provided a new process perspective for improving the flood resilience.

The vulnerability of high-risk societies to natural disasters has continued to increase. To develop an effective and efficient adaptation strategy, local damage assessments must be timely, exhaustive, and accurate. We propose a novel deep-learning-based solution that uses pairs of pre- and post-disaster satellite images to identify water-related disaster-affected regions. The model extracts features of pre- and post-disaster images and uses the feature difference with them to predict damage in the pair. We demonstrate that the model can successfully identify local destruction using less granular and less complex ground-truth data than those used by previous segmentation models. When tested with various water-related disasters, our detection model reported an accuracy of 85.9% in spotting areas with damaged buildings. It also achieved a reliable performance of 80.3% in out-of-domain settings. Our deep learning-based damage assessment model can help direct resources to areas most vulnerable to climate disasters, reducing their impacts while promoting adaptive capacities for climate-resilient development in the most vulnerable regions.

The rhizosphere and phyllosphere of plants growing in natural (mangroves) and artificial wetlands (flooded agricultural ecosystems) harbor methane-utilizing bacteria that oxidize methane at the source and reduce its net flux. For several decades, microorganisms have been used as biofertilizers to promote plant growth. However, now their role in reducing net methane flux, especially from flooded agricultural ecosystems is gaining momentum globally. Research in this context has mainly focused on taxonomic aspects related to methanotrophy among diverse bacterial genera, and environmental factors that govern methane utilization in natural and artificial wetland ecosystems. In the last few decades, concerted efforts have been made to develop multifunctional microbial inoculants that can oxidize methane and alleviate greenhouse gas emissions, as well as promote plant growth. In this context, combinations of taxonomic groups commonly found in rice paddies and those used as biofertilizers are being explored. This review deals with methanotrophy among diverse bacterial domains, factors influencing methane-utilizing ability, and explores the potential of novel methane-utilizing microbial consortia with plant growth-promoting traits in flooded ecosystems.

This work introduces a generic, building-level flood exposure analysis tool applying high resolution flood data and building geometries derived from hydrodynamic simulations performed with the 2D hydrodynamic flood modelling software CityCAT. Validation data were obtained from a survey of affected residents following a large pluvial flood event in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Sensitivity testing was carried out for different hydrodynamic model and exposure tool settings and between 68% and 75% of the surveyed buildings were correctly modelled as either flooded or not flooded. The tool tends to underrepresent flooding with a better performance in identifying true negatives (i. e. no flooding observed with no flooding modelled) compared to true positives. As higher true positive rates were accompanied by higher false positive rates, no single scenario could be identified as the optimal solution. However, the results suggest a greater sensitivity of the results to the classification scheme than to the buffer distance applied. Overall, if applied to high resolution flood depth maps, the method is efficient and suitable for application to large urban areas for flood risk management and insurance analysis purposes.

The model performance is strongly affected by parameters such as bathymetry and bottom friction. In this study, we propose a method that estimates bathymetry globally and the bottom friction coefficient in shallow waters for a global tide and surge model (GTSMv4.1). However, the estimation effect is limited by the scarcity of available tide gauges. We propose complementing sparse tide gauges with tide time series generated using FES2014. The FES2014 dataset outperforms the GTSM in most areas and is used as observations for the deep ocean and some coastal areas, such as Hudson Bay and Labrador, where tide gauges are scarce but energy dissipation is large. The experiment is performed with a computation- and memory-efficient iterative parameter estimation scheme (time-POD-based coarse incremental parameter estimation; POD: proper orthogonal decomposition) applied to the Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSMv4.1). Estimation results show that model performance is significantly improved for the deep ocean and shallow waters, especially in the European shelf, directly using the CMEMS tide gauge data in the estimation. The GTSM is also validated by comparing to tide gauges from UHSLC, CMEMS, and some Arctic stations in the year 2014.

SSF vulnerability has become more evident, with increased severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about what makes SSF vulnerable is limited, which impedes appropriate policy responses and intervention. As a first step to rectifying the situation, a classification approach is proposed to better describe and differentiate types of vulnerability to SSF and to guide data collection and dissemination about SSF vulnerability. The classification system is developed based on a narrative review of case studies worldwide, published in scientific journals in the past 20 years. The case studies cover SSF in diverse aquatic environments, including river, floodplain, reservoir, river delta, lake, atoll, estuaries, lagoon mangrove, coral reefs, seagrass ecosystem, islands, coastal and marine environment. Similar to the five pillars of sustainability, SSF vulnerability is associated with five main factors, i.e., biophysical, social, economic, technological, and governance. Knowledge about SSF vulnerability helps inform tailored management strategies and policies to reduce SSF marginalization and promote viability, aligning, therefore, with the goal of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries.

The presence of glacial lakes in the Himalayan region makes it a potential threat for the downstream community, as the catastrophic failure of the lake causes the Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF), which significantly damages the low-lying areas. Devising appropriate risk reduction strategies for the downstream community to the GLOF hazard is the prime concern for the policymakers. In this study, we have assessed the social vulnerability of the downstream community of Chungthang town of Sikkim Himalaya. Many settlements at Chungthang are potentially exposed to the future GLOF of South Lohnak Lake, one of the fastest-growing glacial lakes in Sikkim, India. A sample size of 90 households have been selected and classified into migrated and permanent residents for the study. Primary data have been collected by using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results revealed that, in Chungthang migrated population are more vulnerable because of their low adaptive capacity and high exposure to the GLOF of South Lohnak lake in Sikkim. The study suggests some important mitigation measures to decrease the vulnerability of the vulnerable community by improving some of the important socioeconomic indicators.

J	Winkler, C; Thaler, T; Seebauer, S				Winkler, Claudia; Thaler, Thomas; Seebauer, Sebastian			The interplay between enterprise and entrepreneur in the flood risk management of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Austria	ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						risk management; resilience; disaster; SME; mitigation	SMALL BUSINESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; COMPETENCE; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; OWNER	Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of most economies across the globe. They are particularly vulnerable to floods because they typically have less structural adaptation measures and less resources and financial access for recovery than large companies. In SMEs, economic and personal interests in risk governance intersect, such as when business crises after flood impacts spill over to personal crises of entrepreneurs. Applying a qualitative research method comprising policy document analysis, interviews and workshops with 11 flood-affected owner-entrepreneurs and 10 local and federal experts, this article analyses SMEs in the manufacturing sector in Austria. SME vulnerability and coping capacity emerge from the close interaction of (1) the governance framework, foremost the public disaster compensation scheme; (2) enterprise-oriented factors, e.g. availability of capital, customer loyalty, labour force flexibility; and (3) entrepreneur-oriented factors, e.g. psychological resilience, social networks, political efficacy. Flood impacts may increase bankruptcy risk when coinciding with economic and personal challenges. SMEs merit special consideration in disaster risk management, therein accounting for the interplay of enterprise- and entrepreneur-oriented factors.

J	Creach, A; Bastidas-Arteaga, E; Pardo, S; Mercier, D				Creach, Axel; Bastidas-Arteaga, Emilio; Pardo, Sophie; Mercier, Denis			Method to Identify the Likelihood of Death in Residential Buildings during Coastal Flooding	BUILDINGS			English	Article						coastal flooding risk; loss of life; fatality assessment; residential buildings; climate change adaptation; VIE index	STORM XYNTHIA; TSUNAMI; VULNERABILITY; LIFE; FATALITIES; DAMAGE; MODEL; LESSONS; IMPACT; ACEH	Tools exist to predict fatalities related to floods, but current models do not focus on fatalities in buildings. For example, Storm Xynthia in France in 2010 resulted in 41 drowning deaths inside buildings. Therefore, there has been increasing recognition of the risk of people becoming trapped in buildings during floods. To identify buildings which could expose their occupants to a risk of death in the case of flooding, we propose the use of the extreme vulnerability index (VIE index), which identifies which buildings are at greatest risk of trapping people during floods. In addition, the "mortality function method" is used to further estimate the expected number of fatalities based on (1) groups of vulnerable people (e.g., aged or disabled), (2) the location of buildings in relation to major watercourses, and (3) the configuration of buildings (e.g., single or multiple entries and single or multiple stories). The overall framework is derived from case studies from Storm Xynthia which give a deterministic approach for deaths inside buildings for coastal floods, which is suited for low-lying areas protected by walls or sandy barriers. This methodology provides a tool which could help make decisions for adaptation strategy implementation to preserve human life.

Stormwater control measures (SCMs), ecologically sustainable methods of stormwater management, may have varying impacts on Culex mosquitoes, such as in areas with combined sewer overflows (CSOs). We studied spatial and temporal associations of SCMs and Culex mosquito counts surrounding the SCMs, stratifying our examination amongst those that do/do not use pooling and/or vegetation, as well as surrounding CSO outfalls after heavy rainfall (>= 95th percentile) during summer 2018. Results indicate Culex mosquito counts after heavy rainfall were not significantly different at SCMs that use vegetation and/or ponding from at those that do not. We also found a 35.5% reduction in the increase of Culex mosquitoes the day of, and 77.0% reduction 7-8 days after, heavy rainfall at CSO outfalls treated with medium SCM density compared to those without SCMs. Our results suggest that SCMs may be associated with a reduction in the increase of Culex mosquitoes at the CSO outfalls after heavy rainfall. More research is needed to study how the impacts of SCMs on mosquito populations may affect human health.

Planning for Disaster-Induced Relocation of Communities	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION			English	Review						community relocation; disaster recovery; post-disaster planning	HOUSING RECOVERY; POSTDISASTER RECONSTRUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND; LESSONS; FLOOD; RESETTLEMENT; PERSPECTIVES; EARTHQUAKE; RETREAT	Problem, research strategy, and findings Disasters displace millions of people every year. After the disaster, they must decide whether to return to their homes or move elsewhere. Planners and government officials often propose permanent relocation as a response. But relocations disrupt lives and livelihoods of households and communities and are therefore rarely the preferred option of those affected. Nevertheless, relocations happen, and planners often develop relocation policies and plan the move. We examined the dynamics of the relocation process through a conceptual framework consisting of five interrelated elements: 1) the natural science; 2) the risk decision; 3) the community's relationship to place; 4) the relocation process, land, and money; and 5) the historical, social, and political context. This research draws from analyses of 53 cases of community relocation, including many that we have directly researched or worked on. Here we introduce this framework as a way for planners to systematically approach the task of evaluating and implementing proposed disaster-induced relocations. Takeaway for practice In planning for relocation, planners should work with all stakeholders to evaluate the risks, balance the risks of staying against those of relocation, and consider alternatives to complete relocation. Finally, planners should be astute regarding the broader contexts of relocation proposals.

The most reliable way of estimating such predictions is through the Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA), its fundamental assumption is that the stochastic process under study is stationary, that is, it does not change with time. Construction of small reservoirs, urbanization and changes in land use in the basin, as well as global or regional climate change, alter the hydrological processes and generate records of annual flows that are non-stationary, showing trends and changes in variability. For the FFA of such registries, the extreme value theory has been extended to apply its classical distribution, the General of Extreme Values (GEV), with parameters of location (u) and scale (a) varying with time (t), introducing it as a covariate. In this work the L moments method is presented for the fit of the probabilistic model GVE(11) whose parameters u and a vary linearly over time. Three numerical applications are described. Conclusions highlight the simplicity of the exposed method and its importance in the estimation of the sought predictions in non-stationary annual maximum data series.

In response to increased risk of bridge pier scouring, there is a need for increased safety monitoring of bridges. This paper presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) - based solution developed to measure micro-vibrations of a bridge pier. Test measurement values are converted with the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method to obtain natural frequencies. Scouring depth of the pier is estimated with the use of a Finite Element Method model. WSN is used to collect the signal and to test data transmission stability in different locations, as well as FFT and Welch method are used to convert the obtained signal into spectral signals allows an automatic determination and storage of pier vibration frequency data. Relevant parameters in a Finite Element Method (FEM) model use the in-situ natural frequencies as calibration parameters, and the soil equivalent spring model was set up by using in-situ drilling data. The maximum spring depth represents the depth of the scouring. The scouring depth and natural frequency data are used as follow-up indicators of bridge scouring condition. WSN is used to monitor condition of piers provides a practical method and tool for mitigating potential bridge collapse.	[Huang, Han-Tang; Tserng, H.

Effects of Hurricane Irma on the Endangered Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FLORIDA-KEYS; DENSITY; PATCH; IMPACTS; HABITAT	Sylvilagus palustris hefneri (Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit [LKMR]) is an endangered subspecies of marsh rabbit found only in the Lower Florida Keys. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma was measured as a Category 4 storm when it passed through the center of the LKMR range causing significant damage to human infrastructure and natural habitats. To assess the impact of Hurricane Irma to LKMR and its habitat. we compared pm- and post-hurricane monitoring data. Overall, 82% of LKMR habitat patches were abandoned, the average number of pellets per sampling plot decreased 94%, and average patch pellet density decreased by 84% following Hurricane Irma. Generally, pellets were found in plots with greater open cover, an intermediate amount of herbaceous and woody cover, and areas with more standing water post-Hurricane Irma. We also observed a slight decrease in signs of Procyon lotor (Raccoon) and Didelphis virginiana (Virginia Opossum). The decrease in rabbit pellets detected after Hurricane Irma is likely attributed to both direct mortality from the storm and flooding. as well as indirect mortality from the loss of critical, salt-sensitive herbaceous cover. Because climate-change models suggest increases in future flooding and hurricane frequency, we recommend that wildlife managers continue to closely monitor the recovery of LKMR populations and their habitat to determine if more active management actions (e.g., habitat remediation, translocations. or captive breeding) are necessary.

As a means of comprehensively exploring such weaknesses and susceptibilities in the interest of future development, this paper proposes a vulnerability evaluation framework that integrates Bi-level Programming (BLP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with multi-followers: the water authority as the leader and industrial, domestic and agricultural water users as the multiple followers. A case study of 19 regions in the Yangtze River Basin between 2013 and 2017 is then introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-level DEA model. It was found that water systems were vulnerable to damage by hazards, that the domestic sector had the greatest effect on the whole, and the proposed framework identifying more vulnerable and safer areas provided managerial insights. The novelty of this paper is to put forward the vulnerability assessment framework of the regional water system which integrates water quantity, contamination, water-related hazards and water use efficiency and reveals the structure of realistic water resource management to obtain more sensitive results.

We analyse the evolution of the Gya glacial lake using a high temporal and high spatial resolution remote sensing approach. In order to frame the case study in a larger picture, we produce a comprehensive inventory of glacial lakes for the entire Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh. Changes in the extent and number of glacial lakes have been detected for the years 1969, 1993, 2000/02 and 2018 in order to assess the potential risk of future GLOFs in the region. The remote sensing approach was supported by field surveys between 2014 and 2019. The case study of the Gya GLOF illustrates the problem of potentially hazardous lakes being overlooked in inventories. The broader analysis of the Ladakh region and in-depth analysis of one GLOF lead us to propose an integrated approach for detecting undocumented GLOFs. This article demonstrates the necessity for using multiple methods to ensure robustness of risk assessment. The improved understanding can lead to a more accurate evaluation of exposure to cryosphere hazards and identification of alternative mechanisms and spatial patterns of GLOFs in the Himalaya.

Climate change and sea level rise are altering the statistics of these extreme events in a rather complex fashion. Here we use a fully coupled global weather/climate modeling system (GFDL CM4) to study characteristics of extreme daily sea level (ESL) along the U.S. Atlantic coast and their response to global warming. We find that under natural weather processes, the Gulf of Mexico coast is most vulnerable to storm surge and related ESL. New Orleans is a striking hotspot with the highest surge efficiency in response to storm winds. Under a 1% per year atmospheric CO2 increase on centennial time scales, the anthropogenic signal in ESL is robust along the U.S. East Coast. It can emerge from the background variability as soon as in 20 years, or even before global sea level rise is taken into account. The regional dynamic sea level rise induced by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation facilitates this early emergence, especially during wintertime coastal flooding associated with nor'easters. Along the Gulf Coast, ESL is sensitive to the modification of hurricane characteristics under the CO2 forcing.

Given the social-political nature and construction of urban flood risks, it is of crucial importance to understand how such risks are experienced and addressed, and by whom. This article aims to contribute to this by focusing on a particular actor, i.e. entrepreneurs of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It asks how SMEs experience, perceive and address risks. This knowledge not only can help to improve flood governance by including one group's specific risks and opportunities but also provides new insights into how risk perceptions are constructed and shape subsequent strategies. The findings are based on a comparative study of SMEs in Jakarta, Metro Manila and Bangkok. Using a mixed methods design, the studies show that entrepreneurs distinguish between frequent everyday floods and scarce major floods, but only consider major floods a risk. The latter is explained by a combination of risk normalisation and incremental and independent everyday practices. Strategies aim at keeping the business going in the short run. There are substantial differences between medium and small companies. Finally, the research confirms that attention for SMEs in flood policies or support is nil.

Sedimentological analyses, including lithofacies de scriptions, palaeocurrent mea sure ments, grain size and rounding analyses and heavy mineral compositions indicate that the fluvial depos its at Brzeoenica were deposited in braided river en vi ronment. The following fluvial sedimentary processes were inferred: (1) shallow, rapid flow alternating with waning flow, (2) in filling of erosional channels with fluvial sedi ments during flood events, (3) changes from supercritical to subcritical flows, and (4) shallow sheet floods. The results of OSL dating indi cated sed iment deposition similar to 65.2 +/- 1.5 ka, i.e. in MIS 4, that was here characterized by cold environmental conditions and a general shift from meander ing to braided fluvial sedi mentation style. This find ing contrasts with accu mulation/erosion phases in terpreted previously in this region for that time in terval; however, it is con sistent with recent studies of fluvial systems func tioning during MIS 5-2 and of factors responsible for sedimentation style.

Taking the upper- and middle-stream of the Weihe River in western China as an example, using multiple meteorological and hydrological elements, as well as land-use/land-cover change (LUCC) data, we constructed a sensitivity model of runoff to climatic elements and human activities based on the hydro-thermal coupling equilibrium equation, while a cumulative slope was used to establish a comprehensive estimation model for the contributions of climatic variation and human activities to the changes of runoff. The results showed that the above function model established could be well applied to quantitatively study the elasticity of runoff's response to climatic variation and human activities. It was found that the annual average precipitation, evaporation, wind velocity, sunshine hours, relative humidity and runoff showed decreasing trends and that temperature increased. While in the hydrological cycle, precipitation and relative humidity had a non-linear positive driving effect on runoff, while temperature, evaporation, sunshine hours, wind velocity, and land-use/land-cover change (LUCC) have non-linearly negatively driven the variation of runoff. Moreover, runoff has a strong sensitive response to precipitation, evaporation and LUCC. In areas with strong human activities, the sensitivity of runoff to climatic change was decreasing, and runoff has a greater elastic response to underlying surface parameters. In addition, the analysis showed that the abrupt years of climate and runoff changes in the Weihe River Basin were 1970, 1985 and 1993. Before 1985, the contribution rate of climatic variation to runoff was 68.3%, being greater than that of human activities to runoff, and then the contribution rates of human activities to runoff reached 75.1%. The impact of natural climate on runoff was weakened, and the effect of human activities on runoff reduction increased. Under 30 hypothetical climatic scenarios, the evaluation of runoff in the future showed that the runoff in the Weihe River Basin will be greatly reduced, and the reduction will be more significant during the flood season. Comparing the geographically fragile environments and intense human activities, it was believed that climatic variation had a dramatic effect on driving the water cycle of precipitation and evaporation and affected regional water balance and water distribution, while human activities had driven the hydrological processes of the underlying surface, thus becoming the main factors in the reduction of runoff. This study provided scientific tools for regional climate change and water resources assessment.

The northward expansion of Mediterranean farming groups (Starcevo-Koros-Cris cultural complex) halted and underwent a complete transformation giving rise to a new cultural group carrying an altered form of Neolithic traditions onward to Europe. This transformation is restricted to sites along a boundary found in the heart of the basin, north of which unfavorable ecological conditions hampered a long-term engagement in a Mediterranean type of agriculture. The majority of Early Neolithic Koros sites in eastern Hungary are confined to the alluvial plain of the Tisza River prone to natural biannual flooding. These wetland conditions were marginal for early farmers as it contained several elements that were hostile for herded animals and these groups were not adopted to cope with. Koros Culture pastoralists responded to these challenges posed by the new environment by complementing their diet with opportunistically exploited wild resources. This type of resilience of the first farmers seen in the alteration of traditional subsistence strategies was simply attributed to the static hostile conditions of the environment alone. Influence of dynamic changes in the hydrology has not been studied and documented so far. This paper presents a multiproxy archeomalacological approach to establish a mid-Holocene flood record in Southern Central Europe and assess the potential impacts of flood frequencies, climate change-induced higher floods on economic, societal development of the first farming groups from the heart of the Carpathian Basin. Based on our findings, intensified use of second-line subsistence resources marking resilience is coeval with intensified flooding during the second phase of cultural evolution preceding transformation. This marked transformation could have been traced regionally as well along the referred northern distribution line and is coeval with the initial phase of a minor climatic perturbation refered to as the IRD 5.b event. The southward expansion of cold waters in the North Atlantic yielded intensive cyclonic activity bringing more rain and cold weather to W Europe. In Hungary, higher continentality provided by the basin setting preserved warmer conditions. Nevertheless, increased rainfall onto the watershed of major rivers triggered heightened floods.

However, it is still not clear how climate change-driven extended periods of soil drying followed by flooding will affect soil-P dynamics. We tested the hypothesis under laboratory conditions that soil antecedent conditions (moist/dry) determine the amount of P mobilised upon flooding. A series of controlled laboratory experiments were carried out by flooding samples of two contrasting soils (a Dystric Cambisol [Crediton series] and a Stagni-Vertic Cambisol [Hallsworth series]), which had each been either dried (40 degrees C for 10 days) or kept at field moisture conditions (25% moisture content). Flooding was simulated by maintaining a 10-cm water column depth in mesocosms. Periodically collected water samples were analysed for dissolved reactive P (DRP), total dissolved P (TDP) and dissolved unreactive P (DUP). The onset of flooding significantly (p < 0.001) increased dissolved concentrations of all forms of P. The release of TDP coincided with a reduction in redox potential, suggesting reductive dissolution of P bearing iron/manganese (Fe/Mn) minerals as indicated by a significant positive correlation between TDP and dissolved Fe (r = 0.430, p < 0.001) and TDP and dissolved Mn (r = 0.622, p < 0.001). Flooding of the dried soils caused a significantly greater increase in the dissolved P concentrations of all forms of P relative to their moist-flooded counterparts. This could be due to a combination of factors which are associated with soil drying and flooding. The Crediton dry-flooded soils released higher concentrations of DRP upon flooding (e.g. 0.14 mg P L-1 on day 1 after flooding) perhaps due to its higher concentrations of water- and NaHCO3-extractable P than the Hallsworth dry-flooded (HDF) soil (0.03 mg P L-1 on day 1 after flooding). However, most of the P in the water column of the dry-flooded soils was unreactive, with the HDF soil releasing higher concentrations of DUP, likely due to its higher organic matter and microbial biomass P contents. The results suggest that flooding of dried soils has greater potential to enhance mobilisation of soil-P than flooding of moist soils and thus has potential implications for soil fertility and surface water quality. Highlights Flooding significantly increased dissolved concentrations of all forms of P. Dried soils released much greater P than their moist counterparts upon flooding. Increased amounts of P in the floodwater coincided with reductions in redox potential and biomass P. Soil with greater amount of biomass-P and organic matter released greater amounts of dissolved unreactive P.

Nonetheless agriculture also contributes to global warming through the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4 and N2O. Yet this complex conundrum can be alleviated and mitigated through sound soil and water management practices. Despite considerable literature on Conservation Agriculture (CA) as a strategy to improve the resilience and mitigation capacity of agroecosystems, there is still paucity of information on the impacts of CA on crop production and environmental quality on the Plateau. In order to fill this gap this study examined the effects of no-till and straw mulch on crop productivity and greenhouse gas fluxes in agroecosystems on the Plateau where farmers' common practice of conventional tillage (CT) was tested against three CA practices: conventional tillage with straw mulch (CTS), no-till (NT) and no-till with straw mulch (NTS). The results indicated that all three CA practices (CTS, NTand NTS) markedly increased soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) but reduced soil temperature (ST). Average grain yields were 854.46 +/- 76.51, 699.30 +/- 133.52 and 908.18 +/- 38.64 kg ha-1 respectively under CTS, NT and NTS indicating an increase by approximately 33%, 9% and 41% respectively compared with CT (644.61 +/- 76.98 kg ha(-1)). There were significant (p < 0 :05) reductions of Net CO2 emissions under NT (7.37 +/- 0.89 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) and NTS (6.65 +/- 0.73 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) compared with CTS (10.65 +/- 0.18 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) and CT (11.14 +/- 0.58 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)). All the treatments served as sinks of CH4but NTS had the highest absorption capacity (0.27 +/- 0.024 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)) and increased absorption significantly (p< 0 :05) compared with CT (0.21 +/- 0.017 tCO2e ha(-1)y(-1)); however, CA did not reduce emissions of N2O. These had an influence on Global warming potential (GWP) as NT and NTS resulted in significant reduction in net GWP. Grain yield was significantly correlated positively with SOC and STN (p< 0 :05); ecosystem respiration was also significantly correlated withSWCand ST whileCH(4) flux was highly correlated with ST (p< 0:001). Crop yield and GHG responses to CA were controlled by soil hydrothermal and nutrient changes, thus improving these conditions through adoption of sustainable soil moisture improvement practices such as no-till, straw mulch, green manuring, contour ploughing and terracing can improve crop resilience to climate change and reduce GHG emissions in arid and semi-arid regions.

We propose an alternate framework to detect significant changes in design-flood between two periods and evaluate it for synthetically generated AMF from the Log-Pearson Type-3 (LP3) distribution due to changes in moments associated with flood distribution. Synthetic experiments show MKT does not consider changes in all three moments of the LP3 distribution and incorrectly detects changes in design-flood. We applied the framework on 31 river basins spread across the United States. Statistically significant changes in design-flood quantiles were observed even without a significant trend in AMF and basins with statistically significant trend did not necessarily exhibit statistically significant changes in design-flood. We recommend application of the framework for evaluating changes in design-flood estimates considering changes in all the moments as opposed to simple trend tests.

Flooding resulting from climate change is a major crop threat that increases the risk of hypoxic stress. The molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia in plants were elucidated in recent years, but new genes related to this stress remain to be discovered. Thus, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) under hypoxia. We collected 29 (Arabidopsis) and 26 (rice) pairs of RNA-Seq data involving hypoxic (including submergence) and normoxic (control) treatments and extracted the genes that were commonly upregulated or downregulated in the majority of the experiments. The meta-analysis revealed 40 and 19 commonly upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, in the two species. Several WRKY transcription factors and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase were commonly upregulated, but their involvement in hypoxia remains unclear. Our meta-analysis identified candidate genes for novel molecular mechanisms in plants under hypoxia.

Rainfall shocks and crop productivity in Zambia: Implication for agricultural water risk management	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Erratic rainfall; Agricultural productivity; Zambia; Water management	TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GROWTH; IMPACT; DROUGHT	This paper investigates the impact of erratic rainfall and related water problems on agricultural productivity. The paper also aims to shed light on the conceptual importance of understanding the incidence and impacts of rainfall shocks for choosing feasible agricultural water risk management strategies both at household and policy levels. To achieve these goals we develop a conceptual framework, use national representative data from Zambia's crop estimates survey for 2017/2018 farming season, employ fixed effects regression approach, and find that dry spells, excessive floods, incidence of water logging are all detrimental to crop productivity. The crop-based equations also reveal the differential impacts of the rainfall shocks on different crops. Since the effect of water factors including dry spells, floods and water logging on agricultural productivity is dependent on the crop types, it is important for the Zambian government as well as other countries to take this into account when planning and implementing strategies for agricultural water risk management.

Urban Water Storage Capacity Inferred From Observed Evapotranspiration Recession	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						urban climate; recession analysis	EDDY COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS; ENERGY-BALANCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; HEAT-ISLAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOCAL CLIMATE; CO2 EXCHANGE; VEGETATION; IMPACT; FLUX	Water storage plays an important role in mitigating heat and flooding in urban areas. Assessment of the water storage capacity of cities remains challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity of the urban surface. Traditionally, effective storage has been estimated from runoff. Here, we present a novel approach to estimate effective water storage capacity from recession rates of observed evaporation during precipitation-free periods. We test this approach for cities at neighborhood scale with eddy-covariance based latent heat flux observations from 14 contrasting sites with different local climate zones, vegetation cover and characteristics, and climates. Based on analysis of 583 drydowns, we find storage capacities to vary between 1.3 and 28.4 mm, corresponding to e-folding timescales of 1.8-20.1 days. This makes the urban storage capacity at least five times smaller than all the observed values for natural ecosystems, reflecting an evaporation regime characterized by extreme water limitation.

The present study proposes a spatial-based multi-criteria approach integrating mitigation capacity to map the degree of flood risk. Flood risk is calculated considering 14 relevant factors under three risk components. Thematic layers were ranked through fuzzy membership functions, and risk components were prepared using fuzzy overlay operation. To make a comparison, first, we calculated risk with mitigation capacity and later without it. Results exhibit, without mitigation capacity around 67% of the study area is exposed to high flood risk, while after integrating mitigation capacity flood risks decreased to 62%. Moreover, validation evaluation suggests risk map integrating mitigation capacity is more accurate (82%) than the risk map without it (79%). Therefore, the developed integrated risk mapping approach is more efficient to assess flood risk, and can be implemented by policymakers in similar environments.

Drivers behind the summer 2010 wave train leading to Russian heatwave and Pakistan flooding	NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE			English	Article							SOIL-MOISTURE; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MONSOON RAINFALL; BOREAL SUMMER; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; TELECONNECTION; VARIABILITY	Summer 2010 saw two simultaneous extremes linked by an atmospheric wave train: a record-breaking heatwave in Russia and severe floods in Pakistan. Here, we study this wave event using a large ensemble climate model experiment. First, we show that the circulation in 2010 reflected a recurrent wave train connecting the heatwave and flooding events. Second, we show that the occurrence of the wave train is favored by three drivers: (1) 2010 sea surface temperature anomalies increase the probability of this wave train by a factor 2-to-4 relative to the model's climatology, (2) early-summer soil moisture deficit in Russia not only increases the probability of local heatwaves, but also enhances rainfall extremes over Pakistan by forcing an atmospheric wave response, and (3) high-latitude land warming favors wave-train occurrence and therefore rainfall and heat extremes. These findings highlight the complexity and synergistic interactions between different drivers, reconciling some seemingly contradictory results from previous studies.

Urban areas, with high concentration of population, key infrastructure, and businesses, are extremely vulnerable to flooding and may suffer severe socio-economic losses due to climate change. Urban flood modelling tools are in demand to predict surface water inundation caused by intense rainfall and to manage associated flood risks in urban areas. These tools have been rapidly developing in recent decades. In this study, we present a comprehensive review of the advanced urban flood models and emerging approaches for predicting urban surface water flooding driven by intense rainfall. The study explores the advantages and limitations of existing model types, highlights the most recent advances, and identifies major challenges. Issues of model complexities, scale effects, and computational efficiency are also analysed. The results will inform scientists, engineers, and decision-makers of the latest developments and guide the model selection based on desired objectives.

Urban Infrastructures & Environmental Risk in Medieval England	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY			English	Article						Urbanism; infrastructure; environment; city walls; bridges; harbours		Medieval city walls, bridges, and harbours stood at the interface between the worlds of man and nature. Wind, ice, rainwater, scour, tidal flows, littoral drift, erosion, silting, micro-organisms, and the growth of vegetation compromised the integrity of structural fabrics and choked up ditches, rivers, and harbour basins. These 'slow disasters' of incremental degradation were periodically punctuated by 'fast disasters' such as devastating floods or violent gales. To keep their public works from falling into ruin, civic authorities had to devise regular maintenance regimes and tackle intermittent large-scale repairs. Infrastructure sustainability became a particularly acute problem during the late middle ages. Climate change accelerated the intensity and frequency of environmental stressors, while urban populations declined in the wake of the Black Death. Economic disruptions were driving up the costs of building materials and labour while the customary sources of infrastructure incomes were shrinking. The growing mismatch in scale between rising infrastructure costs and falling resources was not just another wobble that could be corrected by a renewed mobilisation of traditional recovery mechanisms.

Attribution of the impacts of the 2008 flooding in Cedar Rapids (Iowa) to anthropogenic forcing	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						attribution; flood; global warming; CESM; Iowa; climate change	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL PRODUCTS; CLIMATE; FRAMEWORK; ENGLAND	The City of Cedar Rapids was significantly affected by the June 2008 flood. However, little is known about the role anthropogenic warming during this event, not only in terms of hydrologic response but also of impacts. Here we use a continuous distributed hydrologic model forced with precipitation with and without external forcing and show that the impacts of this flood were likely magnified because of increased anthropogenic warming; compared to the baseline scenario with the external forcing removed, this event was similar to 1.28-fold larger in flood extent, an approximate 3.4-time larger in the number of affected buildings, and an estimated 5.8- and 7.1-time larger in structural and content damage, respectively. While much of the effort up to this point has focused on the attribution of the physical hazard, our results highlight the cascading increase of the contribution of the external forcing (mainly from anthropogenic forcing) moving from hazard to human impacts.

Following a review of the international scholarly literature, we conduct a mixed-methods approach in Austria, combining an online survey among policy makers and other stakeholders with a thematic analysis of policy documents. The aim is to investigate the practical relevance of socio-demographic change in Austria's NHRM. The study shows that many hazard-prone regions in Austria face population change, in particular demographic ageing and population decline. In addition, our findings from the online survey demonstrate the relevance of population dynamics in NHRM, especially with regard to hazard response and recovery. Nonetheless, policy formulation in NHRM overwhelmingly disregards demographic change as a relevant factor. Accordingly, the study underscores the importance of future-oriented risk management strategies to better account for ongoing and expected socio-demographic changes.

However, laboratory-scale models of urban flooding in street networks are often distorted, i.e. different scale factors are used in the horizontal and vertical directions. This may result in artefacts when transposing the laboratory observations to the prototype scale (e.g. alteration of secondary currents or of the relative importance of frictional resistance). The magnitude of such artefacts was not studied in the past for the specific case of urban flooding. Here, we present a preliminary assessment of these artefacts based on the reanalysis of two recent experimental datasets related to flooding of a group of buildings and of an entire urban district, respectively. The results reveal that, in the tested configurations, the influence of model distortion on the upscaled values of water depths and discharges are both of the order of 10 %. This research contributes to the advancement of our knowledge of small-scale physical processes involved in urban flooding, which are either explicitly modelled or parametrized in urban hydrology models.

J	Berezowski, T; Wassen, M				Berezowski, Tomasz; Wassen, Martin			Using water sources extent during inundation as a reliable predictor for vegetation zonation in a natural wetland floodplain	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Wetlands; Inundation; Vegetation zonation; Water sources; Machine learning; Climate change	SPECIES RICHNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER; PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; DRIVERS; MODEL; ZONE; FEN; AVAILABILITY	Distinctive zones of inundation water during floods were shown to originate from different sources in some major floodplains around the world. Recent research showed that the zonation of water in rivers and floodplains is related to vegetation patterns. In spite of this, water source zones were not used for vegetation modeling due to difficulties in their delineation. In this study, we used simulation results of a fully-coupled groundwater-surface water integrated hydrological model (IHM) HydroGeoSphere and the Hydraulic Mixing-Cell method to provide standard hydrological predictors (e.g. water depth, inundation length, groundwater depth, exchange flux) and the extent of inundation zones having a certain water source (discharged groundwater, river, rainfall, and snowmelt). These variables were used to train a vegetation model for the lower Biebrza floodplain (about 290 km2) using vegetation maps from 1960, 1980, and 2000. We used a one-at-a-time (OAT) approach, where each map was validated based on a model trained on the remaining two maps to obtain realistic error estimates. We also used a fractional approach in which a fraction of each map was used for training and validation. The single model from the fractional approach was used to assess the importance of predictors and to predict vegetation for the 20th century and for the 21st century using IHM simulation forced by the Twentieth Century Reanalysis data and EURO-CORDEX RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 model ensembles. The model which used both water sources extent and standard predictors performed the best overall and was sensitive to the future trends. The extent of river water within the inundation area was by far the most important vegetation predictor. The models that neither used the water sources extent predictors nor the exchange flux were not able to predict the trends of areas covered by certain vegetation types under future climate. The advantage of the water sources extent predictors was their ability to represent the spatial effect of local hydrological phenomena. This was not possible with the standard predictors, because they show only the source of the phenomena (e.g. groundwater discharge zone), but do not indicate the actual area affected by its physical and chemical properties, which is more relevant for vegetation development. Our results highlight the relevance of using water extent predictors due to their ability to explain spatiotemporal ecological processes, such as vegetation development. We suggest to use water extent predictors in modelling for developing more accurate decision support for wetland floodplains.

Environmental controls over Holocene carbon accumulation in <i>Distichia muscoides</i>-dominated peatlands in the eastern Andes of Colombia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Article						Peatlands; Climate change; Paramo; Distichia muscoides; Carbon; Andes	INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE; WESTERN CORDILLERA; TROPICAL ANDES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIERRA-NEVADA; SOUTH-AMERICA; PEAT; DYNAMICS; LIMITS; AGE	The long-term carbon (C) and vegetation dynamics of tropical, high-Andean cushion peatlands are poorly understood. Here, we present radiocarbon-dated paleoecological records and modern microclimate data from high-elevation peatlands currently dominated by the cushion plant Distichia muscoides in the paramo (alpine tundra) of the eastern Colombian Andes. Focusing on a well-dated 4300-year-old peat core collected at 4194 m elevation from the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, we investigated the response of peatland vegetation to hydroclimate changes and environmental controls on C accumulation. In addition, we carried out a regional synthesis of existing C accumulation data from northern Andean peatlands to place our new results in broad geographic and temporal context over the last 17,000 years. Our results show that the current Distichia-dominated peatlands are a recent landscape feature on El Cocuy occurring only during the last similar to 250 years. The Distichia peatlands have extremely high sediment accumulation rates of up to 1 cm yr(-1) and C accumulation rates between 183.7 and 849.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1), decreasing with the elevation of a site. These rates far exceed an expected modern C accumulation rate of 110 g C m(-2) yr(-1), calculated by extrapolating an exponential function from a late Holocene average C accumulation rate of 48.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the northern Andes. This suggests that recent Distichia establishment represents an acceleration of C accumulation at a rate higher than expected from decomposition-related autogenic effects. Before the modern climate warming period, our record indicates that Distichia cushions have only grown intermittently, often after the peatland was flooded with mineral sediments. Mineral sediment deposits at 3290, 2590, 1620, 930, and 860 cal. yr BP correspond with wet intervals from lake-derived records of hydroclimate change in the northern Andes and indicate increases in precipitation and subsequent in-wash of mineral sediments. However, within the last 150 years, mineral sediment deposition has increased in frequency, likely due to warming-induced melting of permanent snow and ice mobilizing exposed fluvio-glacial sediments. Increased mineral nutrients, rising temperatures, and strong diurnal temperature contrast in the tropical mountains may explain the rapid C accumulation rates. Taken together, we show that Andean peatlands have experienced the largest shift in vegetation and C accumulation rates in the last 250 years than at any other time during the last 4000 years.

Due to global climate change, rising temperatures are causing changes in global air circulation patterns. Therefore, more extreme drought and flood events will happen in the future. Xerophytic shrubs are the main vegetation types of dryland ecosystems and are expected to be sensitive to changes in rainfall, which would inevitably affect the stability of the ecosystem. We conducted field experiments to simulate the effects of rainfall on Artemisia ordosica Krasch annual net primary productivity (ANPP) and allocation in the Mu Us Desert in northern China. This study examined six different rainfall levels: natural rainfall level (control); natural rainfall level reduced by 30%, 50%, and 70% (-30%, -50%, -70% treatment); and natural rainfall level increased by 30% and 50% (+30%, +50% treatment). The plant height, cover/volume, size/number of vegetative and reproductive twigs, and dry weight of vegetative and reproductive twigs were measured. The results showed the following: (1) Twig size and number are more sensitive to rainfall changes than the cover/volume of this species. (2) Rainfall has a significant influence on shrub ANPP (maximum ANPP was reached at + 30% treatment, and the minimum value was reached at -70% treatment). (3) With the increase or decrease of rainfall, A. ordosica number of twigs increased, and the length became shorter. (4) Rainfall had a significant effect on ANPP allocation (vegetative growth and reproductive growth). With the increase or decrease of rainfall, vegetative growth and reproductive growth of A. ordosica showed a trade-off strategy. Under the condition of adding rainfall, vegetative twig ANPP increased significantly. Under severe drought stress (-70% treatment), ANPP decreased significantly. Adding or subtracting rainfall caused a significant decrease in the vegetative twig ANPP ratio and a significant increase in the reproduction twig ANPP ratio. Our results highlight the sensitivity of twig size and number as indicators of shrub production estimation and the mechanism underpinning desert shrub ANPP response to global environmental changes.

For this purpose, long-term historical records of rainfall (P). runoff (Q) and other climatic factors were used to investigate hydrological variability and trends in the Tajan River Basin over the period 1969-1998. Actual evaporation (E), rainfall variability index (d), evaporation ratio (CE) and runoff ratio (CQ) were estimated from the available hydroclimatological records. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and nonparametric Sen's slope estimates were performed on the respective time series variables to detect monotonic trend direction and magnitude of change over time. Rainfall variability index showed that 1973 was the wettest year (delta = +2.039) while 1985 was the driest (delta = -1.584). Also. decades 69-78 and 89-98 were recognized as the wettest and driest decades respectively. The gradient of variation of climatological parameters showed that during the study period, all three parameters of rainfall, evaporation and runoff have decreased and the variations of rainfall and evaporation were significant at the 95% level. Investigation of hydrological changes due of dam construction (1999) showed that the amount and annual distribution of discharge were completely different pre and post-dam construction. Discharge decreased in high water months and increased in low water months to meet water supply demands, especially for agriculture. The relationship between temperature and rainfall trends is compared for three stations in Mazandaran Province (Gorgan, Babolsar and Ramsar) from 1956 to 2003 and nine other stations with different statistical periods of 19-36 years. relating trends to northern hemisphere and global trends. Decreases in temperature were accompanied by decreases in rainfall, and vice versa. These trends were not observed in northern hemisphere and world scales, where temperature increases are accompanied by decreases in rainfall. These variations of hydroclimatological parameters show undesirable water resources situations during the statistical periods if the trend continues severe water resource crises.

Habitat specialization predicts demographic response and vulnerability of floodplain birds in Amazonia	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; comparative demography; dam impacts; habitat affinities; quaternary; ultra-conserved elements	EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS	The annual flooding cycle of Amazonian rivers sustains the largest floodplains on Earth, which harbour a unique bird community. Recent studies suggest that habitat specialization drove different patterns of population structure and gene flow in floodplain birds. However, the lack of a direct estimate of habitat affinity prevents a proper test of its effects on population histories. In this work, we used occurrence data, satellite images and genomic data (ultra-conserved elements) from 24 bird species specialized on a variety of seasonally flooded environments to classify habitat affinities and test its influence on evolutionary histories of Amazonian floodplain birds. We demonstrate that birds with higher specialization in river islands and dynamic environments have gone through more recent demographic expansion and currently have less genetic diversity than floodplain generalist birds. Our results indicate that there is an intrinsic relationship between habitat affinity and environmental dynamics, influencing patterns of population structure, demographic history and genetic diversity. Within the floodplains, historical landscape changes have had more severe impacts on island specialists, making them more vulnerable to current and future anthropogenic changes, as those imposed by hydroelectric dams in the Amazon Basin.

Evidence and mechanisms from China's higher education expansion in the late 1990s	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Carbon emission intensity; human capital investment; higher education expansion; climate change mitigation; I25; J24; O13; O44; Q54	EMISSIONS; IMPACT; AWARENESS; BEHAVIOR; POLICY	Exploiting an exogenous shock from a centrally devised, nationwide higher education expansion in China in the late 1990s and followed by a surge in the college-educated labour in job markets in the early 2000s, we use a difference-in-differences strategy and carbon satellite datasets to empirically estimate the impact and mechanisms of increases in human capital investment on carbon emission intensity. We find that the regions with the most human-capital-dependent can experience a larger decline of carbon emission intensity compared with that of regions with the least after the policy entry into force. The college-educated labour with higher social responsibility flooded into the job markets contributes to the low-carbon transformation of economy, by improving the production efficiency and innovation, and in turn promoting the upgrading of industrial structure and decreasing the use of fossil energy. This climate mitigation effect is more profound for the regions that are economically developed but also lack the education resources of university and college.

However, we mostly do not know how the accessibility of life-saving public resources for the elderly population will change under future scenarios. Using Shanghai as a case, this study introduced a new analytical framework to fill this gap. We integrated for the first time models of coastal flooding, local population growth, and medical resource supply-demand estimation. The results show that under an extreme scenario of coastal flooding in the year 2050, in the absence of adaptation, half of the elderly population may be exposed to floods, the supply of medical resources will be seriously insufficient compared to the demand, and the accessibility of emergency medical services will be impaired by flooding. Our methodology can be applied to gain insights for other vulnerable coastal cities, to assist robust decision making about emergency responses to flood risks for elderly populations in an uncertain future.

Changes in tidal water levels contribute to flood risk alongside rain and sea storm events. Unlike the latter, temporal variations in tides may be predicted and their patterns analyzed many years in advance. This paper explains two novel methods for characterizing monthly scale patterns in tidal water level variation: one simple qualitative method with restricted applicability; and another more complex quantitative method with global applicability to areas characterized by mixed, mainly semidiurnal and mixed, mainly diurnal tide regimes (similar to 65% of global oceans). We reveal that in some areas tidal high and low waters are balanced in near symmetrical patterns, while elsewhere tides are skewed towards upper or lower tidal height envelopes. Areas characterized by tidal patterns skewed towards upper envelopes are at heightened risk of extreme event inundations during certain periods each year, event scale risks that will increase with climate changes. Those skewed towards lower tidal envelopes are prone to frequent flooding and are potentially at greater risk of chronic inundation with ongoing mean sea level rise. Our findings and the novel tidal pattern classification approaches offered contribute to understanding the time varying nature of tidal contributions to coastal inundation risks.

We explore their relationships with hydroclimatic variability, expressed as rainfall and snowmelt, and find that hydroclimatic variability alone cannot explain changes in annual maximum flood extent in 75% of the analyzed major river basins worldwide. Considering rainfall and urban area together can explain changes in the annual maximum flood extent in 57% of the basins. Our study emphasizes the importance of understanding the global impacts of human presence on changes in seasonal water dynamics. Increasing annual maximum flood extent over the past 30 years is best explained when the coincident increase in urban areas within floodplains is considered not just changes in hydroclimate, according to a worldwide analysis of major river basins.

J	Chegini, T; Li, HY				Chegini, Taher; Li, Hong-Yi			An algorithm for deriving the topology of belowground urban stormwater networks	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; IMPACTS; MODEL	Belowground urban stormwater networks (BUSNs) are critical for removing excess rainfall from impervious urban areas and preventing or mitigating urban flooding. However, available BUSN data are sparse, preventing the modeling and analysis of urban hydrologic processes at regional and larger scales. We propose a novel algorithm for estimating BUSNs by drawing on concepts from graph theory and existing, extensively available land surface data, such as street network, topography, and land use/land cover. First, we derive the causal relationships between the topology of BUSNs and urban surface features based on graph theory concepts. We then apply the causal relationships and estimate BUSNs using web-service data retrieval, spatial analysis, and high-performance computing techniques. Finally, we validate the derived BUSNs in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, and Baltimore in the US, where real BUSN data are partly available to the public. Results show that our algorithm can effectively capture 59 %-76 % of the topology of real BUSN data, depending on the supporting data quality. This algorithm has promising potential to support large-scale urban hydrologic modeling and future urban drainage system planning.

South Asian countries, that have the highest annual average number of people physically affected by natural hazards mostly by floods. Most popular flood risk areas are urban areas because there is rapid urbanization infrastructure and uncontrolled development. It results in more people being vulnerable to floods than ever before. Pakistan is positioned within a hazard-prone region and is exposed to several kinds of natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, landslides, droughts and floods but still it lacks proper disaster management policies. Floods in Pakistan bring a great destruction both in urban and rural areas. This paper focuses on some of the key benefits that may be achieved in presence of a proper disaster management framework or policies and also it proposes latest technologies to deal with hazards.This paper also demonstrates a simple concept that may be adopted and implemented immediately, that may help to minimize the impact economically, socially and environmentally.

The study analyzed the effects of sponge city projects in Harbin, Quzhou, and Sanya, China. Three LULC scenarios are proposed based on the geodesign framework, and the spatial distribution and quantitative values are simulated by the InVEST NDR model and urban flood model study. By comparing different scenarios, the study proved the current sponge project could improve the water pollutant control capability by 11-18% and the stormwater control capability by 0.4-6.3%. If the city-wide green infrastructure network is introduced with sponge projects, the water pollutant control capability can increase by 9-15% and the stormwater control capability can increase by 0.8-2.9%. These results show that the current sponge projects can improve the city's sustainability and be helpful strategies to fight climate change and global warming.

In addition, it seeks to present a necessary survey method and value calculation method to be reflected on the land value. To this end, GIS spatial analysis was performed using tidal observation data and flooding maps. The analysis of IPCC sea level rise assuming the worst-case scenario (Scenario 1) and the gradual-case scenario (Scenario 2) of the actual measurement data of the Busan Tide Observatory showed that 3.8%-5.5% of the total land in Haeundae-gu will be at risk of flooding within the next 100 years. Particularly, lands with a relatively high value at present are more vulnerable. If the method of calculating flood-prone areas presented in this study is introduced in the Government's Land Characteristic Evaluation and the standard land value for areas expected to be flooded is accurately assessed, then the economic loss and social confusion caused by future sea level rises can be prevented.

Among the major constraints limiting crop production, drought is one of the most important. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) is considered an important economic crop not only for sugar production, but also for ethanol generation, serving as an expandable green alternative to crude oil use. To take advantage of the use of sugarcane as renewable source for bioethanol production, it is important to increase its productivity without increasing land use, which includes cultivation under hostile conditions, such as water-limited environments. Previously, we demonstrated that stress-inducible overexpression of the transcription factor AtDREB2A CA conferred drought tolerance in sugarcane subjected to water deficit under greenhouse conditions. In the present work, the AtDREB2A CA transgenic sugarcane lines were evaluated in the field in two representative seasonally dry regions of Brazil. The results demonstrated that the AtDREB2A CA sugarcane lines presented higher yield and productivity when compared to non-transformed plants under drought, representing a suitable strategy for the development of new drought-tolerant cultivars.

This payment could be applied to mitigate HPP's greatest problems such as water scarcity and reservoir silting. We propose an apportionment proportional to the average water flow provided by each municipality within the HPP's catchment area and the size of the flooded area by its reservoir. The water flow was obtained through the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration for all municipalities in the study area with only 3% difference from the observed water flow in the HPP. As a result of the proposed methodology, the number of benefiting municipalities increased from 41 to 167 in the drainage area of Furnas' HPP, providing financial resources to the upstream municipalities and enabling them to invest in conservation techniques to ensure the maintenance of water resources, promoting social and environmental development, and mitigation of HPP's greatest problems such as water scarcity and reservoir silting.

Detailed summarization is conducted based on four types of regional flood risk assessment methods, including (i) statistical methods, (ii) multi-criteria analysis, (iii) analysis using geographical information system (GIS) and/or remote sensing (RS), and (iv) scenario-based analysis. After reviewing of the existing methods in literatures, a perspective approach of evaluating inundation risk for metro systems is proposed. The proposed approach has the following two characteristics: (i) from regional to local, and (ii) from qualification to quantification. The Guangzhou Metro System is used to demonstrate the application of the perspective methods for flood risk assessment of metro system. The risk prevention procedure uses an iterative cycle that includes risk assessment, precaution, prediction, and technical countermeasures. The integration of GIS, global position system (GPS) and build information modelling (BIM) for development of early warning and risk management systems is recommended to manage the risks of inundation of metro system.

After analyzing the characteristics of extremely heavy rain and flood in 2010 and 2021 at Liqingdian Station in Nanzhao, Henan Province, this thesis determines the return periods of two major floods in 2010 and 2021 by using the flood data of regional survey. The design floods of various schemes are analyzed and calculated, including different flood series and historical flood recurrence periods at Liqingdian Station. According to the results, after the major floods in 2010 and 2021, the design peak flow of each frequency increased by 3.2% to 50.1%, and the design 24-h flood volume increased by 9.4% to 42.2%. The recent major floods have a significant impact on the design flood of Liqingdian Station. Therefore, the analysis and calculation of design flood should be made based on the full use of heavy rain and flood that have occurred and the surrounding survey data to fully demonstrate and determine the design flood.

At the same time, the ongoing shift from mere flood protection to multi-functional flood risk governance calls for increased collaboration among a diversity of actors, typically with varying interests and responsibilities. In this study, we analyze the actor networks unfolding from flood risk management plans to visualize the diversity of roles and connections between actors participating in flood risk management measures. We introduce a new framework for analyzing flood risk management plans and related actor networks using Social Network Analysis and test it in the context of Finland. The framework helps to visualize the diversity of networks for different flood risk management strategies. The analysis also reveals the central roles that different types of actors-including those outside the public sector-occupy in the network. The findings suggest that Social Network Analysis can be used in the context of EU flood risk governance and that flood risk management plans offer an excellent opportunity for comparative governance studies in the EU.

Obstetric care for environmental migrants	IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Review						Climate change; Environmental migration; Migration; Natural disasters; Obstetrics and gynaecology; Pregnancy	AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; BIRTH-WEIGHT; HEALTH; IMPACT; EXPOSURE; STRESS; EARTHQUAKES; WOMEN; FLOOD	BackgroundMigration due to environmental factors is an international crisis affecting many nations globally. Pregnant people are a vulnerable subgroup of migrants.AimThis article explores the potential effects of environmental migration on pregnancy and aims to draw attention to this rising concern.MethodsBased on the study aim, a semi-structured literature review was performed. The following databases were searched: MEDLine (PubMed) and Google Scholar. The search was originally conducted on 31st January 2021 and repeated on 22nd September 2022.ResultsPregnant migrants are at increased risk of mental health disorders, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and maternal mortality. Pregnancies exposed to natural disasters are at risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and mental health morbidity. Along with the health risks, there are additional complex social factors affecting healthcare engagement in this population.ConclusionMaternity healthcare providers are likely to provide care for environmental migrants over the coming years. Environmental disasters and migration as individual factors have complex effects on perinatal health, and environmental migrants may be at risk of specific perinatal complications. Obstetricians and maternity healthcare workers should be aware of these challenges and appreciate the individualised and specialised care that these patients require.

Effects of Drought and Flooding on Phytohormones and Abscisic Acid Gene Expression in Kiwifruit	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						ABA catabolism; ABA synthesis; abiotic stress; Actinidia; biomarkers; hormonal crosstalk; molecular markers; plant hormones; water deficit; waterlogging; water stress	WATER-STRESS; GROWTH; PLANTS	Environmental extremes, such as drought and flooding, are becoming more common with global warming, resulting in significant crop losses. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the plant water stress response, regulated by the abscisic acid (ABA) pathway, is crucial to building resilience to climate change. Potted kiwifruit plants (two cultivars) were exposed to contrasting watering regimes (water logging and no water). Root and leaf tissues were sampled during the experiments to measure phytohormone levels and expression of ABA pathway genes. ABA increased significantly under drought conditions compared with the control and waterlogged plants. ABA-related gene responses were significantly greater in roots than leaves. ABA responsive genes, DREB2 and WRKY40, showed the greatest upregulation in roots with flooding, and the ABA biosynthesis gene, NCED3, with drought. Two ABA-catabolic genes, CYP707A i and ii were able to differentiate the water stress responses, with upregulation in flooding and downregulation in drought. This study has identified molecular markers and shown that water stress extremes induced strong phytohormone/ABA gene responses in the roots, which are the key site of water stress perception, supporting the theory kiwifruit plants regulate ABA to combat water stress.

Impacts included hundreds of deaths, mass-mortalities of marine life, increased wildfires, reduced crop and fruit yields, and river flooding. In late June 2021 a heatwave of unprecedented magnitude impacted the Pacific Northwest region of Canada and the United States. Many locations broke all-time maximum temperature records by more than 5 & DEG;C, and the Canadian national temperature record was broken by 4.6 & DEG;C, with a new record temperature of 49.6 & DEG;C. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of this event and its impacts. Upstream diabatic heating played a key role in the magnitude of this anomaly. Weather forecasts provided advanced notice of the event, while sub-seasonal forecasts showed an increased likelihood of a heat extreme with lead times of 10-20 days. The impacts of this event were catastrophic, including hundreds of attributable deaths across the Pacific Northwest, mass-mortalities of marine life, reduced crop and fruit yields, river flooding from rapid snow and glacier melt, and a substantial increase in wildfires-the latter contributing to landslides in the months following. These impacts provide examples we can learn from and a vivid depiction of how climate change can be so devastating.

This paper analyzes what and how social innovations can nurture risk mitigation public policies to enhance flood resilience in small cities. A mixed-methods approach, which considered a survey with 231 participants (54% women, 45% men, and 1% non-identified) and the facilitation of a seminar with participatory methodologies, was implemented between August and October 2021, engaging municipal secretariats, civil defense, an NGO, schools, and residents of Sao Luiz do Paraitinga, Brazil. Most participants (205 out of 231 surveyed respondents) indicated that floods are the main hazards, and 90% stated that municipal authorities should lead prevention measures prioritizing ten social innovation actions to avoid and reduce the disaster risks. The survey's results were shared during a seminar that included serious gaming activities to identify, discuss and formulate implementation pathways (how, when, with whom, with what resources) for the prioritized social innovation actions. Among the measures are prevention and evacuation plans, which were significantly correlated (0.749), as well as natural areas restoration and conservation plans, risk areas tours, and children and youth engagement in disaster risk reduction.

We integrated satellite-derived surface water data and population genomic diversity from 20,294 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across 344 individuals to understand metapopulation persistence of the desert rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida tatei) in central Australia. Desert rainbowfish showed very small effective population sizes, especially at peripheral populations, and low connectivity between river catchments. Yet, there was no evidence of population-level inbreeding and a signal of possible adaptive divergence associated with aridity was detected. Candidate genes for local adaptation included functions related to environmental cues and stressful conditions. Eco-evolutionary modeling showed that positive selection in refugial subpopulations combined with connectivity during flood periods can enable retention of adaptive diversity. Our study suggests that adaptive variation can be maintained in small populations and integrate with neutral metapopulation processes to allow persistence in the desert.	[Attard, Catherine R.

Flood vulnerability and its influencing factors	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Vulnerability; Flood; Flood vulnerability index; Ordinal response model; Semi-parametric approach	LAKE OUTBURST FLOODS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER RISK; INDEX; NEPAL; IMPACT	Riverine floods are the major weather-related disaster affecting both agriculture production and physical infrastructures in Nepal. Climatic factors aggravated by anthropogenic measures contribute to increasing household-level vulnerability in the country. We use face-to-face interview data collected from 217 households located in the Saptari district of Nepal to understand the household-level vulnerability of farmers impacted by floods. Our model combines variables of household sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and exposure to flooding in an integrated vulnerability index to assess the vulnerability status of households and factors influencing the vulnerabilities. Findings indicate a high vulnerability level of most households stems from higher exposure to flood and lower adaptive capacity. Using the ordinal response model, we find that indicators such as credit access, migration, female-proportion, and perception and familiarity with flood incidences positively influence the vulnerability. However, gender, livestock owned, per capita income, adaptation measures, and distance to water bodies have a negative influence on the vulnerability level. These findings can be used to tailor micro-level policies to minimize the impact of floods in the district. Governmental level effort, such as river control strategy, is needed to minimize the flood risk at a larger scale in the future.

Effects of human demand on conservation planning for biodiversity and ecosystem services	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						ecosystem services; biodiversity; conservation planning; beneficiaries; demand; beneficiarios; biodiversidad; demanda; planeacion de la conservacion; servicios ambientales	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROVISION; FRAMEWORK; CAPACITY; IMPACTS; FORESTS; FUTURE; FLOW	Safeguarding ecosystem services and biodiversity is critical to achieving sustainable development. To date, ecosystem services quantification has focused on the biophysical supply of services with less emphasis on human beneficiaries (i.e., demand). Only when both occur do ecosystems benefit people, but demand may shift ecosystem service priorities toward human-dominated landscapes that support less biodiversity. We quantified how accounting for demand affects the efficiency of conservation in capturing both human benefits and biodiversity by comparing conservation priorities identified with and without accounting for demand. We mapped supply and benefit for 3 ecosystem services (flood mitigation, crop pollination, and nature-based recreation) by adapting existing ecosystem service models to include and exclude factors representing human demand. We then identified conservation priorities for each with the conservation planning program Marxan. Particularly for flood mitigation and crop pollination, supply served as a poor proxy for benefit because demand changed the spatial distribution of ecosystem service provision. Including demand when jointly targeting biodiversity and ecosystem service increased the efficiency of conservation efforts targeting ecosystem services without reducing biodiversity outcomes. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating demand when quantifying ecosystem services for conservation planning.

The reliability analysis takes into account both the changes of hydraulic variables such as water level and wave height due to climate change and the deterioration of structural capacities such as crest freeboard loss and soil seepage length degradation over time. A probabilistic time-dependent semi-Markov process is adopted for estimating the transition probabilities on the basis of available field data through routine inspections and expert judgements. Limit state equations are established for evaluating time-dependent probability of failures associated with wave overtopping through the flood defence crest and piping in the underlying water conductive soils. A multi-objective optimisation method is then employed to find optimum solution space for asset inspection and maintenance by minimising both costs for inspection and annual risk of structural failures. The results for a typical earth sea dyke at Thames Estuary show that the probability of failures associated with wave overtopping and soil piping will increase significantly over time, thus appropriate maintenance strategy is required to reduce the risk caused by changing operating conditions.

Is Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) a Useful Indicator to Forecast Groundwater Droughts? - Insights from a Karst Aquifer	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Edwards Aquifer; droughts; spring discharges; groundwater-level monitoring; climate change; climate index	WATER-LEVEL; MANAGEMENT; SPRINGS; PROPAGATION; DEPLETION; SECURITY; IMPACT; FUTURE; FLOODS; TEXAS	The study sought to understand the relationships between meteorological and groundwater droughts on water levels and spring discharges in Edwards Aquifer, Texas. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)-styled Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI) was used to quantify groundwater droughts. SGI time series signal was delayed and damped, while SPI was volatile. SGI values correlated well with SPI values that were observed five to eight months ago. Dynamic regression models with lagged SPI terms and autoregressive integrated moving average errors indicated a statistically significant yet weak relationship between Lag-1 SPI and SGI. The utility of SPI for groundwater drought forecasting was minimal in this aquifer. Nonseasonal and seasonal autoregressive terms played an important role in forecasting SGI and highlighted the need for long-term, high-resolution monitoring to properly characterize groundwater droughts. Spring flows exhibited stronger and quicker responses to meteorological droughts than changes in storage. In aquifers with spring discharges, groundwater monitoring programs must make efforts to inventory and monitor them. Groundwater drought contingency measures can be initiated using SPI but this indicator is perhaps inappropriate to remove groundwater drought restrictions.	[Uddameri, V.; Singaraju, S.; Hernandez, E.

This article explores how long-term spatial planning and short-term humanitarian responses relate to three facets of uncertainty that are particularly relevant in developmental contexts, namely epistemic uncertainty, ontic uncertainty, and ambiguity. The authors explore these facets through a case study of uncertainty, that of unexpected monsoon floods in 2018 and 2019 in Wayanad, a peri-urban hill district in Kerala, India. Through the case, they show that compounded uncertainty leads to ambiguity in action, but that this ambiguity can be ameliorated by a contextualised contingency planning approach. The authors conclude the article by outlining the approach in spatial planning that prioritises flexible and adaptable decision-making to enhance iterative organisational learning and action, as well as cross-sectoral dialogue to deal with uncertainty.

As a result of a misalignment of land use policies and practices, which have not considered floods hazard sufficiently, the increase in the frequency of floods due to climate change, exposure and vulnerability have increased in last decades. Territorial planning is a key tool to promote preventive risk management, and risk mapping is the key piece for decision making at the different geographical scales of land use planning. This paper presents a systematic multi-scale analysis of risk map treatment in territorial planning instruments at different scales, and analyzes the degree of linkage between them. The analysis has been carried out in two case studies in Spain (Valencian Community and Andalusia). Results show that the use of flood risk mapping continues to pose important challenges, especially in urban planning documents, and in relation to vulnerability assessment.

Hurricane resiliency methods for the New York City electric bus fleet	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Electric buses; Hurricanes; Urban resilience; Disaster planning	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Electric buses help municipalities reduce emissions and improve resident health. However, they require a steady electricity supply and face challenges from electricity network disruptions after natural disasters. This study examines hurricane vulnerability of two New York City electric bus routes. We use electricity loss and flooding scenarios to determine the critical element of NYC's electric bus infrastructure: on-street fast chargers, not overnight depot chargers. This conclusion applies for both routes, despite differences in route length, charging pattern, and battery size. Applying existing infrastructure and cost analyses, we conclude that temporary flood barriers around on-street chargers used with diesel generators and solar panels are strong resiliency methods. Additionally, considering flood projections in charger site choices can avoid unexpected costs. These findings are a departure from previous disaster planning focused on centralized bus facilities. As cities work towards fully electric bus fleets, this study and similar analyses can inform transportation resiliency spending.

Despite the benefits, researchers have only begun to examine if known decision-making frameworks apply to severe weather-related decisions. Using experiments, we found that a hyperbolic discounting function accurately described participant decisions to prepare for, and respond to, severe weather, although only delays of 1 month or longer significantly changed decisions to evacuate, suggesting that severe weather that is not imminent does not affect evacuation decisions. In contrast, the probability that a storm would impact the participant influenced evacuation and resource allocation decisions. To influence people's evacuation decisions, weather forecasters and community planners should focus on disseminating probabilistic information when focusing on short-term weather threats (e.g., hurricanes); delay information appears to affect people's evacuation decision only for longer-term threats, which may hold promise for climate change warnings.

This paper helps to address this knowledge gap by illuminating the role of perception, action and decision-making in the everyday. Using an innovative walking methodology, it presents an empirical case study of regularised farmers' movements in and out of a floodplain during the rainy season in central Mozambique to show how people's dayto-day routes are continuously reproduced through meaningful encounters and engagements with physical obstacles and other people. The paper demonstrates how a concern with everyday mobility highlights people's dayto-day capacities to respond to environmental variability and change while also drawing attention to the challenges associated with the gradual accumulation of risk in mobile, rural livelihoods.

We argue that retrospective voters punish only opposition incumbents (candidates in office but not aligned with the government leader), who have limited access to government resources for relief, for natural disasters. We use monthly data on precipitation and evaporation to capture droughts and floods in India's four thousand State Assembly electoral constituencies over the years 1977-2007. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that Members of State Assembly from the party of the Prime or Chief Minister do not face an electoral backlash under bad weather conditions during the monsoon season, whereas opposition politicians face major losses.

As a country with a rapidly developing economy and substantial population, Bangladesh confronts unique challenges due to its extensive floodplains and 720 km-long Bay of Bengal coastline. This study uses nighttime light data to investigate the demographic repercussions and potential disruptions to economic clusters arising from land inundation attributable to SLR in the Bay of Bengal. By using geographical information system (GIS)-based bathtub modeling, this research scrutinizes potential risk zones under three selected shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios. The analysis anticipates that between 0.8 and 2.8 thousand km(2) of land may be inundated according to the present elevation profile, affecting 0.5-2.8 million people in Bangladesh by 2150. Moreover, artificial neural network (ANN)-based cellular automata modeling is used to determine economic clusters at risk from SLR impacts. These findings emphasize the urgency for land planners to incorporate modeling and sea inundation projections to tackle the inherent uncertainty in SLR estimations and devise effective coastal flooding mitigation strategies. This study provides valuable insights for policy development and long-term planning in coastal regions, especially for areas with a limited availability of relevant data.

Improving urban flood resilience is one of main ways to deal with flooding. This study established an urban rainstorm and flood resilience model to sort out the behavioral mechanisms of multiple subjects (government, flood control department, residents and media) and the internal action mechanisms from different dimensions (economic, social, natural, infrastructure and information) of urban rainstorm and flood resilience using system dynamics approach, and to investigate the urban rainstorm and flood resilience in Xi'an city. The results show that the damage losses rate reduced by 44.44%, 10.8%, 9.48% and 3.37% by improving flood resilience, resident engagement, government attention degree and information construction level, respectively. The degree of improvement of urban rainstorm and flood resilience varied for six development scenarios when predict flood resilience. The development pattern can be divided into the beginning phase, preparation phase and development phase, and three improvement strategies are proposed based on the development pattern of flood resilience. This study helps to provide refined strategies for urban rainstorm and flood resilience assessment construction.

Yet, the risk of flooding may not always be known to house buyers before purchase. In this paper, we estimate the immaterial cost of flood risk from coastal flooding using the hedonic house price approach. The analysis is based on a rich house price dataset that identifies flooded houses using insurance data. The design of the insurance mechanism makes it possible to separate material and immaterial damage as all houses are insured independently of the flood risk. Applying a difference-in-differences design, we study the effect of changes in flood risk information, namely the publication of flood maps, and a flood event in Denmark in 2013. By estimating a time-variant house price function, we can infer the welfare implications of non-marginal changes in flood-risk perception. We find that households have a maximum WTP of 21% of the house price to avoid being flooded after a flood event and that this effect diminishes over time. Houses located in a flood risk zone are sold with an 8.4% price discount but controlling for inundation removes the impact of the flood map.

Global warming will significantly affect the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation and further affect the spatio-temporal pattern of disaster-causing risk of extreme precipitation. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal trends of extreme precipitation and projects its disaster-causing risk under different climate scenarios in the Yangtze River Basin from 2021 to 2100. The results indicate that the extreme precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin shows an increasing trend in the future. Annual precipitation (PRCPTOT) increases by 33.05-42.56% under five scenarios compared with the historical period. The future change in heavy precipitation (R95p) also shows a significant increase, but heavy rain days (R50) and 5-day maximum precipitation (RX5day) decrease. The disaster-causing risk of extreme precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin is mainly Levels III and IV, accounting for 57.23-65.99% of the total basin area. The area with Level V is mainly distributed in the Poyang Lake Basin and the lower main stream of the Yangtze River. Moreover, the changes in disaster-causing risk of extreme precipitation are mainly manifested in the decrease of areas with low risk (Levels I and II) and the increase of areas with medium risk (Levels III and IV) in different periods.

In the case of the Hunter Valley Region of Australia, a key sustainable development issue is climate change-induced flooding. The localization and mainstreaming of SDG 13 on climate action can support tangible municipal climate actions in the Region. However, while it is acknowledged that SDG localization is needed to address sustainable development challenges, there is a gap in research and practice to guide local government attempts at SDG localization. This research analyzes literature on SDG localization to understand strategies, challenges and gaps that can inform localization approaches for the Hunter Valley. An analysis of the literature revealed that the implementation of SDG 13 at the local government level is a sparsely researched area, and in practice, efforts to implement SDG 13 have not been publicly communicated. Research-based recommendations for SDG 13 localization are presented to highlight the potential of integrating SDGs into pre-existing local policy so that the SDGs and their targets can support climate action and decrease disaster risk of future floods in Hunter Valley communities.

Numerical modelling of a flash-flood event at Periban de Ramos, Michoacan (Mexico)	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Flash flood hazard; FLO-2D; Numerical modeling; Tancitaro volcano; Mexico	TANCITARO; RAINFALL; FLO-2D; FLOWS	During the afternoon of 23 September 2018, a flash flood event occurred at Periban de Ramos (Michoacan, Mexico). This event was triggered by 2-h precipitation of 58mm, affecting at least 100 families, damaging 30 houses and killing 8 people. We present the first assessment of this event, for which we carried out stratigraphic descriptions, took sedimentological samples of the deposits and performed numerical simulations with the FLO-2D model to recreate the flow. Our results present a good fit with the flow heights, velocities, and the distribution of the flood zones observed in the field. We additionally performed a flood hazard assessment based on a rainfall frequency analysis for extreme events of 2-h duration at different return periods. Results show that even the 2-year event would reach flow depths >5m and velocities exceeding 6.5m/s, causing the overspill of Cutio river, affecting similar to 1500 inhabitants and avocado farming lands, causing a bigger impact on the population's incomes and their way of life. We consider that these types of events could become more frequent and of major magnitude due to the change in land cover and land use, obstruction of natural drainages and changes in precipitation patterns in response to climate change.

Water Balance in Alpine Catchments by Sentinel Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						groundwater storage; Sentinel data; alpine catchment; evapotranspiration; snow water equivalent; water balance	ENERGY-BALANCE; GROUNDWATER STORAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; UNCERTAINTY; RESOLUTION; MODEL; EQUIVALENT; RUNOFF; FLUX	A comprehensive and reliable water balance of snow-dominated alpine catchments is required for a holistic analysis of the hydrological and hydrogeological processes. A major limitation to the elaboration of this balance in alpine terrain is the difficulty of data acquisition as well as the limited presence of meteorological stations. Remotely sensed data can provide valuable information for the water balance assessment on a regional scale. We exploited Sentinel-satellite data to estimate the groundwater storage for one hydrologic year in an extensive Alpine catchment located in northern Italy by means of the residual water balance approach. In particular, Evapotranspiration (ET) and Snow Water Equivalent were estimated with the combined use of Sentinel data, at a spatial resolution of 20 and 30 m, respectively. The results show that the adopted satellite-based methods allow obtaining consistent and physically realistic values to describe the groundwater storage dynamics. In the period 2018-2020, a positive storage occurred only during the snowmelt period and the overall storage was negative, leading to a net lowering of the groundwater level in the floodplain. In addition, the influence of physiographic parameters (altitude, slope, and aspect) and seasonality on the estimates of ET and snow-depth were investigated.	[Perico, R.; Frattini, P.; Crosta, G.

J	Gaborit, P				Gaborit, Pascaline			Climate adaptation to Multi-Hazard climate related risks in ten Indonesian Cities: Ambitions and challenges	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate Adaptation; Cities; Local Coping Strategies; Urban Resilience; Disaster Preparedness; Decentralization; Adaptive Planning; Social Impacts		Indonesian coastal cities are faced with a double imperative to urbanize quickly and to adapt to climate-related disasters. These disasters include droughts, storms, regular floods, tidal waves, and water pollution. This article investigates how ten small- and medium-sized coastal cities in Indonesia are developing resilience strategies to cope with disaster risks. It approaches their level of exposure, the current impacts of climate change, and the existing, local resilience strategies or response. It identifies key discussion points related to the implementation and the feasibility of these strategies. We argue in this article that the priorities are severalfold, and that local governments are increasingly faced with trade-offs when selecting specific interventions and neighborhoods or districts to prioritize to the detriment of others. The current coping strategies seem insufficient to reduce, respond to, and recover from climate-related impacts as well as address the question of vulnerabilities. The population in the coastal areas and in informal settlements, mainly the poor population, is more directly exposed to these climate-related hazards. The local research highlights the difficulties of multi-stakeholder cooperation, the inevitable trade-offs or difficult choices, and the lack of adequate instruments in climate adaptation. Finally, this article calls for more specific timely research on climate adaptation in cities.

This paper presents a method to assess the urban resilience to flooding in terms of the recovery rate of different subdistricts in a city using all-weather synthetic aperture radar imagery (i.e., Sentinel-1A imagery). The factors that influence resilience, and their relative importance, are then determined through principal component analysis. Jakarta, a flood-prone city in Indonesia, is selected as a case study. The resilience of 42 subdistricts in Jakarta, with their gross domestic product data super-resolved using nighttime-light satellite images, was assessed. The association between resilience levels and influencing factors, such as topology, mixtures of religion, and points-of-interest density, were subsequently derived. Topographic factors, such as elevation (coefficient = 0.3784) and slope (coefficient = 0.1079), were found to have the strongest positive influence on flood recovery, whereas population density (coefficient = -0.1774) a negative effect. These findings provide evidence for policymakers to make more pertinent strategies to improve flood resilience, especially in subdistricts with lower resilience levels.

J	Wu, F; Guo, NL; Kumar, P; Niu, LL				Wu, Feng; Guo, Naliang; Kumar, Pankaj; Niu, Lulu			Scenario-based extreme flood risk analysis of Xiong'an New Area in northern China	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						different return periods scenarios; flood risk; hydrodynamic model; inundation extent; Xiong&apos; an New Area		Weather disasters, with floods amongst the most destructive, are increasingly being correlated with climate change. Flood warning measures, for which accurate simulation of flood evolution processes is required, are crucial to avoid human and economic losses. Xiong'an New Area was developed as a hub in northern China, implying an influx of residents and increased economic activity. However, this area is located downstream of the Baiyangdian Lake Basin; therefore, evaluating the flood risk here is vital. We applied a hydrodynamic model in our study and, to simulate the flood inundation process, we employed terrain spatial resolution; we calibrated and validated the model parameters using AnXin hydrological observation data. The results showed a relative water-level error of 5.25%, indicating our model was largely reliable. We calculated the annual exceedance probability of peak discharge against the magnitude and frequency of historical flood-peak streamflow in the basin. We simulated the flood submerged area under three scenarios, that is, return periods of 10, 50, and 100 years, and compared the effects of floods under these scenarios against the urban development planning of Xiong'an New Area. Our results provide practical guidance for flood control planning and crucial insight for urban planning in Xiong'an New Area.

A total of nine rainfall indices at eight stations with at least 72-year daily records are used to characterize annual rainfall regime. The generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) is adopted for dynamically detecting evolution of probability distributions of these indices. The results indicate that alterations of annual rainfall regime are spatial diverse and no prevalent distributional changes are observed. Approximate half indices (35/72) exhibit stationarity and WRR (wet-season rainfall ratio) is the least-affected index since only two stations (Sunmoon Lake and Chengkung) revealing nonstationarity. On the contrary, PRCPTOT (annual total rainfall), SDII (simple daily intensity index), and ADD (annual dry days) are high-affected indices due to 75% of stations exhibiting nonstationarity. Highly affected stations include Taipei, Hengchun, and Dawu because two (WRR and CRX (maximum consecutive rainfall)), one (WRR), and one (WRR) indices classified as stationarity, respectively. Taichung and Sunmoon Lake are least-affected stations since 7 out of 9 indices revealing stationarity. These facts indicate that annual rainfall regime of central-west Taiwan is less affected, and north and southeastern regions are change-prone regions.

Climate adaptation for rural water and sanitation systems in the Solomon Islands: A community scale systems model for decision support	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water resource management; Bayesian belief network; Pacific Islands; Small island developing states; Climate change; Rainwater harvesting	QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; PACIFIC REGION; GROUNDWATER; CHALLENGES; ACCESS; KENYA; GHANA; SUSTAINABILITY	Delivering water and sanitation services are challenging in data poor rural settings in developing countries. In this paper we develop a Bayesian Belief Network model that supports decision making to increase the availability of safe drinking water in five flood-prone rural communities in the Solomon Islands. We collected quantitative household survey data and qualitative cultural and environmental knowledge through community focus group discussions. We combined these data to develop our model, which simulates the state of eight water sources and ten sanitation types and how they are affected by season and extreme events. We identify how climate and current practices can threaten the availability of drinking water for remote communities. Modelling of climate and intervention scenarios indicate that water security could be best enhanced through increased rainwater harvesting (assuming proper installation and maintenance). These findings highlight how a systems model can identify links between and improve understanding of water and sanitation, community behaviour, and the impacts of extreme events. The resultant BBN provides a tool for decision support to enhance opportunities for climate resilient water and sanitation service provision. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the world continues to warm, climate hazards are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. The impacts of extreme events will also be more severe due to the increased exposure (growing population and development) and vulnerability (aging infrastructure) of human settlements. Climate models attribute part of the projected increases in the intensity and frequency of natural disasters to anthropogenic emissions and changes in land use and land cover. Here, we review the impacts, historical and projected changes, and theoretical research gaps of key extreme events (heat waves, droughts, wildfires, precipitation, and flooding). We also highlight the need to improve our understanding of the dependence between individual and interrelated climate extremes because anthropogenic-induced warming increases the risk of not only individual climate extremes but also compound (co-occurring) and cascading hazards. Climate hazards are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in a warming world. Anthropogenic-induced warming increases the risk of compound and cascading hazards. We need to improve our understanding of causes and drivers of compound and cascading hazards.

Yet, the impacts of the flood events on the physics and biology of fjords is still unknown. Current velocities, density, in-situ zooplankton samples, and volume backscatter (S-v) derived from an acoustic profiler were used to explore the response of circulation and zooplankton abundance in a Patagonian fjord to GLOF events in 2010 and 2014. Maximum S-v was found both during the GLOFs and in late winter to early spring of 2010 and the fall and summer of 2014. The increase in S-v in late winter and spring of 2010 corresponded to multiple zooplankton species found from in-situ net sampling. In addition, diel vertical migrations were found during this seasonal increase both qualitatively and in a spectral analysis. Concurrently with zooplankton increases, wind forcing produced a deepening of the pycnocline. Zooplankton abundance peaked in the fjord when the pycnocline depth deepened due to wind forcing and throughout the entire spring season, indicating that mixing conditions could favor secondary production. These results were corroborated by the 2014 data, which indicate that weather events in the region impact both fjord physics and ecology.

J	Fan, XZ; Matsumoto, T				Fan, Xuezhou; Matsumoto, Toru			GIS-Based Social Cost-Benefit Analysis on Integrated Urban Water Management in China: A Case Study of Sponge City in Harbin	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						integrated urban water management; sponge city; social cost and benefit; GIS; life cycle	GREEN ROOFS; CONSTRUCTION; REDUCTION	Climate change along with industrialization or urbanization, which uses materials with low water permeability and is accompanied by change in urban land use, are major reasons for frequent urban floods in many Chinese cities. Moreover, upgrading the drainage system can have numerous negative environmental impacts on the city, especially in districts with dense population and buildings. A new integrated urban water management (IUWM) strategy implemented in China, "sponge city," has gained significant attention in recent years. In this study, a novel framework is built to analyze the effectiveness of sponge city by 3D simulating urban inundation results and performing a cost-benefit analysis. Construction and maintenance fees are included in the costs list, and carbon reduction, air quality improvement, rainwater harvesting, and reduction of flood risk are included under benefits. The district of Nangang in Harbin city in Northeast China was chosen as a case study area. Finally, we conclude that the maximum precipitation of 49.82 mm/h by sponge city can bring the inundation depth below a target depth in the target area. Further, though the sponge city project is not effective from a private perspective, it is effective from a social perspective.

Moreover, flooding has gender based impacts on welfare. These differing impacts create a gender based flood risk resilience gap. We study the intangible impacts of flood risk on the subjective well-being of residents in central Vietnam. The measurement of intangible impacts through subjective well-being is a growing field within flood risk research. We find an initial drop in welfare through subjective well-being across genders when a flood is experienced. Male respondents tended to recover their welfare losses by around 80% within 5 years while female respondents were associated with a welfare recovery of around 70%. A monetization of the impacts floods have on an individual's subjective well-being shows that for the average female respondent, between 41% to 86% of annual income would be required to compensate subjective well-being losses after 5 years of experiencing a flood. The corresponding value for males is 30% to 57% of annual income. This shows that the intangible impacts of flood risk are important (across genders) and need to be integrated into flood (or climate) risk assessments to develop more socially appropriate risk management strategies.

This study sheds light on the modeling of water temperature indices (metrics) that describe critical thermal maxima of the Atlantic salmon (salmo salar). These thermal metrics include MaxWaterTmax (interannual mean of maximum summer temperature), MaxNumDay (interannual mean of the number of consecutive days with maximum water temperature > 25 degrees C and minimum water temperature > 20 degrees C). The latter is an important indicator to evaluate thermal variability. Three other parameters of a Gaussian function fitted to the interannual daily mean temperatures characterizing the thermal regime of 146 stations located in Eastern Canada were estimated. These three parameters are Gaussian_a (maximum of interannual daily mean temperature), Gaussian_b (mean duration of the warm period), and Gaussian_c (date of occurrence of the interannual maximum temperature). The classical Multiple linear regression model (MLR) and the non-linear Generalized additive model (GAM) were tested and compared to estimate the five thermal metrics. The regression-based approaches involve the identification of thermally homogeneous regions based on three approaches: hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), regions of influence (ROI) as well as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Then, the regional MLR and GAM models were applied within the delineated homogenous regions. Also, the regional models were compared to models encompassing all stations (i.e., one region). For each regional estimation model and each thermal metric, a set of optimal explanatory variables were selected using a forward stepwise procedure. The database consisted of 22 environmental predictors related to physiography, topography, climate, land cover and surface deposits. To assess performance of the models, the following statistical metrics were used: coefficient of determination R2, root mean square error (RMSE), bias, relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and percent bias (PBias). The results demonstrate that the non-linear GAM model was consistently better than the simpler MLR model for estimating the five thermal metrics. Results also show that the best practice consists in delineating homogeneous regions before applying the regional GAM model. According to all performance criteria, delineation of regions with the HCA approach is considered to be more flexible and to lead to better performances than neighborhood-based approaches (CCA and ROI).

The validated Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5.1) was employed to assess the effectiveness of LID-BMPs in mitigating runoff volume. The hydrological model was calibrated and validated with nine in-site measured flood hydrographs. 11 LID-BMP scenarios were planned to determine the most effective combination of LID-BMPs. The results showed that according to the site conditions, Infiltration Trench (IT) and Rain Barrel (RB) practices with 22.2% and 0.4% reduction rates had the highest and lowest efficiency in reducing urban runoff. By assessing various combinations of LID-BMPs, it was found that the combination of IT, Bio-Retention (BR), Stormwater Dry Ponds (SDP), Porous Pavement (PP), and Rain Garden (RG) provides the most effective strategy for runoff management. Despite the high efficiency of LID-BMPs in reducing runoff, they are not able to completely handle the consequences of urbanization.

As this review highlights, however, hazard mitigation by tidal wetlands is limited to certain conditions, and not all hazards are equally reduced. Tidal wetlands are effective in attenuating short-period storm-induced waves, but long-period storm surges, which elevate sea levels up to several meters for up to more than a day, are attenuated less effectively, or in some cases not at all, depending on storm conditions, wetland properties, and larger-scale coastal landscape geometry. Wetlands often limit erosion, but storm damage to vegetation (especially mangrove trees) can be substantial, and recovery may take several years. Longer-term wetland persistence can be compromised when combined with other stressors, such as climate change and human disturbances. Due to these uncertainties, nature-based coastal defense projects need to adopt adaptive management strategies.

Changing temporal volatility of precipitation extremes due to global warming	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						clustering; extremal index; extremes; fractional poisson process; waiting time; precipitation volatility	STOCHASTIC WEATHER GENERATOR; LOW-FREQUENCY; TROPICAL CYCLONES; VARIABILITY; MORTALITY; PATTERN; REGIMES; TRENDS; FLOOD; RISK	It is of utmost importance to understand how precipitation extremes change due to global warming. Here, we examine the volatility of precipitation extremes by analysing the waiting time distribution between events and the clustering of precipitation extremes. For this we use the ERA5 reanalysis data and high-resolution simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We find significant evidence for a power-law distribution of waiting times between precipitation extremes and of serial clustering of precipitation extremes. This suggests that precipitation extremes do not occur independently from each other. This is in contrast with previous studies which typically assume that precipitation extreme events occur independently from each other. CESM reproduces these properties well. The climate change simulations show that the waiting times between precipitation extremes become shorter and that at the same time the clustering of precipitation extremes increases. Hence, global warming affects the temporal characteristics of precipitation extremes and, thus, precipitation extremes will become more volatile.	[Franzke, Christian L.

In this regard, alongside the vast psychological literature on mitigation behaviors, there is a lack of research on psychological constraints related to adaptation infrastructures. To fill this gap, we investigated the role of attitudes toward such measures and their antecedents on risk perception. Based on the Solution Aversion Model, Study 1 (n = 194) showed that the more participants oppose the adaptation measures, the less they perceive the risk of flooding. Extending Study 1, Study 2 (n = 95) provided evidence that distrust in science predicts people's dislike and aversion toward adaptive measures, which in turn predicts the perception of hydrogeological risk. Finally, Study 3 (n = 250) revealed that for participants with a lower level of prior knowledge about adaptation measures, the lack of trust in science predicts more negative attitudes toward adaptation, which is associated with lower risk perception.

J	Ncube, T; Chipfakacha, R				Ncube, Tomy; Chipfakacha, Raymond			On crossroads between the right to shelter and looming chances of displacement: Charting towards a resilient and sustainable framework for rural dwellers in flood-prone areas	DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA			English	Article						Disaster-induced displacements; internally displaced persons; indigenous knowledge systems; political commitment; poverty; resilience		Flood-induced displacements are a common feature in rural Zimbabwe and there seems to be a lack of deliberate policy and political commitment from the government. Several factors have increased the susceptibility of communities to flood hazards, ranging from poor housing structures, lack of building standards to ensure resilient structures, and climate change. This paper is an outcome of a one-year study from March 2018 to March 2019. The study adopted a qualitative approach which entailed the use of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Fifty participants were purposively sampled for the study. Study findings reflect a gap in political attention as a root to addressing internal displacement. Lack of social and economic capital also plays an attributional role as a factor that has exacerbated the plight of internally displaced persons. The study recommends the government to adopt an Internally Displaced Persons policy and establish a commission that monitors rural settlement structures to enhance community resilience.

A case in point is a sequence of flood and heatwave within a week, which slows recovery and amplifies damages. We show that across China, floods and heatwaves seldom occurred serially within seven days in the past, but after 2000 the probability is five-to-ten times higher in southern, northwestern and northeastern sectors. It is the significant increase in heatwaves that alters the clustering of independent extremes, and facilitates the emergence of sequential extremes. Typhoon-participating sequential extremes have also increased significantly in frequency in both inland and coastal areas, with the fastest rate at around 200% decade(-1) registered within the 30-35 degrees N latitudinal band. The observed increases in sequential flood-heatwave events are discernibly stronger and more widespread than what would be expected from pure random variability, implying a detectable role of anthropogenic forcings.

Such extreme water events, along with normal rainfall-experienced as certain gain-pose environmental dilemmas. In three studies across five countries, we examined the impact of outcome uncertainty on choices in environmental dilemmas. Cooperation was lowest in certain loss (droughts) and higher in certain gain (normal rainfall) in Study 1, a qualitative field study in Argentina. These results were experimentally replicated in the U.S. in Study 2. Study 3 empirically examined cooperative choice in India, Japan, Spain, and the U.S., replicating patterns for drought and normal rainfall. When the outcome was uncertain (floods), however, culture appeared to moderate cooperation. Two levels of trust (global and local) were also considered. Local trust was a significant predictor of cooperation. Potential mechanisms, and implications are discussed.	[Arora, Poonam; Hoeller, M.

To better understand the range of relationships between precipitation extremes and floods, we analyzed annual precipitation extremes and flood events over the contiguous United States from 1980 to 2014. A low correlation (less than 0.2) between changes in precipitation extremes and changes in floods was found, attributable to a small fraction of co-occurrence. The covariation between precipitation extremes and floods is also substantially low, with a majority of catchments having a coefficient of determination of less than 0.5, even among the catchments with a relatively high fraction of annual maxima precipitation that can be linked to floods. The findings indicate a need for more investigations into causal mechanisms driving a nonlinear response of floods to intensified precipitation extremes in a warming climate.

Extreme Runoff Generation From Atmospheric River Driven Snowmelt During the 2017 Oroville Dam Spillways Incident	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						snowmelt; atmospheric rivers; Oroville Dam; climate change; rain-on-snow; flooding	RAIN-ON-SNOW; SIERRA-NEVADA; WATER EQUIVALENT; PACIFIC-OCEAN; WEST-COAST; CALIFORNIA; PRECIPITATION; SCALE; SENSITIVITY; NORTHERN	In February 2017, a 5-day sequence of atmospheric river storms in California, USA, resulted in extreme inflows to Lake Oroville, the state's second-largest reservoir. Damage to the reservoir's spillway infrastructure necessitated evacuation of 188,000 people; subsequent infrastructure repairs cost $1 billion. We assess the atmospheric conditions, snowmelt, and runoff against major historical events. The event generated exceptional runoff volumes (second largest in a 30-yr record) partially at odds with the event precipitation totals (ninth largest). We explain the discrepancy with observed record melt of deep antecedent snowpack, heavy rainfall extending to unusually high elevations, and high water vapor transport during the atmospheric river storms. An analysis of distributed snow water equivalent indicates that snowmelt increased water available for runoff watershed-wide by 37% (25-52% at 90% confidence). The results highlight potential threats to public safety and infrastructure associated with a warmer and more variable climate.	[Henn, Brian; Ralph, F.

The HAZUS-MH coastal flood hazard modeling and loss estimation tool are used to determine flood extent and depth and corresponding monetary losses to buildings associated with different sea water levels (SWLs). The frequency of SWLs is estimated using a nonstationary mixture normal-generalized Pareto distribution under current condition and future SLR scenarios. Also, the least adaptation level to cope with SLR-induced amplification of coastal flooding is assessed in terms of an increase in flood threshold. The results indicate that under current sea-level conditions, coastal flood risks are predominantly from exposure to acute extreme events. However, chronic risks from repetitive nonextreme flooding may exceed those from extreme floods under future SLR scenarios. Therefore, adaptation strategies may incorporate consideration about chronic flooding to avoid increasing cumulative losses under future SLR scenarios.

Here, marine sediments recovered from the Northwest Borneo Trough are analyzed to trace variations in terrigenous material composition associated with sea level and palaeoflood activities over the past 40 ka. We describe for the first time the influence of sea level change on terrigenous deposition from a tropical island with small mountainous rivers surrounded by narrow continental shelves and the coupling between North Atlantic dynamics and climate feedbacks in tropical Southeast Asia during the Dansgaard-Oeschger stadials. This study demonstrates that climate oscillations occurring at high northern latitudes can be transmitted to tropical Southeast Asia through the functions of sea level, the East Asian winter monsoon and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Such information is fundamental to correctly assessing future sea level rise and flood risks in tropical Southeast Asia. Sea level rise and extreme climate events are two global climate issues currently faced by humanity under the background of global warming. However, the climate feedbacks in tropical Southeast Asia remain unknown, although portions of this region are now densely populated. Here, a gravity core retrieved from the Northwest (NW) Borneo Trough is employed to reveal variations in terrigenous material composition and their controlling factors over the past 40 ka. We found that the terrigenous sediments delivered to the NW Borneo Trough are primarily sourced from NW Borneo, and their deposition is mainly controlled by sea level change and flooding. Further in-depth analysis reveals that northern high-latitude cooling could cause floods in NW Borneo both in the modern and during the past by influencing the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and/or the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Furthermore, our new records suggest that a stronger EAWM during cold stadials could have transported high levels of northerly moisture to NW Borneo, resulting in relatively higher speleothem delta 18O values in NW Borneo. In short, abrupt climate changes in the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere can be transmitted to tropical Southeast Asia through the functions of sea level, the EAWM and the ITCZ. Sea level change and flooding are the main controlling factors for terrigenous deposition from tropical Southeast AsiaNorthern high-latitude cooling could lead to the outbreak of floods in Northwest Borneo via atmospheric teleconnectionClimate oscillations occurring at high northern latitudes can be transmitted to tropical Southeast Asia	[Huang, Jie; Wan, Shiming; Chang, Fengming; Yang, Zaibao; Sun, Hanjie; Ma, Xiaochuan; Li, Anchun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianxing; Li, Tiegang] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Geol & Metallogeny, Qingdao, Peoples R China	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources	Huang, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Geol & Environm, Qingdao, Peoples R China.	huangjie@qdio.ac.cn	Liu, Jianxing/C-6153-2017; wan, shi ming/B-4735-2011	Liu, Jianxing/0000-0002-2201-3887; Jianxing, Liu/0000-0001-8180-1683; wan, shi ming/0000-0001-9335-2248	Laoshan Laboratory Fund; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB40010100]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFF0800503]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2020MD067];  [LSKJ202204205]	Laoshan Laboratory Fund; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); 	We acknowledge the captains and crews of KE XUE YI HAO for their support and help during the SCS Survey Cruise in 2012.

Compounding effects from permafrost degradation and drainage network development within the rock glacier initiated the complex process chain. The debris flow dammed the main river of the valley, impounding a water volume of 120 000 m3 that was partly drained by excavation to prevent a potentially catastrophic outburst flood. We present a systematic analysis of destabilizing factors to deduce the failure mechanism. The identification and evaluation of individual factors reveals a critical combination of topographical and sedimentological disposition, climate, and weather patterns driving the evolution of a thermokarst drainage network. Progressively changing groundwater flow and storage patterns within the frozen sediment accumulation governed the slope stability of the rock glacier front. Our results demonstrate the hazard potential of active rock glaciers due to their large amount of mobilizable sediment, dynamically changing internal structure, thermokarst lake development, and substantial water flow along a rapidly evolving channel network.

Here we proposed a dynamical diagnostic of Extreme Sea Level (ESL) events in the Venice lagoon by using two indicators based on combining extreme value theory and dynamical systems: the instantaneous dimension and the inverse persistence. We show that the latter allows us to localize ESL events with respect to sea level fluctuations around the astronomical tide, while the former informs us on the role of active processes across the lagoon and specifically on the constructive interference of atmospheric contributions with the astronomical tide. We further examined the capability of the MoSE (Experimental Electromechanical Module), a safeguarding system recently put into operation, in mitigating extreme flooding events in relation with the values of the two dynamical indicators. We show that the MoSE acts on the inverse persistence in reducing/controlling the amplitude of sea level fluctuation and provide a valuable support for mitigating ESL events if operating, in a full operational mode, at least several hours before the occurrence an event.

Measures taken to reduce these losses or damages stemming from extreme events typically depend on how effective they are in reducing the consequences of having either too much or too little water and for longer periods of time. To identify trade-offs between the annual estimated loss or damage reduction, i.e., the benefits, however measured, and the average annual cost of various damage reduction measures, one can perform risk-cost analyses. Because of climate change, the likelihoods of future hydrologic extremes are both changing and uncertain. Also uncertain are any estimates of future damages that would occur given any specific extreme event. In addition, one cannot be certain of the future costs or benefits of damage reduction measures. This paper outlines a range of practical approaches for identifying these trade-offs, taking into account the uncertainties associated with future damages resulting from any specific flood or drought event, the changing uncertainties of future flood and drought events, and the uncertainty of future damage mitigation costs.

Case studies presented in the papers exploit a wide range of innovative techniques for hydrological extremes analyses. The papers focus on six topics: Historical changes in hydrological extremes, projected changes in hydrological extremes, downscaling of hydrological extremes, early warning and forecasting systems for drought and flood, interconnections of hydrological extremes and applicability of satellite data for hydrological studies.

In cities such as Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, it is the poorest residents who experience the worst impacts from flooding. Yet although the negative effects of floods on drinking water quality are known, there is little empirical evidence on how they affect water access more broadly. This paper uses interviews from Dar es Salaam's Kigogo Ward to understand perceptions of drinking water source changes during floods. It frames these perceptions in the Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to achieve universal and equitable access to water. Results show that households experience flooding both inside and outside the house and that these episodes impact water quality, accessibility, and availability. In particular, floods can increase contamination, force residents to wait to fetch water, and require them to walk through floodwater to reach water sources. Floods also cause them to discard stored drinking water. These results demonstrate the need for additional research on the impacts of floods on water access.

Shifting climate conditions affect recruitment in Midwestern stream trout, but depend on seasonal and spatial context	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis); brown trout (Salmo trutta); climate change; extreme heat; flooding; population trends; recruitment	POPULATION VITAL-RATES; BROOK TROUT; BROWN TROUT; SALMO-TRUTTA; JUVENILE SALMONIDS; THERMAL HABITAT; EXTINCTION RISK; BRIGHT SPOTS; TEMPERATURE; WISCONSIN	Climate change is a complex threat to freshwater ecosystems. Effects on aquatic species will likely differ among populations depending on seasonal and spatial context, which makes a detailed understanding of population responses to shifting climate conditions key to guiding strategic decision-making. However, few empirical studies have tested for such context dependency on distinct populations across seasons or at large spatial scales. We used 26 years of standardized survey data on recreationally and economically important brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Wisconsin, USA to assess short- and long-term variability in population trends, and quantify the influence of seasonal and spatial climate variability (air temperatures and precipitation) on annual recruitment strength (as indexed by young-of-year [YOY] relative abundance in summer). Some short-term population fluctuations were spatially consistent across the state, indicative of broadscale environmental forcing. Over the longer term, average YOY and age 1 and older brook trout relative abundance has declined since 2006, especially for YOY, while brown trout abundance has substantially increased. The effects of climate conditions on recruitment varied by species, season, and latitude. Increasing maximum summer temperatures were associated with lower brook trout recruitment, but higher brown trout recruitment. The effect for both species was stronger at lower latitudes. Spring temperatures were positively related to brown trout recruitment at lower latitudes; in mid-latitude and northern streams, they were related to increasing recruitment up to about 1 standard deviation, above which recruitment declined. High and low winter and spring precipitation were associated with precipitous declines in recruitment for both species. By contrast, summer precipitation was positively related to recruitment in northern streams for brook trout and southern streams for brown trout. Our results demonstrate that shifts in climate can affect recruitment in similar species differently depending on temporal (seasonal) and spatial (warm, southern regions compared with cool, northern regions) context. Given trout population trends in Wisconsin and climate projections for the Midwestern United States, location- and species-specific management actions are needed that account for this context dependency. Management should aim to maximize the resiliency of populations to extreme climate conditions by buffering negative influences on recruitment.

Lower rain fall in some regions and the increasing in the use of water resources by human populations is increasing the number of water bodies experiencing drying processes. Such changes in ecosystem dynamics have direct impacts on biological communities. Here, we investigated the temporal structure of fish assemblage in terra-firme (i.e., non-floodable) streams in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon by sampling over three seasonal cycles (2012, 2013, 2014). The research investigated the temporal dynamics of the ichthyofauna of streams that experienced temporary flow interruption in 2012; using the ichthyofauna of perennial streams (not interrupted by the effects of drought) as controls to determine the effects of flow cessation on the temporal structure of fish assemblages and their recovery after drought. The species composition of perennial streams remained stable over 3 years (2012, 2013, 2014), not differing between the dry and rainy periods. On by contrast, the species composition of the streams that temporarily dried changed after the flow interruption event. Responses to the temporary flow interruption were not uniform among species, with some increasing in abundance after the event while others decreased. The species whose abundance increased immediately after flow interruption tended to return to initial conditions in the third year of sampling, which might be related to low resource availability in those streams. Species whose abundance decreased tended to remain in low abundance, possibly as a result of local/regional rarity of these species, hindering population restoration processes. The dissimilarity in fish assemblage composition (based on the relative abundance of species) between sampling events revealed that the changes caused by the temporary flow interruption were significantly greater than the temporal changes recorded in perennial streams. Overall, the results indicated that intense drought events may alter fish species composition in terra-firme streams and that such changes may persist for some years. Our results also provide evidence that the responses of fish species to flow regime change are not uniform, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the basic biology of fishes to predict the effects of increased climate disturbances more accurately in aquatic communities. Untangling the effects of natural cyclical factors from the effects deriving from unpredictable extreme events is crucial to better predict the impacts of global climate change on the structure of biological communities.

Atmospheric Rivers Increase Future Flood Risk in Western Canada's Largest Pacific River	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							21ST-CENTURY CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRASER-RIVER; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; WATER-RESOURCES; IMPACTS; CMIP5; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; CALIFORNIA	Snow-dominated watersheds are bellwethers of climate change. Hydroclimate projections in such basins often find reductions in annual peak runoff due to decreased snowpack under global warming. British Columbia's Fraser River Basin (FRB) is a large, nival basin with exposure to moisture-laden atmospheric rivers originating in the Pacific Ocean. Landfalling atmospheric rivers over the region in winter are projected to increase in both strength and frequency in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models. We investigate future changes in hydrology and annual peak daily streamflow in the FRB using a hydrologic model driven by a bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (8.5), the FRB evolves toward a nival-pluvial regime featuring an increasing association of extreme rainfall with annual peak daily flow, a doubling in cold season peak discharge, and a decrease in the return period of the largest historical flow, from a 1-in-200-year to 1-in-50-year event by the late 21st century. Plain Language Summary Snow-covered areas of the globe are particularly sensitive to global warming. Future projections using global climate models generally show that as the ratio of snow to rain declines, river flows peak earlier in the year with reduced volume. These models also capture the phenomenon of "atmospheric rivers": long, meandering plumes of water vapor often originating over the tropical oceans that bring sustained, heavy precipitation to the west coasts of North America and northern Europe. The present-day frequency of landfalling atmospheric rivers on the Canadian west coast is projected to increase nearly fourfold by the late 21st century, with a proportionate increase in extreme rainfall events. Our work is the first to directly investigate the impact of these "rivers in the sky" on "rivers on the land" using climate model projections. Focusing on the Fraser River Basin, Canada's largest Pacific watershed, and using a business-as-usual industrial emissions scenario, we show that the basin transitions from one where peak flow results from spring snowmelt to one where peak flow is often caused by extreme rainfall. Our modeling suggests that extreme rainfall events resulting from atmospheric rivers may lead to peak annual floods of historic proportions, and of unprecedented frequency, by the late 21st century in the Fraser River Basin.

The Irrawaddy River (IR) is the largest river in Myanmar and has an important influence on socioeconomic conditions within its watershed and beyond. However, potential changes to the IR's hydrological extremes under a future warming climate remain poorly understood. We reconstructed a 400-yr May-July streamflow time series for the IR using tree-ring cellulose oxygen isotopes (d18O) and compared the variations of the hydrological extremes before and after the onset of global warming. The streamflow reconstruction shows that the IR experienced 65 extreme flood events and 67 extreme drought events during 1617-2017, with 58 extreme drought events occurred after 1850. Extreme drought events in this region have gradually increased and the frequency of extreme droughts has increased significantly since the 1850s. The occurrence of drought events in the last few decades has exceeded the natural variability. Especially, the persistent drought conditions during 2000-2017 are unprecedented compared with the record of the last 400 yr. This increase in drought events is significantly linked to the weakening of the ISM and increasing temperatures, hence the IR may experience more extreme drought events in the future under global warming.

Even with different temporal and spatial scales, these extreme events challenge risk management specially when happening simultaneously, cascadingly or cumulatively over time. However, the number of articles that evaluates the joint occurrence (i.e., interplay) between floods and drought in the same area is still limited in literature. In this sense, this paper aims to evaluate what lessons we can learn from previous studies on both extreme events, and to identify the way forward for understanding floods-droughts interplay and risk reduction in the future. For this, we developed a literature review with articles from 2008 to 2021, aiming mainly to understand the "dual-risks" context internationally (n = 60). Articles are analysed with chronological, descriptive, and geographical factors, methodological aspects, main objectives, and risks interplay. Results show articles still focuses most on the single hazards approach, and when considering the risks interplay, they focus more on risk assessments rather than on assessing the context conditions of communities and their vulnerabilities. This study concludes by discussing the key elements for integrating floods and droughts, including the analysis of local conditions (i.e., social, political, cultural, and physical aspects) vulnerabilities, and the participation of stakeholders.

Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) are an appealing option for stormwater management; however, their hydraulic control capabilities have received little attention. We developed a comparative model-based approach with 24 scenarios to contrast the hydrologic and hydraulic response of a highly discretized (HD) 1D model and a coupled 1D-2D model, considering the impact of rainwater harvesting systems and tree pits. An additional scenario was modeled including attenuation storage tanks, green roofs, and pervious pavements. A heavily urbanized flood-prone catchment with severe land-use constraints in Bogota, Colombia, was selected for analysis. The findings revealed that SUDS can contribute to reducing the number of flooded junctions, overloaded conduits' length, overloading time, nodal inundation depth, and waterlogging extent. Furthermore, the HD 1D model can reproduce the coupled 1D-2D model results in terms of hydrologic response and some hydraulic control indicators. Further research is needed for an accurate description of the internal hydraulic mechanisms of SUDS interacting with overland flow. The key findings of this study provide model-based evidence to support urban stormwater management decision-making in data-scarce environments.

This study investigated the resilience effects of decentralized detention systems to address extreme flooding events in urban areas. An integrated flood resilience measure that integrates the regional performance of sub-basins with a decentralized flood control system was proposed and applied to an urban watershed including five sub-basins. Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis to quantify the hydrologic responses and resilience of the water-shed to flooding scenarios was performed using the Hydrological Modeling System and Geospatial River Analysis System of Hydrological Engineering Centre models. The results identified the best locations of distributed detention ponds and characterized the effects of the decentralization levels of the detention system on enhancing flood resilience to extreme events. Additionally, an increase in the resilience effects of the decentralized detention system was found in the cases of more extreme flooding events from the combined impacts of high-intensity rainfall and land cover change. The findings suggest insights into incorporating decentralization strategies into decision-making on detention systems to resiliently cope with extreme flooding events in urban watersheds.

Plants have developed a variety of defense responses over time to counteract the detrimental effects of biotic and abiotic stresses. However, in order to combat climate change and the deterioration of ecosystems, it will be necessary to promote the use of beneficial bacteria including plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPR) in agricultural ecosystems. PGPR potentially improves nutrient absorption, modulates hormone levels, and/or improves tolerance to abiotic stress factors and plant pathogens. PGPR offers a sustainable replacement for conventional agrochemicals and traditional farming practices by improving plant growth and stress tolerance. In this context, studying the fundamental evolutionary and ecological relationships among plants and their microbiomes is necessary to build vital approaches to strengthen traditional agricultural techniques. Stress-tolerant PGPR can release bioactive substances such as gibberellins and indole acetic acid which participate in mitigating stresses. PGPR could minimize the adverse effect of salinity, drought, heavy metals, floods, and other stresses on plants by inducing antioxidant enzymes, like catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. This review summarizes the current developments in the PGPR-based strategy for tackling biotic and abiotic stresses.

The Carpathian Basin is extremely affected by fast-changing weather conditions during the year. IEW (sometimes referred to as water logging) is formed when, due to limited runoff, infiltration, and evaporation, surplus water remains on the surface or in places where groundwater flowing to lower areas appears on the surface by leaking through porous soil. In this study, eight different machine learning approaches were applied to derive IEW inundations on three different dates in 2021 (23 February, 7 March, 20 March). Index-based approaches are simple and provide relatively good results, but they need to be adapted to specific circumstances for each area and date. With an overall accuracy of 0.98, a Kappa of 0.65, and a QADI score of 0.020, the deep learning method Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) gave the best results, compared to the more traditional machine learning approaches Maximum Likelihood (ML), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) that were evaluated. The CNN-based IEW maps can be used in operational inland excess water control by water management authorities.

Fire and flood: How the Pantanal ant communities respond to multiple disturbances	PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Disturbance interactions; Flood periods; Wetlands; Species richness; Ant species compositiona	MATO-GROSSO; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; REGIMES; FOREST; BRAZIL; ASSEMBLAGES; HYMENOPTERA; FORMICIDAE	Disturbances are key events in ecological systems, strongly impacting biological communities. This study disentangles the effects of a chronic (flood) and acute (fire) disturbance to determine their interactive effects on ant species richness and composition at different temporal scales. For this, we sampled groundd welling ants with pitfall traps on native grasslands in the Pantanal wetland, one of the world's largest floodplains. We sampled ants ten days (short-term), one year (medium-term), and four years (longterm) after fire and at varying elevations (a surrogate for the time that these areas remain flooded). We found that fire was the dominant factor in determining ant community patterns in flooded areas. In the short-term, fire substantially changed species composition and increased species richness. However, these effects decreased at one year and disappeared after four years, demonstrating the ant community'sresilience. Elevation and, consequently, flooding, did not influence any measured parameter, indicatingthat the ant species are adapted to colonize other areas rapidly or survive in such flooded habitats. Our results suggest that Pantanal ant communities can recover from acute fire disturbances after some years. However, increasing fire frequency caused by global climatic changes and recent Brazilian environmental policy misconducts would probably compromise the observed resilience.

An intersectional approach allows for more nuanced analysis of the ways in which multiple identities, social roles, and economic, racial, and other markers of difference influence vulnerability, thus providing a better understanding of situated gender relations and the role of community-based organizations in shaping recovery capacities. A case study of a stormwater development project in Los Platanitos, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, illustrates how social impacts of project-induced displacement are both spatialized and contingent on situated markers of difference, including gender. Women experienced a range of consequences and emotional responses to the project depending on age, marital and property rights status, and location of their demolished homes within the community.

Several frameworks have been proposed to plan such coupled systems, but there is not a comprehensive framework to assess their resilience under diverse failure scenarios and sources of uncer-tainty. This study proposes a framework which considers both technological and operational resilience. Technological resilience has to do with the performance of the system under extreme loads. Operational resilience has to do with the performance and long-term efficiency of the system after structural damage or degradation, using appropriate proba-bility distributions to quantify the likelihood of failures. The proposed framework is based on an optimization and multi-criteria decision-making platform. It improves on previous research, which lacked consideration of uncertainty in resilience over the life span. We also apply the proposed framework to a real-world test case, and find that ina high -density urban area, a coupled system is more cost-effective than GREI alone. Furthermore, decentralized systems with greater flexibility show significantly better technological and operational resilience. The proposed framework can bet -ter support decision-making for planning robust and cost-effective urban drainage systems, particularly in highly urbanized areas.

J	Klongvessa, P; Chotpantarat, S				Klongvessa, Pawee; Chotpantarat, Srilert			Determination of rainfall data for direct runoff prediction in monsoon region: a case study in the Upper Yom basin, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Baseflow; Direct runoff; Discharge; Rainfall; Upper Yom basin	CHAO-PHRAYA RIVER; LAND-USE CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDO-CHINA; VARIABILITY; GENERATION; DISCHARGE; IMPACTS; FLOODS; SEASON	In a monsoon region, flooding is usually caused by heavy rainfall events in conjunction with saturated soil. A hydrograph in the wet season consists of multiple flood waves from periods of direct runoff lying on a wave of seasonal baseflow from groundwater. This study determined which rainfall duration and occurrence time were most correlated with direct runoff in the Upper Yom basin, Thailand. First, correlation coefficients (CCs) between basin discharge and rainfall under various durations throughout wet seasons during 2009-2018 were calculated. The discharges were correlated with 48 h rainfall ending 12 h before. However, the CCs were not very good (0.35-0.60, except in 2011). Therefore, the CCs only during saturated soil periods were calculated and this produced better results (0.50-0.79). Next, the baseflow was removed from the basin discharge to determine the direct runoff. The CCs between direct runoff and rainfall were even better (0.59-0.83). Therefore, after the removal of the unsaturated soil period and the baseflow, the direct runoff could be predicted from the 48 h rainfall that began 60 h before and ended 12 h before. This duration was associated with basin characteristics and overall spatial distribution pattern of rainfall.

Although the wave-reducing capacity of reefs has been associated with wave breaking and friction, studies quantifying the relative contribution by corals are lacking. To fill this gap, a series of experiments was conducted on a trapezoidal artificial reef model with and without fragments of staghorn coral skeletons attached. The experiments were performed at the University of Miami's Surge-Structure-Atmosphere-Interaction (SUSTAIN) Facility, a large-scale wind/wave tank, where the influence of coral skeletons on wave reduction under different wave and depth conditions was quantified through water level and wave measurements before and after the reef model. Coral skeletons reduce wave transmission and increase wave-energy dissipation, with the amount depending on the hydrodynamic conditions and relative geometrical characteristics of the reef. The trapezoidal artificial coral reef model was found to reduce up to 98% of the wave energy with the coral contribution estimated to be up to 56% of the total wave-energy dissipation. Depending on the conditions, coral skeletons can thus enhance significantly, through friction, the wave-reducing capability of a reef.

But all studies differed in soil Si concentration between the control and Si treatments. As amorphous silica (ASi) was recently found to cause a strong increase of water holding capacity and plant available water in soils, a combined effect of soil moisture and plant response due to Si addition was assumed. In this study, the influence of the soil Si content was excluded by using the same Si enriched soil for treatments of two rice lines, lsi1 mutant defective in Si uptake and its wild-type rice. Most plant parameters, such as nutrient contents, biomass, specific leaf area, specific root length, leaf water content and C allocation did not differ significantly between the genotypes neither under flooded conditions, nor under drought conditions. Only photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were slightly higher for the wild type in both drought and flooded treatments. Overall, our data showed that Si accumulation within the plant tissues has only a minor effect on plant performance under drought stress. Hence, existing studies should be reinterpreted in light of the fact that Si additions may increase soil water availability.

However, apart from direct positive effects, such formal insurance schemes can have unintended side effects when insured households lower their contribution to traditional informal arrangements where risk is shared through private monetary support. Using a stylized agent-based model, we assess impacts of microinsurance on the resilience of those smallholders in a social network who cannot afford this financial instrument. We explicitly include the decision behavior regarding informal transfers. We find that the introduction of formal insurance can have negative side effects even if insured households are willing to contribute to informal risk arrangements. However, when many households are simultaneously affected by a shock, e.g. by droughts or floods, formal insurance is a valuable addition to informal risk-sharing. By explicitly taking into account long-term effects of short-term transfer decisions, our study allows to complement existing empirical research. The model results underline that new insurance programs have to be developed in close alignment with established risk-coping instruments. Only then can they be effective without weakening functioning aspects of informal risk management, which could lead to increased poverty.

Extreme conditions (e.g., droughts and floods) threaten both the quantity and quality of power plant water supply as well as disrupt wastewater discharges back to the environment. Changing climate conditions and water use regimes have prompted numerous assessments exploring the growing threat water poses to the electric power industry. However, lacking from public sources are plant-level data potentially important to such assessments. To better understand this data gap, a semi-structured interview approach was employed with a subset of (coal-fired) power plant owners and operators to characterize the modes by which extreme conditions impact their plant's operations and the measures they have implemented to mitigate water related threats. Interviews engaged 69 power plants, characterized by a range of capacities, cooling types, and water sources. Twenty-five unique modes of impact were identified across the 69 plants, with 96% of plants reported taking some deliberate action to mitigate water-related threats; thirty-four different adaptive measures were recorded. Results here are intended to raise awareness for this potentially important data gap, which could influence the accuracy of projections concerning individual power plant operations under extreme climate conditions supporting grid reliability and long-term system planning exercises.

Hypoxia sensing and signaling in the root, as the first organ encountering low oxygen, is therefore crucial for plant survival under flooding. Nitric oxide has been shown to be one of the main players involved in hypoxia signaling through the regulation of ERFVII transcription factors stability. Using SNP as NO donor, we investigated the NO-responsive genes, which showed a significant response to hypoxia. We identified 395 genes being differentially regulated under both hypoxia and SNP-treatment. Among them, 251 genes showed up- or down-regulation under both conditions which were used for further biological analysis. Functional classification of these genes showed that they belong to different biological categories such as primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism (e.g. glycolysis, fermentation, protein and amino acid metabolism), nutrient and metabolites transport, redox homeostasis, hormone metabolism, regulation of transcription as well as response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our data shed light on the NO-mediated gene expression modulation under hypoxia and provides potential targets playing a role in hypoxia tolerance. These genes are interesting candidates for further investigating their role in hypoxia signaling and survival.

The city is located in an active tectonic depression between the tectonic remains of ancient volcanoes and active volcanic centers. This area has been historically affected by earthquakes, volcanic activity, erosion, mass movements, and flooding. The morphology of the area has been changed by human activities, most of the time without any respect to natural processes thus increasing the problems. There are sectors that show subsidence close to Ilopango Caldera that could be connected to diastrophic block tectonic movements connected to post-seismic episodes after 2012 earthquake, and aquifer level changes due effects of climate change and overexploitation of aquifers. These movements may increase the huge problems of erosion and mass wasting through las Canas basin. In addition, after 2017 seismic swarm a horizontal movement was recorded with the satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) in two areas, which reflects the possible movement of faults that crosses the area of study. This type of information provides important data for the decision-making of land, protection and mitigation zones, monitoring of governmental institutions, and for regional planning.

Learning from the micro-level experiences of the poor in the peri-urban areas of Dhaka provides insights on the intersections between physical vulnerability, flood response strategies, and adaptive capacity. Through a convergent mixed method, this study examines the physical vulnerability of residential buildings, flood damages, and local physical responses in three neighborhoods of Eastern Dhaka. Results show that the level of damage to buildings is the most important predictor of physical vulnerability to floods. Buildings that are older than 20 years old and built with natural materials are likely to experience high flood damages compared to buildings that are less than 10 years and constructed with durable materials. The study concludes that in addition to socio-economic interventions, a targeted and people-centered flood management regime that pays attention to age, material composition, and structural quality of houses is necessary to build residents' adaptive capacities and long-term resilience to flooding. This study contributes to the emerging work on grassroots responses to flood vulnerabilities with practical insights for urban planners and disaster management professionals on particular interventions needed to improve the performance of local responses to flood risks and vulnerabilities.

In this paper, generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) was employed to analyze nonstationary frequency of extreme precipitation at subdaily scale. Nonstationary precipitation return periods were estimated using the expected waiting time (EWT) interpretation. A model coupling SWMM and MIKE21 was established, and calibrated and verified by three historical urban floods. Then, it was utilized to simulate urban floods under stationary and nonstationary rainfall conditions with different return periods. The simulated results illustrated that rainfall depth under nonstationarity was greater than that of stationarity when return period was less than 10 years, but the results reversed when the return period was over 20 years. The main variation of rainfall depth occurred within 6 h. The deviation of the maximum water depth was less than 10% for five return levels, and the difference in the longest inundation lengths was 1.2 h for 50-year return period under two assumptions. It may indicate that slight differences of urban flooding were detected between stationary and nonstationary conditions in the study region, which suggested a further study about urban flood under nonstationarity.

This study considers the land use and settlement patterns based on microtopography and flood risks. The influence of the microtopography and alluvial lowland characteristics on the location and development of residential areas in the Kuji River basin, Japan, is a fundamental aspect of historical knowledge. Investigating the relation between the microtopography and the location of antiquities shows that most of the relics dating to or before the third century were situated in the terraces near the lowlands. The development of lowlands near the mainstream of the Kuji River began around the third century. Furthermore, the relation between the microtopography and development of residential areas is investigated using building density as the development indicator. The results confirm the increase in building density in the alluvial surface, proving a history of flood damage and delayed development compared to other regions. This investigation reveals land development in areas, including the former river bed on the mouth of the Kuji River and the flood plain on the margins of the Hitachiota urban distinct, with no confirmed inhabitation before modern times because of elevated flooding risk.

An integrated weather-hydrologic-coastal-stormwater framework to model urban-coastal interactions: City of Hoboken application	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						forecasting and warning; hydrological modelling; storm sewerage; storm surge	CLIMATE-CHANGE; YORK; SYSTEM; IMPLEMENTATION; INUNDATION; FORECAST; IMPACT	This study presents a flood prediction framework that uses multiscale operational models representing meteorological, coastal, hydrologic, and hydraulic stormwater components. A dual-drainage (street-sewer) model forms the framework core and receives inputs from coastal and meteorological models. The framework was tested in a flood-prone area within the City of Hoboken, New Jersey. Hoboken's aging combined sewer system is regularly overwhelmed by rainfall, storm surge, or their combination resulting in nuisance flooding. The utility of the framework was demonstrated by retrospectively forecasting (72-hr horizon) two contrasting extreme flood events, a rainfall dominated event (Hurricane Irene) and a surge dominated event (Hurricane Sandy). The simulations showed that overland flow from storm surge and low-lying topography were major factor in surcharging the sewer system resulting in flooding. This modelling approach captures multiscale interactions and demonstrates the importance of holistically representing short-term stressors in urban-coastal systems. The framework can be run in ensemble mode to account for uncertainty in atmospheric forcing and aid decision making but this option was not explored in this study. Despite the limitations in expanding the dual-drainage domain to the entire city of Hoboken, the study offers interesting perspectives on leveraging existing models and predicting system response to different stressors.

Bottom-up citizen initiatives (BUIs) may bring together governmental bodies with people at risk. Drawing on a screening of existing BUIs in Europe, North America, and Australia and an in-depth analysis of three study sites, this paper maps BUI activities to stages in the risk management cycle and discusses the institutional, relational and social proximity between BUIs and other stakeholders. Flood BUIs often take over roles that the authorities are not willing or able to fulfil. BUIs emerge out of frustration with current risk policies, after a catastrophic flood event, government-initiated engagement projects or targeted funding opportunities. BUIs can take different forms, ranging from oppositional pressure groups, self-help movements for disaster response and recovery, to initiatives formally installed by law. While self-organised BUIs benefit from high proximity to their home communities, formalised BUIs are deeper embedded in existing institutional structures. In order to gain a stronger voice in the risk debate, BUIs need to expand from the local level to catchment areas and exchange expertise and resources in nationwide or cross-border networks. However, BUIs may create parallel political structures that are not democratically legitimised.

An assessment of best practices of extreme weather insurance and directions for a more resilient society	ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Extreme weather; insurance; resilience; climate change adaptation; risk management	DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; FLOOD RISK; MITIGATION; PARTNERSHIPS; RECOVERY; GERMANY	Extreme weather resilience has been defined as being based on three pillars: resistance (the ability to lower impacts), recovery (the ability to bounce back), and adaptive capacity (the ability to learn and improve). These resilience pillars are important both before and after the occurrence of extreme weather events. Extreme weather insurance can influence these pillars of resilience depending on how particular insurance mechanisms are structured. We explore how the lessons learnt from the current best insurance practices can improve resilience to extreme weather events. We employ an extensive inventory of private property and agricultural crop insurance mechanisms to conduct a multi-criteria analysis of insurance market outcomes. We draw conclusions regarding the patterns in the best practice from six European countries to increase resilience. We suggest that requirements to buy a bundle extreme weather event insurance with general insurance packages are strengthened and supported with structures to financing losses through public-private partnerships. Moreover, support for low income households through income vouchers could be provided. Similarly, for the agricultural sector we propose moving towards comprehensive crop yield insurance linked to general agricultural subsidies. In both cases a nationally representative body can coordinate the various stakeholders into acting in concert.	[Hudson, P.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany; [De Ruig, L.

Changes in Tropical Cyclones Undergoing Extratropical Transition in a Warming Climate: Quasi-Idealized Numerical Experiments of North Atlantic Landfalling Events	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						extratropical transition; tropical cyclone; climate change; quasi-idealized simulation	INITIALIZATION; EVOLUTION; MODEL	The current study extends earlier work that demonstrated future extratropical transition (ET) events will feature greater intensity and heavier precipitation to specifically consider potential changes in the impacts of landfalling ET events in a warming climate. A quasi-idealized modeling framework allows comparison of highly similar present-day and future event simulations; the model initial conditions are based on observational composites, increasing representativeness of the results. The future composite ET event features substantially more impactful weather conditions in coastal areas, with heavier precipitation and greater storm intensity. Specifically, a Category 2 present-day storm attained Category 4 Saffir-Simpson intensity in the future simulation and maintained greater intensity throughout the entire life cycle, although the storm undergoes less reintensification during the post-ET process, a result of reduced baroclinic conversion. These findings suggest increased potential for coastal hazards due to stronger tropical cyclone winds and heavier rainfall, leading to more severe coastal flooding and storm surge.

In this study, we applied MCDA to several factors that contribute to flood susceptibility, namely: elevation, slope, groundwater depth, distance to a drainage system, and land use. These criteria were assigned different weights based on their contribution and previous literature and later underwent a sensitivity analysis. The study's results correlate well with recent flooding events, proving the method's efficiency in identifying hotspots. This study is expected to provide a rapid tool to support the decision-making process for future urban expansion, sustainable development, and resilience planning in Qatar.

This paper seeks more clarity in defining different types of extreme storms, and the global distribution of each type. Recent Findings Detailed case studies of specific events over the United States are revealing but the only way to document such occurrences globally is by using radar profiles from the GPM core satellite. Recent results differ somewhat depending on specific definitions and approaches, but they are starting to converge. Summary We demonstrate the global distribution of the similar to 1000 most extreme events of each type over a 5-year period and find that in addition to testing for extreme rain rates and extremely intense convection, we must also differentiate by size. Large rain areas containing extreme rates are exclusively oceanic, small rain areas often have extreme rates over land. The most intense convective cores are almost exclusively over land, regardless of size.

Because of its importance, the determining Tc is an integral step in several studies involving runoff. Thus, this work presents an unprecedented review of the application of Tc in different lines of research involving water resources around the world. In this article, 1252 publications were listed, obtained from seven different databases, published by 2020, that presented the expressions "time of concentration," "runoff" and "watershed." The articles and conference papers obtained in this research were classified into 12 topics. The number of publications per topic and per country was measured and a cluster analysis was developed to verify the similarity of the distribution of topics per country. In addition, 125 equations applied in related publications for the estimation of Tc are also listed.

J	Schumann, EH				Schumann, Eckart H.			Floods, sedimentation and tidal exchanges in the Keurbooms Estuary, South Africa	GEO-MARINE LETTERS			English	Article								The relatively small Keurbooms/Bitou estuarine system on the south coast of South Africa forms a typical bar-built estuary, with a back-barrier lagoon and a barrier dune almost 4-km long. The lagoon is only about 500-m wide, while the barrier dune is not anchored to any substrate and consequently the position of the tidal inlet, or mouth, varies over the whole length of the barrier dune. This study analyses the sedimentary morphology over the years 2006-2019, during which time, three flood events caused substantial changes in the position of the mouth and the structure of the flood-tidal deltas and flow channels. It is found that after each flood the tidal exchanges reached a maximum, decreasing as sand entered the estuary again. The floods caused considerable infrastructural damage, and the sedimentary changes affected the tourism industry which is dependent on stable tourism attractions in the area. With no management changes, it is surmised that future floods will continue the process of dramatic changes in morphology of the estuary, though climate change may exacerbate these effects.

A data collection framework, model construction, and information management must be established to systematically manage information at the city level. This study developed an urban model generation method using detailed attributes within the City Geography Markup Language (CityGML), a standard data schema for 3D representation of cities based on different types of publicly available information within Korea. The generated model was used to develop a method for simulating flooding status, degree of flooding, and level of building damage after heavy rainfall, in Korea. Furthermore, we developed a method to estimate the loss of human life and property damage by combining the results of the flood analysis with the city model. The proposed methodology supports the creation of standard-based models for flood analysis and exhibits strong interoperability for application to different areas of analysis.

Climate-informed hydrologic modeling and policy typology to guide managed aquifer recharge	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							GROUNDWATER GOVERNANCE; SOIL-MOISTURE; FLOOD RISK; PRECIPITATION; CALIFORNIA; EXTREMES; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; INCREASES; SYSTEMS	Y Harvesting floodwaters to recharge depleted groundwater aquifers can simultaneously reduce flood and drought risks and enhance groundwater sustainability. However, deployment of this multibeneficial adaptation option is fundamentally constrained by how much water is available for recharge (WAFR) at present and under future climate change. Here, we develop a climate- informed and policy-relevant framework to quantify WAFR, its uncertainty, and associated policy actions. Despite robust and widespread increases in future projected WAFR in our case study of California (for 56/80% of subbasins in 2070-2099 under RCP4.5/RCP8.5), strong nonlinear interactions between diversion infrastructure and policy uncertainties constrain how much WAFR can be captured. To tap future elevated recharge potential through infrastructure expansion under deep uncertainties, we outline a novel robustness-based policy typology to identify priority areas of investment needs. Our WAFR analysis can inform effective investment decisions to adapt to future climate-fueled drought and flood risk over depleted aquifers, in California and beyond.

In this paper, we investigate the general patterns of organization and structure of interactions in two anuran-parasite networks in the Brazilian Pantanal (seasonally flooded environment) and Atlantic Forest (non-flooded forest). We present theoretical models to test whether the structures of these host-parasite interaction networks are influenced by neutrality, host taxonomy and host body size. Subsequently, we calculated metrics of connectance, nestedness and modularity to characterize the network structure. We demonstrated the structure networks were influenced mainly by body size and taxonomy of the host. Moreover, our results showed that the seasonally flooded environment present networks with higher connectance/nestedness and lower modularity compared to the other environment. The results also suggest that seasonal floods may promote ecological opportunities for new species associations.

This study introduces a hybrid modeling concept for the cosimulation of mesoscale blue-green stormwater systems and conventional urban sewer networks. The hybrid model successfully introduces the retention/detention effects of mesoscale blue-green stormwater systems to the hydraulic dynamics of the sewer network. The cosimulation package was further facilitated with a cost-oriented multiobjective optimization algorithm. The aim of the scalar multiobjective optimization was to minimize the total cost comprising both flooding costs and action costs - both parameters solely representing the financial components of cost - through optimal placement of mesoscale blue-green systems of optimal size. The suggested methodology provides a useful platform for sustainable management of the existing sewer networks in cities from a hydroeconomic perspective.

Exploring the co-occurrence between coastal squeeze and coastal tourism in a changing climate and its consequences	TOURISM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coastal tourism; Coastal squeeze; Climate change; Coastal dunes; Flooding	ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; SEA-LEVEL RISE; BEACH; PROTECTION; EROSION; VULNERABILITY; MITIGATION; SERVICES; VERACRUZ; IMPACTS	"Coastal squeeze" occurs when there is a chronic loss of coastal habitats landward associated with long-term processes such as sea level rise, land subsidence, sediment deficit and the occupation of space by infrastructure. This phenomenon may also affect socioeconomic activities such as tourism. The goal of this study was to explore the co-occurrence of tourism with coastal squeeze and flooding along the coasts of the Mexican Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Caribbean. Our results reveal that thirty percent of the tourist destinations are exposed to flooding; 62% of the total study area had a moderate to severe degree of coastal squeeze and 66% of the hotels are in squeezed beaches. Finally, we found that most tourist destinations undergoing coastal squeeze are in flood-prone sites, placing communities in high-risk conditions. Different alternatives (such as ecosystem-based protection) to overcome this problem are discussed.

It is important to delineate flood prone areas to minimize flood damages and make mitigation plans. Recently, there has been recognition of the need to understand the risk from groundwater flooding caused by the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface. Mapping groundwater flood risk is more challenging compared to river flooding, especially in karst systems, where subsurface preferential flowpaths can affect groundwater flow. We developed a coupled surface-subsurface modelling framework resolving spatial information and hydrologic data to assess the groundwater flood risk at a karstic watershed: Koiliaris River Basin, Greece. The simulated groundwater table was used to delineate groundwater flooding. Modelled results revealed the role of faults in groundwater flooding generation. We anticipate the coupled surface-subsurface approach to be a starting point for more sophisticated flooding risk assessment, including magnitude and temporal duration of groundwater flooding.

J	Frey, K; Ramírez, DRC				Frey, Klaus; Calderon Ramirez, Daniel Ricardo			Multi-level network governance of disaster risks: the case of the Metropolitan Region of the Aburra Valley (Medellin, Colombia)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						disaster risks; multi-level governance; resilience; adaptation; Colombia	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; URBAN ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; VULNERABILITY; RETHINKING; RESILIENCE; CAPACITY; CITIES	Cities have increasingly been confronted with disasters, ranging from earthquakes and storms to floods and landslides. Traditional technocratic top-down approaches have proved inadequate to face disaster risks in urban agglomerations. Thus, expectations have risen that through multi-level governance, metropolitan regions could become more resilient by joining forces across scales and sectors, enabling them to implement adaptation strategies collectively. Under the leadership of the city of Medellin and integrated within the national risk governance system of Colombia, such a governance arrangement has been established in the Metropolitan Area of the Aburra Valley. Applying social network analysis, this paper analyses the institutional relationships within the multi-level risk governance network Red Riesgos. It demonstrates that the effectiveness of multi-level disaster risk governance networks depends primarily on the protagonist role of local governments and on their abilities to involve local communities and citizens and to interact constantly with higher-level authorities in the implementation process.

In the context of global climate change, the assessment of runoff and sediment in response to climate change is of great significance for water and soil conservation, especially in alpine regions such as the Tibetan Plateau with limited availability of long-term observed data. In this study, based on the available records for the period 1980-2018, the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall-related parameters (rainfall and rainfall erosivity (RE)), and their impacts on the runoff-sediment load (SL) process were investigated in the Lhasa River Basin (LRB) by cross-coherence analysis. In addition, the individual and combined effects of other regional environmental factors (e.g., temperature, snow water equivalent (SWE) and vegetation) on runoff and SL were quantitatively identified using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that the changes in rainfall-related parameters experienced an upward trend at a rate of 3.59 mm/decade (rainfall amount) and 46.05 MJ.mm.ha(-1).h(-1)/decade (RE), respectively. The regions with the most obvious increase occurred in downstream of LRB. However, runoff displayed an insignificant decreasing trend, together with increasing water inputs from the wetter climate in the middle and lower reaches. The contrasting SL trends were found in the middle (significantly descending: 5.5 x 10(4) t/decade) and downstream reaches (slightly increasing: 19.27 x 10(4) t/decade). Rainfall-related parameters generally played a positive role in runoff and SL at all hydrological stations, and their action gradually weakened after 2005 despite still being the dominant factor. Other environmental variables, such as vegetation, did not limit runoff but did reduce the SL with an increase in vegetation coverage in the LRB, where large-area vegetation restoration projects were implemented and mainly distributed on the sandy land and floodplain of the lower reach of the basin. Snow, however, had slightly positive promoting effects on runoff and SL under the scenario of SWE reduction with increasing tem-perature. All above-mentioned variables jointly explained 73.9-76.7% and 39.2-52.4% of the total variability in runoff and SL, respectively. These findings provide valuable insights into future studies on water and soil con-servation planning and ecological restoration in cold and high-altitude regions.

To negate the effects of climate change, researchers are trying to find new agricultural production techniques, to save resources without losing yield quality and quantity. A study on Capsicum annuum L. 'Chili-AS Rot' and Capsicum chinense Jacq. 'Naga Morich' chilies, grown under field capacity, deficit irrigation (50% field capacity) and full and half dose of mineral fertilizer in peat soil substrate was conducted. Both cultivars were marked with the stable isotope N-15, to follow nitrogen translocation in chili plants under stress conditions.Results The yield and plant biomass, capsaicin synthase (CS), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and peroxidase (POX), as well as total and individual capsaicinoids were studied. In 'Chili-AS Rot' the deficit irrigation with the full-fertilization (Diff) dose showed the highest yield and fruit number, compared to other treatments. In the 'Naga Morich' cultivar the deficit irrigation and half-fertilization (Dihf), showed the highest yield, fruit number and dry weight of chilies, compared to other treatments. In the cultivar 'Chili-AS Rot', deficit irrigation was found to reduce the utilization of N fertilizer when the plant (leaves, stems, and roots) and fruit were considered. The utilization of nitrogen fertilizer was 60 to 70% under deficit fertilization, regardless of the irrigation treatment. The half dose fertilized plants of 'Chili-AS Rot' had higher CS activity and PAL activity (from 50 to 80%) than fully fertilized plants, with deficit irrigation having about 10% higher enzymatic activity than field-capacity irrigated plants. In 'Naga Morich', irrigation treatment affected lower enzymatic activity than field-capacity irrigated plants.Conclusions The results indicate that deficit irrigation and fertilization can be used to maintain enzymatic activity and thus capsaicinoid content, which could reduce the economic cost of irrigation water and fertilizer. It was confirmed that the yield was better under deficit irrigation and fertilization for the more pungent 'Naga Morich'. The result of the study shows that when water and fertilizer use is reduced by up to 50%, chili yield losses are minimal or non-existent.

J	Singh, M; Cai, X				Singh, Minerva; Cai, Xin			Coastal Flooding Hazard, Exposure, and Readiness of Buildings in Hong Kong in 2080-2100, and the Implications for Real Estate Management	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						coastal flooding; real estate; climate change; Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP); risk assessment	RISK-ASSESSMENT; PLOTTING POSITIONS; REGION	Coastal flooding has been a significant hazard in Hong Kong. Influenced by climate change, extreme coastal flooding events have been frequently observed in the past decades. Nowadays, the real estate sector has increasingly recognized the significance of managing future coastal flooding risks. However, there are few relevant Geographic Information System (GIS)-based assessment tools and studies about future scenarios. Against this background, this study aims to understand the risk and readiness of properties in Hong Kong for future coastal flooding and to reduce the gap in the risk management decision-making process. This study included the return period, sea level rise, tide activity, and storm surge as the main factors for estimating the frequency and magnitude of coastal flooding events. The estimation and other geospatial data were calculated to describe the exposure, hazard, and readiness of every building in Hong Kong. Based on this risk data of buildings, clustering analysis was adopted to create clusters representing different building risk profiles. The results highlight that there will be 16.3% and 24.7% of buildings in Hong Kong exposed to coastal flooding under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 8.5 and SSP 4.5, respectively, and 2.5% of them will have an extremely high hazard level. This study then constructed an indicator-based assessment model for the real estate sector regarding future coastal flooding risks. Classifying the buildings based on characteristics of their risk profile obtained eight clusters, with clusters 1 and 2 having high risk and low readiness, and clusters 7 and 8 having low risk and low to medium readiness. In addition, distinct spatial patterns were found between the clusters that have low and high readiness of green infrastructure. Therefore, recommendations for the policymaker, planner and companies were provided based on their local situation. Specifically, the discussion suggests that although Yuen Long is an area that has a relatively larger number of high-risk buildings, clusters 3 and 4 in Yuen Long have more potential for adopting various loss mitigation measures. However, clusters 5 and 6 in the city center are more recommended to adopt financial tools and small-scale nonstructural improvements.

On all scales, water availability influences biological processes, such as plant growth and (micro-)biological activity, leading to organic matter input, its decomposition and stabilisation. On the other hand, SOC influences soil hydrology via its impact on soil wettability and its structural organisation. Our objectives were to review the mechanisms involved in the complex relationship between water and SOC at different scales and to discuss levers of action to improve its modelling and management. We carried out a systematic review and synthesised the information of 987 articles dealing with SOC sequestration and soil water.At the landscape scale, precipitation levels influence vegetation type and biomass production as well as horizontal and vertical transport, determining SOC stocks and their spatial distribution. At the profile scale, SOC and water both control biological processes including those involved in soil aggregate formation, and organi-sation of soil porosity. Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilisation processes occur at the microscale, where water movement facilitates the co-occurrence of SOM and microorganisms.All these multiscale processes may change the nature and distribution of SOM, leading to promotion or in-hibition not only of biogeochemical cycling but also of the water cycle. Taking into account these mutual feedback mechanisms in mechanistic models requires their representation at multiple scales through developing modelling parameters in particular for microbial processes occurring in the pore space. This could greatly reduce modelling uncertainty and improve our understanding of global carbon cycling.Levers of action to improve soil water status and consequently SOC accrual include irrigation, and use of organic amendments. Sustainable agricultural practices should focus on (1) optimising the management of water resources and (2) choosing crop species adapted to various water levels to maintain and foster SOC sequestration, to adapt to climate change and in particular extreme events, such as drought and flooding.

Hence it is critical to ensure that sub-daily rainfall records are homogeneous, but with a global shift to automated measurement of rainfall, there has been a change in the rainfall recording instrumentation. Although changes in instrumentation should be documented, in many cases this is not the case and station metadata are missing. As result, studies of rainfall patterns, particularly those investigating trends, often cannot report their treatment of possible inhomogeneities and must assume the data is suitable for further analysis.Here, we argue that standard quality assurance methods for checking inhomogeneities in rainfall may not identify a change in the rainfall record due to a change in instrumentation. Through testing (1) an aggregation of rainfall to the coarsest instrument resolution, (2) removal of rainfall below a minimum rainfall depth, (3) removal of rainfall below a minimum accumulation (event) depth, and (4) a combination of the above adjustments, we present recommendations for ensuring sub-daily rainfall is homogenous with minimum alteration to the rainfall record.We assess the proposed methods using the case study of Australia's sub-daily rainfall monitoring network, where, in 1996 the pluviograph network was switched to tipping buckets, creating a large-sample test bed with a known systematic instrumentation change. Our results show that event-based statistics are considerably more sensitive to instrument change than annually aggregated rainfall statistics and hence standard methods for quality assurance may not identify possible inhomogeneities. We suggest an aggregation of the data to the coarsest instrument resolution, with the removal of small rainfall accumulations, can alleviate inhomogeneities for event-based statistics, whereas, for annual statistics, aggregation to the coarsest instrument resolution is sufficient. In the absence of a known instrumentation change, removing rainfall at or below the instrument resolution is also a viable technique for improving rainfall record homogeneity for event-based statistics. These findings will aid future sub-daily rainfall studies by justifying the use of a minimum rainfall or event depth for subsequent analysis.

In particular, the vegetation cover status of lake wetlands has changed. Here, the change in vegetation cover at the estuary of Poyang Lake was monitored, and its influencing factors are studied to elucidate the dynamic change characteristics of vegetation at the inlet of this lake. Flood and water level changes are two of the main factors affecting the evolution of wetland vegetation at the estuary of Poyang Lake. Therefore, Landsat data from 2000 to 2019 were used to study the spatial and temporal variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the vegetation cover area. Theil-Sen Median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall tests were used to study the long-term trend characteristics of NDVI. The response between NDVI and the explanatory variables at the estuary of Poyang Lake was quantified using regression tree analysis to study the regional climate, water level, and flood inundation duration. Results showed the following: (1) Vegetation in a large area of the study area improved significantly from 2000 to 2010 and only slightly from 2010 to 2019, and few areas with slight degradation of vegetation were found. In most of these areas, the vegetation from 2000 to 2010 exhibited a gradual change, from nothing to something, which started around 2004; (2) The main variable that separated the NDVI values was the mean water level in October. When the mean October water level was greater than 14.467 m, the study area was still flooded in October. Thus, the regional value of BestNDVI was approximately 0.3, indicating poor vegetation growth. When the mean water level in October was less than 14.467 m, the elevation of the study area was higher than the water level value, and after the water receded in October, the wetland vegetation exhibited autumn growth in that year. Thus, the vegetation in the study area grew more abundantly. These results could help manage and protect the degraded wetland ecology.

Flood spatial coherence, triggers, and performance in hydrological simulations: large-sample evaluation of four streamflow-calibrated models	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; SURFACE-WATER; RIVER FLOW; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; DEPENDENCE; EXTREMES; RISK	Floods cause extensive damage, especially if they affect large regions. Assessments of current, local, and regional flood hazards and their future changes often involve the use of hydrologic models. A reliable hydrologic model ideally reproduces both local flood characteristics and spatial aspects of flooding under current and future climate conditions. However, uncertainties in simulated floods can be considerable and yield unreliable hazard and climate change impact assessments. This study evaluates the extent to which models calibrated according to standard model calibration metrics such as the widely used Kling-Gupta efficiency are able to capture flood spatial coherence and triggering mechanisms. To highlight challenges related to flood simulations, we investigate how flood timing, magnitude, and spatial variability are represented by an ensemble of hydrological models when calibrated on streamflow using the Kling-Gupta efficiency metric, an increasingly common metric of hydrologic model performance also in flood-related studies. Specifically, we compare how four well-known models (the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, SAC; the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model, HBV; the variable infiltration capacity model, VIC; and the mesoscale hydrologic model, mHM) represent (1) flood characteristics and their spatial patterns and (2) how they translate changes in meteorologic variables that trigger floods into changes in flood magnitudes. Our results show that both the modeling of local and spatial flood characteristics are challenging as models underestimate flood magnitude, and flood timing is not necessarily well captured. They further show that changes in precipitation and temperature are not always well translated to changes in flood flow, which makes local and regional flood hazard assessments even more difficult for future conditions. From a large sample of catchments and with multiple models, we conclude that calibration on the integrated Kling-Gupta metric alone is likely to yield models that have limited reliability in flood hazard assessments, undermining their utility for regional and future change assessments. We underscore that such assessments can be improved by developing flood-focused, multi-objective, and spatial calibration metrics, by improving flood generating process representation through model structure comparisons and by considering uncertainty in precipitation input.

The climate change has a tremendous impact in the Western Ghats, the UNESCO heritage site in India, and has to be studied in detail. Floods are the most common (and among the most deadly) natural disasters bringing heavy destruction in the Western Ghat river basins of India, and the Periyar basin is one among them. The low-lying areas of Periyar river basin (RPLB) is one of the worst affected river basins in the 2018 Kerala floods. Since the basin was continuously monitoring, the groundwater quality has been assessed in Periyar basin during three periods (pre-flood, flood, and post-flood-April, August, and October 2018 respectively) and is described in this paper. Since the water table is shallow in RPLB, floodwaters quickly reach the groundwater table, thus influencing the groundwater quality. So, the groundwater samples were collected from 26 sites in RPLB, and analyzed for quality determining parameters. Parameters like pH, TDS, EC, TH, NH3-, NO2-, HCO3-, SO42-, SiO44-, Mg2+, and K+ decreased during flood compared to pre-flood times. On the other hand, Ca2+, Na, and Cl-, turbidity values were increased during flood times. The values of pH, TDS, EC, turbidity, NH3-, HCO3-, SO42-, SiO44-, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ were slightly increased in post-flood period compared to flood period. When compared to the pre-flood values, turbidity, NH3-, SO42-, Na+, and K+ were slightly increased in post-flood period. It was also observed that pH, TDS, EC, TH, NO2-, Cl-, HCO3-, SiO44-, PO43-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and E. coli values were higher in pre-flood periods compared to the post-flood scenario. Except pH, turbidity, and E. coli, the averages of all other parameters are falling under the recommended drinking quality values of WHO. The pH belongs to acidic nature throughout the study period. The Piper plot indicates the dominance of Ca-Mg-HCO3 type in pre-flood, and mixing of Ca-Mg-HCO3 type in both flood and post-flood periods. The Gibbs plot reveals that the concentration of elements is mainly depending on rock weathering and sub-surface water flow. The USSL plot depicted that the 92-96% of samples are noted as lower salinity and low sodium hazard at the source of C2S1 and C1S1; however, the 4-11% of samples are noted as high salinity but low sodium hazard at a source of C4S1 and C3S1. The Wilcox diagram indicates that the 88-96% of groundwater was found as higher suitability for irrigation during the study periods. Based on GIS based WQI model, out of the 26 samples studied, 69% of wells showed improvement in water quality after flood; meanwhile, 19% well water samples in flood were observed for lower quality compared to pre-flood times and 12% of samples remain unchanged during flood. Though floods are having positive and negative impacts, from this study, it is clear that quality of the groundwater in the RPLB is not severely affected, but they became diluted to permissible limits during flood and post-flood periods except some locations. Since the flood impact studies on groundwater systems are meager, this data from Periyar basin can be used as baseline groundwater reference data for all future flood-related river basin studies and will be very beneficial for the policy and planning needs in the context of climate change. It is high time to establish the baseline data of all river basins of Western Ghats since the normal earth system processes are worse affected by the recurrence of floods which are reporting every year.

The central question of our paper is how frequent floodexperience (FFE) impacts adaptive behavior and self-reported resilience. Theapplied empirical methods are binary logistic and linear regression modelsusing data from a panel dataset including 2462 residents (Germany, state ofSaxony). Four main conclusions from the investigations can be drawn. First,more flood-experienced respondents are statistically significantly morelikely to have taken precautionary measures in the past. Second, FFE has astatistically significant negative impact on self-reported resilience.Third, the impact of FFE on the capacity to recover and the capacity toresist is statistically significantly non-linear. Fourth, putting togetherthese results reveals the paradox of more flood-experienced respondentsbeing better prepared but feeling less resilient at the same time. It can beconcluded that more research is needed to obtain deeper insights into thedrivers behind self-reported resilience and that this study can be seen as apiece of the puzzle, taking frequent flood experience as the primary entrypoint.

The unchecked development has encroached the natural drainage, and the conventional drainage systems are inadequate in handling the augmented hydrological response. To counter this, a variety of approaches with the ability to adjust within the constraints of complex environments by managing surface runoff are being widely investigated and applied worldwide. These can put the flood water to better use, and the ecological balance may get restored. This review discusses recent progress made in the area of Green Infrastructure (GI), modelling tools that help in stormwater management, vulnerability analysis and flood risk assessment. Different ways of handling the problem are summarized through an extensive literature survey.

This study builds on protection motivation theory (PMT) to explore factors that shape Oklahomans' intentions to adjust to induced seismicity using data collected from households (n=866) across 27 counties in Oklahoma that have experienced varying levels of seismic activity resulting from oil and gas exploration. Correlational analyses and structural equation modeling show that several variables not included in the original PMT, such as feelings of dread or negative emotions associated with earthquakes, are important predictors of intentions to adopt hazard adjustments. This study concludes with examining the effect of additional factors on adjustment intentions and risk perceptions that can help guide future earthquake risk management in identifying and taking appropriate actions that will stimulate precautionary behavior of private actors.

Its impact is also visible in Pakistan as routine health services continue to be disrupted. Consequently, thousands of children have emerged as vulnerable in the face of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), which have already started causing outbreaks in the country. Infections with polio and measles have been significantly reported, especially during the last few years. This reemergence of both diseases is posing great challenges for the country at local, national, and global levels. These impacts are being multiplied by the 2022 flooding - called "super floods " - in the country. Hence, relevant stakeholders, such as the Pakistani government and the World Health Organization (WHO), need to revisit the entire vaccination program to address and resolve issues occurring at the management or local levels. It is highly important to pay attention to the context that provides a fertile ground to negatively affect vaccine uptake.

Reviewing literature on urbanization and its implications on urban environment from within the Global South and on sustainable development research and environmental studies, this article discusses eight implications of urbanization-environmental conundrum: pollution, water resource degradation, urban heat island effect, sea level rise and urban flooding, urban sprawl and slum growth, urban agriculture decline, public health deterioration, and urban wetland destruction that question the ontology of urbanization in Global South cities. Drawing on cases from Saudi Arabian cities, findings indicate that sustainable development agenda is skewed towards socio-economic development with limited focus on environmental issues. This situation is threatening the sustainability of rapidly urbanizing cities. The paper proposes a rhizomatic understanding of environmental importance as a roadmap for sustainable and transformative urbanization in Global South. This ontology changes understandings of what sustainable urbanization should be in rapidly growing Global South cities.

One common type of waterway used to gather and transport ground water is the open channel. Most simulations do not account for the physical roughness of the bed, instead using a roughness coefficient. This means that only the turbulent energy content can be modelled whilst physical turbulent eddies and vortices cannot. Furthermore, many past studies assume the free surface is a rigid lid. This could affect the way that turbulent structures near the free surface behave. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation of an open channel with a rough bed and rigid lid are conducted using OpenFOAM. Results show good correlation with experimental tests. It can be visually observed that turbulent structures generated from the rough bed do interact with the free surface and thus a rigid lid is perhaps not a great approximation. This is supported by an apparent decrease in the Reynolds shear stress from the free surface and 30% of the flow depth immediately beneath.

J	Cruz-Bello, GM; Alfie-Cohen, M				Manuel Cruz-Bello, Gustavo; Alfie-Cohen, Miriam			Capturing flood community perceptions for social vulnerability reduction and risk management planning	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Participatory methods; Social vulnerability reduction; Flood risk reduction plans; Collective memory	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PARTICIPATION; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; GIS	Reducing vulnerability is the aim of flood risk management plans, yet their success depends on acceptance and implementation by their community. It is important, then, to study approaches that encourage societal participation in decision-making. The present study combined three participatory methods to capture and understand local knowledge on flood vulnerability reduction in a coastal town in southern Mexico. As a feasibility outcome, we found that these kinds of approaches involving community participation and consultation are attainable and easy to integrate into the local planning processes of vulnerability reduction and flood risk management. On process outcomes, we found that the community is aware of the flood risk given by their spatial location, has taken actions to adapt, and proposed other actions to reduce their vulnerability. We found no quantitative relationship between the levels of flood delimited by the participatory geographic information systems approach and the community's socioeconomic characteristics obtained by the house survey. Still, qualitative analysis of the three methods revealed that the collective memory of experiencing a flood plays a significant role in the measures the population takes to adapt and reduce vulnerability.

CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya; hydroclimatic hazards; risk assessment; monitoring	FLASH-FLOOD; UTTARAKHAND	The large and apparently increasing magnitude of losses of lives and property due to hydroclimatic 2021 Rishiganga and 2013 Kedarnath floods, shows that risk assessment and planning are inadequate. In the Anthropocene, where climate change is a real and present danger, the frequency of such events is likely to increase along with the damage. Based on our present understanding of the hydroclimatic risks in the HKH, we appeal for a more comprehensive plan for improving our understanding and monitoring. The scheme suggests expansion of mapping and assessment of the factors that contribute to risk. Further development of the archives of extreme events as one of the basis for risk assessment, developing real time monitoring of hazard elements such as the potential for lake outbursts and landslides is essential. Artificial intelligence (AI) should be employed to provide early warning. In India a taskforce of the earth scientists, hydrologists, historians and engineers (civil and AI) should be established to chart a course for the creation of this understanding and monitoring. Similar action may be taken up in other HKH countries.

We compared baseline CLSA data collected on Calgary participants during the 6 months prior to and following the flood. Logistic regression models were created to explore whether select psychological outcomes were associated with the flood for participants categorized by evacuation status. Participants living in evacuated communities pre-flood had significantly lower levels of a diagnosed anxiety disorder than non-evacuated communities, which disappeared post-flood. Participants with higher household income were less likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, worse self-rated mental health, and lower life satisfaction post-flood. Living alone reduced and female gender increased levels of perceived functional social support post-flood. Although natural disasters can shape research findings, the scope of the data being collected and the representativeness of impacted groups may challenge the ability to detect subtle impacts.

Incorporating stakeholders' preferences into a multi-criteria framework for planning large-scale Nature-Based Solutions	AMBIO			English	Article						Climate change mitigation; Flood risk reduction; Multi-criteria analysis; Nature-Based Solutions; River basin	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; FLOOD RISK; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; DECISION-MAKING; STORMWATER; MANAGEMENT; ADAPTATION; SELECTION; CRITERIA	Hydro-meteorological risks are a growing issue for societies, economies and environments around the world. An effective, sustainable response to such risks and their future uncertainty requires a paradigm shift in our research and practical efforts. In this respect, Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) offer the potential to achieve a more effective and flexible response to hydro-meteorological risks while also enhancing human well-being and biodiversity. The present paper describes a new methodology that incorporates stakeholders' preferences into a multi-criteria analysis framework, as part of a tool for selecting risk mitigation measures. The methodology has been applied to Tamnava river basin in Serbia and Nangang river basin in Taiwan within the EC-funded RECONECT project. The results highlight the importance of involving stakeholders in the early stages of projects in order to achieve successful implementation of NBSs.

Thomas			A hypothesis-driven framework for resilience analysis of public transport network under compound failure scenarios	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION			English	Article						Hypothesis-driven; Urban flooding; Compound failures; EWM-TOPSIS; Resilience	CENTRALITY	Urban flood risk is becoming a severe issue in most cities and has been a critical global concern of the twenty-first century. Flooding events can trigger significant failures in public transport networks (PTNs) within urban areas. With a growing population in urban areas, demand for transportation increases. Consequently, the dual forces of climate change and rapid urbanization have intensified the size and frequency of floods. Furthermore, the increasing threat of targeted attacks, natural hazards, and compound failures to PTNs has called for an urgent need to improve the resilience of critical lifeline systems. Here, we propose a new synthetic criterion for identifying the critical nodes of PTNs. Additionally, a hypothesis-driven framework for resilience analysis of PTNs against deliberate and compound failures is developed, which we demonstrate on Mass Transit Railway (MTR) in Hong Kong to obtain a quantitative understanding of resilience. Besides, the quantitative comparison of the viability of multiple recovery strategies suggests that the proposed method (EWM - TOPSIS) performs the best for the MTR network to recover after a disruption. Our findings can generalize across urban critical infrastructure systems as well as natural and human systems.

However, besides many additional benefits, such as dams for water supply, irrigation, flood control, recreation, navigation, etc., hydropower generation has a negative impact on the environment. This study aimed to investigate the hydrologic changes in Lithuanian lowland rivers caused by small hydropower plants (HPPs). Thirty-two indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) were studied in 11 rivers downstream of hydropower plants in the post-impact and pre-impact periods. The findings showed that HPPs and reservoirs considerably disturbed the primary flow of river ecosystems downstream. The largest changes in mean IHA values were found for low and high pulse characteristics (up to 57%) and the number of reversals (up to 44%). Only small or no deviations of the timing of annual extreme flows were found. The number of reversals, a low pulse count, and a fall rate were the flow characteristics that fell outside their historical ranges of variability most often. Six (out of 11) hydropower plants were identified that provoked hydrologic alterations of a moderate degree.

Quantifying Nitrous Oxide Emissions in the US Midwest: A Top-Down Study Using High Resolution Airborne In-Situ Observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						agriculture; climate change; flux estimate; Midwest; nitrous oxide; top&#8208; down	NATURAL-GAS PRODUCTION; METHANE EMISSIONS; N2O EMISSIONS; CO2	The densely farmed U.S. Midwest is a prominent source of nitrous oxide (N2O) but top-down and bottom-up N2O emission estimates differ significantly. We quantify Midwest N2O emissions by combining observations from the Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America campaign with model simulations to scale the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). In October 2017, we scaled agricultural EDGAR v4.3.2 and v5.0 emissions by factors of 6.3 and 3.5, respectively, resulting in 0.42 nmol m(-2) s(-1) Midwest N2O emissions. In June/July 2019, a period when extreme flooding was occurring in the Midwest, agricultural scaling factors were 11.4 (v4.3.2) and 9.9 (v5.0), resulting in 1.06 nmol m(-2) s(-1) Midwest emissions. Uncertainties are on the order of 50 %. Agricultural emissions estimated with the process-based model DayCent (Daily version of the CENTURY ecosystem model) were larger than in EDGAR but still substantially smaller than our estimates. The complexity of N2O emissions demands further studies to fully characterize Midwest emissions.

Herein, GIS-based data storage, manipulation, and visualization of environmental attributes and archeological records are among the most intensely applied methods to evaluate human-landscape interaction, movement patterns, and spatial behavior of past societies. Recent land use management and land cover change, however, have largely altered and modified present-day landscapes, which decreases the potential replicability of modern surface conditions to past ecosystem functionalities and the individual human landscape affordances. This article presents a comprehensive multivariate environmental analysis from a regional case study in the Upper Rhine Valley and exemplifies the bias of the archeological record based on modern land use, built-up, and surface change. Two major conclusions can be drawn: modern surfaces are the result of long-term past human landscape development, and the archeological data inherent in the landscape is strongly biased by modern human activity ranges, urban, agricultural and infrastructural development, and the configuration and perception of recent surface management.

Transaction data on Des Moines' housing market from 2000 to 2012 are used to estimate a hedonic property price function for the region. Both difference-in-differences and triple differences techniques with boundary dummies are used to isolate the impact of the 2008 flood. The main results are as follows. First, the price discount effect of pre-flood risk information is reconfirmed; however, it is overestimated when unobservable neighborhood effects are not controlled for. Second, unexpected inundation during the flood also leads to price discounting. Finally, we find a significant rebounding effect for post-flood prices in the 100-year floodplain areas not actually inundated, while there was no significant change in the 100-year floodplains actually inundated. These findings imply that the housing market updates the risk perception of properties when it receives new flood information. Meanwhile, this price change can affect the income distribution by increasing rents in areas in which the poor usually reside, offering policymakers some insights into how to formulate disaster-related policies.

This paper comprehensively considered two major factors of vulnerability of urban flood-bearing and disaster prevention and mitigation (DPAM) capacity and built a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban flood-bearing risks. Secondly, a combined model consisted of composite fuzzy matter-element and entropy weight model was constructed to calculate the comprehensive risk indicator. Finally, the Zhengzhou City was taken as an example, the comprehensive indices of urban flood-bearing risk from 2006 to 2015 were evaluated. The results showed that the comprehensive risk of Zhengzhou City was generally on a slow upward trend, from II level (moderate-risk) in 2006 to III level (secondary high-risk) in 2015, which was mainly due to the mismatch between the rapid development of urbanization and the slow improvement of DPAM capabilities. This paper is expected to provide scientific reference and technical support for urban flood disaster prevention and sponge city construction.

Change point detection of flood events using a functional data framework	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Functional data analysis; Change point detection; Hydrology; Flood	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIME-SERIES; STATIONARITY; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL	Change point detection methods have an important role in many hydrological and hydraulic studies of river basins. These methods are very useful to characterize changes in hydrological regimes and can, therefore, lead to better understanding changes in extreme flows behavior. Flood events are generally characterized by a finite number of characteristics that may not include the entire information available in a discharge time series. The aim of the current work is to present a new approach to detect changes in flood events based on a functional data analysis framework. The use of the functional approach allows taking into account the whole information contained in the discharge time series of flood events. The presented methodology is illustrated on a flood analysis case study, from the province of Quebec, Canada. Obtained results using the proposed approach are consistent with those obtained using a traditional change point method, and demonstrate the capability of the functional framework to simultaneously consider several flood features and, therefore, presenting a comprehensive way for a better exploitation of the information contained in a discharge time series.

Influence of flooding variability on the development of an Amazonian peatland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Amazonia; flooding; palynology; peatlands; vegetation dynamics	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HOLOCENE CLIMATE; FORELAND BASIN; VARZEA FORESTS; POLLEN RECORD; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; CLASSIFICATION; FLOODPLAINS; DISTURBANCE	Peat in the Pastaza-Maranon Foreland Basin (PMFB), northern Peru, forms beneath open wetlands, palm swamps, pole forests and seasonally flooded forests. These vegetation communities may represent different successional stages of peatlands, but the spatiotemporal patterns of peatland development in Amazonia are still poorly understood. We present a new geochemical and palaeoecological record spanning the last c. 4330 years from an open peatland (San Roque, core SAR_T3_03_B). Our results suggest the persistence of predominantly herbaceous vegetation communities at the core site since the start of peat accumulation (c. 3180 cal a bp). Micro-X-ray fluorescence core scanning provides evidence for episodes of fluvially derived minerogenic input and simultaneous increases in flood-tolerant taxa relating to intervals of increased frequency and depth of riverine flooding. The establishment of Mauritia flexuosa palms from around 440 cal a bp coincided with a shift to lower flooding depth and frequency which continues to the present day.

Extreme hydrologic events due to aridity and climate change are shaping human lives and major activities in numerous countries at an unprecedented pace. This study aims to assess flash floods from extreme storm events in an arid catchment using high-resolution data. The study applied two models on the event of a single storm, namely the IHACRES and AHP models. The observed flow was used for models' validation. The average flow output determined with the IHACRES model was approximately 0.47 m(3)/s while the flow output resulting from the AHP model was 0.45 m(3)/s. The efficiency showed that the IHACRES performed better in evaluating extreme events with an average of 0.88 while the AHP model showed an efficiency of 0.68. Nonetheless, the quantitative simulation outputs of both models are likely to have good applicability for simulating single storm events in arid catchments. The validated IHACRES and AHP models offer valuable tools for simulating flash flood. The study's outcomes have implications for flood management policy and infrastructure planning, ensuring a more resilient response to extreme flood events in arid regions globally.

Pluvial floods are on the rise in the changing climate, particularly in increasingly sealed urbanized areas. In this paper, we examine the changes in flood risk in Poland, discussing the mechanisms, observations, projections and variability. Next, we discuss flood risk management in the country, including specific issues related to urban and rural areas and the synergies between flood and drought risk reduction measures. We identify and assess the weaknesses of the existing flood risk management plans in Poland for the first planning period 2016-2021 and for the second planning period 2022-2027. We find the level of implementation of plans in the former period to be very low. Many planned measures do not have much to do with flood risk reduction but are often linked to other objectives, such as inland navigation. The plans contain numerous small measures, which come across as inapt and economically ineffective solutions. We specify policy-relevant recommendations for necessary and urgent actions, which, if undertaken, could considerably reduce flood risk. We also sketch the way ahead for flood risk management in Poland within the timeframe of the implementation of plans for 2022-2027 and the next regular update of plans for 2028-2033.

Although numerical models are widely used for this purpose, they require various types of data and experience to operate the model and often tedious calibration processes. Under the digital revolution, the application of data-driven approaches to predict streamflow has increased in recent decades. In this work, multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models with three different input combinations are developed and assessed for multi-step ahead short-term streamflow predictions, using 14 years of hydrological datasets from the Kulim River catchment, Malaysia. Introducing more precedent streamflow events as predictor improves the performance of these data-driven models, especially in predicting peak streamflow during the high-flow event. The RF model (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE): 0.599-0.962) outperforms the MLR model (NSE: 0.584-0.963) in terms of overall prediction accuracy. However, with the increasing lead-time length, the models' overall prediction accuracy on the arrival time and magnitude of peak streamflow decrease. These findings demonstrate the potential of decision tree-based models, such as RF, for short-term streamflow prediction and offer insights into enhancing the accuracy of these data-driven models.

Among other water resource issues, it recognized the need to enhance data-enriched water management services to support decision making related to drought monitoring, flood warning, tracking and improving sustainable development and monitoring and ameliorating the impacts of climate change. Needs associated with the Strategy's four themes: improved data acquisition for essential water variables, research and product development, interoperability and coordination, and capacity development and decision support, are reviewed. Responses to the recommendations have been undertaken by GEO, led by its Global Water Sustainability (GEOGloWS) initiative which includes NASA contributions, CEOS, and the Global Terrestrial Network for Hydrology (GTN-H). Progress on the themes is reviewed and benefits of these developments for international and US water management are identified. The commentary concludes with a summary of what has been achieved, what remains to be done, and the priority focus areas for implementation in the final year of the Strategy.

The study entails robust statistical analysis of the observed hydroclimatic data (1980-2016) using the standard procedures of trend and abrupt change point detection, flood frequency analysis (FFA), and streamflow drought index (SDI). The coupled impact of rising temperatures (0.024 degrees C/year) and diminishing precipitation (- 5.71 mm/ year) is yielding substantial decreases in the streamflow of the Jhelum basin. The other manifestations of changing climatic regimes are the increasing trends in the spring season (March-May) streamflow and the concurrence of abrupt change points in the streamflow data with climatic variables. The climate change signals are well evident over the hydrological extremes, reflected in an enhanced occurrence of droughts through the latter half of the examined period. Moreover, the flood fre-quency estimates show that the magnitude of the peak discharges about different return periods has increased significantly during 1986-2016 compared to 1956-1985 estimates. The magnitude of 100-year recurrence interval flood has increased by 10.54-79.58% during 1986-2016. The current study calls for the inclusive restructuring of water management practices to offset the impacts of changing hydrological extremes in the basin.	[Ahsan, Shafkat; Bhat, M.

Variability in Phytoplankton Biomass and Community Composition in Corpus Christi Bay, Texas	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Estuary; Low inflow; Phytoplankton; Texas	HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; COASTAL LAGOON; RIVER-ESTUARY; STORMWATER RUNOFF; GALVESTON BAY; NUTRIENT; DYNAMICS; EUTROPHICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; RESPONSES	Corpus Christi Bay is a shallow, wind-driven lagoon located on the semi-arid South Texas coast that has a rapidly urbanizing watershed. Projections indicate that this region will become warmer and drier and will support an increasing urban population over the next several decades. Here, a 27-month field study was undertaken to quantify phytoplankton biovolume, community composition, and relationships with environmental drivers. Phytoplankton biovolume varied unimodally with a peak in biovolume from spring through summer followed by a decline into fall and winter. Phytoplankton growth was related to nutrient availability during the spring and summer, while water temperature and factors affecting flushing were important during the fall and winter. Regions with more restricted circulation patterns (i.e., man-made canals) were found to support higher standing crops of phytoplankton and the occurrence of high biovolume blooms. Diatoms were dominant during the winter and spring, dinoflagellates were dominant during the summer and fall, and picophytoplankton groups were important during spring, summer, and fall. These results suggest that nutrient and physical conditions interact to determine phytoplankton biomass and community composition and contribute to our ability to project potential impacts of future increases in human populations in the watershed, decreasing precipitation due to climate change, and increasing frequency of short-lived flood events.

These natural disasters can lead to severe loss of human lives. Monitoring and early warning may be the most promising ways to reduce the damage caused by natural disasters. Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are new and efficient techniques for establishing monitoring methods. In this study, a new type of monitoring system, employing three types of LPWANs, was introduced. Radio wave propagation tests, monitoring data, and the effect of temperature on the inclination data were explained. The radio wave propagation tests were used to determine the proper locations for the gateway (GW) and sensors that comprise the monitoring system. The system was able to successfully collect the measurement data at each observation site. However, errors were still found in the measurement data for several reasons, such as electrical circuit problems, battery problems, and environmental effects. Moreover, an unstable correlation between temperature and the inclination data was observed. Thus, the moving average filter was applied in order to smooth out the fluctuations in the inclination data. Nonetheless, random noise was still present in the inclination data. It was determined, therefore, that only long-term inclination data trends should be used to predict displacement data.

The View from Jaketown: Considering Variation in the Poverty Point Culture of the Lower Mississippi Valley	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY			English	Article						Poverty Point culture; Lower Mississippi Valley; hunter-gatherers; earthworks; paleoethnobotany; intersite variability; culture history	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOUND; ARCHAEOLOGY; LANDSCAPES; CONTEXT; PLACE; EARTH	Recent research at Jaketown, a Late Archaic earthwork site in the Lower Mississippi Valley, suggests that the culture-historical framework used to interpret Jaketown and contemporary sites in the region obscures differences in practices across sites. As an alternative, we propose a framework focused on variation in material culture, architecture, and foodways between Jaketown and Poverty Point, the regional type site. Our analysis indicates that people used Poverty Point Objects and imported lithics at Jaketown by 4525-4100 cal BP-earlier than elsewhere in the region. By 3450-3350 cal BP, people intensively occupied Jaketown, harvesting a consistent suite of wild plants. Between 3445 and 3270 cal BP, prior to the apex of earthwork construction at Poverty Point, the community at Jaketown built at least two earthworks and multiple post structures before catastrophic flooding sometime after 3300 cal BP buried the Late Archaic landscape under alluvium. These new data lead us to conclude that the archaeological record of the Late Archaic Lower Mississippi Valley does not reflect a uniform regional culture.

Tree planting is gaining momentum as a potential method of natural flood management (NFM) due to its ability to break up soil and increase infiltration and water storage. In this study, a 2.2 km(2) clay-textured area in Warwickshire, England, planted with trees every year from 2006 to 2012 was sampled to investigate how infiltration varies dependent on season and tree proximity and maturity. Infiltration data was collected from 10 and 200 cm away from selected sample trees from November 2019 to August 2021 using a Mini Disk infiltrometer (MDI). The results show that mean infiltration is higher at the 10 cm proximity compared with the 200 cm proximity by 75.87% in winter and 25.19% in summer. Further to this, mean 10 cm infiltration is 192% higher in summer compared with winter, and mean 200 cm infiltration is 310% higher in summer compared with winter. There is little evidence to suggest a relationship between infiltration and tree maturity at the study site.

The yield of maj or crops in Pakistan is badly affected by natural adversaries, which is a source of poverty. It is predicted that the near future food insecurity issue can prevail in Pakistan due to these hazards. Due to climatic and natural hazards, a decline in agricultural productivity affects the farming community, manufacturing, and business sectors through a multiplier effect. The study was designed during 2020 to assess the farmers' perceptions regarding the impact of natural hazards on food crop production in the Rice-Wheat cropping zone of Punjab, Pakistan. Data were collected from 540 farmers using Multistage Random Sampling Technique (MRST). The study ranked natural hazards based on the mean score of the Likert Scale of farmers' perceptions. Food productivity was adversely prone to flood, insect infestation, biological diseases, extreme heat, wind storms in summer, hailstorms, and heatwaves. However, there was a positive impact of humidity on food production. So, appropriate policies should be formulated to mitigate the antagonistic impact of natural hazards on rice-wheat production, ensuring food security via increasing food production (availability) and income (accessibility).

The effects of changing the drainage threshold, water depth, and horizontal resolution were studied in two Iowan regions of around 100 km(2). To assess the uncertainty from rasterized inundation extent maps used as the reference, a regional and community-level evaluation with three distinct water depth estimates was performed for a five-county region in Iowa. An inner zone approach was utilized to demonstrate the uncertainties around the computational boundary of regions. The results reveal that the HAND model's performance depends on the research area's morphological characteristics, even though they are not directly input into the calculation. A good parameter set for one site does not ensure good performance for another. Moreover, the findings suggest that the DEM's resolution should be carefully chosen, as overgeneralization reduces the reliability of forecasts. Finally, the HAND model relies on drainage accumulation to build the simulation network; therefore, the calculation around the region border can introduce uncertainty. The findings of this study provide guidelines for effective model setup, adjustments, and performance improvement for non-rating-curve-based HAND.

Given that glacial lakes have little area compared with background objects, extracting glacial lakes high precisely is still challenging. Recently, U-Net, a deep learning (DL) method, has shown great potential in glacial lake extraction, due to its elaborate encoder-decoder structure and powerful skip connections. However, the skip connections transmit a lot of information irrelevant to glacial lakes from the low-level appearance features to the high-level semantic features, leading to inefficient utilization of the low-level features. In this letter, we propose a normalized difference water index (NDWI) attention U-Net (NAU-Net) for pixel-wise glacial lake segmentation, which utilizes NDWI as a spatial attention to highlight the signals of water regions in low-level feature maps, thereby making the network pay more attention to glacial lakes. Compared with the classical networks and the state-of-the-art non-DL methods, our NAU-Net shows better performance on glacial lake extraction.

Pre-Columbian fire management and control of climate-driven floodwaters over 3,500 years in southwestern Amazonia	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						pre-Colombian Amazon; paleoenvironment; hydrological change; agriculture; landscape domestication	LANDSCAPE MODIFICATION; ASSEMBLAGES; FISHERY; HISTORY; LLANOS; MOJOS; EARTH	In landscapes that support economic and cultural activities, human communities actively manage environments and environmental change at a variety of spatial scales that complicate the effects of continental-scale climate. Here, we demonstrate how hydrological conditions were modified by humans against the backdrop of Holocene climate change in southwestern Amazonia. Paleoecological investigations (phytoliths, charcoal, pollen, diatoms) of two sediment cores extracted from within the same permanent wetland, similar to 22 km apart, show a 1,500-y difference in when the intensification of land use and management occurred, including raised field agriculture, fire regime, and agroforestry. Although rising precipitation is well known during the mid to late Holocene, human actions manipulated climate-driven hydrological changes on the landscape, revealing differing histories of human landscape domestication. Environmental factors are unable to account for local differences without the mediation of human communities that transformed the region to its current savanna/forest/wetland mosaic beginning at least 3,500 y ago. Regional environmental variables did not drive the choices made by farmers and fishers, who shaped these local contexts to better manage resource extraction. The savannas we observe today were created in the post-European period, where their fire regime and structural diversity were shaped by cattle ranching.

An accurate assessment of flood disaster loss has become a key issue. In this study, extreme rainstorm scenarios with 50- and 100-year return periods based on the Chicago rain pattern were designed. The dynamic change process of flood disaster loss was obtained by using a 1D-2D coupled model, Hazard Rating (HR) method, machine learning, and ArcPy script. The results show that under extreme rainstorm events, the direct economic loss and affected population account for about 3% of the total GDP and 16% of the total population, respectively, and built-up land is the main disaster area. In addition, the initial time and the peak time of flood disaster loss increases with an increasing flood hazard degree and decreases with the increase in the return period. The total loss increases with the increase in the return period, and the unit loss decreases with the increase in the return period. Compared with a static assessment, a dynamic assessment can better reveal the development law of flood disaster loss, which has great significance for flood risk management and the mitigation of flood disaster loss.

Social vulnerability analyses typically employ socio-demographic proxy indicators that do not address the risk attitudes, beliefs and agency of those living in areas at risk. To close this gap, this article introduces a range of indicators from psychological risk research. Physical, social and psychological indicators are compared for their influence on vulnerability outcomes such as building damage or emotional distress. Based on survey data of 456 Austrian at-risk households, hierarchical regression models confirm the added value of psychological indicators for measuring vulnerability above and beyond traditional physical and social indicators. Our findings show that psychological indicators are particularly important for explaining health impacts and distress. General intentions for flood preparedness, fear of flooding and self-efficacy are most relevant. For a more holistic view of vulnerability, measurement instruments should incorporate psychological indicators. Disaggregated household-level data is necessary to fully capture the variability between households living in the same flood-prone area. Indicators perform differently depending on the other indicators included, and the considered outcome; therefore, we caution against pooling indicators to composite indices of overall vulnerability.

This study aims to bridge the existing gap in data and knowledge by exploiting satellite observations, and efforts are made to compile and update glacier lake inventories. GLOF susceptibility assessment is evaluated by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multicriteria structured technique based on three susceptibility contributing factors: Geographic, topographic, and climatic. A total of 294 glacial lakes are delineated with a total area of 7.85 +/- 0.31 km(2) for the year 2018. Analysis has identified six glacier lakes as potential GLOF and met the pre-established criteria of damaging GLOFs. The historical background of earlier GLOF events is utilized to validate the anticipated approach and found this method appropriate for first order detection and prioritization of potential GLOFs in Northern Pakistan.

The decision-making of building-level adaptation strategies is a challenging task due to uncertain climate impacts. This study evaluates building-level adaptation strategies through a dynamic programming-based cost-benefit analysis approach to incorporate the latest information of SLR in adaptation decision-making. The adaptation outcomes are estimated by applying a Monte-Carlo method with stochastic flood damage of buildings under four SLR projections. Based on a case study in Bay County, Florida (USA), results indicate that single-family and multi-family buildings are the most vulnerable buildings in Bay County. Mobile homes have a lower flood risk, while they are more sensitive to SLR. The long-term flood damage shows SLR could exponentially increase the average annual flood damage in the community from $17.7 million to $204 million. Investing in adaptive measures can substantially mitigate building-level flood risk, where the adapted average annual damage ranges from $9.57 million to $38.2 million in the county. The proposed adaptation method could facilitate more effective risk communications between the public and private sectors and improvise community adaptation planning under uncertain SLR.

Variations in the Aboveground Phytomass in Northern Eurasia in the 21st Century	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Northern Eurasia; Great Eurasian Natural Massif; aboveground phytomass; carbon equivalent; trends; multispectral survey; modeling; biomes; tundra; forest; steppe		Changes in the phytomass of the ecosystems of Northern Eurasia were traced based on the results of modeling and analysis of multispectral satellite imagery (MODIS archives 2000-2020). It was established that, since the end of the 20th century, an increase in reserves has been noted caused by climate change (an increase in the concentration of CO2, annual mean temperatures, etc.). Application of the GIS-information products based on the MODIS-projective vegetation cover (MODIS/006/MOD44B), evapotranspiration and the thermal field (MOD16A2), and biological production (MOD17A3HGF) allowed us to conduct retrospective modeling of the trend in the aboveground carbon reserves (tC/ha). It was revealed that in the years 2000-2020, a slight trend remained of an increase in the phytomass of forest ecosystems (1.2-6.0%), floodplain, and mountain meadows and shrubs (8.1-9.8%). In the last 17 years, a negative trend has been observed in treeless biomes: -6.0% in tundra, -9.0% in meadow and typical steppes, and -11.3% in deserted steppes. Multidirectional changes in carbon reserves of the aboveground phytomass of biomes, in addition to the internal (succession) and external (climate and anthropogenic transformation: forest felling, landscape fires, etc.) factors, are also due to the synergy of their action.

To efficiently upgrade flood defence systems, insight in costs and benefits of measures at a system level is required throughout the process of planning and design. Due to the size of flood defence systems the number of possible decisions is large, which hampers system optimization. We describe a greedy search algorithm that can find (near-)optimal combinations of reinforcement measures for dike segments. The algorithm has been validated by comparing results for 2800 different dike segments to an integer programming implementation. The difference in objective value (Total Cost) is only 0.04% on average, which is small compared to other uncertainties in assessment and design of dike segments. The algorithm is applied to a reinforcement project for a dike segment of 41 independent sections, and compared to the common design practice which uses reliability-based requirements on a section level. It is found that the resulting reinforced dike segment is 42% cheaper to construct than the one obtained from the common approach, based on the same input information. This illustrates the practical and societal value of the design approach using a greedy search algorithm in this context.

The transformation of drought and flood involves not only the degree of drought and flood, but also their evolution trends and the key factors affecting this transformation. Taking the Jialu River Basin (JRB) in Central China as an example, via the comprehensive analysis of rainfall data from 8 meteorological stations, the temporal and spatial distribution, the transformation period, and of the factors influencing drought and flood were revealed. Our results show that: (1) for most of the year, there is a drought in the JRB, irrespective of the meteorological station; (2) the dry-wet transformation between adjacent seasons showed that the main characteristics of each season were continuous drought/wetting; (3) there is no difference between dry and wet transformation in the JRB, indicating that topography does not play a role, and (4) the sequence of drought and flood showed good agreement with solar activity, indicating that sunspots are the main cause of the periodic change of drought and flood in the JRB.

However, because most large carnivores are long-lived, cryptic and wide-ranging, few studies examine the demographic consequences of habitat loss, and the resultant crowding that ensues, on these species. We used long-term data to examine the demographic responses of an African lion (Panthera leo) population to flooding-induced habitat loss in a seasonal wetland, the Okavango Delta, during a transition from low to high annual flooding patterns. We found that intraspecific competition reduced cub survival and that this effect was exacerbated by habitat loss and consequent crowding. The proportion of cubs recorded in the population also declined as crowding increased, and both the survival of cubs and proportion of cubs recorded declined as prey abundance decreased. Apparent sub-adult survival declined with increasing pride size, but this likely reflects emigration rather than mortality. Adult survival remained relatively constant throughout the study period, a population response which is important in buffering populations against short-term fluctuations in ecological conditions. As many large carnivore populations face future habitat loss, it is important that we understand the demographic consequences of habitat loss in order to better mitigate its effects in the future.

However, a major drawback with most of the currently used methods is the lack of flexibility. Indeed, these methods are only able to detect changes in the strength of dependence assuming invariant shape of the dependence structure. However, under a changing climate, the shape of dependence might change as well. Furthermore, in the multivariate setting, heterogeneities can occur in the margins and/or in the dependence structure. The most existing approaches for multivariate change detection deal with the whole distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical test for multivariate heterogeneity detection, based on copula and multivariate L-moments. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed test and to compare it with those of existing tests. Results indicate that the proposed test has an interesting power especially when the dependence strength remains invariant, with power ranging between 45 and 93% whereas for the existing tests the power is lower than 14% in this case. An application to a real data set is also provided. Results show the ability of the proposed test to discriminate homogeneous and inhomogeneous series.

Although a wildly diverse intellectual movement, this scholarship shares the common goal of widening traditional understandings of agency to include nonhuman objects. This article adopts insights from cognitive science to extend the concept of political agency beyond the confines of human intention. Instead of focusing on the constraining material characteristics of the nonhuman within a large-scale relational framework, we argue in support of a distributive understanding of agency based on the co-constitutional essence of the mind itself. Specifically, we integrate insights from embodied cognition grounded in dynamical systems theory into the established framework of the hydrosocial cycle to argue that residents? experiences within an active material world help explain the existence of certain flood risk perceptions. In other words, human intention or agency?as it is commonly understood?comes into existence through a co-constitutional process involving brain, body, and aspects of a wider environment. Using qualitative interview data from two communities along the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana, we support our arguments through an investigation of three types of embodied experiences between residents and the levees that shape risk perception. Key Words: embodied cognition, hydrosocial cycle, new materialism, risk perception.

Anthropogenic strath terrace formation caused by reduced sediment retention	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Anthropocene; river incision; terrace formation; Pacific Northwest	RADIOCARBON AGE CALIBRATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARROYO FORMATION; RIVER INCISION; CASCADE RANGE; WASHINGTON; EROSION; BEDROCK; VEGETATION; LANDSCAPE	Across North America, human activities have been shown to cause river incision into unconsolidated alluvium. Human-caused erosion through bedrock, however, has only been observed in local and isolated outcrops. Here, we test whether splash-dam logging, which decreased in-stream alluvial cover by removing much of the alluvium-trapping wood, caused basin-wide bedrock river incision in a forested mountain catchment in Washington State. We date incision of the youngest of four strath terraces, using dendrochronology and radiocarbon, to between 1893 CE and 1937 CE in the Middle Fork Teanaway River and 1900 CE and 1970 CE in the West Fork Teanaway River, coincident with timber harvesting and splash damming in the basins. Other potential drivers of river incision lack a recognized mechanism to cause T1 incision or are not synchronous with T1 incision. Hence, the close temporal correspondence suggests that reduced sediment retention triggered by splash damming led to the observed 1.1 mm.y(-1) to 23 mm.y(-1) of bedrock river incision and reduction of the active flood-plain to 20% and 53% of its preincision extent on the Middle and West Forks, respectively. The development of such anthropogenic bedrock terraces may be an emerging, globally widespread physiographic signature of the Anthropocene.

TanDEM-X satellite data acquired in 2012 were used to generate a high-resolution topography map, and multi-sensor InSAR displacement time-series were used to obtain ground deformation rates between 2007 and 2017. Both data sets were then used to project ground deformation rates for the 2030s and 2050s. A 2-D flood inundation model (FloodMap-Inertial) was employed to predict coastal flood inundation for both scenarios. The results suggest that the sea-level rise, along with land subsidence, could result in minor but non-linear impacts on coastal inundation over time. The flood risk will primarily be determined by future exposure and vulnerability of population and property in the floodplain. Although the flood risk estimates show some uncertainties, particularly for long-term predictions, the methodology presented here could be applied to other coastal areas where sea level rise and land subsidence are evolving in the context of climate change and urbanization.

Urban rainstorms and waterlogging have become an urgent challenge that needs to be monitored in real time and further predicted for the improvement of urbanization construction. We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Furthermore, we build a nationwide map of urban waterlogging based on recent 2-year microblogging data.

Among the various types of hazards caused by floods, disruption of the road network has a particularly severe impact on the mobility of emergency responders, and therefore, poses a difficult challenge to damage mitigation, especially in the urban environment. The aim of this article is to present a mapping model for analyzing the spatial pattern of flood impact on urban mobility. Specifically, by incorporating the theory of space syntax, this model focuses on two dimensions of the analysis: the performance of the road network and the relationship between the factors behind it. The former can demonstrate the extent to which the city is affected by flooding in terms of mobility, whereas the latter can provide valuable reference for enhancing the efficiency of evacuation and rescue operations.

Future precipitation increase from very high resolution ensemble downscaling of extreme atmospheric river storms in California	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							NORTH-AMERICA; SYSTEM MODEL; CLIMATE; WEATHER; IMPACTS; SCALE	Precipitation extremes will likely intensify under climate change. However, much uncertainty surrounds intensification of high-magnitude events that are often inadequately resolved by global climate models. In this analysis, we develop a framework involving targeted dynamical downscaling of historical and future extreme precipitation events produced by a large ensemble of a global climate model. This framework is applied to extreme "atmospheric river" storms in California. We find a substantial (10 to 40%) increase in total accumulated precipitation, with the largest relative increases in valleys and mountain lee-side areas. We also report even higher and more spatially uniform increases in hourly maximum precipitation intensity, which exceed Clausius-Clapeyron expectations. Up to 85% of this increase arises from thermodynamically driven increases in water vapor, with a smaller contribution by increased zonal wind strength. These findings imply substantial challenges for water and flood management in California, given future increases in intense atmospheric river-induced precipitation extremes.

The potential threats can be demonstrated only by hydrodynamic modeling. The main problem while simulating sewage systems operation is the selection of proper model rainfall. It should reflect the main characteristics of real rainfall phenomena occurring in the analyzed area. In Poland, regarding the lack of local models, the model rainfalls developed in Germany are recommended for use. However, there was no confirmation so far, whether these models correspond to Polish hydrological conditions. The aim of the work was, therefore, the verification of these rainfall standards through research on the variability of precipitation intensity over time, based on local databases. Statistical analysis of local hyetographs shapes indicated differences with the German standards. On this basis, detailed model rainfall patterns for the studied stations were proposed.

In analyzing as a case study three major reservoirs in the Middle Euphrates river valley in southeastern Turkey (Ataturk, Birecik and Karkamis), we developed a Post-Flooding Damage Assessment (PFDA) to evaluate the impact of dams on archaeological sites. Our PFDA, consisting of an analysis of cross-correlations between multi-temporal Landsat imagery, geographical spatial datasets and archaeological data from surveys and excavations, provides an unprecedented detailed overview of the loss of especially significant cultural landscapes, and also highlights the limited accuracy of pre-flooding archaeological surveys and excavations. We conclude with recommendations for improving how rescue archaeological projects targeting endangered cultural landscapes are designed, with an immediately achievable target of better documenting cultural heritage threatened by dams.

In this study, we use secondary climate and census data, interviews and focus groups in four small cities in the Amazon Delta and Estuary (SCADEs), to discuss how residents and local governments perceive and respond to climate hazards and their implications. These SCADEs may be better equipped than other urban areas to deal with challenges brought by climate change, due partially to residents' high mobility between urban and rural areas and a tradition of adaptive actions in a dynamic social and environmental context. However, persistent flooding and sinkholes demonstrate the limited capacity of local governments to cope with the dynamics of accelerated occupation of floodplain areas in SCADEs.	[De Lima, Ana C.

Critical dependence of morphodynamic models of fluvial and tidal systems on empirical downslope sediment transport	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							BED-LOAD TRANSPORT; CHANNEL PATTERNS; SAND; GRAVEL; BIFURCATION; FLOW; EQUILIBRIUM; MORPHOLOGY; STABILITY; CENTURIES	The morphological development of fluvial and tidal systems is forecast more and more frequently by models in scientific and engineering studies for decision making regarding climate change mitigation, flood control, navigation and engineering works. However, many existing morphodynamic models predict unrealistically high channel incision, which is often dampened by increased gravity-driven sediment transport on side-slopes by up to two orders of magnitude too high. Here we show that such arbitrary calibrations dramatically bias sediment dynamics, channel patterns, and rate of morphological change. For five different models bracketing a range of scales and environments, we found that it is impossible to calibrate a model on both sediment transport magnitude and morphology. Consequently, present calibration practice may cause an order magnitude error in either morphology or morphological change. We show how model design can be optimized for different applications. We discuss the major implications for model interpretation and a critical knowledge gap.	[Baar, A. W.; Albernaz, M. Boechat; van Dijk, W. M.; Kleinhans, M.

A spatial database is collected from metropolitan areas in Beijing, including flood inventories from 2004 to 2014 and nine metrological, geographical, and anthropogenic explanatory factors. Urban flood susceptibility is mapped and compared using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and a support vector machine. Model performances are evaluated using four evaluation indices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score) as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results show that WELLSVM can better utilize the spatial information (unlabeled data), and it outperforms all comparison models. The high-quality WELLSVM flood susceptibility map is thus applicable to efficient urban flood management. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of planning policies on land use dynamics and livelihood opportunities under global environmental change: Evidence from the Mekong Delta	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Rural livelihoods; Rural employment; Land -change model; Land -use planning policies; Land systems; Environmental Change; Future scenarios; Mekong Delta	SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION; FOOD DEMAND; AGRICULTURE; PROVINCE	The Mekong Delta faces significant challenges in supplying Vietnam and its export market countries with agricultural commodities, while ensuring livelihoods and providing living space to its growing population in the context of climate change and the country's agrarian transition. Anthropogenic factors, such as the construction of dykes to control river flooding, river sand mining, the further development of triple-cropping rice production, and infrastructure development, together with climate change impacts on sediment and water availability, are all combining to threaten agricultural production. One of the key challenges in sustainable development is the need to identify plausible future states of agricultural-based socio-ecological systems which draw upon differing strategies of land management, and to characterise the impacts of these systems on both the landscape and employment. It was hypothesised from the literature and rapid rural appraisals that each land system can only provide a certain number of jobs, which was further demonstrated using binomial regressions. We show that the odds of being employed are lower for intensive agricultural systems (OR=0.78 for triple rice; 0.91 for intensive aquaculture) than for diversified systems (OR=1.16 for rice-aquaculture; OR=1.63 for mixed fruit trees). Drawing from workshops with local and national stakeholders, we then used Earth observation and national census data in a spatial land use systems dynamic framework to simulate two alternative Mekong Delta futures based upon the climate pathway RCP 4.5 in combination with two existing policies (i) Resolution No. 124 (Specialisation) which promotes triple crop rice and aquaculture intensification and (ii) Resolution No. 639 (Diversification), which states that there should be a development of sustainable rice aquaculture and crop diversification. Based on the quantitative objectives of each policy, we estimated likely changes of services provided by land use systems if either policy were to dominate. The estimated impacts of each future scenario on the provision of employment ultimately indicate that policies with a diversification development paradigm will provide more employment (+0.9%) than policies with a specialisation paradigm (-46%), and that current policies have potentially conflicting consequences. Decisions driving towards intensive farming risk triggering rural unemployment and outmigration, potentially exacerbating urban poverty in major cities such as Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh City. On the other hand, decisions aiming at increasing diversified agricultural systems can help secure more job opportunities. Our results indicate that spatial planning policies should rely on a broad-based assessment of land system services that include employment and environmental impacts to ensure a just transition towards resilient and environmentally sustainable rural territories.

J	López-Martínez, F				Lopez-Martinez, Francisco			Are Floods Becoming a More Expensive Hazard? A Damages Review of the Southeastern Spanish Coast (1996-2016)	LAND			English	Review						natural hazards; floods; economic damages; spatial planning; socio-economic factors	NATURAL HAZARDS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; OCTOBER 2007; FLASH-FLOOD; COSTA-BRAVA; VULNERABILITY; EXPOSURE; SPAIN; MANAGEMENT; LOSSES	Over the last few decades, an increasing economic and social flooding damages trend has been recorded worldwide. Although this situation was initially associated with climate change, recently different institutions and scientific papers have related this trend to two main reasons: (i) a human population increase and (ii) the number of assets located in floodable areas. In this regard, this paper analyses evolutions in flood damages and their causes in a Mediterranean area, the provinces of Alicante and Murcia, between 1996 and 2016. The duration of this period, from a flood risk management policy point of view, is very important because it encompasses one of the most important legislative periods at a national and European level. As a main result, this paper establishes a temporal and spatial pattern related to increases in flood damages and their main influence on coastal areas, respectively, due to certain economic, spatial and temporal factors. As a conclusion, these trends demonstrate the inefficiency of flood risk management policies, especially those connected with spatial planning.

Flexible Planning for Intercity Multimodal Transport Infrastructure	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Transportation networks; Roadways; Railways; Dynamic adaptive policy pathways; Adaptation; Transport mode switching	ADAPTIVE POLICY PATHWAYS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; TRAVEL; FRAMEWORK; DEMAND	Planning transport infrastructure development involves high levels of uncertainty due to socioeconomic, environmental, and technological changes. Methodologies currently used in transport planning often have minimal consideration for adaptiveness, leading to costly redesigns or cancellation of entire projects. Presented herein is the investigation of the applicability of dynamic adaptive policy pathways, which is a methodology predominantly used in the field of flood-risk planning, to long-term transport infrastructure planning. Specifically, the paper investigates whether this methodology could facilitate ongoing adaptation to variations in service demand and capacity. It demonstrates this by examining future demand and capacity of road and rail travel between Manchester, United Kingdom, and London using publicly available data and information sources. The study shows that dynamic adaptive policy pathways is useful for identifying periods of time of significant capacity vulnerability for the examined transport network in the coming decade. The method is demonstrated to be valuable for identifying the points in time when policy-makers will have to make decisions and for assessing the impact of transport mode switching. This can have implications of cost-saving and improved service delivery.

This report describes the relief efforts in Kozhikode, a coastal region of Kerala, where Operation Navajeevan was initiated. Sources: Data were collected from a centralized database at the command center in the District Medical Office as well as first-hand accounts from providers who participated in the relief effort. Observations: From August 15 through September 8, 2018, 36,846 flood victims were seen at 280 relief camps. The most common cause for presentation was exacerbation of an on-going chronic medical condition (18,490; 50.2%). Other common presentations included acute respiratory infection (7,451; 20.2%), traumatic injuries (3,736; 10.4%), and psychiatric illness (5,327; 14.5%). Analysis: The prevalence of chronic disease exacerbation as the primary presentation during Operation Navajeevan represents an epidemiologic shift in disaster relief in India. It is foreseeable that as access to health care improves in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and climate change increases the prevalence of extreme weather events around the world, that this trend will continue.

Adaptation to flooding requires sufficient social capital (linkages between members of society), risk perceptions (understanding of risk), and self-efficacy (self-perceived ability to limit disaster impacts) to be effective. However, there is limited understanding of how social capital, risk perceptions, and self-efficacy interact. We seek to explore how social capital interacts with variables known to increase the likelihood of successful adaptation. To study these linkages we analyze survey data of 1010 respondents across two communities in Thua Tien-Hue Province in central Vietnam, using ordered probit models. We find positive correlations between social capital, risk perceptions, and self-efficacy overall. This is a partly contrary finding to what was found in previous studies linking these concepts in Europe, which may be a result from the difference in risk context. The absence of an overall negative exchange between these factors has positive implications for proactive flood risk adaptation.

The results show that the intensities of rainfall on sub-daily scale are getting more extreme. The annual maximum 1-, 2- and 3-hour rainstorms followed significant upward trends with increases of 0.32, 0.43 and 0.44 mm per year, respectively, while the annual maximum 6-, 12- and 24-h events had non-significant rising trends. The detected significant trends in short-duration rainstorms were then used to redesign storm hyetographs to drive the HEC-HMS model, the results show that these changes in short-duration rainstorm characteristics would increase the flood peak discharge and flood volume. These findings indicate that regional flood control capabilities must be improved to manage the adverse impacts of rainfall variation under changing environments.

The anthropic disturbance resulted in a specific microbial network topology character-ized by lower modularity and stability, reflecting the legacy of past agricultural use on soil microbiome.

We used data from mountain and lowland watersheds, where floods are caused by different processes. In order to identify possible shifts in the day of occurrence of annual flood maxima, we apply the kernel density method to the time series of two subperiods (1960-1987 and 1988-2015). We use the Mann Kendall test at a 5% significance level to identify significant positive or negative trends in the series of annual maximum discharges. In Austria, we observe an increasing trend in summer floods associated with increasing precipitation. In the lowland areas of Ukraine, a clear reduction in spring floods is observed, linked to shallower snow packs in a warming climate. In the Ukrainian Carpathians, on the other hand, where floods occur throughout the year, an increase in the portion of liquid precipitation during the cold period of the year leads to earlier floods and an increase in the probability of flooding in winter.

In this study, a hyper-resolution flood model for coastalurban systems, WRF-Hydro-CUFA (Coastal Urban Flood Applications), is developed based on a distributed process-based hydrologic model, WRF-Hydro, to represent urban hydrologic processes. In addition, WRF-HydroCUFA integrates a hydraulic flow solver, SWMM, to consider flood controls of stormwater drainage. As a pilot study, the applications for past non-extreme and extreme flood events in the City of Tybee Island, USA, show that WRF-Hydro-CUFA can represent multiple flood mechanisms, including coastal and pluvial flooding. WRF-HydroCUFA is further implemented for operational flood predictions on a web-based dashboard, providing an opportunity for calibration and improvement. The application and enhancement processes of WRF-Hydro-CUFA can be transferred and adapted in other coastal communities facing similar flood risks but with limited access to flood models.

J	Cerda, JR; Webb, TL				Cerda, Jacey R.; Webb, Tracy L.			Wildlife conservation and preserving biodiversity: impactful opportunities for veterinarians?	JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Editorial Material							THREATS; HEALTH	The world is losing wildlife species at an unprecedented rate. Habitat destruction, overexploitation, and pollution are the leading causes of biodiversity decline. As a threat multiplier, climate change exacerbates these processes as demonstrated by the death of several billion wild animals in the last few years from wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and other natural disasters. In the face of these challenges, veterinarians have unique and important skillsets to contribute to wildlife conservation and the preservation of biodiversity at many levels. Veterinarians can organize and train to mobilize wildlife extraction, rescue, and rehabilitation units during natural disasters as well as build relationships with rehabilitators to provide their services for general wildlife rehabilitation needs. They can work in transdisciplinary teams to provide veterinary expertise for ecosystem health and rewilding projects. They can become sustainability champions by providing pollinator and wildlife friendly habitats at their clinics and reducing clinic waste and energy consumption, and they can engage in science communication and advocacy. When provided with the necessary information, resources, and action items, veterinarians can increase their positive impact and personal well-being through purposeful, value-driven, community-building efforts to support wildlife conservation and biodiversity.

Drawing on data collected from 102 reset-tled households, three years post-relocation, we document perceptions of the new community and self -reported changes on several risk-reduction and development indicators. We found mixed outcomes. Moving to an upgraded built environment led to improved perceptions of happiness, climate resilience and security against crime. Yet, for most respondents, the resettlement had adverse impacts on social capital and economic mobility. In the new site, social norms imposed upon residents, restricting individual and collective freedom, have resulted in sentiments of captivity and immobility. There is a major discon-nect between the rhetoric of the political elites that promote the project as socio-environmental justice and urban development, and residents' experiences on the ground. This article brings attention to the negotiations and trade-offs that urban poor households are exposed to, even in well-designed resettle-ment interventions.

However, hospitals face risks from the natural environment, such as flood risks. Amid the increasing flood risks due to climate change, it is essential to examine hospitals' risk exposure. Motivated by this, this paper aims to answer four specific questions related to hospitals in Florida: (1) Are hospitals located in flood zones? (2) What is the relationship between hospital network size and flood hazard? (3) To what extent does hospital flood hazard vary by hospital attributes? (4) How do hospitals' flood hazards differ from other public structures' flood hazards? By leveraging two micro-level datasets, we found that approximately 12% of Florida hospitals are in flood zones, and that hospitals' flood hazard is not influenced by hospital network size or hospital attributes. We also found that hospitals are one of the most flood-prone public structures in our sample, raising questions about public infrastructure in flood management. We conclude by offering recommendations for improving hospital resilience to future flood disasters.

Groundwater shapes North American river floods	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						groundwater; floods; hydrology; climate	BASE-FLOW; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; TRENDS; STREAMFLOW; RISK; PRECIPITATION; SEASONALITY; HYDROLOGY; SHIFTS	The importance of soil moisture in triggering river floods is increasingly recognized. However, soil moisture represents only a fraction of the water stored in the unsaturated zone. In contrast, groundwater from the deeper, saturated zone, may contribute a significant proportion of river flow, but its effects on flooding are poorly understood. Here we analyze hydroclimatic records of thousands of North American watersheds spanning 1981-2018 to show that baseflow (i.e. groundwater-sustained river flows) affects the magnitude of annual flooding at time scales from days to decades. Annual floods almost always arise through the co-occurrence of high precipitation (rainfall + snowmelt) and baseflow. Flood magnitudes are often more strongly related to variations in antecedent baseflow than antecedent soil moisture and short-term (<= 3-day) extreme precipitation. In addition, multi-decadal trends in flood magnitude and decadal flood variations tend to better align with groundwater storage and baseflow trends than with changing precipitation extremes and soil moisture. This reveals the importance of groundwater in shaping North American river floods and often decouples the spatial patterns of flood trends from those of shifting precipitation extremes and soil moisture.

Reconnecting waterways to their floodplains improves water quality and quantity, supports biodiversity and sensitive species conservation, increases flood, drought and fire resiliency, and bolsters carbon sequestration. But, while the importance of river restoration is clear, beaver-based restoration-for example, strategic coexistence, relocation, and mimicry-remains an underutilized strategy despite ample data demonstrating its efficacy. Climate-driven disturbances are actively pushing streams into increasingly degraded states, and the window of opportunity for restoration will not stay open forever. Therefore, now is the perfect time to apply the science of beaver-based low-tech process-based stream restoration to support building climate resilience across the landscape. Not every stream will be a good candidate for beaver-based restoration, but we have the tools to know which ones are. Let us use them.

It is generally more tolerant to disturbance than other seagrass species, including tolerance to reduced salinity. This study investigated the low salinity tolerance of a population of H. wrightii that has a long history of exposure to river flooding located at Cat Island, Mississippi (MS). Plants were collected after record prolonged flooding of the Mississippi River in 2019 and subsequent reduced salinities at Cat Island, MS, then allowed to recover at a salinity of 25 before being subject to three low salinity exposures of 5, 10, and 15. Plants were still alive after more than 12 months even at the lowest salinity of 5. Morphological and biomass metrics were recorded at the end of this prolonged low-salinity exposure. Plants exhibited low biomass and shoot density. This population of H. wrightii was able to survive very low salinities for longer than previously reported. Other seagrass populations with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stressors may become important for survival as climate change alters coastal habitat conditions.

J	Said, Y; Barr, M; Saidani, T; Atri, M				Said, Yahia; Barr, Mohammad; Saidani, Taoufik; Atri, Mohamed			Desertification Detection in Makkah Region based on Aerial Images Classification	COMPUTER SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Desertification detection; deep learning; convolutional neural networks (CNN); aerial images classification; Makkah region		Desertification has become a global threat and caused a crisis, especially in Middle Eastern countries, such as Saudi Arabia. Makkah is one of the most important cities in Saudi Arabia that needs to be protected from desertifica-tion. The vegetation area in Makkah has been damaged because of desertification through wind, floods, overgrazing, and global climate change. The damage caused by desertification can be recovered provided urgent action is taken to prevent further degradation of the vegetation area. In this paper, we propose an automatic desertification detection system based on Deep Learning techniques. Aerial images are classified using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect land state variation in real-time. CNNs have been widely used for computer vision applications, such as image classification, image segmentation, and quality enhancement. The proposed CNN model was trained and evaluated on the Arial Image Dataset (AID). Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model has better performance while being suitable for embedded implementation. It has achieved high efficiency with 96.47% accuracy. In light of the current research, we assert the appropriateness of the proposed CNN model in detecting desertifi- cation from aerial images.

J	Wu, WY; Westra, S; Leonard, M				Wu, Wenyan; Westra, Seth; Leonard, Michael			Estimating the probability of compound floods in estuarine regions	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							STORM-SURGE; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; EXTREME RAINFALL; CONTINUOUS SIMULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTENSITY; RISK; INUNDATION; DEPENDENCE; MODELS	The quantification of flood risk in estuarine regions relies on accurate estimation of flood probability, which is often challenging due to the rareness of hazardous flood events and their multi-causal (or "compound") nature. Failure to consider the compounding nature of estuarine floods can lead to significant underestimation of flood risk in these regions. This study provides a comparative review of alternative approaches for estuarine flood estimation - namely, traditional univariate flood frequency analysis applied to both observed historical data and simulated data, as well as multivariate frequency analysis applied to flood events. Three specific implementations of the above approaches are evaluated on a case study - the estuarine portion of Swan River inWestern Australia - highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The theoretical understanding of the three approaches, combined with findings from the case study, enable the generation of guidance on method selection for estuarine flood probability estimation, recognizing issues such as data availability, the complexity of the application/analysis process, the location of interest within the estuarine region, the computational demands, and whether or not future conditions need to be assessed.

J	Hino, M; Burke, M				Hino, Miyuki; Burke, Marshall			The effect of information about climate risk on property values	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						climate change; flood risk; real estate	FLOOD; DISASTER	Floods and other climate hazards pose a widespread and growing threat to housing and infrastructure around the world. By reflecting climate risk in prices, markets can discourage excessive development in hazardous areas. However, the extent to which markets price these risks remains poorly understood. Here we measure the effect of information about flood risk contained in regulatory floodplain maps on residential property values in the United States. Using multiple empirical approaches and two decades of sales data covering the universe of homes in the United States, we find little evidence that housing markets fully price information about flood risk in aggregate. However, the price penalty is larger for commercial buyers and in markets where buyers are more risk aware, suggesting that policies to improve risk communication could influence market outcomes. Our findings indicate that houses in flood zones in the United States are currently overvalued by a total of $43.8 billion (95% confidence interval: $32.6 to $55.6 billion) based on the information in publicly available flood hazard maps alone, raising concerns about the stability of real estate markets as climate risks become more salient and severe.

Study focus: A rich and detailed regional dataset of annual maximum series (AMS) of sub-daily rainfall is considered with a three-fold aim: to detect possible changes in (1) seasonality and (2) magnitude of sub-daily rainfall extremes, (3) to assess the current reliability and accuracy of a previously developed regional model for rainfall frequency estimation based on the local value of mean annual precipitation (MAP). New hydrological insights for the region: The main findings of the study include: (1) delay (towards Autumn) in the mean timing of sub-daily rainfall extremes, more marked for higher elevations and longer durations; (2) significant increase in the magnitude of sub-daily extreme events for some areas, especially in the Apennine; (3) high sensitivity of the regional predictions of the frequency regime of sub-daily rainfall extremes to local changes in AMS and MAP.

To focus on the dynamic role of individual and governmental decision making on flood-risk management, we developed and implemented a coupled agent-based and hydraulic modelling framework. Within this framework, household agents are located in a floodplain protected by a levee system. Individual behaviour is based on Protection Motivation Theory and includes the options to (1) not react to flood risk; (2) implement individual flood protection measures; or (3) file a complaint to the government. The government decides about reinforcing the levee system, compromising between a cost-benefit analysis and filed complaints from households. We found that individual decision making can significantly influence flood risk. In addition, the coupled agent-based and hydraulic modelling framework approach captures commonly observed socio-hydrological dynamics, namely levee and adaptation effects. It provides an explanatory tool for assessing spatial and temporal dynamics of flood risk in a socio-hydrological system.

J	Sweya, LN; Wilkinson, S				Sweya, Lukuba N.; Wilkinson, Suzanne			A tool for measuring environmental resilience to floods in Tanzania water supply systems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Resilience; Environmental tool; Floods; Water supply; Tanzania	CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDICATORS; DELPHI	Water supply systems (WSSs) are particularly the central recipient of the impacts of environmental-related risks. Most heat energy trapped by greenhouse gases (GHGs) goes into water bodies and often affects the water cycle leading to severe floods. Floodwater flowing through a polluted and degraded environment contaminates the water sources contributing into elevated treatment costs. Resilient WSSs would survive those impacts. Yet, existing resilience tools have paid less attention to environmental aspects during the assessment, focusing on the physical elements making up the system. In this paper, a qualitative environmental tool to assess WSSs resilience is proposed. The tool's principles and indicators are made appropriate to Tanzania through a Delphi survey. Thematic and standard descriptive analyses are carried out during data analysis. Environmental resources sensitivity, environmental capacity, natural flood attenuation, and natural assets are the main factors that affect the WSSs environmental resilience. When evaluated in a real case "WSS", the tool showed the WSS has moderate environmental resilience with less than desirable performance where specific improvements are required for 78% of the aspects. Results are useful contributions for planning and implementing measures to improve the WSS environmental resilience.

These irregularities in the precipitation regime cause sudden and heavy rains, which increases the risk of flooding especially in cities. Therefore, the investigation of the change in precipitation intensities over time has great implications in terms of hydrology, water resources and urbanisation. In this study, rainfall intensity of Artvin meteorological station which is located in the Black Sea Region of Turkey is investigated. This station differs from the other stations in the Black Sea Region with extreme rainfall characteristics. Data of 14 standard duration rainfall intensity series with durations of 5 min to 24 h were used. First of all, two methods were applied for homogeneity control and then trend analysis was performed. Assuming that the factor destabilising the homogeneity is the trend, a detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was performed. After the implementation of DFA, homogeneity and trend analysis were reapplied to the data. In conclusion, it was determined that the main reason for the deterioration of rainfall intensity was the trend.

In this background, urban flood disasters caused by rainstorms frequently occur in China. Therefore, a disaster risk analysis model based on a bow-tie Bayesian network was established to analyze the risk of waterlogging disasters. First, the waterlogging accident was analyzed, the intermediate and basic events that caused the accident were identified, and the accident tree was drawn. According to the intuitive nature of the fault tree, it was transformed into a Bayesian network, and in the meantime, a posteriori probability analysis of nodes was performed to further obtain the critical importance of basic events. By analyzing the importance of the basic events of waterlogging disasters, the key basic events that lead to disasters were proposed. Finally, the bow-tie model was used to analyze the importance of the hazards, and a strategy for the prevention and control of accidents was proposed. The results show that the major accident node of urban waterlogging accidents is the unsafe state of the urban environment, and the management and control of the urban environment should be strengthened to improve the prevention and control of urban waterlogging, e.g., pre-disaster prevention.

This research explores flood vulnerability in cities by developing an index that can be easily implemented across the world. Our methodology is based on the arrangement of a series variables into three different classes (demography, socioeconomics and infrastructure) and the determination of their spatial variability through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We tested the proposed approach in the city of Santander (Spain) where a vulnerability index map was generated based on the combination of the proposed classes. The analysis show that we can reduce complexity from an initially identified 159 relevant variables to 16 representative and impactful variables in terms of spatial variance. Classification of the variables into three different classes made it possible to quantify the main causes of vulnerability to flooding across space. We produce a flood risk map by integrating our findings with a flood hazard map for the same area. This flood risk map gives urban planners detailed information about the most affected areas and allows them to design measures that mitigate the severity and effects of floods optimising available resources.

Applications of PA to sustainable urban drainage and nature-based solution (NBS) design are numerous but often rely on a bucket modelling (BM) approach to assess the efficiency of retention and detention structures.Managing urban growth and climate change requires careful attention to 1) the shape of NBSs to fit into an existing urban grid and 2) the intensity of rainfall, which is expected to increase significantly. The BM approach is insensitive to the shape of technical solutions and the variability of rainfall intensity, so the PA was revised, coupled with a hydrodynamic modelling (HM) approach and compared with previous BM-based approaches. In the low-intensity rainfall regime, HM and BM predict completely different infiltration system (IS) overflow probabilities.In the high-intensity precipitation regime, both provide a bell-shaped probability density function of overflow volumes, although BM tends to underestimate IS overflow volumes with low shape factor and overestimate IS overflow volumes with high shape factor.

Disasters, disaster preparedness and post disaster recovery: Evidence from Caribbean firms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Disasters; Disaster preparedness; Post disaster recovery; Caribbean Small Island Developing States; Firms	NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BUSINESS; IMPACTS; FLOOD	Firms are exposed to various kinds of risks such as man-made and natural disasters that can negatively affect their business. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a better under-standing of disasters, disaster preparedness, and post disaster recovery strategies and the private sector in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS), a region highly vulnerable to such impacts. A Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) was adopted using a novel database-the Innovation, Firm Performance, and Gender (IFPG) firm-level dataset conducted in the Caribbean in 2020 to estimate the production function as well as technical efficiency scores of firms, following which the efficiency scores were regressed against disaster preparedness and post disaster recovery strategies, and other firm-specific control variables using robust standard errors clustered at the country and sector level. The results indicate that disaster preparedness and post disaster recovery strategy affect technical efficiency. In particular firms with a post disaster recovery plan to resume operations after a disaster, firms with knowledge of which parts of their business need to be operational following a disaster, and firms that ensure that their suppliers have a post disaster recovery plan experience a positive effect on technical efficiency, while firms operating in a building that is able to withstand disasters negatively affects technical efficiency.

J	Vitale, C				Vitale, Corinne			Understanding the shift toward a risk-based approach in flood risk management, a comparative case study of three Italian rivers	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Institutional analysis; Flood risk governance; Spatial planning; River basin management; Urban flood resilience; Italy	WATER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; NETHERLANDS; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; STABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK	Flooding is a threatening human/climate-induced hazard and the expected increase in the frequency and severity of floods is challenging cities worldwide. Modern flood risk management advocates the diversification of mea-sures and strategies to face floods. This diversification is endorsed by the risk-based approach that - unlike the standards-based approach - emphasizes the need of addressing both the probability and consequences of floods and stresses the importance of collaboration between spatial planners and water managers in the field of flood risk management. In this paper, the politicized Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework is used as an analytical ordering device to systematically examine the interplay between discursive, institutional, and contextual factors in enabling or hampering the shift toward a risk-based approach in flood management policies for the Metropolitan City of Naples and the Metropolitan City of Milan. Striking similarities across the cases and recurring patterns reveal three main entangled governance issues hampering the shift toward a risk-based approach, namely: poor coordination across levels of government, communities of actors, and policy domains. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for policy-makers on how to address these three governance challenges for successful flood adaptation policy responses.

Applications of Molecular Markers for Developing Abiotic-Stress-Resilient Oilseed Crops	LIFE-BASEL			English	Review						molecular markers; MAS; oilseeds; abiotic stress; SSRs; molecular breeding; climate change	SUNFLOWER HELIANTHUS-ANNUUS; CARTHAMUS-TINCTORIUS L.; RAPESEED BRASSICA-NAPUS; FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; SESAMUM-INDICUM L.; SALT TOLERANCE; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS; GENOME SEQUENCE	Globally, abiotic stresses, such as temperature (heat or cold), water (drought and flooding), and salinity, cause significant losses in crop production and have adverse effects on plant growth and development. A variety of DNA-based molecular markers, such as SSRs, RFLPs, AFLPs, SNPs, etc., have been used to screen germplasms for stress tolerance and the QTL mapping of stress-related genes. Such molecular-marker-assisted selection strategies can quicken the development of tolerant/resistant cultivars to withstand abiotic stresses. Oilseeds such as rapeseed, mustard, peanuts, soybeans, sunflower, safflower, sesame, flaxseed, and castor are the most important source of edible oil worldwide. Although oilseed crops are known for their capacity to withstand abiotic challenges, there is a significant difference between actual and potential yields due to the adaptation and tolerance to severe abiotic pressures. This review summarizes the applications of molecular markers to date to achieve abiotic stress tolerance in major oilseed crops. The molecular markers that have been reported for genetic diversity studies and the mapping and tagging of genes/QTLs for drought, heavy metal stress, salinity, flooding, cold and heat stress, and their application in the MAS are presented.

A new co-learning method in spatial complex fuzzy inference systems for change detection from satellite images	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Complex fuzzy inference system; Remote sensing images; Image change detection; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning	SAR IMAGES; NETWORK	The detection of spatial and temporal changes (or change detection) in remote sensing images is essential in any decision support system about natural phenomena such as extreme weather conditions, climate change, and floods. In this paper, a new method is proposed to determine the inference process parameters of boundary point, rule coefficient, defuzzification coefficient, and dependency coefficient and present a new FWADAM+ method to train that set of parameters simultaneously. The initial data are clustered simultaneously according to each data group. This result will be the basis for determining a suitable set of parameters by using the FWADAM+ concurrent training algorithm. Eventually, these results will be inherited in the following data groups to build other complex fuzzy rule systems in a shorter time while still ensuring the model's efficiency. The weather imagery database of the United States Navy (US Navy) is used to evaluate and compare with some related methods using the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), R-squared (R-2) measures, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The experimental results show that the proposed method is up to 30% better than the SeriesNet method, and the processing time is 10% less than that of the SeriesNet method.

Using global sensitivity analysis, we aim to measure the contributions of the offshore forcing conditions (wave-wind characteristics, still water level and sea level rise (SLR) projected up to 2200) to the occurrence of a flooding event at Gavres town on the French Atlantic coast in a macrotidal environment. This procedure faces, however, two major difficulties, namely (1) the high computational time costs of the hydrodynamic numerical simulations and (2) the statistical dependence between the forcing conditions. By applying a Monte Carlo-based approach combined with multivariate extreme value analysis, our study proposes a procedure to overcome both difficulties by calculating sensitivity measures dedicated to dependent input variables (named Shapley effects) using Gaussian process (GP) metamodels. On this basis, our results show the increasing influence of SLR over time and a small-to-moderate contribution of wave-wind characteristics or even negligible importance in the very long term (beyond 2100). These results were discussed in relation to our modelling choices, in particular the climate change scenario, as well as the uncertainties of the estimation procedure (Monte Carlo sampling and GP error).

DROUGHT-HARDENING IMPROVES FLOODING TOLERANCE OF MAIZE AT SEEDLING STAGE UNDER DROUGHT-FLOOD ABRUPT ALTERNATIONS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						leaf area; biomass; ABA concentration; stomatal conductance e; transpiration	ABSCISIC-ACID; ABA	In recent years, the frequency and intensity of drought-flood abrupt alterations due to global climate change have drastically increased. In contrast, plant response to the drought-flood abrupt alternations remains unclear. In the current study to reveal maize's physiological response to drought-flood abrupt alternations, these were carried out in two stages in this study, i.e., three levels of water deficit (WD, i.e., 75%, 65%, and 55% of the field capacity) in stage I, and then five durations of flooding (75%-WDi, 65%-WDi and 55%-WDi) in stage II. The results indicated that the 65%-WDi treatment significantly decreased the leaf area and biomass of maize seedlings in stage I, while maintaining plant growth and reaching the control level in stage II. Abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in maize leaves and roots of 0-5 cm depth was sensitive to drought stress. Under drought-flood abrupt alternations, the root system in 55%-WD5 and 65%-WD7 exhibited strong ABA signal, which was sensitive to drought-flood abrupt alternations. Therefore, at the maize seedling stage, proper control of soil moisture is beneficial for improving stress tolerance at later stages, but stress tolerance after drought-flood abrupt alterations is related to the degree of drought exposure at the early stage.

Inadequate and limited risk management measures from farming community to overcome such severe financial, production, and marketing risks not enough so need of adoption farm-based feasible risk management strategies. In addressing this research gap, this study investigated the potential association and implementing synchronized agricultural credit and diversification adoption to catastrophic risk manage for wheat production in Punjab, Pakistan. The study used the data of 480 wheat farmers' respondents and employed multinomial and bivariate probit regression models for empirical analysis. Empirical estimates illustrated the significant association in adoption of multiple risk management strategies as addressing the adoption single risk management strategy motivates farmers to adopt another strategy at same time. Furthermore, results also indicated as farmer schooling, age, family return, ownership of land, farm size, and farmer risk oppose character were highlighted the most influenced features for adopting various risk management strategies. Policy makers and state-based authorities can be assisted by these outcomes to evaluating plans of risk management and willingness of farmer in accept government supported regarding implementation of these catastrophic risk managing strategies.

In the face of global biodiversity decline, understanding the effects of potential climate change on the persistence of soil seed banks is critical, especially in wetland ecosystems. Although studies have explored the response of soil seed banks to changes in periodically inundated wetlands, little is understood about seed banks in peatlands. Aims. We examined the spatial variability of soil seed banks during a recent drying event, the last of which occurred over 60 years ago. Methods. We sampled the soil seed bank in three zones away from the centre of the dry lakebed at five depth intervals down to 50 cm. Key results. Our study showed that the seed bank distribution in a peatland reflected the wetland plants examined at the time of the drying event. The distribution of seeds was along a flood gradient, suggesting an interaction between historical inundation intensity (Zone) and vertical (Depth) distribution of seeds, and correlated with the extant vegetation, as determined during a significant water drawdown period. Conclusions and implications. This study shows that the ability of seeds to survive burial, either submerged or desiccated, even after long periods, may prove to have advantages for plant survival and establishment.

So a reasonable evaluation on water resources future changes in the Hanjiang River Basin (HRB) is essential to ensure its water safety. In this study, we firstly evaluated the China meteorological forcing dataset (CMFD), and then used it to measure the applicability of the eight global climate models (GCMs). Finally, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and clustering algorithms were used to analyze the spatial distribution status of precipitation in the HRB. The results showed that the BCC-CSM2-MR model has the best effect, followed by the IPSL-CM6A-LR model. In the SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios, total precipitation in the HRB all shows an increasing trend. However, the difference in the spatial distribution of precipitation intensified, for the upstream and downstream tended to be wetter, while the middle reaches had less precipitation. In the future climate scenarios, the areas with more precipitation (Class 1) increased significantly, while the areas with medium precipitation (Class 3) decreased significantly, which will enlarge the precipitation difference between regions in the HRB. The increase in the total amount of precipitation, coupled with the increase in the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation, will make the HRB more vulnerable to flooding disasters. Therefore, the water resources management measures in the HRB should be strengthened in the future.

Due to climate change and an increased need for the renewal of piping systems, making the right decisions on how to handle I/I is more important than ever. This paper presents a novel framework for risk-based decision support on I/I based on established theories on risk assessment and decision-making. The framework is presented on a general level and suggests that uncertainties are included in the decision-making process, together with criteria representing the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Published models on I/I and decision support are evaluated based on criteria from the framework showing that (1) the models rarely include risk-based decision-making or uncertainties in the analyses and that (2) most models only include project-internal financial aspects, excluding social and environmental, as well as project-external aspects, of I/I and I/I measures. A need for further research to develop a more holistic decision support model for I/I is identified, and it is concluded that the application of the proposed framework can contribute to more sustainable decisions on how to handle I/I and provide transparency to the process.

Increased outburst flood hazard from Lake Palcacocha due to human-induced glacier retreat	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							TROPICAL CORDILLERA-BLANCA; EQUILIBRIUM-LINE ALTITUDE; MORAINE-DAMMED LAKES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MASS-BALANCE; REGIONAL CLIMATE; ANDEAN GLACIERS; PROCESS CHAIN; VARIABILITY; PERU	Human-induced warming is responsible for the retreat of Palcaraju glacier and the associated increase in glacial lake outburst flood hazard, according to an analysis of observations and numerical models. A potential glacial lake outburst flood from Lake Palcacocha (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) threatens Huaraz, a city of 120,000 people. In 1941, an outburst flood destroyed one-third of the city and caused at least 1,800 fatalities. Since pre-industrial times, Lake Palcacocha has expanded due to the retreat of Palcaraju glacier. Here we used observations and numerical models to evaluate the anthropogenic contribution to the glacier's retreat and glacial lake outburst flood hazard. We found that the magnitude of human-induced warming equals between 85 and 105% (5-95% confidence interval) of the observed 1 degrees C warming since 1880 in this region. We conclude that it is virtually certain (>99% probability) that the retreat of Palcaraju glacier to the present day cannot be explained by natural variability alone, and that the retreat by 1941 represented an early impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Our central estimate is that the overall retreat is entirely attributable to the observed temperature trend, and that the resulting change in the geometry of the lake and valley has substantially increased the outburst flood hazard.

Performance of Three Sorghum Cultivars under Excessive Rainfall and Waterlogged Conditions in the Sudano-Sahelian Zone of West Africa: A Case Study at the Climate-Smart Village of Cinzana in Mali	WATER			English	Article						inundation; waterlogging; climate change adaptation; flooding; millet; Sahel	GROWTH; TRENDS	Recent climate analyses show trends for increasing precipitation variability with increasing precipitation sums in Mali. The increasing occurrence of temporary intra-seasonal droughts and waterlogging longer than a week demands climate-smart solutions. Research has focused on water deficits since the 1980s. However, besides droughts, waterlogging can restrict productivity of sensitive cash and staple crops as cotton and corn. The year 2019 offered the historically unique opportunity to monitor waterlogging effects with 1088 mm precipitation in the rural commune Cinzanawith an isohyet of 681 mm. Impacts of two extreme downpours on three sorghum cultivars were monitored in a farmers-field experiment with three replications. All sorghum cultivars performed well in 2019 with significantly higher grain and above ground biomass yields than in the reference year 2007, with well distributed rainfall in Cinzana. "Jakumbe" (CSM63E) produced significantly higher grain yields than the hybrid cultivar "PR3009B" bred for high harvest index. The local cultivar "Gnofing" selected by local farmers produced significantly higher above ground biomass. All cultivars tolerated without severe stress symptoms 20 days waterlogging and 72 h inundation. Further waterlogging resilience research of other crops and other sorghum cultivars is needed to strengthen food security in Mali with expected increasing precipitation variation in the future.

J	Zeng, Z; Guan, DB				Zeng, Zhao; Guan, Dabo			Methodology and application of flood footprint accounting in a hypothetical multiple two-flood event	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						flood footprint assessment; multiple natural disasters; indirect economic impact accounting; post-flood economic recovery; compound flood events	RISK; RECOVERY; INPUT	Multiple natural disasters are becoming ever more frequent around the world, with both climate change and rapid urbanization increasing the risk of such disasters in human society. Comprehensive analysis of the economic impact of multiple disasters on the industrial and economic system has become an urgent and essential part of urban recovery and sustainable development. However, there is a lack of studies that focus on assessing the indirect economic impacts resulting from such multiple events, and thereafter providing a common quantitative approach within their assessment. With the concept of flood footprint and input-output theory, this study proposes a more externally oriented methodology (flood footprint model) for indirect flood footprint (IFF) accounting and offers various extensive sensitivity analyses based on a hypothetical two-flood event. Based on the two-flood case, we conclude that the total flood footprint of a multi-flood within a given region is larger than the sum of individual flood footprints and this is the same for the IFF due to the combination effect, while the flood footprint is highly constrained by factors such as occurrence time and physical damage caused by the ensuing disaster.

J	Bae, C; Lee, DK				Bae, Chaeyoung; Lee, Dong Kun			Effects of low-impact development practices for flood events at the catchment scale in a highly developed urban area	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Urban flood; Low impact development (LID); SWMM; Parameter estimation and model updating	SURFACE	Because conventional responses to urban flooding, such as the extension of sewer conduits, are basically incompatible with recent trends of sustainable development, it is desirable to restore the natural hydrological cycle and maximize the infiltration capacity of a site at the source of flooding. Thus, low-impact development (LID) practices have frequently been suggested as adaptation strategies to local climate change. Studies have demonstrated the potential effects of LID, but they have not quantified and verified the extent of its capacity to mitigate the effects of actual floods. Therefore, this study set up catchment-scale sites located at the boundary where rainwater is treated in an urban area and evaluated the impacts of two types of LID using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) based on actual flood events during the wet season. The results showed that LID could reduce the runoff volume, peak flow, and inundation volume compared with conventional development. This study also used and demonstrated the implications of sensitivity testing and model updating to increase the correlation between the real system and the modeled site; therefore, the results can be used as a reference to assess the effectiveness of green space when planning urban redevelopment and regeneration projects where sewer systems already exist.

Land use/land cover change along the Eastern Coast of the UAE and its impact on flooding risk	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK			English	Article						Land use land cover; remote sensing; GIS; flood risk assessment; UAE	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER DELTA; CLASSIFICATION; URBANIZATION; SHORELINE; IMAGERY; AREA; MANAGEMENT; RAINFALL; QUALITY	This study was conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of land use/land cover (LULC) along the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over a 20-year period using an integration of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems techniques. The impact of land use change on flooding potential was also investigated through hydrologic model simulations. Landsat images of the years 1996, 2006 and 2016 were processed and analyzed. Change detection was carried out to assess changes in the built-up areas. Furthermore, the impact of urbanization on flooding was assessed using a hydrologic model in two major watersheds of Fujairah Emirate. It was observed that for the period 1996-2006 the vegetation and the built-up areas had increased at a rate of 11.23% and 24.56%, respectively. For the period 2006-2016, this expansion more than doubled in terms of the vegetation class (27.51%) and slightly increased for the built-up class (28.98%). The change detection analysis revealed that urbanization has mostly occurred along the coastal boundary. Hydrologic model simulations quantified the role of urbanization in increasing the flooding potential. The increase depends on watershed characteristics and the rate of change in urbanization and the magnitude of the rainfall event.

However, with global climate change and human activities across the landscape, stationary approaches cannot capture the nonstationary characteristics of flood events. This study aims to explore the key elements in establishing an effective bivariate nonstationary flood frequency model for flood peak and volume series at the Three Gorges Dam in China. A stationary reference model and six nonstationary models were established and rigorously compared to evaluate their benefits and limitations, including two time-informed models and four climate-informed models that consider time and climate indices as explanatory variables. The results suggest that nonstationary models are clearly superior to stationary models with respect to model performance based on the deviance information criterion (DIC). The time-informed nonstationary model provides a potential tool to project future trends in flood return periods with minimal data availability, yet the uncertainty in the estimation of design values of such models is limited. On the other hand, explicitly incorporating climate indices as explanatory variables of flood frequency distribution can significantly improve model performance and reduce uncertainty but at the cost of increased model complexity.

Vulnerability of sea turtles and fishes in response to two catastrophic Caribbean hurricanes, Irma and Maria	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STINGRAY DASYATIS-AMERICANA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT USE; HOME-RANGE; MOVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; CONSERVATION; DISTURBANCE; PATTERNS; PREDATOR	Extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, floods, droughts) are capable of changing ecosystems and altering how animals obtain resources. Understanding the behavioural responses of animals being impacted by these natural events can help initiate and ameliorate conservation or management programs. This study investigated short- and long-term space-use of the critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), as well as five species of fishes and stingrays, in response to two of the most destructive Caribbean hurricanes in known history- Irma and Maria, which were at their peak intensity when they passed the US Virgin Islands in September of 2017. Using passive acoustic telemetry in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, we show a variety of short-term behavioural patterns initiated across species to reduce exposure to the strong environmental conditions, such as moving to deeper habitats within the study area. Although short-term expansion of activity space was evident for several sea turtles, long-term impacts on space-use and body condition were limited. In contrast, southern stingrays (Hypanus americanus) left the study area shortly after the hurricanes, suggesting vulnerability stemming from altered habitat, prey availability, or temperature/oxygen profiles. This study shows the strong spatial resilience of several nearshore species despite exposure to two consecutive category 5 hurricanes.	[Matley, J.

Using Macau as a testbed, this research describes examines the impacts of flooding caused by storm surges on residents' daily travel and proposes measures to ameliorate disaster risks. Spatial extents of urban floods were modelled through inundation simulations using geographical information data. An analysis of the travel distance increases from residents' homes to common types of destinations was performed both under normal conditions and during flood events in GIS (Geographic Information System) to assess the influence of urban flooding on residents' daily travel. The results show that one third of the land is threatened by floods in Macau. People's average travel distance increases as the warning levels escalate, and travel distance is predicted to rise by up to 64.5%. Based on the findings, the study proposes mitigation strategies to minimize urban flooding's impacts. It suggests that the area more densely populated is not necessarily the one requiring the deployment of preventative measures with the highest priority, as a traffic analysis is identified as the key area which demands disaster prevention measures.

The results show that AM flood data in eastern Australia is dominated by downward trends. Depending on the significance level and study period under consideration, about 8% to 33% of stations are characterised by significant trends, where over 85% of detected significant trends are downward. Furthermore, the change-point analysis shows that the percentages of stations experiencing one abrupt change in the mean or in the direction of the trend are in the range of 8% to 33%, of which over 50% occurred in 1991, with a mode in 1995. Prominent resemblance between the monotonic trend and change-point analysis results is also noticed, in which a negative shift in the mean is observed at catchments that exhibited downward trends, and a positive shift in the mean is observed in the case of upward trends. Trend analysis of the segmented AM flood series based on their corresponding date indicates an absence of a significant trend, which may be attributed to the false detection of trends when the AM flood data are characterised by a shift in its mean.

There are currently a few different tools available that communities can use to plan, including the Sea Level Report Card and products generated by a United States. Federal interagency task force on sea level rise. These tools are a start, but it is recognized that they are not necessarily enough at present to provide communities with the type of information needed to support decisions that range from seasonal to decadal in nature, generally over relatively small geographic regions. The largest need seems to come from integrated models and tools. Agencies need to work with communities to develop tools that integrate several aspects (rainfall, tides, etc.) that affect their coastal flooding problems. They also need a formalized relationship with end users that allows agency products to be responsive to the various needs of managers and decision makers. Existing boundary organizations can be leveraged to meet this need. Focusing on addressing these needs will allow agencies to create robust solutions to flood risks, leading to truly resilient communities.

How to improve attribution of changes in drought and flood impacts	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL			English	Article						hydrological extremes; damage; dynamic risk; vulnerability; trend attribution; paired catchments; consecutive hydro-hazards	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX; DAMAGE MITIGATION MEASURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATURAL HAZARDS; ECONOMIC-IMPACTS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; DISASTER LOSSES; FOOD SECURITY; UNITED-STATES; RIVER-FLOODS	For the development of sustainable, efficient risk management strategies for the hydrological extremes of droughts and floods, it is essential to understand the temporal changes of impacts, and their respective causes and interactions. In particular, little is known about changes in vulnerability and their influence on drought and flood impacts. We present a fictitious dialogue between two experts, one in droughts and the other in floods, showing that the main obstacles to scientific advancement in this area are both a lack of data and a lack of commonly accepted approaches. The drought and flood experts "discuss" available data and methods and we suggest a complementary approach. This approach consists of collecting a large number of single or multiple paired-event case studies from catchments around the world, undertaking detailed analyses of changes in impacts and drivers, and carrying out a comparative analysis. The advantages of this approach are that it allows detailed context- and location-specific assessments based on the paired-event analyses, and reveals general, transferable conclusions based on the comparative analysis of various case studies. Additionally, it is quite flexible in terms of data and can accommodate differences between floods and droughts.

Geographers have contributed much to the critical understanding of the theoretical foundations and implications of this now ubiquitous concept, and have made some initial steps in studying how local practitioners and other experts interpret and apply resilience in risk reduction and adaptation measures. But there is limited empirical research, however, on what the people living in communities exposed to hazards think about resilience. This study aims to address this gap by conducting in-person, researcher-administered surveys (n = 400) with members of the public using coastal and lakefront environmental amenities in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada. Survey results include three main findings: (1) the majority of participants prefer the framing of "increasing resilience" over "reducing vulnerability"; (2) the conceptualization of resilience as creative transformation is greatly favored over conceptualizations of resilience as resistance or recovery; and (3) resilience is seen as uneven in both study cities. The study reveals insights that can help inform and align resilience theory and practice in cities.

They form the base of the local Deccan stratigraphy, and their volcanological context is poorly understood. Apart from the flow, there are isolated hills of volcanic rocks, which have stood against the erosional processes that occurred in the basin. This paper provides an overview of features indicative of the interaction between water and lava and/or magma in Kachchh and their suitability as analogue for Mars. We have surveyed <22 craters/cones within the basin for their relevancy as planetary analogue. Evaluated during field investigations and satellite imagery for structures, physiography, and geologic setting concerning climate change from its evolution.

These assumptions are inconsistent with observations that suggest intensifying extreme precipitation events and the uncertainties surrounding projections of the coupled natural-human systems. Here we demonstrate a safety factor approach to designing urban infrastructure in a changing climate. Our results show that assuming climate stationarity and neglecting deep uncertainties can drastically underestimate flood risks and lead to poor infrastructure design choices. We find that climate uncertainty dominates the socioeconomic and engineering uncertainties that impact the hydraulic reliability in stormwater drainage systems. We quantify the upfront costs needed to achieve higher hydraulic reliability and robustness against the deep uncertainties surrounding projections of rainfall, surface runoff characteristics, and infrastructure lifetime. Depending on the location, we find that adding safety factors of 1.4-1.7 to the standard stormwater pipe design guidance produces robust performance to the considered deep uncertainties. The insights gained from this study highlights the need for updating traditional engineering design strategies to improve infrastructure reliability under socioeconomic and environmental changes.

Sea level rise and changing wave climates will alter patterns of erosion and deposition, but some existing coastline evolution models are unable to simulate these effects due to their one-dimensional representation of the systems or the sediment transport processes. In this paper, the development and application of the Coastline Evolution Model 2D (CEM2D) are presented, a model which incorporates these influences. The model has been developed from the established CEM and is capable of simulating fundamental cause-effect relationships in coastal systems. The two-dimensional storage and transport of sediment in CEM2D, which are only done in one-dimension in CEM, mean it is also capable of exploring the influence of a variable water level on sediment transport and the formation and evolution of morphological features and landforms at the mesoscale. The model sits between one-dimensional and three-dimensional models, with the advantage of increased complexity and detail in model outputs compared to the former but with more efficiency and less computational expense than the latter.

LEK is derived from complex interactions between fishers' observations of environmental change and their institutional capacities to manage fisheries. Hence, it is important to understand where and how LEK and formal scientific studies on fish species' decline could complement each other. In this paper, the causes of decline of 58 fish and two shrimp taxa were identified from LEK data (1999-2019) obtained from river-floodplain fisheries of the Gangetic plains (Bihar, India). Qualitative analyses of LEK were used to generate species-specific hypotheses and historical insights on their declines. Destructive fishing, overfishing and the Farakka barrage were cited by fishers as the major causes of declines. Potential reasons for these perceptions were explored in relation to fishers' experiences of conflicts in the region over fishing rights and access.

These changes need to be accompanied by appropriate government responses. We examined these changing mobilities in Bangladesh by first classifying them according to the relevant characteristics of emergency mobilities as described by Adey (anticipation, coordination, absence and difference) and then applying, as appropriate, one or more of Sheller and Urry's six essential bodies of mobility theory to provide a dynamic analysis from which to generate policy responses. Major findings specific to Bangladesh include the criticality of social networks and the mobility of gender roles due to flood-related migration. The policy implications, situated at the confluence of cultural tradition, the imperative to survive and current government policy which does not encourage mobility, focus on reconceptualising the use of land space to envisage a new paradigm of support for emergency mobility and resourcing people movement. Future research could apply this novel data analysis approach to other migration situations, with the purpose of informing emergency mobility policy.

Minimizing Urban Floodplain Management Regrets under Deeply Uncertain Climate Change	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article							WATER-RESOURCES; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; ROBUST OPTIMIZATION; RISK; ADAPTATION; MODEL; SIMULATION; STRATEGIES; PROTECTION; LESSONS	Optimization modeling can reveal promising multiperiod schedules for adapting to deeply uncertain changes in flooding. We contribute a parsimonious optimization model (mixed integer program) that adjusts the efficacy of property-scale adaptation measures (first-floor elevation, wet floodproofing, permanent retreat, insurance) for different floodwall investments and insurance incentives. After minimizing expected flood-control and damage costs for individual scenarios, we identified adaptation portfolios that minimize underdesign and overdesign regrets under a deeply uncertain future. A near-optimal solutions algorithm also identified diverse solutions with different multistakeholder tradeoffs. A stylized example showed that, when mild damage is tolerated, portfolios combining smaller floodwalls, wet floodproofing of basements, and moderately elevated manufactured (mobile) homes can be more robust to climate uncertainty than larger floodwalls alone. Yet, near-optimal solutions demonstrated that larger floodwalls without any property-scale measures are also feasible. Insurance incentives targeting property-scale measures (elevation, wet floodproofing) suited for permanent homes discourage municipal floodwall investments and force owners of manufactured homes to retreat. The results motivate further research on wet floodproofing, retreat financing, and insurance-based adaptation incentives.

Satellite-derived changes in floodplain productivity and freshwater habitats in northern Australia (1991-2019)	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Classification tree; Landsat; Image classification; Floodplain; Macrophytes; Aquatic vegetation	RIVERS REGION KAKADU; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; AQUATIC VEGETATION; ENVISAT ALTIMETRY; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; EXTENT DYNAMICS; PALSAR SCANSAR; FLOW REGIMES; TIME-SERIES	The ecological communities supported by freshwater habitats and wetlands that persist from floodplain inundation generate numerous cultural, recreational and economic values via commercial fisheries and other human uses of these habitats. However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991-2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r = 0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r = 0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r = 0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r = 0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems).

Survival of off-host stages of Ixodid ticks depends on microclimate driven in part by extrinsic factors resulting from weather, such as temperature, humidity, drought, and floods. The impact of some of these abiotic factors is unclear for D. albipictus. The effect of water submergence on biological parameters of engorged, adult, females, and unfed larvae was assessed in the laboratory. Survival of adult females after submergence for 3 days was 88% with significant effects on their ability to oviposit. After 5 weeks, 63% of larvae (1-month-old) survived submergence in water, whereas survival of larvae (3-month-old) was reduced to 23% after 7 days. The off-host stages of D. albipictus have variable tolerance to periods of submergence that may influence the number of larvae available on the landscape for recruitment to moose in autumn.

Six categories of maximum daily rainfall were considered: light: 0-4 mm/day (A); mild to moderate: 4-16 mm/day (B); moderate to heavy: 16-32 mm/day (C-1); heavy: 32-64 mm/day (C-2); heavy to torrential: 64-128 mm/day (D-1); and torrential: equal to or greater than 128 mm/day (D-2). The results show that during the second period (1990-2010), increasing trends were detected in the middle categories B (most frequent: 20.78%), C-1 (17.85%), C-2 (20.21%) and D-1 (4.92%). In addition, migratory movements and rainy events towards the higher categories were detected (in particular towards C-1 (8.84%)). These results show an increase in extreme rains in the Macta watershed during the period 1990-2010.

Risky Development: Increasing Exposure to Natural Hazards in the United States	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						natural hazards; exposure; risk; Zillow; vulnerability	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; LAND-COVER; FLOOD RISK; LOSSES; SIZE; INTENSITY; WILDFIRES; IMPACTS; MODEL	Losses from natural hazards are escalating dramatically, with more properties and critical infrastructure affected each year. Although the magnitude, intensity, and/or frequency of certain hazards has increased, development contributes to this unsustainable trend, as disasters emerge when natural disturbances meet vulnerable assets and populations. To diagnose development patterns leading to increased exposure in the conterminous United States (CONUS), we identified earthquake, flood, hurricane, tornado, and wildfire hazard hotspots, and overlaid them with land use information from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation data set. Our results show that 57% of structures (homes, schools, hospitals, office buildings, etc.) are located in hazard hotspots, which represent only a third of CONUS area, and similar to 1.5 million buildings lie in hotspots for two or more hazards. These critical levels of exposure are the legacy of decades of sustained growth and point to our inability, lack of knowledge, or unwillingness to limit development in hazardous zones. Development in these areas is still growing more rapidly than the baseline rates for the nation, portending larger future losses even if the effects of climate change are not considered.

This requires a transformation in the way we plan and govern our cities, but what can be learnt from the current crisis about how cities should be managed? In this article, we report on a scoping review to help identify seven lessons learnt for cities from the COVID-19 pandemic. We build on these lessons through a synthesis, outlining three urban missions that will chart a green urban recovery. The missions are to accelerate the urban mobility transition; to attain regenerative urban development; and create resilient urban infrastructure. We expand on what these missions entail, by defining six pathways that supports transition of urban mobility, energy, food, housing, health and nature. These pathways, when implemented in an integrated manner, provides a roadmap for green recovery in cities, that also builds resilience.

Research on long-term precipitation totals is absent in the Slovak Republic. This paper deals with the statistical analysis of daily precipitation from 48 precipitation stations in Slovakia. The paper evaluates the spatial distribution of precipitation in Slovakia and also presents analyses of stationarity and trends using the Mann-Kendall test. Emphasis is placed especially on the evaluation of the trends in total annual precipitation, maximum daily precipitation and also the number of days without precipitation in the year. By evaluating the trends in these three indicators, it is possible to assess the impact of potential change in the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation on hydrological drought and floods. The results show that there are currently no significant changes in precipitation in Slovakia. The problem of floods and hydrological drought seems to be more complex and is mainly due to surface water drainage from the landscape and the change in its use in connection with the increase in the average annual temperature.

Towards integrated flood inundation modelling in groundwater-dominated catchments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Groundwater flooding; Floodplain inundation modelling; Chalk aquifer; LISFLOOD-FP; ZOOMQ3D	CHALK UNSATURATED ZONE; SURFACE-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RECHARGE; RISK; AQUIFER; IMPACTS; SIMULATIONS; WISCONSIN; TRANSPORT	Traditionally in flood inundation modelling the contribution of groundwater is either neglected or highly simplified. Long-duration groundwater-induced events, such as those that occur across Chalk catchments of northern Europe, can, however, incur significant economic and social cost. We present a new methodology for integrated flood inundation modelling by coupling the 2D hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP with the 3D finite-difference groundwater model ZOOMQ3D. We apply the model to two adjacent Chalk catchments in southern England, the Lambourn and Pang, over two flooding events, during the winters of 2000/01 and 2013/14. A dense network of monitoring boreholes reveals local-scale heterogeneities in the aquifer not captured by the model. However, we demonstrate through inundation extent and streamflow comparisons that, on a regional scale, groundwater levels are simulated sufficiently well to capture groundwater inundation extent. The role of the unsaturated zone is discussed and contrasted between the two events. Currently, predictive tools to simulate groundwater flood events are limited, and this new, computationally efficient methodology will help to fill this gap.

We hereby propose an integrated modelling approach that consists of a semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model and a novel parameterization strategy. The modelling approach integrates the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model, Taihu Basin (TB) model, and Nash instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) into a framework. Model parameters are calibrated by optimizing their relationships with corresponding physical factors. The proposed modelling approach is applied in the Qinhuai River basin (QRB), China. The modelling approach shows satisfactory performance in flood simulation both for calibration and validation of flood events in the QRB. The approach has temporal and spatial prediction capability by using the established relationships between parameter values and physical factors. Robustness analysis reveals that the different sets of flood events used for parameter relationship calibration led to similar model performance. Numerical experiments show that impervious coverage poses strong influences on the model performance and needs to be considered in flood routing simulations for small- or medium-intensity flood events.

Many lakes are facing serious problems with degraded ecosystem functions and services, driven by multiple factors. Knowledge of how lakes change and respond to these drivers is crucial for sustainable lake management. Paleolimnological records provide highly resolved time-series data of long-term lake environmental change. We review how local paleolimnological studies and regional syntheses are improving understanding of the current status of Chinese aquatic ecosystems and revealing new insights into the changes that occurred in the past, such as eutrophication, heavy metal pollution, aquatic community change, and ecosystem shifts. We examine how these changes are related to natural and anthropogenic environmental stressors and consider the use of paleolimnological methods for defining reference conditions and setting ecological and chemical restoration targets. Despite past progress, we suggest that increased incorporation of paleolimnological information into policy and decision-making is needed for evidence-based adaptive management to enhance the sustainability of lake ecosystem functions and reduce long-term risks.

J	Gou, XN; Lam, JSL				Gou, Xueni; Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee			Risk analysis of marine cargoes and major port disruptions	MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS			English	Article						Maritime risk; Catastrophe risk; Marine cargo; Port disruption; Terminal operation; Natural hazard	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARITIME; TRANSPORTATION; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; MODEL	As an interface between sea and land, ports are exposed to a wide range of natural hazards such as cyclones, floods and tsunami. At the same time, marine cargoes are growing both in terms of volume and value. Besides their exposure to various hazards during the sea trip, their concentration in ports increases the risk to the cargo itself as well as to the port. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, our study proposes a framework for catastrophe risk analysis of marine cargoes and ports by breaking-down the terminal operation process. This allows a more in-depth analysis by investigating the different parts of that process. Second, the study formulates a State Transition model for the simulation of scenarios. This is an integrated and robust risk model, to analyse exposure of marine cargoes and ports to natural hazards.

J	Armstrong, J; Preston, J				Armstrong, John; Preston, John			Benefits from the remote monitoring of railway assets	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						infrastructure planning; railway systems; sustainability		Railway infrastructure already has some 'smart' characteristics, in that it 'knows' where trains are located and can sometimes detect track and other equipment faults. There is considerable scope to increase these capabilities. There is also a significant and urgent need for such improvements: railways have limited operational flexibility and face increasing passenger and freight traffic demand on existing infrastructure. The reliable provision of additional capacity requires improved system 'self-knowledge' for traffic control and management purposes, as well as for system reliability and safety. The use of smart infrastructure for fault prediction and the guidance of preventive maintenance helps to maintain operational capacity. This approach also helps to reduce track access requirements for traditional maintenance and renewals activities, thus increasing network availability and total capacity. Climate change presents the railway industry with significant challenges, notably in terms of flooding and earthworks failures resulting from increased rainfall intensity. Smart infrastructure includes the prediction and monitoring of such events to maintain safety and enable the timely implementation of operational contingency plans. This paper draws upon a range of sources to identify the needs for and potential benefits of increased deployment of smart infrastructure and other assets on railways in Britain and elsewhere.

Large-Scale Climatic Patterns Have Stronger Carry-Over Effects than Local Temperatures on Spring Phenology of Long-Distance Passerine Migrants between Europe and Africa	ANIMALS			English	Review						climate change; passerine migration; spring phenology; long-distance migrants; large-scale climate indices; NAO; IOD; SOI; Europe; Africa	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; ARRIVAL DATES; MIGRATION PHENOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS; PASSAGE AREAS; GLOBAL CHANGE; SURVIVAL; WEATHER	Simple Summary Spring in Europe has been trending earlier for almost half a century. Long-distance migrant birds, such as the Willow Warbler and Pied Flycatcher, which breed in Europe, have arrived earlier too. It is broadly accepted that warming springs in temperate regions explain the earlier arrival of migrants. However, migration started weeks earlier and thousands of kilometres away. There must be additional cues elsewhere triggering migration. Meteorologists have developed measures of atmospheric circulation which are related to climate variability in wide regions. One of them is the Southern Oscillation Index, which reflects El Nino/La Nina that cause droughts and floods in the southern hemisphere. Other atmospheric circulation patterns, measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and Indian Ocean Dipole, help predict total rainfall for a whole season in various parts of Africa and Europe. Good rains are associated with plant growth and with insect abundance. Insects provide food for most of these migrants. Therefore, this paper asks the question: "Is the timing of arrival of long-distance migrants in spring related to the climates they experience in the places where they are over the year prior to arrival in Europe?" This paper says the answer is "Yes". Earlier springs in temperate regions since the 1980s, attributed to climate change, are thought to influence the earlier arrival of long-distance migrant passerines. However, this migration was initiated weeks earlier in Africa, where the Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, North Atlantic Oscillation drive climatic variability, and may additionally influence the migrants. Multiple regressions investigated whether 15 indices of climate in Africa and Europe explained the variability in timing of arrival for seven trans-Saharan migrants. Our response variable was Annual Anomaly (AA), derived from standardized mistnetting from 1982-2021 at Bukowo, Polish Baltic Sea. For each species, the best models explained a considerable part of the annual variation in the timing of spring's arrival by two to seven climate variables. For five species, the models included variables related to temperature or precipitation in the Sahel. Similarly, the models included variables related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (for four species), Indian Ocean Dipole (three), and Southern Oscillation (three). All included the Scandinavian Pattern in the previous summer. Our conclusion is that climate variables operating on long-distance migrants in the areas where they are present in the preceding year drive the phenological variation of spring migration. These results have implications for our understanding of carry-over effects.

Near-reef and nearshore tropical cyclone wave climate in the Great Barrier Reef with and without reef structure	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tropical cyclones; Wave climate; Wave modelling; Atmospheric boundary layer; Great barrier reef; Parametric wind fields; Sparse storage technique; Ecosystem function; Coastal protection	COASTAL REGIONS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; PART I; MODEL; WIND; IMPACT; FETCH; PROFILES; BEACHES	The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) coral coverage is in rapid decline from severe and sustained pressures from lagoon water quality, crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), coral bleaching, tropical cyclones, pollution and diseases. The two recent GBR coral bleaching events (2016-2017) lead to Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) shifting their focus from passive management to active intervention (Great Barrier Reef Blueprint for resilience by GBRMPA). These active interventions, potentially able to increase GBR resilience, as there are reefs that, due to their physical location relative to all other reefs, river and estuary entrances, ocean currents, have favourable coral growth conditions. To undertake such interventions, various information is required including tropical cyclone wave climates. This paper develops tropical cyclone wave climates for the entire GBR. These wave climates were developed by simulating several thousand synthetic cyclones derived from the "HadGEM" general circulation model with RCP8.5 climate change scenario. The synthetic cyclones adopted herein include the following climate changes assessed by comparing averages of key forcing parameters between 1950 to 1999 and 2050 to 2099. Their average arrival rate increases from 2.25 to 2.41 cyclones/year and their average maximum wind speed increases from 24 to 28 m/s. Their average radius to maximum winds remains constant at 51 km. Two key challenges were resolved, namely, long runtimes and large files (600 m grid increment covering 1800 km by 280 km). Runtimes were reduced by excluding cyclones where their wind speeds over the entire event never exceeded 10 m/s within GBR itself or within 100 km of the GBR over water. Maximum wave heights were compared with an extended fetch empirical expression, which was based on satellite data of tropical cyclones in open waters, when cyclones were outside the GBR lagoon. These comparisons indicate that predicted wave heights have a lower bias using default wave generation parameters when compared with the extended fetch empirical expression. Prediction uncertainty was estimated at no more than 10% from various cyclonic windfield models. The existing GBR reefs reduce nearshore wave or runup height by between 1.5 and 2 times compared to the no reef case. The reduction in wave or runup height was found to be minimal for 1 m sea level rise. These two findings indicate that there is more flooding potential from coral removal than SLR within the GBR lagoon.

However, an understanding of their simultaneous impacts on river discharge remains limited in some parts of the world. To shed light on this issue, the objective of this article is to investigate the effects of rainfall variability and land use change on river discharge in the Nyong basin (at Olama and Mbalmayo gauging stations) and some of its sub-basins (So'o and Mefou) over the long period 1950-2018. To achieve this goal, hydro-meteorological data of the Nyong basin and sub-basins were analyzed using the Pettitt test. Likewise, land use changes in the basin and sub-basins were also analyzed using supervised classifications of Landsat satellite images of the basins at different periods (1973, 2000 and 2018). On the annual scale, rainfall has decreased statistically over the studied basins. In the large basins (Olama and Mbalmayo), this decrease in rainfall is synchronous with that of discharges, while it is concomitant with an increase in the Mefou (small basin). After the ruptures within time series identified in the annual modules, the extreme discharges (maximum and minimum) decreased in Olama; in Mbalmayo, the maximum discharges remained stable while the minimum discharges decreased. On the other hand, the maximum and minimum discharges have significantly increased in the Mefou. The stability of maximum discharges at Mbalmayo and the increase in extremes on the Mefou in a context where the precipitation that generates the discharge has decreased can be attributed to land use change. These changes are essentially marked by an increase in impervious areas and a reduction in forest cover. On the seasonal scale, the impact of precipitation in the dry season is visible on the flows of the rainy seasons that follow them on the large basins (Olama and Mbalmayo). Between the decades 1970-1990 and 2000-2010, there was respectively a significant increase, then a decrease in summer precipitation, which impacted the autumn discharges in the same direction. Conversely, between the same intervals, there was a significant decrease, then a slight increase in winter precipitation. The impact of winter precipitation on the spring discharge is more visible during the first period only (1970-1990). During the second period, winter precipitation seems to have more of an impact on the runoff for the same season. In the Mefou sub-basin, the precipitation plays an essentially amplifying role in the increase in discharge in the seasons during which they occur. Those having experienced an increase, or a maintenance of precipitation (summer and spring) recorded the most significant increases in discharges. These results could be useful for long-term planning on the demand and use of water, as well as flood management in the basins	[Ebode, Valentin Brice] Univ Yaounde I, Dept Geog, POB 755, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Ebode, Valentin Brice; Braun, Jean Jacques; Nnomo, Bernadette Nka] IRGM UY1 IRD, Int Joint Lab DYCOFAC, POB 4110, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Braun, Jean Jacques; Riotte, Jean] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Geosci Environm Toulouse, IRD, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Nnomo, Bernadette Nka] Hydrol Res Ctr, Inst Min & Geol Res IRGM, POB 4110, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Mahe, Gil] Univ Montpellier, IMT, CNRS, HydroSci Montpellier,IRD, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Nkiaka, Elias] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Riotte, Jean] Indian Inst Sci, Joint IRD IISc Lab, Indo French Cell Water Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India	University of Yaounde I; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of Sheffield; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore	Mahé, G (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, IMT, CNRS, HydroSci Montpellier,IRD, F-34095 Montpellier, France.	ebodebriso@gmail.com; jjbraun1@gmail.com; bnnomo@gmail.com; gil.mahe@ird.fr; e.nkiaka@sheffield.ac.uk; jeanriotte1@gmail.com	Riotte, Jean/K-7185-2017; BRAUN, Jean-Jacques/ABI-7098-2020; Valentin Brice, Ebode/HZM-3648-2023; Mahe, Gil/AAY-9002-2021	BRAUN, Jean-Jacques/0000-0003-2979-6164; Valentin Brice, Ebode/0000-0003-3307-4789; Mahe, Gil/0000-0002-0081-750X; Nkiaka, Elias/0000-0001-7362-9430	IRD (Research Institute for Developing Countries); LMI DYCOFAC, at Yaounde	IRD (Research Institute for Developing Countries); LMI DYCOFAC, at Yaounde	The authors wish to thank the Cameroonian authorities and national services of Meteorology and Hydrology, for providing data to the Joint International Laboratory (LMI) DYCOFAC.

With multiple studies raising serious concerns about climate shifts and aridity expansion in the region, this one aims to establish a new high-resolution classification for hydrology purposes based on Mediterranean-specific climate indices. This classification is useful in following up on hydrological (water resource management, floods, droughts, etc.) and ecohydrological applications such as Mediterranean agriculture. Olive cultivation is the characteristic agricultural practice of the Mediterranean region. The proposed approach includes the use of classic climatic indices and the definition of new climatic indices, mainly precipitation seasonality index I-s or evapotranspiration threshold S-PET, both in line with river flow regimes, a principal component analysis to reduce the number of indices, K-means classification to distribute them into classes, and finally the construction of a decision tree based on the distances to class kernels to reproduce the classification without having to repeat the whole process. The classification was set and validated by WorldClim-2 at 1 km high-resolution gridded data for the 1970-2000 baseline period and 144 stations' data over 30 to 120 years, both at monthly time steps. Climatic classes coincided with a geographical distribution in the Mediterranean ranging from the most seasonal and driest class 1 in the south to the least seasonal and most humid class 5 in the north, showing the climatic continuity from one place to another and enhancing the visibility of change trends. The MED-CORDEX ALADIN and CCLM historical and projected data at 12 and 50 km resolution simulated under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the 2070-2100 period served to assess the climate change impact on this classification by superimposing the projected changes on the baseline grid-based classification. RCP scenarios increase the seasonality index I-s by +80% and the aridity index I-Arid by +60% in the north and I-Arid by +10% without I-s change in the south, hence causing the wet season shortening and river regime modification with the migration north of moderate and extreme winter regimes instead of early spring regimes. The ALADIN and CCLM regional climate models (RCMs) have demonstrated an evolution of the Mediterranean region towards arid climate. The classes located to the north are slowly evolving towards moderate coastal classes, which might affect hydrologic regimes due to shorter humid seasons and earlier snowmelts. These scenarios might look favourable for Mediterranean cultivation; however, the expected impact on water resources and flow regimes will surely expand and directly hit ecosystems, food, health, and tourism, as risk is interconnected between domains. This kind of classification might be reproduced at the global scale, using the same or other climatic indices specific to each region, highlighting their physiographic characteristics and hydrological responses.

Evidence of Rice Cultivation in Primorye in the Middle Ages	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Southern Ussuriysk fortress; paleosol; phytoliths; cultural plants; natural environment; floods; B-Tm cryptotephra of Baitoushan Volcano; Southern Far East		A displaced paleosol layer presumably used for rice farming was found in the section under a rampart in the Southern Ussuriysk fortress. The paleosol was periodically flooded, as evidenced by diatoms from different environments. Bulliform rice phytoliths were found in the paleosol. The obtained range of radiocarbon dates made it possible to reconstruct the course of events. Based on a finding of B-Tm cryptotephra of the Baitoushan Volcano (946/947 CE), the rice field existed in the period between the middle of the tenth century and the construction of the fortress at the beginning of the twelfth century. The soil was transferred from the floodplain where soil profiles were formed in the Middle-Late Holocene under drier conditions than in the Middle Ages. The moisture increase in the Medieval Warm Period was favorable for the agriculture development, including the rice cultivation. The deposits formed during severe floods overlapped both the cultural layers and the paleosol of the rice field. It was likely one of the reasons for the end of rice cultivation along with the climate change towards cooling and a decrease in precipitation.	[Razzhigaeva, N. G.; Ganzey, L. A.; Grebennikova, T.

Through constructing the topological structure of flood control network and collecting the hydrological information from hydrological stations, this study proposes a Bayesian flood network model of Haihe river basin (Beisanhe and Yongdinghe river basin) to assess the flood risk. Flood Probability (FP) and Flood Network Cascade (flood network cascade) are proposed to characterize the vulnerability and flood cascade of flood control networks respectively. The accuracy of the flood cascade simulation of the Beisanhe river basin exceeds 80%, and the accuracy of the Yongdinghe river basin exceeds 85%. It is proved that the Bayesian network model proposed in this study has good simulation performance. The derived vulnerability assessment indicates that the central and southern regions of the Beisanhe River and Yongdinghe River basin are easily affected by floods at other nodes. The proposed Bayesian network modeling framework can also simulate the flood cascade in flood control infrastructure, so it can be used for scenario planning and real-time flood forecasting to provide information for flood management and operation.

This paper addresses this gap by developing and validating MCDA-GIS analysis to map how potential nature strategies could mitigate fiood hazard if applied within the Mun River Basin, Thailand. Through a literature review, the top three solutions for fiood and drought hazards were found: wetlands, re/ afforestation, and changing crop types. These strategies were reviewed and validated with a MCDA-GIS methodology, through land use change (LUC) maps to depict different future scenarios. The results found that fiood hazard did decrease when NBS were implemented in the catchment, especially for A/Reforestation, and to a greater extent when a combination of NBS were applied. This article provides specific insights into the current gaps of NBS publications, specifically considering the case of the Mun River Basin, Thailand.

J	Salem, A				Salem, Ariane			Wind of Change: How Climatic Disasters are Reshaping Opinions on Environmental Policy	REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE			English	Article						disaster; climate change; environmental policy; political attitudes	EXPERIENCE	Each individual in the United States is exposed on average to 9 climatic disasters during their lifetime, with possible effects on political attitude formation, in particular in the realm of environmental policies. Using data on the universe of hurricanes, floods and severe storms from 1953 to 2014, I show that exposure to disasters is a key determinant of support for environmental public action, and that it is lasting over the course of life. A standard deviation of climatic disaster in one's lifetime increases the probability of expressing a pro-environmental opinion by 9 percentage points and liberal views by 15 percentage points of a standard deviation. I show that the environmental effect is channeled by direct exposure in respondent's own county. Investigating heterogenous effects along the partisan lines of respondents reveal that it is mostly Democrats who are affected by the disaster experience, especially those living in red States. Results are also consistent with retrospective voting behaviors, as voters are more likely to punish governors who are ideologically less supportive of public action after a climate disaster. These results give ground for the growing evidence of polarization of US citizens on environmental issues.

Around 40 million people in the region are affected by the two hotspots, including populations in Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Emirates. Both hotspots encompass roughly 8212 km(2) and contribute 11% to 85% in 2005 and 2021, respectively, of the total SDS in the region. Dust physical (particle surface area and size percentages) and chemical (mineralogy, major and trace elements, and radionuclides) properties show close similarities between source and downwind samples during SDS originated solely from the two hotspots. Deposited dust size particles show a finning trend towards the north in the Middle East compared to the south. A comprehensive assessment of the chemical and physical properties of soil and dust samples was conducted as an essential step in developing and implementing a mitigation plan in order to establish a success story in reducing SDS, improving air quality, and benefiting the gulf countries and neighboring regions.

The study area is badly damaged by devastating flood in 2015. We assessed the flood susceptibility to northern coastal area of Tamil Nadu using various machine learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost (XGB), Rotation Forest (RTF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used to demarcate flooded areas using Sentinel-l and other multi-source geospatial data to generate influential factors. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) removes weak factors in this study. The flood susceptibility resultant map is classified into five classes: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The GBM algorithm attained high classification accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 92%. The study area is urbanized and vulnerable identifying flood inundation useful for effective planning and implementation.

J	Raman, G; Raman, G; Peng, JCH				Raman, Gururaghav; Raman, Gurupraanesh; Peng, Jimmy Chih-Hsien			Resilience of urban public electric vehicle charging infrastructure to flooding	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							STATIONS; IMPACT	An adequate charging infrastructure is key to enabling high personal electric vehicle (EV) adoption rates. However, urban flooding-whose frequency and intensity are increasing due to climate change-may be an impediment. Here, we study how geographically-correlated outages due to floods impact public EV charging networks in Greater London. While we find no appreciable impact on the ability of battery EVs to serve typical urban driving behaviors, we observe disproportionate stresses on chargers both near, and surprisingly significantly farther from, the flooded regions. For instance, we find over 50% increase in charger utilization and 260% increase in the distance to the nearest available charger in parts of Greater London over 10 km away. Concerningly, the impact is most concentrated on already-stressed sections of the network, underscoring the infrastructure's vulnerability. Finally, we develop and evaluate four strategies for city planners to enhance the flood resilience of cities' public EV charging networks. A study of how the Greater London electric vehicle charging network is affected by flooding reveals disproportionate impacts on already-stressed parts of the network, peaking as far as over 10 km away from the flooded regions.

Here, we show the first study to compare the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) on GHG emissions under continuously flooded irrigation (CF) and under intermittently flooded (IF) conditions. Elevated CO2 stimulated CH4 emissions under CF by 50% in a field experiment and by 46% in a pot experiment, but it had no effect under IF in both experiments. Elevated CO2 had no effect on N2O emissions in either the field or pot experiment. Rice root biomass, aboveground biomass and grain yield increased with eCO(2), but were not affected by water management. Elevated CO2 only stimulated the abundance of methanogens under CF, suggesting that increased soil O-2 availability with IF limited methanogenic activity under eCO(2). Our findings suggest that estimates of CH4 emissions from global rice agriculture with eCO(2) need to account for recent changes in water management.

Retreating glaciers, degrading permafrost and rapid mass movements on the one hand and glacier-related disasters, on the other hand, are the sentinels of these phenomena. In this study, we focus our attention on the Makalu Barun region in the Nepal Himalaya, and characterize four main morphoclimatic zones, building on repeated field surveys and interpretation of remote sensing imagery. We distinguish four distinct zones: (i) extreme glacial zone; (ii) glacial zone; (iii) periglacial zone; and (iv) seasonally cold/warm humid zone. While extreme glacial zone is stagnant in its area, remaining three zones have been experiencing areal/location changes associated with changing climate, glacier extent and permafrost distribution. We describe dominant geomorphic processes and typical landforms of these zones in detail, highlighting the role of mass wasting processes and far-reaching process chains acting across distinct morphoclimatic zones. The study provides evidence of very dynamic landform evolution which indicates extreme geomorphological hazards in the Nepal Himalaya.

The BWI time series is assessed for the development of its relationship with observed streamflow. Further, a popular ensemble learning technique, random forest, is employed to compute the 10-d streamflow using the BWI time series. Moreover, the results are compared with the classical rainfall-runoff model forced with satellite-based precipitation and evapotranspiration, BWI-rainfall-runoff model, and Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of multiple efficiency measures, viz. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results reveal the BWI-rainfall-runoff model is the most accurate model for prediction of discharge. The performance of the BWI-rainfall-runoff model is very good over four of six catchments and good to satisfactory over the remaining two catchments.

Here we combine climate models and species trait simulations to explore the degree to which differing palaeogeographic boundary conditions and differing magnitudes of cooling and glaciation can explain the relative intensity of marine extinction during greenhouse-icehouse transitions in the Late Ordovician and the Cenozoic. Simulations modelled the response of virtual species to cooling climate using a spatially explicit cellular automaton algorithm. We find that palaeogeography alone may be a contributing factor, as identical changes in meridional sea surface temperature gradients caused greater extinction in Late Ordovician simulations than in Cenozoic simulations. Differences in extinction from palaeogeography are significant, but by themselves are insufficient to explain observed differences in extinction intensity. However, when simulations included inferred changes in continental flooding and interval-specific models of sea surface temperature, predicted differences in relative extinction intensity were more consistent with observations from the fossil record. Our results support the hypothesis that intense extinction in the Late Ordovician is partially attributable to exceptionally rapid and severe cooling compared to Cenozoic events.

Unexpected functional diversity of stream biofilms within and across proglacial floodplains despite close spatial proximity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							BACTERIA; COMPONENT; ECOSYSTEM; COVERAGE; BIOMASS; ALGAE; TOOL	High-mountain streams are particularly vulnerable to climate change because they intimately interface with the cryosphere. As glaciers shrink and snowpack diminishes, proglacial streams will eventually shift from being glacier-fed to streams fed by groundwater, snowmelt and precipitation. This shift will affect both the flow regime and physico-chemical characteristics of streams, possibly also the structure and function of their benthic microbiome. Here, we applied genome-resolved metagenomics to benthic biofilms from glacier-fed streams and their groundwater-fed tributaries within three proglacial floodplains in the Swiss Alps. Despite the close spatial proximity between both stream types, their microbiome structure differed consistently for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The glacier-fed stream microbiome was taxonomically and functionally less diverse than its groundwater-fed counterpart, and had smaller genomes, but with conservation of the central metabolic functions primarily related to nitrogen and sulfur cycling. Consequently, much higher functional variability was associated with the microbiome of tributary streams, mainly due to abundant genes involved in the transport and degradation of organic matter. Our findings suggest that glacier shrinkage will cause shifts in the functioning of benthic microbiomes of proglacial floodplains with yet unknown consequences for downstream biogeochemistry.

One of the reasons for this is the attempted use by state, corporate and individual actors of smart technologies, discourses and practices to solve the urban challenges of flooding, traffic and waste management in the context of climate change and urbanisation. In this paper, we examine the efforts of the Jakarta Smart City programme and office to govern these challenges. Where smart cities are often described as offering speed and real-time efficiency, we instead find that the technologies and practices mobilised by the Jakarta Smart City programme govern by projecting, delaying and hypothesising into the future. We describe these governance strategies and outline three of their key forms: keeping track of objects and people, calculating and projecting state savings, and mundane watching but not acting. Rather than facilitating exacting and real-time policy responses to address these urban problems, these practices instead produce temporal relations of delay that push action further into the future. Building on existing research about futuring and anticipation, and the tempos and rhythms of smart cities, our contribution is to highlight slowness and delay as a key mode of governing.

In this study, we used Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) to analyze the nonstationary changes of annual maximum runoff in the HRB and its influencing factors. It has also been complemented with a stationary model for comparative analysis. We found that the annual maximum runoff has a significant decreasing trend. The top four factors influencing this runoff change are the local changes in pre-cipitation and temperature, and the regional climate oscillations as reflected by the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) and the Pacific North American Index (PNA). The nonstationary model had better simulation effect than the stationary model. The stationary model could not reflect the impact of explanatory variables on annual maximum runoff, while the nonstationary model could well analyze the impact of single and dual explanatory variables. The results of this study provide some new insights in support of flood prevention and control in the HRB.

We conducted a pre-registered incentivized online experiment with a sample of 769 UK residents to better understand solidarity behavior framed in the context of flooding. In the experiment, participants make costly adaptation decisions that reduce their own risk of endowment loss. Moreover, they can make solidarity transfers to affected partners if unaffected themselves. Participants are matched with a partner who takes adaptation decisions, too. We experimentally vary the adaptation costs of the partner to be either the same (control condition) or heterogenous (known or uncertain). In the control condition, participants show less solidarity with non-adapted partners than with adapted ones. On average, the heter-ogenous adaptation cost treatments do not significantly affect observed solidarity transfers. Explorative analyses indicate, however, that differences in transfers to adapted and non-adapted partners are mediated by one's adaptation behavior. Under known heterogenous adaptation costs, risk-averse players (who adapted themselves) show as much solidarity with adapted as with non-adapted partners. Overall, the results suggest that information about adaptation cost heteroge-neity may promote solidarity after exogenous shocks when people cannot easily adapt proactively.

Probabilistic modeling of sustainable urban drainage systems	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Runoff control; Flood risk mitigation; Sustainable urban drainage systems; Infiltration systems; Evapotranspiration systems; Rainwater harvesting systems; Analytical probabilistic approach; Residual storage	PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; DESIGN	Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) include strategies and solutions for distributed stormwater management and control. They are strongly encouraged, especially in highly urbanized areas that suffer the combined effect of impervious surfaces and the increase in extreme rainfall events due to urbanization growth and climate change. Their integration into traditional urban drainage systems can mitigate flood risk and pollution of receiving water bodies. The main goal of SUDS is to restore the natural water balance by increasing infiltration and evapotranspiration processes and promoting rainwater harvesting and reuse. This paper proposes an analytical-probabilistic approach for SUDS modeling applicable to different systems. Developed equations allow estimating the runoff and residual storage probability for evaluating the efficiency of the storage volume both in terms of flood control and, depending on SUDS type, in terms of emptying time or water needs supply. The modeling considers the possibility of consecutive chained rainfalls; this feature is relevant for SUDS, often characterized by low outflow rates. Relating characteristic parameters to a probabilistic level (the Average Return Interval, ARI) makes the formulas interesting to be used in the design practice. An application to two case studies confirmed the goodness of the proposed method.	[Raimondi, A.; Di Chiano, M.

Such positive WPSH anomalies can be induced by central Pacific (CP) cold sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies of an incipient La Nina and warm anomalies in the Indian and/or the tropical Atlantic Ocean, both promoting anticyclonic anomalies over the northwestern Pacific region. How variability of the WPSH, its extremity, and the associated mechanisms might respond to greenhouse warming remains elusive. Using outputs from 32 of the latest climate models, here we show an increase in WPSH variability translating into a 73% increase in frequency of strong WPSH events under a business-as-usual emission scenario, supported by a strong intermodel consensus. Under greenhouse warming, response of tropical atmosphere convection to CP SST anomalies increases, as does the response of the northwestern Pacific anticyclonic circulation. Thus, climate extremes such as floods in the Yangtze River Valley of East China associated with WPSH variability are likely to be more frequent and more severe.

Instead of fully avoiding flood-prone areas, an optimized placement considering the magnitude of flood inundations can minimize the impact of flood hazards and simultaneously maximize the socio-economic benefit of EV charging station networks. In this study, an integrated framework of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is proposed to optimize the charging station locations by maximizing the charging convenience, minimizing the impact of flood hazards, and minimizing the impact of existing charging stations. The NSGA-III is applied to solve the multi-objective location optimization of charging stations. TOPSIS is subsequently used to determine the best solution from the feasible candidates generated by the NSGA-III. A case study conducted in the Waikiki area demonstrates that the proposed optimization framework can effectively deal with the trade-off between the impact of flood hazards and the charging service of a charging station network. This study provides new insights into best practices for dealing with multiple conflicting objectives in EV charging station planning under climate change.

Such curves are obtained through frequency analysis of rainfall data and commonly used in infrastructure design, flood protection, water management, and urban drainage systems. However, they are typically available only in sparse locations. Data for other sites must be interpolated as the need arises. This paper describes how extreme precipitation of several durations can be interpolated to compute IDF curves on a large, sparse domain. In the absence of local data, a reconstruction of the historical meteorology is used as a covariate for interpolating extreme precipitation characteristics. This covariate is included in a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model for extreme precipitations. This model is especially well suited for a covariate gridded structure, thereby enabling fast and precise computations. As an illustration, the methodology is used to construct IDF curves over Eastern Canada. An extensive cross-validation study shows that at locations where data are available, the proposed method generally improves on the current practice of Environment and Climate Change Canada which relies on a moment-based fit of the Gumbel extreme-value distribution.

Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using key informant interviews, household surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs) and field observations. Quantitative data from the questionnaire survey were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), whilst, qualitative data were exposed to content analysis. Rainfall and temperature trends were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and the significance of the trends determined using Mann-Kendall and CUSUM analysis. Most respondents (78%) revealed decreased rainfall amounts and changed onset, and 94% reported increased temperature. Farmers disclosed that droughts and floods are major climatic stresses in the area; this was substantiated by observed increasing and decreasing temperature and rainfall trends respectively. This corroborated with most respondents who perceived decreased rainfall amounts and changed onset, and reported increased temperature levels. Response strategies include crop diversification and drought-resistant crop varieties, migration, abandoning some crops, and short-cycle crops. However, smallholder farmers have been failing to effectively address climatic challenges. We argue that they are still heavily reliant on social, economic, and policy support to improve their adaptive capacity, particularly, transformative responses.

The framework is applied to an urban catchment, namely Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The rainfall-runoff analysis was conducted for extreme rainfalls for historic (2016) and future events in 2050 and 2064 under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 6.0 and 8.5. The simulation-optimization approach in the historic scenario yielded 495,607 BMPs occupying 76.99 km(2) resulting in runoff reduction of 21.54 mm (198.76-177.22 mm). Achieved runoff reduction is 38.72 (428.35-389.63 mm) and 55.03 (602.65-547.62 mm), respectively, for RCPs 6.0 and 8.5, which could meet the water demands of GHMC for 10.33 and 11.53 days. Impacts of 10 different BMP configurations of varying costs (10-70%) and pollutant load reductions (0-3%) on runoff reduction are accomplished as part of sensitivity analysis.	[Madhuri, R.; Raja, Y.

Some of the most ecologically important arid deltas include the Colorado, Indus, Nile, and Tigris-Euphrates. The primary stressors vary globally, but these deltas are threatened by increased salinization, water storage and diversion, eutrophication, and wetland loss. In order to make these deltas sustainable over time, some water flow, including seasonal flooding, needs to be re-established. Positive impacts have been seen in the Colorado River delta after flows to the delta were increased. In addition to increasing freshwater flow, collaboration among stakeholders and active management are necessary. For the Nile River, cooperation among different nations in the Nile drainage basin is important. River flow into the Tigris-Euphrates River delta has been affected by politics and civil strife in the Middle East, but some flow has been re-allocated to the delta. Studies commissioned for the Indus River delta recommended re-establishment of some monthly water flow to maintain the river channel and to fight saltwater intrusion. However, accelerating climate impacts, socio-political conflicts, and growing populations suggest a dire future for arid deltas.

In response, managing authorities may increase frequency and intensity of aquatic plant removal (weed cutting) to lower the water level in rivers possibly impairing physical and hydromorphological stream conditions. We studied 32 Danish lowland streams subjected to three different weed cutting practices, representing a gradient in weed cutting intensity, and uncut controls to compare physical and hydromorphological habitat quality parameters among stream groups. Moreover, we measured short-term changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and suspended sediment (SS) transport in two streams before, during, and just after weed cutting for the least and most pervasive weed cutting method, respectively. Our results indicated a lower habitat quality affiliated with increasing intensity of weed cutting practice, notably an association with silt cover at the expense of hard substrate. DO concentrations were relatively unaltered but an abrupt increase in SS transport comparable to storm events was observed during cutting with the most pervasive method. Our results indicate that ecological and hydromorphological effects of high intensity weed cutting should be carefully studied and considered before large scale implementation.

Frequent historical YR flooding events, however, have resulted in tremendous loss of life and property, whereas in recent decades YR runoff and sediment load have fallen sharply. To put these recent changes in a longer-term context, we reconstructed natural runoff for the middle reach of the YR back to 1492 CE using a network of 31 moisture-sensitive treering width chronologies. Prior to anthropogenic interference that started in the 1960s, the lowest natural runoff over the past 500 y occurred during 1926 to 1932 CE, a drought period that can serve as a benchmark for future planning of YR water allocation. Since the late 1980s, the low observed YR runoff has exceeded the natural range of runoff variability, a consequence of the combination of decreasing precipitation and increasing water consumption by direct and indirect human activities, particularly agricultural irrigation. This reduced runoff has resulted in an estimated 58% reduction of the sediment load in the upper reach of the YR and 29% reduction in the middle reach.

However, such investments tend to be made in the aftermath of disasters. Very little is known about the proactive planning of flood protection investments that account for uncertainties associated with flooding events. Understanding the uncertainties such as "when" to invest on these structures to achieve the most optimal cost-saving amount is outmost important. This study fills this large knowledge gap by developing an investment decision-making assessment framework that determines an optimal timing of flood protection investment options. It combines real options with a net present value analysis to examine managerial flexibility in various investment timing options. Historical data that contain information about river water discharges were leveraged as a random variable in the modeling framework because it may help investors better understand the probability of extreme events, and particularly, flooding uncertainties. A lattice model was then used to investigate potential alternatives of investment timing and to evaluate the benefits of delaying investments in each case. The efficacy of the proposed framework was demonstrated by an illustrative example of flood protection investment. The framework will be used to help better inform decision makers.

This paper contributes to study the urban flooding control and water quality management with the implementation of DTs and LIDs in the USDS. A many-objective optimization (MOO) based design framework and analysis method is developed for achieving four objectives of USDS design. A realistic USDS is adopted for the case study, in which the DTs and LIDs are implemented by this extended MOO-based design method to achieve the optimal result of flooding risk control and water quality improvement. The obtained results are further analyzed for the characteristics of flooding risk control and water quality component evolution in the USDS. The results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the designed DTs and LIDs to mitigate the flooding risk and improve water quality in USDS.

It is one of the more important components in the hydrological cycle and surface energy balance (SEB). How to accurately estimate AET especially for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with complex terrain remains a challenge for the scientific community. Using multi-sensor remote sensing data, meteorological forcing data, and field observations, AET was derived for the Nagqu river basin of the Northern Tibetan Plateau from a surface energy balance system (SEBS) model. As inputs for SEBS, improved algorithms and datasets for land surface albedo and a cloud-free normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were also constructed. The model-estimated AET were compared with results by using the combinatory method (CM). The validation indicated that the model estimates of AET agreed well with the correlation coefficient, the root mean square error, and the mean percentage error of 0.972, 0.052 mm/h, and -10.4%, respectively. The comparison between SEBS estimation and CM results also proved the feasibility of parameterization schemes for land surface parameters and AET.

We set out to study how spatial design based on pathways thinking can help develop more adaptive and sustainable landscapes. Using landscape analysis, field research, and research-through-designing in a case study on climate resilience in Boston (USA), we argue for better understanding of the spatial and design consequences of pathways in general. Our results indicate that pathways can be spatially translated, demanding landscape-informed choices when sequencing different policy actions. We found that spatial designing makes the landscape consequences of pathways transparent and enables policy-makers to replace the input of policy actions with spatial interventions, select pathways according to different underlying design strategies, use the mapped pathways to initiate an iterative research-through-designing process to test and inform different designs, and spatially visualize the pathways and possible sequences of actions. We conclude that policy-makers should be cognizant about the spatial implications of pathways and offer directions to enrich applications of pathways thinking for achieving adaptive and sustainable landscapes.

Plio-Pleistocene Southwest African Hydroclimate Modulated by Benguela and Indian Ocean Temperatures	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						hydroclimate; leaf waxes; Pliocene; Benguela upwelling system	HYDROGEN-ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WAX N-ALKANES; HADLEY CIRCULATION; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; UPWELLING SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAF-WAXES; PLIOCENE; RATIOS	Future projections of southwestern African hydroclimate are highly uncertain. However, insights from past warm climates, like the Pliocene, can reveal mechanisms of future change and help benchmark models. Using leaf wax hydrogen isotopes to reconstruct precipitation (& delta;Dp) from Namibia over the past 5 million years, we find a long-term depletion trend (-50 & PTSTHOUSND;). Empirical mode decomposition indicates this trend is linked to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) within the Benguela Upwelling System, but modulated by Indian Ocean SSTs on shorter timescales. The influence of SSTs on reconstructed regional hydroclimate is similar to that observed during modern Benguela Nin & SIM; $\tilde{n}$o events, which bring extreme flooding to the region. Isotope-enabled simulations and PlioMIP2 results suggest that capturing a Benguela Nin & SIM; $\tilde{n}$o-like state is key to accurately simulating Pliocene, and future, regional hydroclimate. This has implications for future regional climate, since an increased frequency of Benguela Nin & SIM; $\tilde{n}$os poses risk to the ecosystems and industries in the region. Rainfall in southwestern Africa will likely be impacted by human-caused climate change, but climate models disagree on whether the region will get wetter or drier as the planet warms. Previous studies, which used plant pollen preserved in ocean sediment, tell us that southwestern Africa was wetter during the Pliocene, a warm period approximately 5.3 to 2.5 million-years-ago, and got drier over time as Earth cooled. This drying is thought to be caused by a concurrent decrease in temperatures within the eastern South Atlantic Ocean. In this study we measure hydrogen isotopes in ancient plant matter and use statistical tools which indicate that rainfall patterns in southwestern Africa are also impacted by changes in Indian Ocean temperatures. This combined Atlantic and Indian Ocean influence is similar to events that we observe in modern times where areas of arid southwestern Africa get short bouts of very strong rainfall when the coastal waters warm. The area that gets strong rainfall depends on where the warm water occurs along the western coast and whether there's also warmer- or colder-than-normal water in the Indian Ocean. If the Pliocene ocean temperature patterns resembled these events, we may need to do further studies to determine whether they will become more common in the future. Plio-Pleistocene changes in the hydrogen stable isotopic signature of leaf waxes from Southern Africa are linked to Benguela temperaturesHigher frequency shifts in the record are likely driven by Indian Ocean temperatures via a mechanism observed in the modernIsotope-enabled simulations suggest that capturing this mechanism may be key to accurately simulating past and future regional hydroclimate	[Rubbelke, Claire B.; Bhattacharya, Tripti] Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Feng, Ran] Univ Connecticut, Dept Earth Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [Knapp, Scott] George Mason Univ, Atmospher Ocean & Earth Sci, Fairfax, VA USA; [Mcclymont, Erin L.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England	Syracuse University; University of Connecticut; George Mason University; Durham University	Rubbelke, CB (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.	crubbelk@syr.edu	Feng, Ran/HPE-3363-2023; McClymont, Erin/AAX-3657-2020	McClymont, Erin/0000-0003-1562-8768; Knapp, Scott/0000-0002-9539-2937; Burls, Natalie/0000-0002-6950-3808; Rubbelke, Claire/0000-0002-6856-9450	TB and CR acknowledge funding support from NSF Grants Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) OCE-1903148 and OCE-2103015.

Invasive species were thus introduced into the Americas, displacing native inhabitants. Timber was felled for ship building and provisioning for agriculture, resulting in a mass land conversion for the purposes of crop cultivation. As European colonization expanded, landscapes were further modified to mitigate against floods and droughts via the building of dams and levees. Resources have been exploited, and native populations have been overfished to the point of collapse. The resultant population explosion has also resulted in wide-spread pollution of aquatic resources, particularly following the industrial and agricultural revolutions. Collectively, these activities have influenced the climate and the climate, in turn, has exacerbated the effects of these activities. Thus, the anthropogenic fingerprints are undeniable, but relatively speaking, which of these transformative factors has contributed most significantly to the decline of freshwater fishes in North America? This manuscript attempts to address this question by comparing and contrasting the preeminent drivers contributing to freshwater fish declines in this region in order to provide context and perspective. Ultimately, an evaluation of the available data makes clear that habitat loss, obstruction of streams and rivers, invasive species, overexploitation, and eutrophication are the most important drivers contributing to freshwater fish declines in North America. However, pesticides remain a dominant causal narrative in the popular media, despite technological advancements in pesticide development and regulation. Transitioning from organochlorines to organophosphates/ carbamates, to pyrethroids and ultimately to the neonicotinoids, toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of pesticides have all steadily decreased over time. Concomitantly, regulatory frameworks designed to assess corresponding pesticide risks in Canada and the USA have become increasingly more stringent and intensive. Yet, comparatively, habitat loss continues unabated as agricultural land is ceded to the frontier of urban development, globalized commerce continues to introduce invasive species into North America, permanent barriers in the form of dams and levees remain intact, fish are still being extracted from native habitats (commercially and otherwise), and the climate continues to change. How then should we make sense of all these contributing factors? Here, we attempt to address this issue.
