India, as an example, has a national action plan for climate change and human health. Sub-national (State) plans for climate change also exist, taking into account the health sector. The State of Bihar was selected for assessment because of its vulnerability (a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity). A vulnerability framework was constructed by discussions with national and local-level specialists followed by weightage given by working in the field of climate and health with international exposure. A total of 15 districts were at a high risk of floods and these were considered for detailed analysis using the methodology for human development index as well as other examples in the field of environment. Climate health vulnerability index score were correlated with actual prevalence of flood mortality data of these 15 districts in year 2016. It was found that climate health vulnerability and flood mortality had negative low correlation of -0.25. In contrast for vector-borne diseases (VBD), both pre-flood and post-flood, the morbidity data had a correlation of 0.24 and 0.11 respectively. Possible reasons for a negative correlation for mortality could involve better preparedness by disaster district authorities. However, outbreak control is within the ambit of the health sector where a possible reason for decreased correlation coefficient in the post-flood period could be due to the impact on health facilities itself, thus leading to reduced reporting.

To assess the implications of a severe drought in Finland, we carried out a national scale drought impact analysis. Firstly, we simulated water levels and discharges during the severe drought of 1939-1942 (the reference drought) in present-day Finland with a hydrological model. Secondly, we estimated how climate change would alter droughts. Thirdly, we assessed the impact of drought on key water use sectors, with a focus on hydropower and water supply. The results indicate that the long-lasting reference drought caused the discharges to decrease at most by 80% compared to the average annual minimum discharges. The water levels generally fell to the lowest levels in the largest lakes in Central and South-Eastern Finland. Climate change scenarios project on average a small decrease in the lowest water levels during droughts. Severe drought would have a significant impact on water-related sectors, reducing water supply and hydropower production. In this way drought is a risk multiplier for the water-energy-food security nexus. We suggest that the resilience to droughts could be improved with region-specific drought management plans and by including droughts in existing regional preparedness exercises.

This article presents a case study on the implementation of a permeable interlocking concrete paving (PICP) system, and it develops physical-mathematical modeling using software for the design of a parking lot that currently does not have adequate paving and urban drainage, resulting in sporadic flooding due to heavy rainfall in the city of Temuco, La Araucania region, Chile. This article's contribution highlights the application of new technology in Chile, discussing road infrastructure solutions based on sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDSs), which seek to implement feasible alternatives in urban sectors to improve human livelihood. The factors studied include structural and hydrological properties, along with the infiltration analysis of the system according to historical rainfall records in the area. This research concludes that the permeable pavement system with a drainage pipe and smooth roughness coefficient performs satisfactorily for an extreme hydrometeorological event corresponding to 140 mm considering 24 h of rainfall with a return period of 100 years equivalent to an inflow of 673 m3/day. Finally, the results indicate that, at least in the conditions of the city of Temuco, the use of permeable interlocking concrete pavement (PICP) proves to be a sustainable and feasible alternative to implementing measures of adaptation and mitigation against climate change, reducing the city's flooding zones and allowing the irrigation of urban green areas.

J	Yang, HT; Zhang, ZZ; Liu, X; Jing, PX				Yang, Haitao; Zhang, Zhizheng; Liu, Xi; Jing, Pengxu			Monthly-scale hydro-climatic forecasting and climate change impact evaluation based on a novel DCNN-Transformer network	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Hydrological prediction; Climate change impact assessment; Monthly runoff forecast; Transformer; Time series forecasting	SHARED SOCIOECONOMIC PATHWAYS	Climate change has emerged as one of the foremost global challenges confronting humanity today, leading to a heightened frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena, including droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall patterns. Accurately predicting changes in runoff patterns under future climate conditions holds sig-nificant importance for effective regional water resource planning and management. Recent research on runoff forecast has centered on optimizing hyperparameters of ELM, RNN, LSTM models using PSO, GWO, SSA, and other algorithms. Additionally, key features are extracted through input variable decomposition and pre-processing methods like EMD, EEMD, and VMD. However, these approaches have difficulties in extracting the long-term dependencies information of sequence units, parallel computing, and hyperparameter sensitivity. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a novel end-to-end deep runoff prediction model based on deep convolutional neural network and Transformer (DCTN). The deep convolutional modules of DCTN employs the deep convolutional operation to extract local features of climate data while the Transformer of DCTN makes full use of self-attention to capture the long-term dependencies, which can achieve more accurate runoff predictions. Experiments on historical runoff forecasting at the Shanjiaodi hydrology station in the Dagu River Basin show that the proposed DCTN obtains a notable improvement of approximately 30.9% compared to traditional models. Based on the prediction results of three shared socioeconomic pathways, the potential impacts of climate change on runoff in Dagu River Basin were evaluated using the DCTN model. The results reveal that the likelihood of spring floods is substantially amplified in the mid-century and late-century, while the probability of extreme summer runoff diminishes. This study advances the understanding of runoff prediction and its implications under changing climate scenarios, paving the way for more informed decision-making and effective water resource management strategies.

Based on previous studies on climate change and vulnerability in Taipei, Taiwan, this study explores the correlations between place attachment and individual attributes of residents in different vulnerable areas in Taipei. First, this study investigates the integrated vulnerability (IV) of 12 districts of Taipei by overlaying natural vulnerability (NV) and social vulnerability (SV). This study selects four districts with high IV and low IV in Taipei, and with a large proportion of flooded areas, as the study sites. Second, a questionnaire survey (600 respondents) is conducted to examine the correlations between place attachment and the individual attributes of the respondents (age, residence duration, disaster experience, and education) in the four districts. Third, factor analyses are carried out to categorize place attachment into four factors: "security," "familiarity," "belongingness," and "rootedness." Finally, whether different factors have different relationships with place attachment are elucidated. The results show no consistent correlations between place attachment and individual attributes in areas with different vulnerabilities. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations before and after factor analyses of place attachment, among the four factors of place attachment (security, familiarity, belongingness, rootedness), there are no factors significantly relating to overall place attachment. This study further examines the mediator effect between risk experience and place attachment. The results show no mediator effects in the relationships of "perception -> place attachment -> coping behavior" and "attitude -> place attachment -> coping behavior." Follow-up studies can elucidate factor analyses of place attachment and examine the effect of geographical scale (neighborhood, district, and city) on place attachment.

This study used future climate data of general circulation models (GCMs) to investigate the impacts of climate change during the future period (2062-2095) relative to the historical period (1981-2014) on the hydrological system of the Minjiang river watershed, China. A previously calibrated soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was employed to simulate the future hydrology under the impacts of changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentration for four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP 1, 2, 3, and 5) of the CMIP6. The study revealed that the impacts of increase in future temperature, i.e., increase in ET, and decrease in surface runoff, water, and sediment yield will be countered by increased atmospheric [CO2], and changes in the hydrological parameters in the future will be mostly associated to changes in precipitation. Data of the GCMs for all the SSPs predicts increase in precipitation of the watershed, which will cause increase in surface runoff, water yield, and sediment yield. Surface runoff will increase more in SSP 5 (47%), while sediment and water yield will increase more in SSP 1, by 33% and 23%, respectively. At the seasonal scale, water yield and surface runoff will increase more in autumn and winter in SSP 1, while in other scenarios, these parameters will increase more in the spring and summer seasons. Sediment yield will increase more in autumn in all scenarios. Similarly, the future climate change is predicted to impact the important parameters related to the flow regime of the Minjiang river, i.e., the frequency and peak of large floods (flows > 14,000 m(3)/s) will increase along the gradient of scenarios, i.e., more in SSP 5 followed by 3, 2, and 1, while duration will increase in SSP 5 and decrease in the other SSPs. The frequency and duration of extreme low flows will increase in SSP 5 while decrease in SSP 1. Moreover, peak of extreme low flows will decrease in all scenarios except SSP 1, in which it will increase. The study will improve the general understanding about the possible impacts of future climate change in the region and provide support for improving the management and protection of the watershed's water and soil resources.

This study examined the effects of climate change on the high flow conditions in the Great Miami River Watershed in Ohio under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Streamflow for the 21st century was simulated by utilizing a watershed model - SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and 10 different climate outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). The future streamflow was divided into three equal periods: 2016-2043 (early century), 2044-2071 (mid-century), and 2072-2099 (late century) and independently analyzed to compare high flows of respective intervals with baseline periods (1988-2015). The analysis predicted that 7-day, 10-year high-flow (7Q10) would increase by 38% under RCP 4.5 and 44% under RCP 8.5. Similarly, the annual peak flows for study periods were predicted to increase by 26% under RCP 4.5 and 38% under RCP 8.5 from the base period. However, the analysis demonstrated an erratic response for monthly peaks indicating that the peak flow would increase in summer months - May and July to October. Meanwhile, the result did not show any significant increase during the winter season, especially from November to April. The analysis of the four major dams located in the watershed showed that the dam's peak discharges increase in January, May, and September. Even though increasing peaks were projected in September for the 21st century, the monthly peaks from the watershed outlet were found to be lowest in September as compared to other months. The frequency of future flooding compared to the historical record was found to be increasing in the mid-century under RCP 4.5 and the late century under RCP 8.5. As the future flood is projected to increase, this study fmds the reasonable impact of climate change on flood regulating reservoirs/dams in monthly flows. However, daily high flows (90th percentile flow) would be increasing significantly (44% to 250%) under RCP 8.5.

J	Buma, B; Schultz, C				Buma, Brian; Schultz, Courtney			Disturbances as opportunities: Learning from disturbance-response parallels in social and ecological systems to better adapt to climate change	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; disturbance; ecology; natural disaster; resilience; social-ecological systems; transformation	RESILIENCE; RESTORATION; RANGE; MIGRATION; BIODIVERSITY; GOVERNANCE; LANDSCAPE; IMPACTS; SHIFTS; STRATEGIES	Disturbances (e.g. fires, floods, windstorms, landslides and tsunamis) are ubiquitous throughout the world. Many social and ecological systems have resilience mechanisms to accommodate and recover from such events. Yet, in an era of directional climate change, adaptation (rather than recovery to the same state) may be the most logical path. In such cases, disturbances, while often unwelcome, may function as opportunities for change. We synthesize the literature on disturbances and adaptation to climate change for both ecological and social systems, attempting to find commonalities and situations where disturbances present adaptation opportunities. We also identify three major characteristics of systems that may drive differential potential for success going forward: their overall richness of actors, their functional overlap in diversity, and their temporal rate of change. Social systems are better positioned to successfully take advantage of disturbance-generated opportunities to adapt when they support collaboration of diverse interests and engage in pre-disturbance response planning to seize opportunities when they arise. Ecological systems are well-positioned for adaptation when they are diverse, populated with species that are tolerant of post-disturbance environments, and when life-history traits are well-matched with the temporal and spatial distribution of those disturbances. Social systems with a lack of planning and inclusive participation and where powerful actors are resistant to change are less able to take advantage of disturbances as adaptational opportunities; ecological systems that are less diverse (spatially and in regards to species composition), especially those dominated by late successional species, are similarly constrained. Overall, we find that disturbances can create opportunities for adaptation when the ecology and social systems are aligned but there are also many situations where this is not true, depending on initial conditions, temporal pace of disturbance and system characteristics. Policy implications. Disturbances, while damaging and often catastrophic in the short term, present climate adaptation opportunities because they can spur reorganization towards climatically suitable systems. Policy makers and advocates should carefully consider current social and ecological conditions, specifically how they will reorganize post-disturbance, and explore the options available to prepare and take advantage of (inevitable) future disturbances.

The changing characteristics of extreme events are widely attributed to climate change. However, given this region's long history of floods and droughts, the role of natural climate variability cannot be rejected without a careful diagnosis. Here, we examine how oceanic and atmospheric variability has contributed to unusual precipitation distributions in West South Asia. Variations in sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific and northern Arabian Sea, and internal atmospheric variability related to the circumglobal teleconnection pattern and the subtropical westerly jet stream, explain more than 70% of monthly summer precipitation variability in the 21st century. Several of these forcings have co-occurred with record strength during episodes of extreme monsoons, which have exacerbated the overall effect. Climate change may have contributed to increased variability and the in-phase co-occurrences of the identified mechanisms, but further research is required to confirm any such connection.

However, progress on this issue is hampered by incomplete GLOF inventories, especially in remote mountain regions. Here, we exploit high-resolution, multi-temporal satellite and aerial imagery, and documentary data to identify GLOF events across the glacierized Cordilleras of Peru and Bolivia, using a set of diagnostic geomorphic features. A total of 160 GLOFs from 151 individual sites are characterised and analysed, tripling the number of previously reported events. We provide statistics on location, magnitude, timing and characteristics of these events with implications for regional GLOF hazard identification and assessment. Furthermore, we describe several cases in detail and document a wide range of process chains associated with Andean GLOFs.

In this study, we propose urban disaster prevention plans based on the classification and characterization of flood vulnerable areas reflecting demographic changes. Data on the property damage, casualties, and flooded area between 2009 and 2018 in 229 municipalities in South Korea were collected and analyzed, and 74 flood vulnerable areas were selected. The demographic change in the selected areas from 2000 to 2018 was examined through comparative analyses of the population size, rate of population change, and population change proportion by age group and gender. Flood vulnerable areas were categorized into three types through K-mean cluster analysis. Based on the analysis results, a strategic plan was proposed to provide information necessary for establishing regional flood-countermeasure policies.

Nature-based Solutions in Bangladesh: Evidence of Effectiveness for Addressing Climate Change and Other Sustainable Development Goals	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Review						nature-based solutions; Bangladesh; climate change adaptation; climate change mitigation; resilience; sustainable development goals; governance; climate policy	CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS; CHANGE ADAPTATION; AGROFORESTRY; SYSTEMS; TILLAGE; CONSERVATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; FORESTRY; PROFITABILITY	Many lower-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and climate change, due to their geographical location and high levels of poverty. In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.

However, few studies have assessed if and how households and individuals have actually taken action in this regard. Because some individual beliefs can be linked to facilitating factors and barriers to action, a better understanding of the adoption of adaptive behaviors requires a combined analysis of individual psychosocial factors. The purpose of this study was to develop a better understanding of the reasons underlying the adoption of behaviors related to structural adaptation to flooding by people living in or near flood-prone areas in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Results of a series of structural equation modeling showed that behavioral, normative and control beliefs were all significant predictors of the respondents' intention to adopt structural flood protective behaviors, with normative beliefs being the strongest. By identifying the best psychosocial predictors of the adoption of such behaviors, the results of this study provide valuable insights regarding the most effective factors to be used in public health messages to promote the adoption of behaviors related to structural adaptation to flooding.

Historical documents were used to reconstruct a drought and flood grade series for the Hexi Corridor from 0 to 1950 AD. The moving average and wavelet transform processing methods were used to determine the temporal evolution characteristics of droughts and floods, as well as the corresponding relationships with climate change and human activities in the Hexi Corridor after 1000 AD. The results showed the occurrence of eight drought phases (370-410 AD, 790-870 AD, 1050-1150 AD, 1260-1340 AD, 1430-1570 AD, 1710-1770 AD, 1800-1890 AD, and 1910-1950 AD), five flood phases (320-360 AD, 1670-710 AD, 1730-1790 AD, 1810-1860 AD, and 1880-1950 AD), and 3 oscillation periods of drought and flood events. Climate change may have been the main factor inducing droughts and floods before 1580 AD, whereas human activities may have increased the frequency of droughts and floods after the 16th century. Therefore, quantifying the impacts of natural factors and human activities on droughts and floods can provide important theoretical guidance for the prevention and reduction of future disasters.

How to deal with stormwater runoff is not only affected by local factors, but also by the surrounding land consumption. Therefore, it becomes particularly difficult to clarify the responsibility for the runoff. This study constructed a guiding planning framework for runoff distribution from the perspective of fairness. This framework established an evaluation method for regional unbalanced development through the coupling relationship between local coupling and telecoupling and multi-regional input-output, and used the evaluation results as a basis for realizing fair distribution of the increment of stormwater runoff, thereby clarifying the attribution of runoff responsibilities. The main conclusions about watershed of Dajiaxi are: (I) Compared with urbanization, climate change is the main factor causing the increase in stormwater runoff. (II) From the perspective of the coupling relationship, the external system needs to share 70.7% of the runoff increment, the midstream and downstream need to share 4.88% and 23.44% of the total runoff, while the upstream only needs to share 1.39% of the total runoff. The results of this study provide a foundation for the medium-scale runoff distribution planning.

In the Mediterranean, it is now established that extreme precipitation could increase in future climate scenarios, following the trend already started in the observed data. Nevertheless, the trends observed in the South of France indicate a decrease in the frequency of floods in the majority of the basins, despite the increase in intense precipitation causing these episodes, due to the decrease in soil moisture which can strongly modulate the hydrological response of the basins. Conversely, a trend towards an increase in the intensity of the most extreme floods is observed in some basins. It is indeed imperative to differentiate the behavior of different types of basins, urban, natural or agricultural, at different scales, in the face of changes in the regime of extreme rainfall. Although a lot of work has been done to estimate future climatic conditions, we are not well aware of the possible modifications of hydrological variables and surface conditions, with complex interactions between precipitation and infiltration processes on hillslopes, which can strongly modulate the magnitude of floods. It is therefore necessary to better understand and quantify the hydrological response in a context of climatic and anthropogenic changes.

Both concepts are known to be inter-linked and inter-dependent in disaster risk science as well as climate change adaptation literature. However, a holistic relationship between these two concepts is rarely studied which this research aims to assess by conducing an empirical study in Pakistan in the context of rural flooding. A total of 120 samples are collected using household survey from four rural communities in two different districts. Indicators are chosen through rigorous literature review and categorized into human, social, economic, physical and natural assets. A total of 24 and 19 indicators for vulnerability and capacity respectively are used to develop the resultant index. Results show that the two analyzed districts have a similar pattern of vulnerabilities; however, in both districts, capacities differ with respect to different livelihood categories. A significant negative correlation is observed in the study area which confirms the relationship theorized in literature between vulnerability and capacity. The methodology adopted in this study can also be replicated to pragmatically validate the relationship between both of these concepts for future extreme climatic events and disasters.

Preparing for the Future Impacts of Megastorms on Archaeological Sites: An Evaluation of Flooding from Hurricane Harvey, Houston, Texas	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY			English	Article						coastal vulnerability analysis; remote sensing; geographic information systems; super storm; hurricane recovery	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CULTURAL-HERITAGE	Powerful hurricanes in 2017-Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria-were stark examples of how these previously rare catastrophes are becoming increasingly normal due to climate change, with dire consequences for cultural resources. These storms, sometimes called megastorms or superstorms, were the first in which high-resolution satellite imagery was available in the immediate aftermath, providing a new tool for rapidly evaluating damage to archaeological sites. Using Hurricane Harvey as a case study, we examined two recent spatial models of archaeological site vulnerability to long-term climate change to determine whether these models are also adequate for predicting the impacts of short-term climate catastrophes. We further examined a number of individual variables that we expected to be useful in predicting which sites would be most vulnerable to flooding, such as proximity to rivers, the coast, or the floodplain. Neither the models nor the individual variables correlated well to increased risk to archaeological sites, with the exception of land use. Sites located within developed areas benefited from measures to protect property and were less often flooded. We suggest that strategies for responding to megastorms would be most effective through a combination of preparedness, analysis of remote sensing data, and existing field research methods.

J	Janiszek, M; Krzysztofik, R				Janiszek, Monika; Krzysztofik, Robert			Green Infrastructure as an Effective Tool for Urban Adaptation-Solutions from a Big City in a Postindustrial Region	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						adaptation; climate resilience; green infrastructures; urban resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; BARRIERS; BENEFITS; IMPACT; CITIES; STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; DRIVERS; POLICY	Adaptation to climate change is becoming one of the main paradigms for how cities function and develop. The significant role of green infrastructure (GI) as a tool for cities to adapt to climate change is increasingly emphasized among practitioners of spatial planning and in the research literature. Thus, despite the local impact, green infrastructure planning necessitates the creation of a holistic and integrated city management system. The aim of the article is to identify the effects generated by projects implemented in the field of green infrastructure in big cities of post-industrial regions and to formulate determinants and barriers limiting the strengthening of cities' adaptive capacity to climate change. In the methodological dimension, the article is based on the desk-research method (analysis of project documentation and specialist literature), logical reasoning and the case study method, enriched with a series of interviews and observation of the study area to present the selected projects implemented as part of green infrastructure. Solutions based on nature, green infrastructure and the adaptation of ecosystems are of strategic importance for the challenges of reducing the negative effects of urban heat islands and the risk of flooding, rational space management, regeneration of degraded urban spaces, the coexistence of urban and green space and, consequently, increasing housing, as well as cultural and recreation areas. This is especially true of post-industrial regions, such as the Katowice Conurbation in Poland, to which the examples presented here refer.

This data potentially has significant application in the insurance industry, but requires some steps of post-processing, and appropriate delivery mechanisms, before it can be used in practice. The post-processing approach we apply involves statistical modelling of the simulated changes in damage to estimate rates of change of log damage versus global mean surface temperature (GMST). Under linear assumptions, these rates of change can be used to calculate the change in damage between any two time-periods for any GMST scenario. Under further assumptions, these changes can be used to adjust many of the metrics of flood risk used in the insurance industry, such as average annual losses, exceedance probabilities and year loss tables. We deliver these results in two ways to suit different users in the insurance industry. First, the rates of change, and related correlations, are provided as freely available datasets for insurers who prefer to process and apply the data themselves. Second, commercial online software is provided that performs some steps of the processing and application. Many sources of uncertainty affect our results. The results must not therefore be interpreted too literally, but hopefully give a good indication of the sign and rough magnitude of the likely changes in river flood damage due to climate change. Future studies will hopefully reduce the uncertainty.

Here we use the WWF Water Risk Filter (WRF) and geospatial analysis to screen hydropower projects, both existing (2488 dams) and projected (3700 dams), for a variety of risks at a global scale, focusing on biodiversity risks, hydrological risks (water scarcity and flooding), and how those hydrological risks may shift with climate change, based on three scenarios. Approximately 26% of existing hydropower dams and 23% of projected dams are within river basins that currently have medium to very high risk of water scarcity; 32% and 20% of the existing and projected dams, respectively, are projected to have increased risk by 2050 due to climate change. For flood risk, 75% of existing dams and 83% of projected dams are within river basins with medium to very high risk, and the proportion of hydropower dams in basins with the highest levels of flood risk is projected to increase by nearly twenty times (e.g., from 2% to 36% of dams). In addition, a large proportion of existing (76%) and projected hydropower dams (93%) are located in river basins with high or very high freshwater biodiversity importance. This is a high-level screening, intended to elucidate broad patterns of risk to increase awareness, highlight trends, and guide more detailed studies.

Climate change influences on tropical cyclones and sea levels will only exacerbate these rises. For example, Australia's Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017 was one of the most destructive cyclones to make landfall in Australia since Tropical Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The primary impacts of Cyclone Debbie were due to extreme short duration intense wind driven rainfall and widespread major flooding, both linked to uncharacteristically warm sea surface temperatures. Studying the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones is limited by the lack of well observed historical events. Traditional hazard risk assessment approaches are limited since they are primarily based on statistical models which only deal with single meteorological hazards, or use simplified parameterized relationships when more than one phenomenon is included. Here we explore the value of dynamical models for creating targeted, detailed, and physically plausible multi-hazard tropical cyclone scenarios, through the development of a modeling system that i) retains a high degree of simulation control, ii) is globally applicable, and iii) is responsive to climate variability and change. Application of the modeling system to a thermodynamic climate change scenario finds that the tropical cyclone penetrates much further inland with a marked expansion of the heavy rainfall area, resulting in significantly larger areas subjected to damaging and destructive wind speeds and rainfall totals capable of producing flash and riverine flooding.

However, there is rarely a comprehensive review of this field and it remains unclear how the research topics on urban floods have evolved. In this study, we analyzed the development of urban floods research and explored the hotspots and frontiers of this field by scientific knowledge mapping. In total, 3314 published articles from 2006 to 2021 were analyzed. The results suggest that the number of published articles in the field of urban floods generally has an upward trend year by year, and the research focus has shifted from exploring hydrological processes to adopting advanced management measures to solve urban flood problems. Moreover, urban stormwater management and low impact development in the context of climate change and urbanization have gradually become research hotspots.

Traditional studies have used rain gauge observations to analyze rainstorm events, but relevant information is usually missing in gauge-sparse areas. Satellite-derived precipitation datasets serve as excellent supplements or substitutes for the gauge observations. By developing a grid-based rainstorm-identification tool, we used the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) time series product to reveal the spatial and temporal variabilities of rainstorms over China during 1998-2017. Significant patterns of both increasing and decreasing rainstorm occurrences were detected, with no spatially uniform trend being observed across the whole country. There was an increase in the area being affected by rainstorms during the 20-year period, with rainstorm centers shifting along the southwest-northeast direction. Rainstorm occurrence was found to be correlated with local total precipitation. By comparing rainstorm occurrence with climate variables such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, we also found that climate change was likely to be the primary reason for rainstorm occurrence in China. This study complements previous studies that used gauge observations by providing a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of China's rainstorms.

Evaluation of non-stationarity in summer precipitation and the response of vegetation over the typical steppe in Inner Mongolia	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Non-stationary precipitation; Vegetation dynamic; Climate change; NDVI; Typical steppe	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEASONAL PRECIPITATION; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; FLOOD FREQUENCY; CHINA; TRENDS; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS	The typical steppe in Inner Mongolia is an important component of the Eurasian steppes. It plays a dominant role in preventing desertification and against sandstorms, but highly sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. Based on long-term observed precipitation data and remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images, the non-stationary behavior of summer precipitation and its linkage with vegetation change were investigated, by means of incorporating time-varying and physical based explanatory covariates in non-stationary modeling. Results indicated that time-dependent models exhibited good performance to reproduce the temporal variations of eco-hydrological variables. The non-stationarity of summer precipitation was prominently visible for the majority of sites during the period from 1957 to 2017, with the mean behavior described as a linear or nonlinear time-varying pattern. In general, the steppe has experienced a decreasing trend in summer precipitation, but whether the decline tends to maintain or weaken or strengthen depends on the spatial location of the site studied. Differences appeared in the changes of vegetation in summer from 1998 to 2017 in different sub-regions. Evidences for the presence of stationary evolution was found in most sub-regions in the middle part, together with a linear increase in the westernmost sub-regions while a non-linear decrease in the easternmost sub-regions. Covariate analyses further highlighted the role of precipitation variabilities in the modeling of the NDVI-related vegetation dynamics over the steppe. The potential relations of summer precipitation to vegetation growth were characterized as both linear and non-linear positive forms. In particular, precipitation extremes could be responsible for the occurrences of exceptional cases in vegetation condition. The fluctuations in summer precipitation have crucial significance for future predictions of vegetation succession. Findings from this study would lead to additional insights to understanding the effect of climate change on grassland ecosystem processes.

Enlarged lake inundation areas may pose adverse effects and potential threats on the local human living environment, especially for high-risk villages adjacent to rapidly expanding lakes. Taking a rapidly expanding lake, Angzi Co in the central TP as a study case, we investigated the flooding risk of lake growth on the local living environment and proposed an optimized solution of village relocation selection on the basis of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing. The detection of spatiotemporal variations of Angzi Co using optical and altimetric satellite observations revealed a significant area and water level increase by 81.28 km(2) and 5.78 m, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. We also assessed the vertical accuracy of multi-source digital elevation model (DEM) products using Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) altimetry data and further examined the flooding risk and potential influences of lake expansion on adjacent settlements (Guozha Village). Results indicated that UAV-DEM achieves excellent advantages in depicting details of lake shoreline variations and simulating potential submergence regions, followed by Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D DEM (AW3D DEM). Moreover, assuming that Angzi Co maintains the water level at a growth rate of 0.29 m/a (the average change rate during 2000-2020), the village will be submerged in approximate 10 years based on our assessment. Furthermore, we designed an optimal relocation site southwest of Guozha Village and approximately 3 km away based on the GIS-MVDA method and field investigations. An initial remote sensing-based approach for assessing the flooding risk from dramatic lake expansions in the TP and optimizing the village relocation site was proposed in this study to provide an essential scientific reference for formulating risk mitigation solutions under future climate change scenarios.

As climate change is widely projected to accelerate the hydrological cycle, concerns about the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation arise. The present study used Pattern Scaling coupled with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to calculate changes in multi-day extreme precipitation in the North Central Vietnam in 2050, 2070, and 2090 under three AR5's Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Twenty long-term historical observation stations in the study area with daily data mostly date back to more than 50 years were employed and 5-day maximum total precipitation was analyzed. The results reveal an agreement among the employed GCMs on an increase in the intensity and a shortening of the return periods of extreme precipitation, with the most reinforced trend occurring under RCP8.5, followed by RCP6.0 and then RCP2.6. This indicates that the risk of associated floods is likely to increase, especially under higher RCPs. Therefore, planning and decision making of durable infrastructure along with flood mitigation strategies to cope with such events are recommended.

Results revealed that land has the most dominant role in increasing agricultural production followed by labour and irrigation. The contribution of non-cereal crops (i.e., potatoes, pulses, oilseeds, jute and cash crops) to total production are also significant, ranging from 2 to 8% per annum. An increase in annual-rainfall and long-term-temperature (LTT) significantly enhance production. Production is significantly higher in floodplain agroecologies. However, production efficiency fluctuated sharply and declined overtime. The mean efficiency score of 0.74 implies substantial room to improve production by resource reallocation. Average farm size, crop specialization and investment in R&D significantly improve efficiency whereas increases in annual temperature-variability and LTT significantly reduce efficiency. Efficiency is significantly lower in low-lying floodplain and coastal-plain agroecologies. Policy implications include investments in diversifying cropping portfolio into other cereals (i.e., wheat and maize), research to develop crop varieties suited to changing climatic conditions and specific agroecological regions, and land/tenurial reforms to consolidate farm size to enhance productivity and efficiency of Bangladesh agriculture.

Climate Forecasts and Flood Mitigation	SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article							PROPERTY-VALUES; WATER; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; INVESTMENT; EXTREMES; VARIABILITY; PROTECTION	There is growing evidence that flood mitigation is often inefficient because individuals misestimate flood risk. The propensity to misestimate flood risk is expected to rise because climate change ensures the past will be a poor predictor of the future. Greater reliance on downscaled climatological and hydrological forecasts has been suggested to address these information failures. This article combines stochastic dynamic programming with historical data and climate-driven streamflow projections to determine how changes in flood risk forecasts influence optimal investments in flood mitigation infrastructure. Using upgrades in California's levee system as an example, we show that climate change is causing benefit-cost analysis to become increasingly biased in favor of flood mitigation infrastructure projects. We also show that using downscaled hydroclimate forecasts to achieve more accurate estimates of flood risk can decrease the efficiency of flood mitigation infrastructure investments, if flood risk is currently overestimated.

Climate change exhibits spatial and temporal differences. To meet the requirements of spatial planning, further research is needed to assess water supply risks at different basin or regional scales. In this study, we selected four SSP-RCP scenarios for analysis, considering the temporal scale of spatial planning. The climate modeling capabilities of five global climate models (GCMs) and a multi-model ensemble (MME) were evaluated using a Taylor diagram, which assesses the performance of climate element simulations. The modeling framework that consisted of system dynamics (SD), patch-generating land-use simulations (PLUS), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was employed to analyze synergistic changes in climate, land use, and water supply. The Ganjiang River Basin (GRB) serves as a case study for climate-adaptive planning at the basin scale, given its characteristics of high agricultural water demand and vulnerability to droughts and floods. The study aims to provide decision-making support for such planning. In our projections, precipitation in the GRB showed a slightly increasing trend from 2021 to 2050. Monthly precipitation increases during the flood season in August and decreases during the dry season from October to December. The maximum and minimum temperatures showed an increasing trend on both the yearly and monthly scales, with slightly higher increases during fall and winter. During the planning phase, the land use quantities of SSP126 and SSP245 showed similar variations. SSP370 experienced the most significant reduction in farmland, while SSP585 displayed a more scattered and punctuated layout of construction land. The annual water supply in the GRB showed a slightly decreasing trend from 2021 to 2035 and 2036-2050, and the largest reduction was found in SSP370. The trend of variation in the monthly water supply was complex. There was a consistent trend of decreasing water supply during the dry season, whereas the changes during the flood season were more complex. Seasonal variations in water supply are a major water security concern for the basin's future. It is necessary to strengthen the agricultural water security planning in the northern region of the basin and enhance its ability to adapt to droughts and floods.

Olivine weathering is a natural process that sequesters carbon out of the atmosphere, but is now being proposed as a strategy that can be artificially implemented to assist in the mitigation of anthropogenic carbon emissions. We use the landscape evolution model Badlands to identify a region (Tweed Caldera catchment in Eastern Australia) that has the potential for naturally enhanced supply of mafic sediments, known to be a carbon sink, into coastal environments. Although reality is more complex than what can be captured within a model, our models have the ability to unravel and estimate how erosion of volcanic edifices and landscape dynamics will react to future climate change projections. Local climate projections were taken from the Australian government and the IPCC in the form of four alternative pathways. Three additional scenarios were designed, with added contributions from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, to better understand how the landscape/dynamics might be impacted by an increase in sea level rise due to ice sheet tipping points being hit. Three scenarios were run with sea level held constant and precipitation rates increased in order to better understand the role that precipitation and sea level plays in the regional supply of sediment. Changes between scenarios are highly dependent upon the rate and magnitude of climatic change. We estimate the volume of mafic sediment supplied to the erosive environment within the floodplain (ranging from similar to 27 to 30 million m(3)by 2100 and similar to 78-315 million m(3)by 2500), the average amount of olivine within the supplied sediment under the most likely scenarios (similar to 7.6 million m(3)by 2100 and similar to 30 million m(3)by 2500), and the amount of CO(2)that is subsequently sequestered (similar to 53-73 million tons by 2100 and similar to 206-284 million tons by 2500). Our approach not only identifies a region that can be further studied in order to evaluate the efficacy and impact of enhanced silicate weathering driven by climate change, but can also help identify other regions that have a natural ability to act as a carbon sink via mafic rock weathering.

No study has yet evaluated the effects of applying the water supply adjustment standard (Standard) and activating the reservoir emergency storage in response to extreme drought. The main objective is to assess the effects of applying Standard and activating emergency storage in meeting the water demand under extreme drought at six multipurpose reservoirs (Andong, Gimcheon-Buhang, Gunwi, Hapcheon, Imha, and Milyang) in the Nakdong River Basin, South Korea. We built a reservoir simulation model (HEC-ResSim), determined the extreme drought scenarios, and emergency storage capacity. We evaluated three reservoir operation cases (general operation, regular Standard, and revised Standard) from 2011 to 2100. The results show that applying the Standard and activating the emergency storage are effective in meeting the future water demand during extreme drought. In conclusion, we need to secure 110 million cubic meters (MCM) (Hapcheon reservoir) and 8 MCM (Gunwi reservoir) of water to reduce the number of days in the emergency stage. This research serves as a fundamental study that can help establish Standard and emergency storage activation criteria for other multipurpose reservoirs in preparation for extreme drought.

To solve these problems, cities are increasingly combining stormwater infrastructure with park space in ways that create new efficiencies. To date, most research has focused on the stormwater management performance aspect of these combinations and not the techniques employed to achieve the combined goals. To fill this gap, 23 sponge city parks in Shanghai were investigated to examine the combination of stormwater and park services. Our findings show that stormwater techniques were primarily combined with the park facilities of water areas, paved open spaces, and pathways. Additionally, we found that larger parks employed a wider range of techniques for managing stormwater runoff and supported broader sets of park activities, while those at smaller scales prioritized infiltration, detention, and purification measures, as well as concentrated on social and economic activities. This study is the first to explore SPC parks that integrate stormwater management and park services, thereby providing implications for SPC development in China and insights into the ways that the two properties can be combined in other cities.

Thus, it is crucial for countries especially in arid and semi-arid regions of the world to develop appropriate preparedness plans for megadrought risk management. Since groundwater is the key water resource in these regions, it is important to reliably quantify the maximum sustainable extraction to ensure a sufficient groundwater reserve, i.e. the Strategic Groundwater Reserve, for a probable future megadrought event. For this purpose, a new concept of Probable Maximum Drought is proposed in this study, based on the concept of Probable Maximum Flood. As the spillways of large dams are designed based on the Probable Maximum Flood to minimize the probability of failure and the associated casualties and damages, the Probable Maximum Drought concept is proposed to estimate Strategic Groundwater Reserves to limit the consequences of prolonged droughts, including damage and threats to societal stability. This will allow water resources managers and policymakers to develop appropriate strategies to adapt and restrict development plans of a given region based on a sustainable megadrought risk management.

Whether land modifications are implemented will depend on the willingness and ability of a diversity of actors. This article reviews the state of knowledge on land modification use in areas exposed to dual hydrologic risks and the land owners, managers, and users who directly make decisions about action on lands they control. The review presents a typology of land modifications and explains how land modifications interact with the hydrological cycle to reduce risks. It then addresses the roles and perspectives of the land owners, managers, and users undertaking land modifications, summarizing theories explaining motivations for, as well as barriers to and enablers of, land modification implementation. The analysis reveals geographical differences in narratives on land modifications as well as knowledge gaps regarding variation across actors and types of land modifications.

Often, the country is affected by droughts and storms that result in heat waves and floods with adverse effects for the population and the economy in general. For this reason, the analysis of temporal and spatial climate data is more evident than ever to face the socio-economic and environmental impacts associated with knowledge and understanding of the climate patterns in the country. The present investigation focuses on determining the changes in climatic variables of precipitation and temperature, generating indicators on these variables' behavior, and identifying Bolivia's areas with the most significant temporal exposure to climate changes in recent decades. Thus, this study proposes a regionalization that allows to contrast and analyzes these changes. As a result, it is expected to contribute to the generation of public policies and research around the areas of risk, vulnerability, adaptation, and climate resilience of the most significant exposure areas identified in this study.

They produce rain, lightning, strong winds or hail and are capable of causing serious failures in rail transport. We identified 14,786 incidents associated with storms, which took place on the Czech rail network between 2002 and 2021. This represented 5% of all reported rail incidents in Czechia over the monitored period. Using the exact binomial test and a grid covering each combination of month and hour, we found that these incidents were concentrated between May and August in the early morning and afternoon hours. Most of the rail problems were concentrated on only a small number of days, indicating the significant impact of severe storms. The incidents (82%) were associated with rail device failures and/or power outages, such as malfunctions of switches, signals or communication and safety devices. In addition, tree falls on rail infrastructure were also common. The total train delay time exceeded 3917 h, and in some cases rail traffic was even completely disrupted. Based on the findings, which provide unique insight into the impacts of storms on railways, mitigation measures are discussed. This is particularly important given climate change, which may lead to an increased likelihood of severe weather and associated damage in the future.

In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), neighbor cues reduce the activity of the photosensory receptors phytochrome B (phyB) and cryptochrome 1, releasing photoreceptor repression imposed on PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) and leading to transcriptional reprogramming. The phyB-PIF hub is at the core of all shade-avoidance responses, whilst other photosensory receptors and transcription factors contribute in a context-specific manner. CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 is a master regulator of this hub, indirectly stabilizing PIFs and targeting negative regulators of shade avoidance for degradation. Warm temperatures reduce the activity of phyB, which operates as a temperature sensor and further increases the activities of PIF4 and PIF7 by independent temperature sensing mechanisms. The signaling network controlling shade avoidance is not buffered against climate change; rather, it integrates information about shade, temperature, salinity, drought, and likely flooding. We, therefore, predict that climate change will exacerbate shade-induced growth responses in some regions of the planet while limiting the growth potential in others. The signaling network involved in shade avoidance responses integrates information from environmental variables such as temperature, water availability, and salinity.

Comparison of different statistical downscaling models and future projection of areal mean precipitation of a river basin under climate change effect	WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; climate change; GCMs; precipitation; statistical downscaling	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DESIGN FLOOD; HYDROLOGY	Investigation of the hydrological impacts of climate change at the local scale requires the use of a statistical downscaling technique. In order to use the output of a Global Circulation Model (GCM) model, downscaling technique is used. In this study, statistical downscaling of monthly areal mean precipitation of Goksun River basin in Turkey was carried out using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gene-expression Programming (GEP) techniques. Large-scale weather factors are used for a basin with monthly areal mean precipitation (P-M) record from 1971 to 2000 for training and testing periods. The R-2-value for precipitation in SVM, GEP and GMDH models are 0.62, 0.59, and 0.6 respectively, for testing periods. The results showed that SVM has the best model performance than the other proposed downscaling models, however, AIC values showed the GEP model has the lowest AIC value. The simulated results for CGCM3 A1B and A2 scenarios show a similarity in their average precipitation prediction. Generally, both scenarios anticipate a decrease in the average monthly precipitation during the simulated periods. Therefore, the results of future projections show that the mean precipitation might decrease during the period of 2021-2100.

Critical services and infrastructure are feeling increasing pressure to be maintained in a sustainable way under these combined stresses. Methods to better cope with these demanding factors are greatly needed now, and with the predicted impacts of climate change, further adaptation will become essential for the future. All cities comprise a complex of interdependent systems representing critical operations that cannot function properly independently, or be fully understood in isolation of one another. The consequences of localised flooding can become much more widespread due to the inter-relation of these connected systems. Due to reliance upon one another and this connectedness, an all-encompassing assessment is appropriate. Different model representations are available for different services and integrating these enables consideration of these cascading effects. In the case study city of Bristol, 1D and 2D hydraulic modelling predicting the location and severity of flooding has been used in conjunction with modelling of road traffic and energy supply by linking models established for these respective sectors. This enables identification of key vulnerabilities to prioritise resources and enhance city resilience against future sea-level rise and the more intense rainfall conditions anticipated.

However, there is a general lack of understanding of the ways in which runoff sensitivities to precipitation and temperature changes are associated with the CMIP5 scenarios. This paper investigates the hydrological response to future climate change under CMIP5 RCP scenarios by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and then quantitatively assesses runoff sensitivities to precipitation and temperature changes under different scenarios by using a set of simulations with the control variable method. The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is an ideal area to study this problem. The results demonstrated that the precipitation effect was the dominant element influencing runoff change (the degree of influence approaching 23%), followed by maximum temperature (approaching 12%). The weakest element was minimum temperature (approaching 3%), despite the fact that the increases in minimum temperature were higher than the increases in maximum temperature. The results also indicated that the degree of runoff sensitivity to precipitation and temperature changes was subject to changing external climatic conditions.

We investigate the effect of wet and dry extreme precipitation regimes on invasive species' abundances in northern tallgrass prairies. Because soil moisture is a key determinant of prairie composition, theory and evidence suggest drought conditions will hinder invasion, whereas wetter conditions will enhance invasion. To test this hypothesis, we explored the effect of precipitation on invasive plant species abundance from 2010 to 2019 in 25 managed prairies using observations from 267 transects comprising 6675 plots throughout western Minnesota, USA. We estimated how increases in the number of extremely wet or dry months in a year altered overall invasive species abundance and the abundance of the highly invasive grasses Poa pratensis and Bromus inermis. We found that a greater occurrence of abnormally wet months increased invasive species abundance but found mixed evidence that abnormally dry conditions hindered invasion. Further, more moderately wet and dry months reduced native grass abundance. Together, these results suggest that more frequent extremely wet months may intensify invasive dominance and that dry months may not counterbalance these trends. Given the considerable uncertainty still surrounding the interactive effects of climate change and invasion on native plant communities, this research represents an important step toward quantifying the complex influence of precipitation extremes on invasion dynamics in managed ecosystems of critical conservation concern.

CITIES			English	Article						Sea-level rise; Climate gentrification; Housing price; Miami	ENVIRONMENTAL GENTRIFICATION; FLOOD HAZARDS; RISK; AMENITIES; DISASTER; PRICES; VALUES	Climate gentrification has become a powerful concept to explore how climate change governance and peoples' awareness of sea-level rise will produce new housing geographies and urban inequalities. Departing from climate justice and gentrification critiques, we contribute to the conceptual advancement of climate gentrification from a geographical perspective through an examination of whether its occurrence in Miami is a real climate change-minded investment practice. We find homebuyers' awareness of sea-level rise is not the major factor compel-ling homebuyers to higher ground. Presently, climate gentrification in Miami is more refiective of a rational economic investment motivation in response to expensive fiood insurance rather than sea-level rise itself. Homebuyers are more steered by fiood insurance required by FEMA and the historical record of fiooding, rather than elevation and scientific projections of storm surges. Moreover, unlike other global cities, wealthy and well-educated homebuyers show fewer concerns about rising sea levels and climate change in Miami. Our findings reveal that climate gentrification is being utilized by some developers and is both interpreted and misinterpreted by local policymakers to facilitate neoliberal urban redevelopment and place marketing. At the same time, the real estate industry is failing buyers in terms of providing accurate climate and sea-level rise information. To help remedy this knowledge gap, we call for two policy instruments to increase investors' awareness of sea-level rise: 1) include risk assessment of sea-level rise in homebuyer contracts, and 2) improve FEMA insurance maps to incorporate sea-level rise scenarios.

But the inevitable climate change effects due to constant feeding of emissions into atmosphere leads to severe and extreme precipitation causing flooding. The combined impact of flooding, rapid urbanization and vehicular growth has become a looming threat to the transportation system which is affecting the developing economies disproportionately. There is an urgent need for the transport infrastructure to adapt to these climate change effects to reduce human as well as economic losses and adaptation is seen as the necessary tool to address this. In this paper, a methodological approach to formulate the adaptation strategies from urban transport to urban flooding in developing economies is presented. Further three adaptation policy bundles are formulated specifically to enhance the resilience of transportation system against urban flooding thereby strengthening the adaptive capacity of the system. These strategies are evaluated for the years 2030 and 2050 along with base year for various travel parameters to estimate the impact of flooding. This study finds that the implementation of bundle 1 is an effective adaptation measure when compared to bundle 2 and 3. The comparative analysis with BAU flooding scenario shows that VKT of bundle 1 is reduced by 4% and 3%, speeds increased by 21% and 45%, vehicle hours travelled by 9% and 8% for the years 2030 and 2050 respectively. Trips that are cancelled due to flooding can be nullified using appropriate strategies is also shown in this paper.

Perspective: Climate Change and the Relocation of Indonesia's Capital to Borneo	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						Anthropocene; biodiversity; flooding; impacts; Indonesia	JAKARTA INDONESIA; LAND SUBSIDENCE; WATER-QUALITY; BIODIVERSITY; URBANIZATION	Indonesia has recently announced the relocation of the country's capital from the island of Java to the island of Borneo. Java's limited sustainability is evident from extreme deforestation, biodiversity loss, intense road traffic, and high pollution. Jakarta, Indonesia's current capital on Java, is both one of the most densely populated cities in the world, and one of the most threatened by climate change. Negative impacts upon Jakarta due to climate change could affect its economy, human health, and biodiversity. These negative factors could be transferred from Jakarta to Borneo, at least partially, during the early stages of moving the capital. Borneo currently houses one of the largest remaining forested areas in Southeast Asia and is considered to be a biodiversity hotspot. However, despite its biological importance, similar to 30% of Borneo has been deforested in the last 50 years. Borneo also has high rates of biological endemism, but some of its emblematic endemic species are critically endangered. We argue that Indonesia's announcement to re-locate the capital is one of the first examples of systematic, mass migration expected to occur linked to the climate change crisis. Unless a multidisciplinary and sustainable transition is implemented, the establishment of a new capital in Borneo could be a major biodiversity catastrophe. Research is urgently needed in Borneo to determine the status quo of its ecosystems for a large-scale, before-after assessment of the human-footprint to better understand processes in the Anthropocene.

This study considers three decadal variability (1982-2013) in meteorological, hydrological, vegetation, and soil moisture parameters for inducing water scarcity and drought conditions in urban regions. Hazards associated with urban drought-inducing parameters variability, vulnerability, and exposure of Indian smart cities were used to compute the Urban drought risk. The research investigations revealed the maximum urban drought risk for Bangalore, Chennai, and Surat cities. Northwest, West Central, and South Peninsular urban regions have higher risk among all the urban regions of India.

Utilizing the exogenous variation in the rainfall deviation from the local norms within an individual fixed-effects framework, we uncover the negative association between rainfall and the probability of individual's decision to migrate. We find that doubling the amount of precipitation relative to the long-run local average reduces the probability of migration by 7.5 percent. This result could potentially be driven by individuals who work in the agriculture sector and could have experienced an increase in income as high precipitation could lead to high yield. Furthermore, our heterogeneity analyses suggest rainfall shocks could perpetuate gender inequality in Vietnam as women are less likely to migrate when being affected by climate change. Policymakers could shift their focus to flood control and water management in affected areas, where people's livelihoods depend on agriculture, to efficiently address issues related to climate-induced internal migration.(c) 2022 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

To mitigate floods, pluvial risk maps with climate change scenarios have been developed to help major urban areas adapt to a changing climate. In some cases, subnational governments have played a key role to develop these maps. However, governance research about the role of subnational governments in geospatial data development in urban water transitions has received little attention. To address this gap, this research applies the Governance Assessment Tool as an evaluative framework to increase our understanding of the governance factors that support the development of pluvial flood risk maps at the subnational level. For this research, we selected the region of Flanders in Belgium. This region is considered among the frontrunners when it comes to the creation of a pluvial flood risk map with climate change scenarios. Data have been collected through in-depth interviews with steering committee actors involved in the development process of the map. The research identified that the current governance context is supportive of the creation of the flood risk map. The government of Flanders plays a key role in this process. The most supportive qualities of the governance context are those related to the degree of fragmentation (extent and coherence), while the less supportive ones are those related to the "quest for control" (flexibility and intensity). Under this governance context, government actors play the primary role. The Flemish government led the maps' creation process and it was supported by the lower governmental levels. As the provincial government was an important actor to increase local participation, collaboration with private and non-governmental actors in the steering committee was more limited. The financial resources were also limited and the process required a continuous development of trust. Yet, the Flemish Environmental Agency, with the use of technology, was able to increase such trust during the process.

Identifying the runoff variation in the Naryn River Basin under multiple climate and land-use change scenarios	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; ensemble prediction; land-use change; multiple scenarios; Naryn River Basin; SWAT	WATER-RESOURCES; CHANGE IMPACTS; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; QUALITY; COVER	A multiple scenario-based ensemble prediction (MSEP) method is developed for exploring the impacts of climate and land-use changes on runoff in the Naryn River Basin. MSEP incorporates multiple global climate models, Cellular Automata-Markov and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) within a general framework. MSEP can simultaneously analyze the effects of climate and land-use changes on runoff, as well as provide multiple climate and land-use scenarios to reflect the associated uncertainties in runoff simulation and prediction. Totally 96 scenarios are considered to analyze the trend and range of future runoff. Ensemble prediction results reveal that (i) climate change plays a leading role in runoff variation; (ii) compared to the baseline values, peak flow would increase 36.6% and low flow would reduce 36.8% by the 2080s, which would result in flooding and drought risks in the future and (iii) every additional hectare of arable land would increase the water deficit by an average of 10.9 x 10(3) m(3), implying that the arable land should be carefully expanded in the future. Results suggest that, to mitigate the impact of climate change, the rational control of arable land and the active promotion of irrigation efficiency are beneficial for water resources management and ecological environmental recovery.

"We can't do it on our own!" - Integrating stakeholder and scientific knowledge of future flood risk to inform climate change adaptation planning in a coastal region	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Flood risk management; Climate change adaptation; Integrated assessment; Scientist-stakeholder engagement; Flood modelling	DECISION-MAKING; MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; ENGAGEMENT; PROJECTS	Decision-makers face a particular challenge in planning for climate adaptation. The complexity of climate change's likely impacts, such as increased flooding, has widened the scope of information necessary to take action. This is particularly the case in valuable low-lying coastal regions, which host many competing interests, and where there is a growing need to draw from varied fields in the risk-based management of flooding. The rising scrutiny over science's ability to match expectations of policy actors has called for the integration of stakeholder and scientific knowledge domains. Focusing on the Broads - the United Kingdom's largest protected wetland - this study looked to assess future flood risk and consider potential adaptation responses in a collaborative approach. Interviews and surveys with local stakeholders accompanied the development of a hydraulic model in an iterative participatory design, centred on a scientist-stakeholder workshop. Knowledge and perspectives were shared on processes driving risk in the Broads, as well as on the implications of adaptation measures, allowing for their prioritisation. The research outcomes highlight not only the challenges that scientist-stakeholder integrated assessments of future flood risk face, but also their potential to lead to the production of useful information for decision-making.

Spatial analyses of vulnerable locations have given rise to climate change vulnerability mapping. While not a new concept, the spatial analyses of specific health outcomes remain limited. This review explores different methodologies and data that are used to assess vulnerability and map population health impacts to climate hazards. The review retrieved scholarly articles and governmental reports concerning vulnerability mapping of human health to the impacts of climate change in the United States, published in the last decade. After review, 37 studies were selected for inclusion. Climate-related exposures were distributed across four main categories, including: high ambient temperatures; flood hazards; vector-borne diseases; and wildfires. A number of different methodologies and measures were used to assess health vulnerability to climate-related hazards, including heat vulnerability indices and regression analyses. Vulnerability maps should exemplify how variables measuring the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different populations help to determine the potential for climate-related hazards to have an effect on human health. Recommendations address methodologies, data gaps, and communication to assist researchers and stakeholders in directing adaptations to their most efficient and effective use.

Ghana's Akosombo Dam, Volta Lake Fisheries & Climate Change	DAEDALUS			English	Article								In Ghana, the Pwalugu Dam in the Upper East is in the final planning stage. Whereas promoters of Ghana's first dams emphasized the need for generating electricity to modernize and industrialize the new nation, the planners of Pwalugu have focused on water issues. Due to climate change, droughts have had a devastating impact on local agriculture. The dam's primary purpose is an irrigation scheme and flood control. This essay historicizes these concerns by revisiting the Akosombo Dam, Ghana's largest hydroelectric dam, completed in 1965. The discussion juxtaposes personal recollections of dam-affected communities with reports by administrators, biologists, and social scientists. The essay draws on government records, scientific studies about Volta Lake, and oral histories. Ultimately, it argues, builders and administrators of the Akosombo Dam failed to address most water issues, despite ample knowledge about their existence. One hopes that these shortcomings will not be repeated in the Pwalugu project.

This evolving scenario represents an escalating risk, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive climate change adaptation strategies across society. Vital to effective response are models that evaluate damages, costs, and benefits of adaptation strategies, encompassing non-linearities and feedback between anthropogenic and natural systems. While flood risk modeling has progressed, limitations endure, including inadequate stakeholder representation and indirect risks such as business interruption and diminished tax revenues. To address these gaps, we propose an innovative version of the Climate-economy Regional Agent-Based model that integrates a dynamic, rapidly expanding agglomeration economy populated by interacting households and firms with extreme flood events. Through this approach, feedback loops and cascading effects generated by flood shocks are delineated within a socio-economic system of boundedly-rational agents. By leveraging extensive behavioral data, our model incorporates a risk layering strategy encompassing bottom-up and top-down adaptation, spanning individual risk reduction to insurance. Calibrated to resemble a research-rich coastal megacity in China, our model demonstrates how synergistic adaptation actions at all levels effectively combat the mounting climate threat. Crucially, the integration of localized risk management with top-down approaches offers explicit avenues to address both direct and indirect risks, providing significant insights for constructing climate-resilient societies.

J	Beylich, M; Haberlandt, U; Reinstorf, F				Beylich, Marcus; Haberlandt, Uwe; Reinstorf, Frido			Daily vs. hourly simulation for estimating future flood peaks in mesoscale catchments	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; disaggregation; flood modeling; mesoscale; modeling time step	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPORAL RAINFALL; CASCADE MODEL; DISAGGREGATION; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT	Daily hydrological models are commonly used to study changes in flood peaks due to climate change. Although they often lead to an underestimation of absolute floods, it is assumed that future flood peaks in smaller mesoscale catchments are less underestimated when examining the relative change signal of floods. In this study, the applicability of this hypothesis is investigated by comparing the results of a daily hydrological model set, calibrated on runoff hydrographs, with an hourly model set calibrated on flood peak distributions. For analysis, a daily RCP8.5 climate model ensemble is disaggregated to hourly values and the runoff is simulated on a daily and hourly basis for six mesoscale catchments in Central Germany. Absolute floods and relative flood changes are compared between both model sets. The results show significant differences between the absolute floods of both model sets, in most cases caused by underestimations due to the daily modeling process. In contrast, the differences between the two model sets are not significant for the relative change signal of the floods, especially for higher return periods. To improve results in climate studies with coarse modeling time step, the use of relative change signal of floods instead of absolute values is recommended.

This study assesses climate change insights of the Tharu in Bardiya district of Nepal in relation to climate variability and water sector-related hazards, focussing on Indigenous knowledge (IK) for adaptation and mitigation in agriculture. Tharu are the first settlers in Tarai, Nepal and largely depend on farming. Our sequential mixed-method approach first quantifies perceptions and then analyses qualitative information from participatory methods. We found the Tharu have perceived a temperature increase but a rainfall decrease; the former is validated with weather data, but not the rainfall trend due to high annual variation. The high ranking of flooding in both villages and drought in Bikri indicates the importance of the water sector and related hazards. Tharu have used Indigenous as well as scientific knowledge for weather predictions, coping and adaptation to water-related hazards in agriculture-based livelihoods. As the application of IK-based traditional agricultural practices has decreased due to their lower yield than modern agricultural practices, there is need for documentation, research and policy actions to integrate IK and science to reduce climatic vulnerability and increase productivity of resilient agricultural practices.

The emergence of nature-based solutions could provide alternative approaches for climate adaptation; however, studies on their public acceptability are limited. This research focuses on the human dimensions of nature-based coastal adaptation solutions. The research sought to understand the kind of environmental changes participants were experiencing in their coastal communities of Nova Scotia and what management responses they observed being taken, if any. Online focus groups were held with coastal property owners in Nova Scotia to understand how they assess coastal risks and four approaches to nature-based coastal adaptation: living shorelines, accommodation, retreat, and dyke realignment to make space for wetland restoration. Results revealed ongoing trust in traditional hard-line approaches, but also interest in knowing more about nature-based options. There was general support for living shorelines, albeit with scepticism; a concern that accommodation is just a "band-aid" approach; resistance to retreat, despite general recognition of its future utility; and a lack of understanding of dyke realignment. The successful implementation of nature-based coastal adaptation approaches will require more evidence of their viability, better options for financing them, and engagement with communities around the best-fit alternatives for them.

Sponge City: Using the "One Water" Concept to Improve Understanding of Flood Management Effectiveness	WATER			English	Review						Sponge City; climate change; megacity; One Water; subsidence	URBAN; CHALLENGES; CITIES; CHINA; GROUNDWATER; SUBSIDENCE	Urban flood-related issues are substantial in China, arising from rapid construction of megacities over decades with insufficient flood control, all being made worse by climate change. Since Sponge City (SC) options are primarily effective at maintaining the water balance at the surface, flooding continues. In response, the One Water concept is used to demonstrate the need to respond to dimensions beyond SC and shown herein to have potential to reduce the impacts of major storms (e.g., suppress 100-year flooding to a 25-year flooding equivalent). However, climate change causes more intense storms, indicating the intensity of the 100-year storm will increase by similar to 0.23% annually over the next 70 years. Hence, given sufficient SC options, the 100-year storms may only be effectively reduced to a 50-year storm, at best by SC options. "One Water" is utilized as a concept to demonstrate structured thinking about how each dimension of the hydrologic cycle can be employed to consider the degree of interconnection, allowing improved assessment of various components of the hydrologic cycle and SC options. Examples are used to demonstrate how the concept of One Water links the array of components of the hydrologic cycle together, generating a holistic view of urban water resource security.

The results indicate that water shortage would still threaten the Yellow River because annual runoff will remain below 1000 m(3)/year, although water scarcity would be alleviated to some degree. More and larger floods will happen in summer in the 21st century, especially in the long-term period under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. More Hydrological droughts will occur during July-October, and some extreme droughts would likely exceed the historical largest magnitudes in July and August in the long term under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.

However, local practitioners face many barriers that can undermine their capacity to adopt and sustain adaptation initiatives to reduce exposure and vulnerability and strengthen resilience to climate risks. Existing scholarship suggests that national governments play an important role in providing leadership and resources to support local adaptation policy development. However, less research attention has been devoted to investigating sub-national, regional government initiatives to support local adaptation policy and planning in federal states, despite their financial resources and constitutional responsibility to oversee municipalities. This article analyzes how one sub-national government, the provincial government of Nova Scotia (Canada), activated and motivated local adaptation policy and planning through a combination of policy instruments and municipally focused capacity-building initiatives. In addition to describing the structure and dynamics of the provincial mandate for municipal adaptation planning in Nova Scotia, we provide case study evidence to draw insights about the enabling conditions for the successful implementation of climate change adaptation governance initiatives of this kind.

In February and March, Cyclone Freddy raged across the Indian Ocean for 5 weeks and made landfall 3 times, killing more than 1,400 people in Malawi and elsewhere in southeastern Africa. In July, Algeria experienced 50 degrees C heat and fires that killed dozens of people and displaced thousands. In September, more than 11,000 people died in the Libyan port city of Derna when a hurricane and torrential rains caused dams to burst1. Elsewhere, melting ice, rising seas, extreme heat and drought are wreaking havoc from the poles to small Pacific islands2. Demands for compensation3 for 'loss and damage' - the excess or permanent hit to ecosystems, infrastructure and culture from climate-change-related extremes - are mounting. Pakistan has raised a US$9-billion lifeline from some 40 countries as well as private donors and banks to rebuild after devastating floods affected 33 million people there in 2022.

Today, it puts an estimated 1.81 billion people at risk. Floods particularly affect coastal cities, where it is expected that the damage associated with inundations exceed the staggering value of USD 50 billion by 2050. Indeed, the risk associated with flooding in coastal cities is increasing due to three unequivocal trends: growing population in large urban centres, sea level rise, and increased intensity of extreme weather events. Planning and implementation of storm drainage systems in large cities is a complex, long, and expensive process. Typically, the effective lifespan of storm drainage systems may extend to nearly a century. Accordingly, such systems should be designed for the future, not the present. Addressing these important challenges, the paper evaluates flood risks in the coastal city of Maputo, in Mozambique. Results show that, although downtown Maputo is not particularly exposed to compound flooding, accounting for rainfall-tide events is essential to understand flooding in the area and evaluating the performance of the storm drainage system.

Previous contributions on the causes of flooding in urban areas mostly do not consider the actors involved in adaptation and do not acknowledge the diversity of knowledge they possess. In this study, the causes of urban floods in an African city are explored from an actor-oriented perspective. The Kendall coefficient of concordance method is used to analyse interviews with household members and community leaders living in flood-prone communities as well as technocrats involved in public flood adaptation at the metropolitan level. The level of agreement on the causes of flooding is low among the actors, making the case for integrating informal actors into the formal flood adaptation structures at the metropolitan level. This will harness the diversity of knowledge on how flood risk unfolds for the purpose of local adaptation to urban floods in African cities.

Clonal plants might be particularly affected due to limited genotypic diversity of their populations, potentially decreasing their adaptability. We therefore tested the ability of a widely distributed predominantly clonally reproducing herb (Fragaria vesca) to cope with periods of drought and flooding in climatic conditions predicted to occur at the end of the twenty-first century, i.e. on average 4 & DEG;C warmer and with twice the concentration of CO2 in the air (800 ppm) than the current state. We found that F. vesca can phenotypically adjust to future climatic conditions, although its drought resistance may be reduced. Increased temperature and CO2 levels in the air had a far greater effect on growth, phenology, reproduction, and gene expression than the temperature increase itself, and promoted resistance of F. vesca to repeated flooding periods. Higher temperature promoted clonal over sexual reproduction, and increased temperature and CO2 concentration in the air triggered change in expression of genes controlling the level of self-pollination. We conclude that F. vesca can acclimatise to predicted climate change, but the increased ratio of clonal to sexual reproduction and the alteration of genes involved in the self-(in)compatibility system may be associated with reduced genotypic diversity of its populations, which may negatively impact its ability to genetically adapt to novel climate in the long-term.

The study areas, as one of the important food baskets of the country, has been experiencing wide-ranging extreme event (flood, riverbank erosion, cold wave, less and erratic rainfall, and prolonged droughts). Here severe affected sectors are agriculture; fisheries; livestock; housing; and drinking water, sanitation and public health. Through participatory Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), the adaptation strategies were prioritized based on the overall preferences of multiple stakeholder opinions at different level (community/village, upazila/sub-district, and district/regional level). Therefore, using MCA methods of the study areas helped their ideas from different level actors/stakeholders to improve the adaptation strategy, practices and drivers leading to vulnerability. The study found that most priority of adaptation measures of different sector i. e Agriculture; Fisheries; Livestock; Housing; and Drinking Water, Sanitation and Health sector; are Maize, and Sathi Fosol (mixed and relay culture); Livelihood Diversification; Adhi system (shared rearing of livestock); Rising plinth level, and Solar energy, and Ensure safe drinking water, and Enhance health facility and community clinic activities, respectively. The various mechanisms for coping and adaptation practices of different communities were identified in this study. The study suggests further support from the government. Study recommends a combination of the local and scientific knowledge, allocation of resources to the poor, techno-logical transfer and innovative adaptation approaches for Bangladesh.

To ensure rapid, widespread and equitable adaptation to these risks, government policy must be enacted to support community-wide adaptation. Public support for adaptation policy will be key to its passage. To date, few studies have focused on what factors motivate public support for adaptation policy, especially at the subnational level. To address these gaps, we develop a conceptual model that draws on and synthesizes past conceptual frameworks and literature related to environmental behavior and adaptation specifically. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examine this model, drawing on data from a statewide survey of over 2700 individuals from the state of Indiana in the Midwestern United States. We assess the drivers of two distinct measures of policy support: support for climate adaptation policy and support for climate adaptation taxes. We find that threat appraisal, climate risk perception, perceived efficacy of government, respondent's climate change beliefs, perceived descriptive and dynamic norms around policy support, and social structural characteristics such as political affiliation are important drivers of support for adaptation policy, but that their effects differ across our two outcome measures. These findings point to opportunities to better engage the public in policy discourse, while also suggesting that distinct motivations shape support for policy compared to the taxes likely needed to support these new programs.

Farmers are increasingly vulnerable to floods and drought. In this article, the negative impact of climate hazards on rice cultivation in the Tonle Sap and Mekong River influenced by climatic variability between 1994 and 2018 are analyzed. A cohort of 536 households from four Cambodian districts participated in household surveys designed to consider how various vulnerability factors interacted across this time series. It was found that: (i) The major climate hazards affecting rice production between 1994 and 2018 were frequent and extreme flood and drought events caused by rainfall variability; (ii) In 2018, extreme flood and drought occurred in the same rice cultivation cycle. The impact caused by each hazard across each region were similar; (iii) An empirical model was used to demonstrate that drought events tend to limit access to irrigation, impact rice production, and result in an increased prevalence of water-borne diseases. Flood events cause reduced rice production, damage to housing, and impede children from accessing education. The impact of drought events on rice production was found to be more severe than flood events; however, each climatic hazard caused physical, economic, social, and environmental vulnerabilities. It is recommended that sufficient human and financial resources are distributed to local authorities to implement adaptation measures that prepare rice farmers for flood and drought events and promote equitable access to water resources.

Based on the downscaled precipitation series retrieved from the large-scale outputs of CanESM2 climate model under RCPs scenarios, wet/dry spells characteristics were analyzed during 2011-2040, in one of the most vulnerable arid and semiarid basins located in the Southern Alborz region, Iran. The results suggest that the mean wet spells number decreases during the 2020s period under RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios, while mean dry spells number indicates increasing values for the near future compared with the baseline. Moreover, short-length wet spells are dominant, while dry spells with medium durations are prevailing in the study region. On the other hand, dry spells persistence is much higher than those of wet spells, although there is no significant difference among the average wet spells number. Furthermore, there is not any significant difference among the persistence of wet spells under various RCPs scenarios. These results illustrate that the risk of flood events will be alleviated in the region ,whereas the risk of longer droughts events will increase. The main findings of this study show that analyzing the characteristics of wet/dry spells can lead to more accurate and efficient strategies to have sustainable resources management under the changing climate.

The concept of a nonstationary flood hazard has been formulated by extending the geometric distribution to account for time-varying exceedance probabilities over the design life of a project. However, to our knowledge, only time covariate is used to estimate the nonstationary flood hazard over the lifespan of a project, which lacks physical meaning and may lead to unreasonable results. In this study, we aim to strengthen the physical meaning of nonstationary flood hazard analysis by investigating the impacts of climate change and population growth. For this purpose, two physical covariates, i.e., rainfall and population, are introduced to improve the characterization of nonstationary frequency over a given design lifespan. The annual maximum flood series of Xijiang River (increasing trend) and Weihe River (decreasing trend) are chosen as illustrations, respectively. The results indicated that: (1) the explanatory power of population and rainfall is better than time covariate in the study areas; (2) the nonstationary models with physical covariates possess more appropriate statistical parameters and thus are able to provide more reasonable estimates of a nonstationary flood hazard; and (3) the confidences intervals of nonstationary design flood can be greatly reduced by employing physical covariates. Therefore, nonstationary flood design and hazard analysis with physical covariates are recommended in changing environments.

Prolonged dry periods, heavy flood events, degradation of the lands and ice thawing, modify the chemical composition of river waters influencing the drivers governing the complex dynamics of river catchments where everything comes together. In this framework, Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) offers methods in which the complex structure of the river water composition and the interrelationships among the various components are put into the proper context for their statistical analysis. In this research, we propose a new CoDA approach combining the robust Mahalanobis distance (D) calculus of ilr-transformed chemical variables and the perturbation difference, both with respect to a pristine compositional benchmark. The aim was to trace the change in the chemical composition of the Eastern Siberian River Chemistry Database where degradation of the permafrost for global warming produces important effects on natural waters. The findings indicate complex multiplicative laws and feedback mechanisms governing solutes in Eastern Siberian rivers, with high values of D found where permafrost is more discontinuous. Perturbations clearly discriminate chemical components more resilient to stresses induced by global changes (Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3) from those whose variability is not maintained under control (Cl- , Na+, SO42-). These outcomes open up a new scenario in searching for spatiotemporal resilience metrics to reveal rivers response to environmental changes.

Many global climate models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) have been developed to project the future changing climate. To quantitatively evaluate future flood risks, the results of the current hydrological model based on simulated data from the climate model should be analyzed. This paper focuses the connection of technological and policy aspects for the future flood management in South Korea. Accordingly, this study assesses the changes in flood quantiles based on the two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. The HadGEM3-RA regional climate model is used to predict future changes in extreme rainfall events, and the regional quantile delta mapping (RQDM) method is adopted to correct for any inherent bias in the climate models. The climate change scenario is divided into the following four periods: S0 (1976-2005), S1 (2011-2040), S2 (2041-2070), and S3 (2071-2100). A regional frequency analysis (RFA) is applied to estimate the rainfall quantiles as input data in rainfall-runoff model. The flood quantiles are simulated using the HEC-1 (rainfall-runoff) model for historical and future periods, and the variations in the flood quantiles are calculated quantitatively for the five major river basins (Hangang, HAN; Nakdonggang, NAK; Geumgang, GUM; Seomjingang, SJG; Yeongsangang, YSG) in South Korea. As a result, it is found that the highest flood risk can occur in the YSG basin, and the YSG basin should be considered the most urgent and important river basin for climate change adaptation plans compared with other major basins in South Korea.

Climate change projection using the statistical downscaling model in Modjo watershed, upper Awash River Basin, Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Global circulation model; Temperature; Precipitation; Predictands; Predictors	HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; TRENDS; SIMULATIONS; REANALYSIS; OUTPUT	Global circulation models have been used to project future climate changes, which encourage experts to design mitigation measures. Still, it is challenging to use the raw data at a local scale without downscaling. Hence, this study applied a statistical downscaling model to downscale daily data generated from the second generation of the Canadian Earth System Model under two Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using observed data for model calibration and validation. The downscaled results showed that the maximum temperature likely to increases in the range of 2.04-2.50 degrees C for RCP4.5 in the 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2099), respectively, and the minimum temperature indicate an increase by 0.87 degrees C in 2050s and 1.56 degrees C in 2080s averaged over the watershed level. The projected mean annual and seasonal air temperatures are likely to increase up to the end of the twenty-first century at all stations. The utmost annual rainfall change is projected to be 14.5% in the 2080s for RCP4.5 at Modjo. The highest seasonal precipitation change is projected to be 30.9% (RCP8.5) in the main rainy season (Kiremt) at Chefedonsa. Seasonal-based future projection of the precipitation shows non-significant trends, except the Kiremt season. The study revealed that the temperature was highly influenced by altitude and slightly affected by corresponding land use land cover type. In general, the increase in temperature could worsen the environmental conditions in warm seasons; and an increase in precipitation in the Kiremt season is expected to bring a likely risk of flooding.

The ensemble of best top four models from both CMIP simulations is also used to investigate the future climate change under medium and high emissions for short, medium, and long terms. Results show CMIP6 products outperform CMIP5 in terms of accuracy statistics, particularly for precipitation. Overall, CMIP6 indicate less intermodel variability, implying the climate signal obtained via CMIP6 is improved relative to CMIP5. The CMIP6 reduce the error in precipitation and temperature 11% and 6%, respectively while increasing the correlation 13% for precipitation. Correlation is not changed for temperature. The substantial success of CMIP6 mainly manifests itself in the winter precipitation and autumn temperature. A slightly warmer (up to 0.35 ?C) climate from the CMIP6 is projected while precipitation change in mean precipitation decline is about 2.5% smaller for CMIP6. However, precipitation changes in maximum decline and increase are more noticeable for CMIP6, addressing the better resolving for future climate variability. The summer warming (up to 6.5 ?C) and drying (up to -40%) towards autumn spread across the country. The increased precipitation projection in the winter and spring over the east of the Black Sea Region and north-east of Anatolia may further increase the flood risks in the area.	[Bagcaci, S.

In this study, three high spatial-temporal resolution precipitation products were used to analyze hourly EREs during May-October from 2001 to 2018 over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). To quantify the possible link between EREs and environmental factors (such as urbanization, climate change, and orography), the Hovmoller diagrams and Generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) nonstationary model were used. The results showed that the eastward propagating precipitation systems created a heavy rainfall center in the southwest mountainous of YRD due to orographic lifting, and enhanced in the plains over urbanized areas, especially in the vicinity of Nanjing, Changzhou, and Nantong metropolitan regions. The variability of hourly rainfall extreme in the urbanized regions is high correlated to the multivariate ENSO index (MEI), and shows a greater magnitude in the urban than rural regions. This phenomenon was intensified by large-scale circulation patterns due to strong-ENSO over the NanjingChangzhou-Nantong (NCN) urban regions, but weakened over the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo (SHN) urban regions. An analysis of nonstationary GAMLSS also suggests the large-scale circulation presents a greater impact on the hourly extreme rainfall than the urbanization, while the hourly rainfall extremes in the urban areas are still higher than that in rural regions under the nonstationary scenario. Those results suggest intense rainfall occurred more frequently in the urban region under observed climate change and urbanization in YRD.

OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; FLOOD PROTECTION; COASTAL; POLICY	Sea level rise (SLR) is projected to have severe consequences for people and assets in European coastal areas. Planning for SLR is a critical step to ensure timely and adequate responses. Despite our rapidly increasing understanding of SLR impacts and the need to adapt, few studies have looked at how countries are planning for SLR. We surveyed experts from the 32 European countries with a coastline about how their country is planning for SLR. Our online survey focused on four areas: (1) whether SLR planning exists and at what level of government; (2) which climate information and scenarios are used in planning; (3) what planning horizons and corresponding levels of SLR are used; and (4) how uncertainty in handled and whether high-end sea level rise is being considered in planning. Additionally, we asked experts to assess the status of sea level rise planning in their country. Our results indicate that most coastal countries in Europe are planning for SLR, but 25% still do not. We find that the planning horizon 2100 is most common and many countries are considering around 1m (adjusted for local conditions) of SLR at that point in time. However, there are significant differences between countries, which may lead to unequal impacts, over time. We also find that RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are the most widely used climate change scenarios, suggesting that countries are considering high-end climate change in planning, although this does not mean they consider high amounts of SLR. Important questions remain about how planning is realized into levels of protection or preparedness and whether the amounts of SLR and planning horizons currently in use will lead countries to act in time.

The study applies two common climate projections based on (Representative Concentration Pathways), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 and downscaled gridded climate projections from 14 global climate models (GCMs) to estimate the 100-year, 24-h extreme precipitation events for two future time-periods: near-term (2021-2060) and far-term (2060-2099). 100-year 24-h precipitation events at near- and far-term are compared to GCM-driven historical extreme precipitation events during a base period (1960-1999) and results for RCP 8.5 scenario show average increases between 25%-50% during the near-term compared to the base period and increases of over 50% during the far-term. Streamflow conditions are generated with a distributed hydrological model where downscaled climate projections are used as inputs. For the near-term, the medians of the GCMs using the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 suggest 2.9%-8.1% increases in the 100-year, 24-h flow event in the Connecticut and an increase of 9.9%-13.7% in the Merrimack River. For the far-term, the medians of the GCMs using the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 suggest a 9.0%-14.1% increase in the Connecticut and 15.8%-20.6% for the Merrimack River. Ultimately, the results presented here can be used as a guidance for the long-term management of infrastructures on the Connecticut and Merrimack River floodplains.

Climate-related uncertainties in urban exposure to sea level rise and storm surge flooding: a multi-temporal and multi-scenario analysis	CITIES			English	Article						Sea level rise; Flood exposure; Uncertainty; Stakeholders; Climate change	SURFACE-WATER; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; IMPACT; CITIES; INUNDATION; NETWORKS; FUTURE; HAZARD; MODEL	Climate change-induced sea level rise and intensified storms pose emerging flood threats to global coastal urban areas. While such threats have been mapped, their uncertainties from different climate scenarios and longer planning horizons have yet to be addressed from both an exposure assessment and a stakeholder outreach perspective. Therefore, we chose the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Area as an example to project its flood areas every 20 years between 2000 and 2100, under 24 varied climate scenarios with two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration levels. We then assessed flood exposure by intersecting the flood areas with demographic and socioeconomic distributions, developed areas, lifeline infrastructures, and emergency responders in low elevation ( < 10 m) coastal zones. Our median estimates under the low GHG scenarios indicated that 10-38% of the items assessed above are flood-exposed in 2000-2020, with this exposure increasing to 20-54% during 2080-2100. The median estimates under the high GHG scenarios for the same periods are 0-35% and 40-67%, respectively. The expected uncertainties, or standard deviations, of the exposures for a given item assessed above under the low and high GHG scenarios are 1-2% in 2000-2020 and 7-10% in 2080-2100. Despite our modeling capability for a range of climate scenarios over the long term, some stakeholders, particularly those in the private sector, prefer near-term results with lower uncertainties. This implies the need for coastal urban areas to cope with climate-related uncertainties and to focus on the long term when developing strategies and policies for climate change adaptation.

J	Feng, DM; Beighley, E				Feng, Dongmei; Beighley, Edward			Identifying uncertainties in hydrologic fluxes and seasonality from hydrologic model components for climate change impact assessments	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							GLOBAL CLIMATE; WATER AVAILABILITY; STREAMFLOW; CALIFORNIA; PARAMETERIZATION; FREQUENCY; VARIABILITY; REGIMES; RUNOFF; FLOOD	Assessing impacts of climate change on hydrologic systems is critical for developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for water resource management, risk control, and ecosystem conservation practices. Such assessments are commonly accomplished using outputs from a hydrologic model forced with future precipitation and temperature projections. The algorithms used for the hydrologic model components (e.g., runoff generation) can introduce significant uncertainties into the simulated hydrologic variables. Here, a modeling framework was developed that integrates multiple runoff generation algorithms with a routing model and associated parameter optimizations. This framework is able to identify uncertainties from both hydrologic model components and climate forcings as well as associated parameterization. Three fundamentally different runoff generation approaches, runoff coefficient method (RCM, conceptual), variable infiltration capacity (VIC, physically based, infiltration excess), and simple-TOPMODEL (STP, physically based, saturation excess), were coupled with the Hillslope River Routing model to simulate surface/subsurface runoff and streamflow. A case study conducted in Santa Barbara County, California, reveals increased surface runoff in February and March but decreased runoff in other months, a delayed (3 d, median) and shortened (6 d, median) wet season, and increased daily discharge especially for the extremes (e.g., 100-year flood discharge, Q(100)). The Bayesian model averaging analysis indicates that the probability of such an increase can be up to 85 %. For projected changes in runoff and discharge, general circulation models (GCMs) and emission scenarios are two major uncertainty sources, accounting for about half of the total uncertainty. For the changes in seasonality, GCMs and hydrologic models are two major uncertainty contributors (similar to 35 %). In contrast, the contribution of hydrologic model parameters to the total uncertainty of changes in these hydrologic variables is relatively small (<6 %), limiting the impacts of hydrologic model parameter equifinality in climate change impact analysis. This study provides useful information for practices associated with water resources, risk control, and ecosystem conservation and for studies related to hydrologic model evaluation and climate change impact analysis for the study region as well as other Mediterranean regions.

J	Ganoulis, J				Ganoulis, Jacques			A New Dialectical Model of Water Security under Climate Change	WATER			English	Article						water management; climate change; humans-nature relationship; conflict resolution; dialectics		Although Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is widely accepted as the state-of-the-art rational model for improving water governance, its evaluations under climate change at national and global scales indicate that progress made in water security and ecosystem preservation is slow. The paper identifies the relationship between Humans and Nature as the main reason for that and generates a novel social component to improve Water Resources Management (WRM) following three pillars: (1) A historical review over the past 20,000 years indicating that WRM depends on the interplay between Humans and Nature. This is in constant change over time, and depending on socio-economic and climate conditions, it oscillates between two opposites: conflict and cooperation. Three clusters have been identified, showing a different timeline pattern of dominance: (a) Nature dominating Humans (Naturalistic), (b) Nature-Humans in cooperation and competition (Dualistic), and (c) Humans dominating Nature (Anthropocentric). (2) Clarification of why a WRM model can improve water security through the Governance-Policy-Science Nexus. (3) Suggestion of a novel WRM model based on conflict identification (eristic component) and dialectical conflict resolution. Two types of conflicts have been distinguished: (a) Human vs. Human and (b) Human vs. Nature when the laws of nature are not respected. The dialectical tool operates by exchanging rational arguments to unify opposite objectives for harmonizing Humans with Natural laws. A case study of flood mitigation in Crete Island illustrates the Eristic-Dialectical methodology.

J	Mariano, C; Marino, M				Mariano, Carmela; Marino, Marsia			The Climate-Proof Planning towards the Ecological Transition: Isola Sacra-Fiumicino (Italy) between Flood Risk and Urban Development Prospectives	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate-proof planning; coastal multi-risk; local urban plan	SEA	The increasing concentration of people and economic activities in urban areas intensifies the pressure on the urban environment and hastens environmental degradation processes. Therefore, addressing the impact of climate change on cities is an urgent matter that demands the immediate attention of policymakers, researchers, and the general public, not only for its environmental but also socioeconomic ramifications. Within this framework, the research focuses on the effects of climate change on coastal cities and aims to define guidelines for the innovation of urban planning tools from a climate-proof perspective. Specifically, the study analyses the effects of two phenomena related to climate change: heavy rainfall, river overflow, and sea-level rise, to establish a replicable approach for updating the documents that constitute the cognitive framework of the Local Urban Plan through the preparation of a multi-risk map (that considers different time horizons) and consequently the prescriptive apparatus of the Plan through the definition of a toolkit of site-specific design actions oriented towards urban adaptation. The proposed methodology is tested on the case study of Isola Sacra, Fiumicino (Italy), and is intended to apply to other territorial contexts. The aim of this study, in accordance with the principles of the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) framework, is to furnish theoretical-methodological and operational guidelines to translate risk knowledge, despite its limitations due to variables and uncertainties in measurements, into effective urban adaptation measures.

In total, six main lithofacies associations are inferred that represent three relevant sedimentary environments associated with the paleolakes, i.e. lacustrine, deltaic and fluvial. Since the local last glacial maximum (LGM), there have been at least three river-blocking episodes and consequent phases of lacustrine development in the Gega and Jiedexiu dammed lakes. They occurred at ca. 25-17 ka, 14-11 ka, and similar to 4 ka. Sedimentological evidence shows that the glacier-dammed lakes were not stable; they experienced oscillations of lake level through short-time drainage events. The damming events and subsequent outburst floods were likely triggered by changes in the extent and thickness of glaciers, caused by rapid climatic changes. This seems to be consistent with proglacial lakes occurring elsewhere, although the dynamics of glacier-dammed lakes can be highly variable between catchments and through time due to the influence of climate-dependent factors on the proglacial lakes.

J	Schweizer, V; Colloff, MJ; Pittock, J				Schweizer, Vivienne; Colloff, Matthew J.; Pittock, Jamie			The Dammed and the Saved: a Conservation Triage Framework for Wetlands under Climate Change in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Environmental flows; Water reform policy; Wetland conservation; Environmental trade-offs; Decision context; Values; rules and knowledge	EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS; MACQUARIE MARSHES; ADAPTATION; ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; RECOVERY; REQUIREMENTS; FLOODPLAINS; THRESHOLDS; WATERBIRDS	As the impacts of climate change and water demands from irrigation continue to increase in the Murray-Darling Basin, water for the environment is becoming more scarce and the ecological conditions of many wetlands is poor. With water scarcity, conservation triage is becoming an increasingly relevant management option for environmental watering of wetlands. However, triage is controversial; being considered contrary to current conservation objectives and practices. We assessed environmental watering at two Ramsar wetlands, Macquarie Marshes and Gunbower Forest, based on international environmental treaty obligations and domestic policy settings, changes to flow regimes, wetland condition and current management. Triage decision making was found to be in tacit use at Macquarie Marshes, based on 'rules of thumb' and experiential ecohydrological knowledge, whereas formal environmental watering planning formed the basis for triage decision making at Gunbower Forest. We developed a framework for conservation triage of wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin to stimulate change in the decision context for wetland conservation and adaptation under climate change. Conservation triage entails reframing of relationships between people and nature and values, rules and knowledge used by stakeholders. Because water is the medium by which wetland conservation outcomes eventuate, trade-offs between competing water uses can be realised with the triage framework.

Statistical downscaling of regional climate model: A case study in Penang Island, Malaysia	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL			English	Article						Regional climate model; statistical downscaling; flood risk; Penang Island; Malaysia	PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE	Flooding events are the most devastating natural disasters that Malaysia had experienced these recent years. It has become a challenge for the government and society to mitigate the flood events that occurs naturally, especially when climate change had worsened the situation. This study focuses on changes of rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature in Penang. With the fast growth rate of resident population and its economic status, obtaining the suitable and viable future climate scenario is crucial and significant to enhancing the flood forecasting capabilities in the Penang Island. The dataset obtained from CanESM2 GCM was used to generate the regionalized rainfall and temperature data based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of 4.5 and 8.5 W/m(2) emission scenario. The downscaling period (2005-2100) for maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) and rainfall time were developed using the statistical downscaling technique. For reliability analysis, the model outputs were analysed with Probability Density Function (PDF), Linear Regression and Pearson Correction Test. Based on the reliability analysis outcomes, the possible causes for acknowledging that the Penang Island could follow the high emission scenario RCP 8.5. This indicates that the average monthly rainfall and temperature of Penang Island may increase consequential of the regional climate change, resulting from an increasing population, the industrial development and ever-escalating transportation needs.

Flood risk is calculated as a function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The flood risk for a building was classified into five classes, and the distribution characteristics of buildings were examined according to England's flood risk vulnerability classification system, known as Planning Policy Statement 25 (PPS25). After analyzing the risk of flooding in Ulsan Metropolitan City, one of Korea's representative urban areas, it was found that while Dong-gu District can be considered relatively safe, districts of Jung-gu and Nam-gu, as well as Ulju-gun, have highly vulnerable buildings with red and orange ratings, which include motor vehicles-related facilities, education and welfare facilities, and residential facilities. There has been evidence to prove that urban flood disaster affects topography and the environment, in addition to having a significant effect on adaptability depending on the facility groups that resulted from urbanization. This study is expected to serve as a scientific database for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to floods during land-use planning, which would eventually allow for systematic management of high-risk buildings through verification of location suitability of buildings by facility group.

The basin's hydrological responses to climate forcing in the projected period are analysed under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Trends in the projected period relative to the reference period are determined for medium, high and low flows. Flood characteristics are estimated using the threshold level approach. The analysis of variance technique (ANOVA) is used to segregate the contribution from RCMs, RCPs, and internal variability (IV) to the total uncertainty in streamflow projections. Results show a robust positive trend for streamflows. Flood volumes may increase by 11.7% in RCP4.5 (2006-2030), 76.4% in RCP4.5 (2025-2049), 20.3% in RCP8.5 (2006-2030), and 342.4% in RCP8.5 (2025-2049), respectively, for Jamshedpur. For Ghatshila, increment in flow volume is estimated as 15.7% in RCP4.5 (2006-2025), 24.2% in RCP4.5 (2025-2049), 35.9% in RCP8.5 (2006-2030), and 224.6% in RCP8.5 (2025-2049), respectively. Segregation results suggests that the uncertainty in climate prediction is dominated by RCMs followed by IV. These findings will serve as an early warning for the alarming extreme weather events India is currently facing.

The review is conducted to assess existing or proposed actions for dealing with impacts of drought, heat waves, sea-level rise, and pluvial and fluvial flooding. It includes over 30 measures related to structural, services, technological, informational and ecosystem-based approaches. The main findings demonstrate that CBA of adaptation measures across urban environments must contend with numerous long-term socioeconomic and climate change uncertainties. Subsequently, this has led to inconsistencies in valuation frameworks related to, for example, planning horizons, discount rates, non-market considerations and future scenarios. Results also indicate a clear gap in the literature on the economic valuation of adaptation measures in the Global South. Furthermore, few studies integrate equity dimensions while planning for adaptation. Extensions of CBA to account for key uncertainties will help policy makers to allocate (often scarce) resources more efficiently and limit the likelihood of maladaptation. Further inclusion of the magnitude and distributional effects of non-market impacts and greater civil society engagement in policy dialogues will also be vital for promoting just and equitable measures that balance adaptation alongside other policy goals such as mitigation, economic development, health and well-being.

This study examines the hydrological control effects of LIDs on mitigating runoff depth and peak runoff in the context of climate change for four micro-watersheds (A, B, C and D) in northeast India. In addition, attempts have been made to determine whether redesigning the existing drainage helps reduce runoff in the study area. Results show that redesigning the drainage system has resulted only in 2.5-3.6% reduction in runoff depth for the four micro-watersheds. LIDs were effective in managing the stormwater in all four micro-watersheds. Among the four LIDs considered (green roof, permeable pavements, infiltration trenches, and rain barrels), the green roof showed the highest percentage reduction in runoff characteristics. Climate change analysis has shown a significant increase in the runoff characteristics in all four watersheds. For watersheds A, B, C, and D, the green roof effectively reduced runoff by 30%-38%, 83%, 50%, and 34%, respectively. This study will help the decision-makers to assess and choose the best LIDs to minimize the risk of flooding.

This study set out to map the adaptation patterns - namely, the strategies employed to cope with water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related impacts of climate change - within the Mabinju community, located along the banks of Lake Victoria in Western Kenya. Qualitative methods were employed, involving 17 semi-structured individual interviews and seven focus groups with village members. Insights derived from direct conversations with village members were deepened through qualitative interviews with an additional 13 WASH sector stakeholders working in the wider Lake Victoria Basin region. Through this study, various WASH-specific community adaptation measures were identified, with both positive and negative impacts on long-term local climate resilience. While many positive coping strategies were found to be spurred by the creative faculties of local residents, capacities for adaptation were found to be restrained by broader forces of poverty and resource access, resulting in the adoption of certain maladaptive coping mechanisms. These findings highlight the need for climate adaptation interventions in the WASH sector to simultaneously build on existing resilience-enhancing measures while addressing the root causes of maladaptation.

This study examined long-term changes in flood characteristics (including magnitude, frequency, and timing) in 30 alpine headwaters of the large endorheic Tarim River Basin, Central Asia. The contributions of climatic factors to flood (magnitude and timing) changes were investigated using numerical experiments in combination with the random forest approach. The following results were obtained: (1) Annual maximum flood peaks increased at most stations (89% stations) during 1961-2015 with increased flood frequency. Earlier flood peaks were observed in spring with a rate of 1.38 day per decade; for other seasons, changes in the occurrence time of flood peaks showed strong spatial variability. (2) Precipitation was the dominant factor for the increased flood magnitude in most catchments of the southern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, and temperature played a greater role in the northern Kunlun Mountains. (3) For flood timing changes, melt level height and precipitation were the most influential factors in the alpine catchments in the Tarim River Basin. The results provide information on the spatiotemporal variations of floods and their driving factors in this alpine basin under climate change.

Vulnerability to climate change of a microendemic lizard species from the central Andes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							THERMAL BIOLOGY; BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; GENUS LIOLAEMUS; ECOLOGY; TEMPERATURE; EVOLUTION; ECTOTHERMS; IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY	Given the rapid loss of biodiversity as consequence of climate change, greater knowledge of ecophysiological and natural history traits are crucial to determine which environmental factors induce stress and drive the decline of threatened species. Liolaemus montanezi (Liolaemidae), a xeric-adapted lizard occurring only in a small geographic range in west-central Argentina, constitutes an excellent model for studies on the threats of climate change on such microendemic species. We describe field data on activity patterns, use of microhabitat, behavioral thermoregulation, and physiology to produce species distribution models (SDMs) based on climate and ecophysiological data. Liolaemus montanezi inhabits a thermally harsh environment which remarkably impacts their activity and thermoregulation. The species shows a daily bimodal pattern of activity and mostly occupies shaded microenvironments. Although the individuals thermoregulate at body temperatures below their thermal preference they avoid high-temperature microenvironments probably to avoid overheating. The population currently persists because of the important role of the habitat physiognomy and not because of niche tracking, seemingly prevented by major rivers that form boundaries of their geographic range. We found evidence of habitat opportunities in the current range and adjacent areas that will likely remain suitable to the year 2070, reinforcing the relevance of the river floodplain for the species' avoidance of extinction.

To assess the changes in temperature and precipitation and their impacts on the discharge in the upper Yangtze Basin from pre-industrial to the end of 21st century, four hydrological models were integrated with four global climate models. Results indicated that mean discharge was simulated to increase slightly for all hydrological models forced by all global climate models during 1771-1800 and 1871-1900 relative to the 1971-2000 reference period, whereas the change directions in mean discharge were not consistent among the four global climate models during 2070-2099, with increases from HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5, and decreases from GFDL-ESM2M and IPSL-CM5A-LR. Additionally, our results indicated that decreases in precipitation may always result in the decrease in mean discharge, but increases in precipitation did not always lead to increases in discharge due to high temperature rise. The changes in extreme flood events with different return intervals were also explored. These extreme events were projected to become more intense and frequent in the future, which could have potential devastating impacts on the society and ecosystem in this region.

Climate change threatens to exacerbate these risks. Risk transfer mechanisms, such as weather index insurance (WII) may help buffer farmers against these hazards. However, WII programs struggle to attract the clients most in need of protection, including marginalized women and men. This risks re-enforcing existing inequalities and missing opportunities to promote pro-poor and gender-sensitive development. Key questions, therefore, include what factors constrain access to WIIs amongst heterogeneous communities, and how these can be addressed. This paper contributes to that end through primary data from two WII case studies (one in India, the other in Bangladesh) that identify contextual socio-economic and structural barriers to accessing WII, and strategies to overcome these. More significantly, this paper synthesizes the case study findings and those from a review of the literature on other WII initiatives into a framework to promote a systematic approach to address these challenges: an important step forward in moving from problem analysis to remedial action. The framework highlights actions across WII product design, implementation and post-implementation, to minimize risks of social exclusion in future WII schemes.

Yet, minimal research has examined how governments can motivate community members to prepare for disasters (e.g., purchasing flood insurance or installing water barriers in homes for floods and hurricanes). Instead, studies have focused on how to communicate actions individuals should take during disasters, rather than before disasters. This study develops messages targeting social norms, which are promising approaches to motivate community members to adopt disaster risk preparedness and mitigation behaviors. Specifically, we developed a variety of messages integrating descriptive norms (i.e., what others do), injunctive norms (i.e., what others believe should be done), and a social norms-based fear appeal, or social disapproval rationale (i.e., a negative social result of [not] taking behaviors). Then, we tested these messages through two between-subject factorial online experiments in flood- and hurricane-prone U.S. states with adult samples (N = 2,286). In experiment 1 (i.e., purchasing flood insurance), the injunctive norms message using weather forecasters and the social disapproval rationale message significantly increased social norms perceptions, which in turn influenced behavioral intentions. In experiment 2 (i.e., installing water barriers), the injunctive norms message using weather forecasters, the injunctive norms message using neighbors, and the social disapproval rationale message significantly increased social norms perceptions, which in turn influenced mitigation intentions. However, the descriptive social norms message was not effective in increasing social norms perceptions. We provide some of the first empirical evidence on how organizations' risk communication can empower community members to prepare and mitigate the impact of disasters.

The country is frequently affected by numerous climatic events including floods, droughts, cyclones, etc., which damages the farm household's livelihood and socio-economic condition. Therefore, this work intends to appraise the smallholder farmers' perceived climate-related risk, impact, and the factors that influence their choices of adaptation strategies to cope with the adverse impact of the climatic extreme events in northern Bangladesh. Survey data were collected from 300 respondents from two drought-prone districts of northern Bangladesh in January-February 2020. The climate-related risk perception index (CRRPI) was constructed to assess the farmers' perceived risk. The multinominal logit (MNL) model was employed to explore the factors influencing farmers' choices of adaptation strategies. Farmers' perceptions of climate change risk were found to be consistent with meteorological data in the research area. Results of the CRRPI revealed that flood, drought, riverbank erosion, and heat waves were the critical risks perceived by the farmers. Farmers used a variety of adaptation measures to deal with these climatic threats, including agricultural diversification, changes in fertilizer and insecticides, and crop and seed changes. The MNL model results showed that the factors that influenced a farmer's choices of adaptation strategies were age, education level, family members, income level, year of farming experience, and the farmer's information on climate change. This study also demonstrated that water scarcity in the dry period and the frequency of crop diseases were the major limiting factors experienced by the farmers whilst undertaking adaptation strategies. Thus, awareness and capacity building through training and support to adopt the adaptation strategies are essential to enhance the resilience of the farmers.

The extreme 2018 drought that prevailed throughout Europe provided an opportunity to investigate conditions likely to become more frequent in the future. For an upland rural catchment utilised by the distilling industry in North-East Scotland, a tracer-based survey combined discharge, electrical conductivity, stable water isotopes and temperature measurements to understand the impacts of drought on dominant stream water and industry water sources, both in terms of water quantity and quality (temperature). Results showed that water types (groundwater, ephemeral stream water, perennial stream water and water from small dams) were spatially distinct and varied more in space than time. With regards to the drought conditions we found that streams were largely maintained by groundwater during low flows. This also buffered stream water temperatures. Water types with high young water fractions were less resilient, resulting in streams with an ephemeral nature. Although our results demonstrated the importance of groundwater for drought resilience, water balance data revealed these storage reserves were being depleted and only recovered towards the end of the following year because of above average rainfall in 2019. Increased storage depletion under continued trends of extreme drought and water abstraction could be addressed via informed (nature based) management strategies which focus on increasing recharge. This may improve resilience to droughts as well as floods, but site specific testing and modelling are required to understand their potential. Results could have implications for management of water volumes and temperature, particularly for the sustainability of an historic industry, balancing requirements of rural communities and the environment.

The Gushanchuan river, a primary tributary of the middle Yellow river, Northern China, showed a significant downward trend in the last century. Little is known regarding the relative contributions of changing environment to the observed hydrological trends and response on the runoff generation process in its watershed. On the basis of observed hydrological and meteorological data from 1965-2010, the Mann-Kendall trend test and climate elasticity method were used to distinguish the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff in the Gushanchuan basin. The results indicate that the runoff in the Gushanchuan Basin has experienced significant declines as large as 77% from 1965 to 2010, and a mutation point occurred around 1997; the contribution rate of climate change to runoff change is 12.9-15.1%, and the contribution rate of human activities to runoff change is 84.9-87.1%. Then we divided long-term data sequence into two stages around the mutation point, and analyzed runoff generation mechanisms based on land use and cover changes (LUCC). We found that the floods in the Gushanchuan Basin were still dominated by Excess-infiltration runoff, but the proportion in 1965-1997 and 1998-2010 decreased gradually (68.46% and 45.83% in turn). The proportion of Excess-storage runoff and Mixed runoff has increased, which means that the runoff is made up of more runoff components. The variation law of the LUCC indicates that the forest area increased by 49.61%, the confluence time increased by 50.42%, and the water storage capacity of the watershed increased by 30.35%.

Assessing and visualising hazard impacts to enhance the resilience of Critical Infrastructures to urban flooding	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Natural hazards; Climate change; Flood modelling; Resilience; Visualisation	RISK; METHODOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; HEALTH	The design, construction and maintenance of Critical Infrastructures (CI) is commonly based on standards that are rigorous, so as to withstand any climate or weather-linked pressures. However, due to climate change, climate characteristics may shift, resulting in increased frequency/magnitude of potential failures, or exposure to new unknown risks. As vital components for the normal functioning of modern societies, the resilience of CIs under climate stressors encompasses their structural integrity, their operational elements, and their capacity to maximize business output. In this work, we propose an integrated and participatory methodological approach to enhance the resilience of interconnected CIs to urban flooding under climate change, by assessing the risk and introducing adaptation measures. The main objectives of the proposed methodology and approach are: (i) to provide scientific evidence for better understanding of how future climate regimes might affect normal operation of interconnected CI in urban areas during their lifespan; (ii) to assess the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation measures; (iii) to involve local stakeholders and operators in the co-design of the approach, as well as the assessment and the evaluation of adaptation measures; (iv) to combine computational modelling with advanced 3D visualisation techniques for effectively engaging stakeholders in decision making; (v) to include risk assessment and damage functions co-designed by end-users and local stakeholders; (vi) to integrate all of the aforementioned components in a specifically designed cloud platform as a Decision Support System for end-users, (vii) to validate the DSS by the end users and local stakeholders. The paper presents the computational background and tools. Additionally, it describes a Case Study in Torbay, UK, where the full methodology and the proposed participatory approach have been applied, with all the specifics, i.e., the scenarios of extreme flooding, the numerical and visualisation results, the response of the stakeholders and the evaluation of selected adaptation measures.

In the last century, we have been building disaster prevention infrastructure (artificial levees and dams, referred to as "grey infrastructure") to protect human lives and assets from floods, but these hard protective measures will not function against mega-floods. Moreover, in a drastically depopulating society such as that in Japan, farmland abandonment prevails, and it will be more difficult to maintain grey infrastructure with a limited tax income. In this study, we propose the introduction of green infrastructure (GI) as an adaptation strategy for climate change. If we can use abandoned farmlands as GI, they may function to reduce disaster risks and provide habitats for various organisms that are adapted to wetland environments. First, we present a conceptual framework for disaster prevention using a hybrid of GI and conventional grey infrastructure. In this combination, the fundamental GI, composed of forests and wetlands in the catchment (GI-1) and additional multilevel GIs such as flood control basins that function when floodwater exceeds the planning level (GI-2) are introduced. We evaluated the flood attenuation function (GI-1) of the Kushiro Wetland using a hydrological model and developed a methodology for selecting suitable locations of GI-2, considering flood risk, biodiversity and the distribution of abandoned farmlands, which represent social and economic costs. The results indicated that the Kushiro Wetland acts as a large natural reservoir that attenuates the hydrological peak discharge during floods and suitable locations for introducing GI-2 are concentrated in floodplain areas developing in the downstream reaches of large rivers. Finally, we discussed the network structure of GI-1 as a hub and GI-2 as a dispersal site for conservation of the Red-crowned Crane, one of the symbolic species of Japan.

Automatic feature selection and weighting for the formation of homogeneous groups for regional IDF estimation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Regional frequency analysis; IDF curve; Feature selection and weighting; Climate change; Urbanization; Homogeneous group formation	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; URBAN SURFACE; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; FLOOD; EVENTS; AREAS	The intensity-duration frequency (IDF) curve has been used as an effective tool to quantify the risk associated with the impact of extreme rainfall on civil infrastructure. However, recent changes in the rainfall climatology caused by climate change and urbanization have made estimates in the stationary environment provided by the traditional regional IDF approach increasingly inaccurate. This inaccuracy is mainly caused by the lack of consideration for the temporal and spatial differences in the selection of similarity indicators (attributes that are used to measure similarity of extreme rainfall patterns among different stations), resulting in ineffective formation of homogeneous groups (group of stations that share similar extreme rainfall patterns) at various regions. To consider the temporal differences of similarity indicators, including meteorological factors, topographic features and urban impact indicators, a three-layer design is proposed based on the three stages in extreme rainfall formation: cloud formation, rainfall generation and change of rainfall intensity over an urban surface. During the process, the impacts from climate change and urbanization on extreme rainfall patterns are considered through the inclusion of potential features that relate to the rainfall mechanism at each layer. The spatial differences of similarity indicators for Homogeneous Group Formation (HGF) at various regions is resolved by using an automatic feature selection and weighting algorithm, specifically the hybrid searching algorithm of Tabu Search, Lagrange Multiplier and Fuzzy C-means clustering, to select the optimal combination of features for HGF based on the uncertainty in the regional estimates of the rainfall quantiles for a specific site. The proposed methodology fills the gap of including the urbanization impacts on the extreme rainfall patterns during HGF process and challenges the traditional assumption that the same set of features can be equally effective in generating the optimal homogeneous group in regions with different geographic and meteorological characteristics.

Exploring vertical and horizontal diffusion in Hessen and Finland	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Policy diffusion; Multilevel governance; Hessen; Germany; Finland; Municipality	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; CITIES; GOVERNANCE; NETWORKS; BARRIERS	Municipalities across the globe are seeking to adapt to increasing climate change impacts, such as heavy rainfall, drought, heat waves, and floods. An important question is how to support the diffusion of innovations in local adaptation policy-making. Responses often lack consideration of the diversity of municipalities and their varying needs and capacities. This article addresses this gap by analysing how internal and external motivations for and barriers to adaptation policy and diffusion vary across municipalities of different sizes in the federal State of Hessen in Germany and in Finland. Hessen and Finland have comparable population sizes and settlement structures, but their municipalities are embedded in different multilevel governance architectures and climatic geographies. The analysis builds on quantitative data from two independent surveys among Hessian and Finnish municipalities. The results show that while there are similarities and some differences among the motivations, with municipalities in Hessen focusing more on extreme weather events and Finnish municipalities more on well-being, the barriers are strikingly similar, focusing on lack of resources as well as unclear responsibilities of different governance levels and within municipalities. Size is an important factor determining the adaptation needs and capacities of municipalities in both surveys. The findings highlight the need for a clearer adaptation governance framework, support from the closest governance level and more resources, but also context-sensitive policy support that has been discussed in theory and practice.

Understanding their perception of drought hazards, risk and vulnerability can help to identify drivers of and barriers to drought risk planning and management in a changing climate at the local level. This paper presents a novel interdisciplinary drought case study in Sweden that integrates soft data from a nationwide survey among more than 100 local practitioners and hard data based on hydrological measurements to provide a holistic assessment of the links between drought severity and the perceived levels of drought severity, impacts, preparedness, and management for two consecutive drought events. The paper highlights challenges for drought risk planning and management in a changing climate at the local level and elaborates on how improved understanding of local practitioners to plan for climate change adaptation can be achieved.

This proof-of-concept study introduces an approach enabling the practitioner to derive allowances for the full distribution of extremes (as opposed to single return periods) and is based on catchment characteristics. A region of influence approach, adopted by the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH), is applied to estimate changes to the parameters of statistical models of extreme flows, as opposed to flow peaks. The approach is distribution neutral and can be applied to any catchment for which an FEH analysis has been undertaken. Results for an example scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 2080s) are compared to a geographically regional method and an example is provided for a single catchment estimating extremes with the FEH method and adjusting them for the RCP8.5 2080s scenario.

Both soil flooding and drying are becoming more common due to climate change, but it is not clear how soil drying prior to flooding influences nutrient solubilization in soils, compared with flooding of already moist soils. This study was designed to examine how soil drying followed by ex-tended flooding might influence solubilization of micronutrient metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Zn and Ni). A series of laboratory mesocosm experiments was carried out by flooding samples of two contrasting grassland soils, which had each been ei-ther dried (40 degrees C for 10 days) or kept at field moisture conditions (25%, w/w). The flooding of dried soils generally resulted in higher concentrations of the micronu-trients (Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) in the water columns relative to their moist-flooded counterparts. The results demonstrate that the flooding-induced variations in pH and redox potential influence solubilization of micronutrients in the soils. The mobilization of Co and Ni appeared to be controlled by redox-driven reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn minerals. This was supported by significant (p < .001) nega-tive correlations between redox and metals: Co (r=-.712), Ni (r = -.784) and the positive correlations between Fe and metals: Co (r = .763) and Ni (r = .714) and between Mn and other metals: Co (r = .909) and Ni (r = .811). However, there were no significant correlations of Zn and Cu with Fe and Mn. The results sug-gest that soil drying followed by flooding has the potential to promote greater solubilization of soil micronutrients compared with flooding of moist soils, with potential implications for soil fertility and catchment water quality under future changes in weather patterns driven by climate change.

Thus, keeping this problem in mind the study was conducted using improved MODIS snow cover product for District Hunza to extract snow cover area (SCA) from 2003 to 2018. ASTER GDEM data was utilized to correlate the topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect) with SCA. Mean monthly and annual rainfall and temperature data were acquired from climate research unit (CRU) to examine the impact of climate change on SCA. The results indicated that District Hunza has a declining trend of SCA on a monthly and annual time scale because mean monthly and annual temperature is increasing with a rate of 0.31 degrees C and 0.10 degrees C, respectively while precipitation is decreasing with a rate of - 2.90 mm/month and - 5.73 mm/year. High seasonal variability has been observed in SCA due to variations in temperature and precipitation. Maximum snow cover area is observed in elevation zone 3-zone 5 in accumulation period while in depletion period maximum SCA is observed in zone 4 and zone 5. The highest snow cover area was observed in slope zone 3 and zone 4 while Northeast and North facing slope aspect has also maximum amount of snow. Monthly, annual, and seasonal SCA has been correlated with climatic parameters and strong relationship has been observed between them. The conclusion can be drawn from this study that increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation are contributing to SCA melting, which can cause flood and water scarcity in downstream regions.

Wetlands have the functions of ecological water storage, water supply, and climate regulation, which plays an indispensable role in global environmental security. The Pumqu River Basin (PRB) is located in an area with extremely vulnerable ecological environment, where climate change is obvious. Understanding wetland distribution, changes and causes in the PRB are of great importance to the rational management and protection of wetlands. Using the Landsat series satellite images, wetlands of this area in 2000, 2010, and 2018 were extracted. The results showed that (1) there were obvious regional differences in wetland types and their distribution patterns in the basin. Wetlands were mainly distributed in areas with slopes less than 12 degrees and at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m. (2) During the past 20 years, the wetland area in the basin decreased, and the changing trend of wetlands was different. Palustrine wetlands decreased tremendously, riverine and lacustrine wetlands first decreased and then increased, while floodplain wetlands first increased and then decreased. Palustrine wetlands were reclaimed to cultivated land, but the proportion of reclamation is small. (3) Climate dominated wetland changes in the PRB. The changes in riverine and lacustrine wetlands were mainly affected by the warm-season average temperature, the change in palustrine wetlands was mainly related to the annual precipitation and the warm-season average temperature, and the change in floodplain wetlands was related to the warm-season precipitation. To achieve sustainable development, the government plays a guiding role and actively formulates and implements wetland protection policies, such as restricting or prohibiting grazing on wetlands, which play an important role in wetland protection and restoration.

However, there areknowledge gaps in our understanding of the quantity and distribution in tropical regions. Specifically, Mexican wetlands have not been considered in global carbon budgets or carbon balances for a number of reasons, such as: (1) the lack of data, (2) Spanish publications have not been selected, or (3) because such balances are mainly made in the English language. This study analyzes the literature regarding carbon stocks, sequestration and fluxes in Mexican forested wetlands (Forest-W). Soil carbon stocks of 8, 24.5 and 40.1 kg cm(-2) were detected for flooded palms, mangroves, and freshwater or swamps (FW) wetland soils, respectively, indicating that FW soils are the Forest-W with more potential for carbon sinks (p = 0.023), compared to mangroves and flooded palm soils. While these assessments of carbon sequestration were ranged from 36 to 920 g-C m(-2) year(-1), C emitted as methane was also tabulated (0.6-196 g-C m(-2) year(-1)). Subtracting the C emitted of the C sequestered, 318.2 g-C m(-2) year(-1) were obtained. Such data revealed that Forest-W function is mainly as carbon sink, and not C source. This review can help to inform practitioners in future decisions regarding sustainable projects, restoration, conservation or creation of wetlands. Finally, it is concluded that Forest-W could be key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate change through carbon storage. However, new studies in this research line and public policies that protect these essential carbon sinks are necessary in order to, hopefully, elaborate global models to make more accurate predictions about future climate.

J	Liu, J; Fan, B				Liu, Jun; Fan, Bo			What contributes to local-level institutional adaptation under climate change? A configurational approach based on evidence from China's Sponge City Program	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Institutional adaptation; Institutional capacity; Bureaucratic reputation; Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis; Sponge city program	REPUTATION; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; INFORMATION; INNOVATION; SECTOR	Unrestrained human industrial and agricultural production activities exacerbate climate change and environ-mental pollution. Climate change leads to an increase in flood risks and the spread of water and soil pollution, resulting in challenges in urban stormwater management. Institutional adaptation to climate change is vital for realizing effective local urban stormwater management. However, the accumulated knowledge on climate adaptation over the past decade has been concentrated at the technical and economic levels, with limited research on institutional adaptation. The Sponge City Program in China selects 30 pilot cities to promote a novel stormwater management approach that combines the reliability of traditional gray infrastructures made of concrete materials with the adaptability and sustainability of green-blue infrastructures based on natural-based solutions, but the extent of institutional adaptation in this process varies considerably across pilot cities. To explain what drives institutional adaptation, a configurational analysis of pilot cities is conducted using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method. Based on data from 628 official reports and 36 interviews, we demonstrate local governments are significant institutional entrepreneurs, and high institutional adaptation occurs with the combined effects of institutional capacity, financial resources, and reputational incentives. There are three types of paths driving institutional adaptation: "strong institutional capacity-strong financial resource -low reputational reserve," "strong institutional capacity-strong financial resource-high reputational competi-tion," and "strong institutional capacity-weak financial resource-low reputational reserve." These three paths account for 72% of the instances of high institutional adaptation outcomes, and 90% of cases share a given configuration of conditions associated with an outcome. Our conclusion advances a theoretical understanding of the drivers of institutional adaptation and provides guidelines for future climate adaptation practices.

However, the observed data of a specified region may differ significantly from the model since the GCM data are simulated on a global scale. To solve this problem, previous studies have used downscaling methods such as quantile mapping (QM) to correct bias in GCM precipitation. However, this method cannot be considered when certain variables affect the observation data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose a novel method that uses a convolution neural network (CNN) considering teleconnection. This new method considers how the global climate phenomena affect the precipitation data of a target area. In addition, various meteorological variables related to precipitation were used as explanatory variables for the CNN model. In this study, QM and the CNN models were applied to calibrate the spatial bias of GCM data for three precipitation stations in Korea (Incheon, Seoul, and Suwon), and the results were compared. According to the results, the QM method effectively corrected the range of precipitation, but the pattern of precipitation was the same at the three stations. Meanwhile, for the CNN model, the range and pattern of precipitation were corrected better than the QM method. The quantitative evaluation selected the optimal downscaling model, and the CNN model had the best performance (correlation coefficient (CC): 69% on average, root mean squared error (RMSE): 117 mm on average). Therefore, the new method suggested in this study is expected to have high utility in forecasting climate change. Finally, as a result of forecasting for future precipitation in 2100 via the CNN model, the average annual rainfall increased by 17% on average compared to the reference data.

Livelihoods transformation and climate change adaptation: The case of smallholder water buffalo farmers in the Philippines	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Climate-resilient livelihoods; Dairy production; Natural disasters; Mixed crop-livestock; Mixed methods	FARMING SYSTEMS; MIXED CROP; LIVESTOCK; IMPACT; TRAJECTORIES; VARIABILITY; INTEGRATION; STRATEGIES; PATHWAYS; ASIA	Livelihood transitions in most agricultural nations are conditioned by changes in both human and climate systems. In the Philippines, climate change related extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and droughts have detrimental impacts on crop production and have significantly affected the livelihoods of cash crop focused rural villages. A shift from crop to livestock production is emerging as a buffer activity to recover from crop losses; however, whether this adaptive response is viable is still unexplored. The aim of this study is to understand how farmers perceive water buffalo as a transformative opportunity and how they use water buffalo in the adaptation process to sustain their livelihoods when the climate becomes more volatile. Data were collected from farming villages in the Nueva Ecija province, the Philippines using mixed methods. It was found that farmers' livelihood patterns evolved as economic consequences of recurrent crop failures caused by typhoons, flooding, and dry spells. Farmers' changed their farming activities as an adaptive response driven by past experiences of climatic changes, farmers' social relations, household capacity, and resources available. The increasing trend of shifting to water buffalo dairying demonstrated farmers' preferences for less risky sources of income in lieu of the opportunities and options available. Thus, local adaptation can be understood to be an outcome of both farmers' livelihood survival strategies and the institutional dynamics in their localities. The results imply a need to integrate adaptation programs that are linked to local livelihood development, particularly in the Carabao Development Program (CDP). This study concludes by suggesting issues to be considered for water buffalo dairying as a viable adaptation option for climate-resilient livelihoods.

Assessing the governance landscape and proposing ways forward for comprehensively managing flood and drought risk	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Stakeholder landscape; Mapping and engagement; Governance structures; Climate change adaptation; Natural hazard and disaster risk management; Climate risk management	STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS; CHANGE ADAPTATION; REDUCTION; CHALLENGES	Climate and weather-related damage have been increasing globally in recent decades. Due to climate change and socio-economic developments, a further increase in climate-related risks is expected. Numerous countries have a long and successful history in disaster risk management (DRM) to avoid, minimize and manage damage caused by extreme weather events. In addition, climate change adaptation (CCA) focuses on managing the risks resulting from climate change today and in the future. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of managing climate-related risks, these two independent approaches need to be linked closer in a more holistic approach - a concept that has been termed climate risk management (CRM). In order to build stronger ties in practice, it is crucial to first understand current governance structures in specific countries or regions. This paper focuses on Austria, a country with experience in both DRM and CCA. In this paper, we present a comprehensive picture of the stakeholder landscape and governance structures in the context of managing climate-related risks. We focus on flooding and agricultural drought, two key risks in Austria. Building on a literature review and a two-stage stakeholder process, consisting of stakeholder interviews and stakeholder workshops, relevant institutions and actors were identified and assigned to a 4-phase CRM cycle. Moreover, specific activities of the identified actors and interactions between them were determined. Based on these insights, we conclude that a comprehensive CRM, which aligns DRM and CCA practice, does not yet exist in Austria. We propose to establish the missing CRM decision-making structures by e.g. instituting a legally-anchored national climate risk council, which can act as an interface between CRM practice and political decision-making.

This paper investigates how climate change will affect the values and functions of Mediterranean seasonally-flooded wetlands with emergent vegetation. We simulated the future evolution of water balance, wetland condition and water volumes necessary to maintain these ecosystems at mid- and late- 21st century, in 229 localities around the Mediterranean basin. We considered future projections of the relevant climatic variables under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios assuming a stabilization (RCP4.5) or increase (RCP 8.5) of greenhouse gases emissions. We found similar increases of water deficits at most localities around 2050 under both RCP scenarios. By 2100, however, water deficits under RCP 8.5 are expected to be more severe and will impact all localities. Simulations performed under current conditions show that 97% of localities could have wetland habitats in good state. By 2050, however, this proportion would decrease to 81% and 68% under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, decreasing further to 52% and 27% by 2100. Our results suggest that wetlands can persist with up to a 400 mm decrease in annual precipitation. Such resilience to climate change is attributed to the semipermanent character of wetlands (lower evaporation on dry ground) and their capacity to act as reservoir (higher precipitation expected in some countries during winter). Countries at highest risk of wetland degradation and loss are Algeria, Morocco, Portugal and Spain. Degradation of wetlands with emergent vegetation will negatively affect their biodiversity and the services they provide by eliminating animal refuges and primary resources for industry and tourism. A sound strategy to preserve these wetlands would consist of proactive management to reduce non-climate stressors. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We employ FEMA disaster declaration data and American Community Survey data to study household post-disaster migration choices. We find that natural disasters increase households' propensity to migrate both out of their county but within their greater metropolitan area, as well as out of their greater metropolitan area, by up to one percentage point. However, low-income households are especially less likely to move following disasters associated with less FEMA aid. We also find that disaster-affected migrants favor safer destinations. While migrating households appear to factor disaster risk reduction into relocation decisions, the results imply the need for incentivizing and aiding migration for vulnerable populations who are less likely to do so on their own.

J	Pralle, S				Pralle, Sarah			Drawing lines: FEMA and the politics of mapping flood zones	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article								Flooding is the most common and damaging of all natural disasters in USA, and climate change is exacerbating the problem. Accurate flood maps are critical to communicating flood risk to vulnerable populations, to mitigating and adapting to floods, and to the functioning of the federal flood insurance program. Yet, we know little about how the mapping process works in practice. This article argues that politics can shape the remapping process in ways that leave communities vulnerable. Because mapping takes place within the context of the National Flood Insurance Program, the conversation at the local level often centers on the costs of revising the flood hazard zones rather than the risks associated with flooding. This can lead to less than optimal responses by individuals and communities, and suggests that the USA is not adequately preparing for future climate change impacts.

For Taiwan in particular, the corresponding increase in disaster risk threatens not only the environment but also the lives, safety, and property of people. This highlights the need to develop a methodology for mapping disaster risk under climate change and delineating those regions that are potentially high-risk areas requiring adaptation to a changing climate in the future. This study provides a framework of flood risk map assessment under the RCP8.5 scenario by using different spatial scales to integrate the projection climate data of high resolution, inundation potential maps, and indicator-based approach at the end of the 21st century in Taiwan. The reference period was 1979-2003, and the future projection period was 2075-2099. High-resolution climate data developed by dynamic downscaling of the MRI-JMA-AGCM model was used to assess extreme rainfall events. The flood risk maps were constructed using two different spatial scales: the township level and the 5 km x 5 km grid. As to hazard-vulnerability(H-V) maps, users can overlay maps of their choice-such as those for land use distribution, district planning, agricultural crop distribution, or industrial distribution. Mapping flood risk under climate change can support better informed decision-making and policy-making processes in planning and preparing to intervene and control flood risks. The elderly population distribution is applied as an exposure indicator in order to guide advance preparation of evacuation plans for high-risk areas. This study found that higher risk areas are distributed mainly in northern and southern parts of Taiwan and the hazard indicators significantly increase in the northern, north-eastern, and southern regions under the RCP8.5 scenario. Moreover, the near-riparian and coastal townships of central and southern Taiwan have higher vulnerability levels. Approximately 14% of townships have a higher risk level of flooding disaster and another 3% of townships will become higher risk. For higher-risk townships, adaptation measures or strategies are suggested to prioritize improving flood preparation and protecting people and property. Such a flood risk map can be a communication tool to effectively inform decision- makers, citizens, and stakeholders about the variability of flood risk under climate change. Such maps enable decision-makers and national spatial planners to compare the relative flood risk of individual townships countrywide in order to determine and prioritize risk adaptation areas for planning spatial development policies.

Climate resilient agriculture and enhancing food production: Field experience from Agusan del Norte, Caraga Region, Philippines	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						climate change; climate-resilient agriculture; mitigation; vulnerability mapping; adaptive capacity; climate risk	CROP DIVERSIFICATION; ADAPTATION	This paper describes the assessment of climate risks, the vulnerability of farmlands, and the adaptive farming practices to climate change with the use of GIS, field observations, stakeholder consultation and interviews and case documentation. GIS-based climate risk vulnerability assessment maps were generated to pinpoint the areas with the major climate hazards in Agusan del Norte. The vulnerability of the farmlands, and the adaptive capacity of the farms were assessed with index scoring. Also, adaptation to climate change based on the most problematic hazard (flooding) was observed on the two groups of farmers (with and without climate resilient agriculture (CRA)/cropping system adjustments) for cost and benefit comparison. The results show flooding and drought as the significant hazards in Agusan del Norte (Caraga Region) and high vulnerability to these hazards due to low coping mechanisms for most farms. Low adaptive capacity was also observed among these farms. Case-based observations on adaptation in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte revealed that well-timed adjustments to the usual cropping system can increase farm income despite of the flood and inundation for 2-3 months. This study recommends for harmonized measures toward advocating strengthened adaptive capacity for agriculture across Agusan del Norte. Further climate R&D and increasing policy support on climate financing and CRA options are highly encouraged for the agricultural stakeholders to take action. For hard-pressed farmers with constrained access to improved varieties and technologies, timing is potentially essential to circumvent damages from climate change to gain economic and psychosocial benefits with well-timed adaptation measures.

The existing nonstationary design flood estimation methods usually focus on the statistical nonstationarity of the flow data series in the catchment, which neglect the hydraulic approach, such as reservoir flood regulation. In this paper, a novel approach to comprehensively consider the driving factors of non-stationarities in design flood estimation is proposed, which involves three main steps: (1) implementation of the candidate predictors with trend tests and change point detection for preliminary analysis; (2) application of the nonstationary flood frequency analysis with the principle of Equivalent Reliability (ER) for design flood volumes; (3) development of a nonstationary most likely regional composition (NS-MLRC) method, and the estimation of a design flood hydrograph at downstream cascade reservoirs. The proposed framework is applied to the cascade reservoirs in the Han River, China. The results imply that: (1) the NS-MLRC method provides a much better explanation for the nonstationary spatial correlation of the flood events in Han River basin, and the multiple nonstationary driving forces can be precisely quantified by the proposed design flood estimation framework; (2) the impacts of climate change and population growth are long-lasting processes with significant risk of flood events compared with stationary distribution conditions; and (3) the swift effects of cascade reservoirs are reflected in design flood hydrographs with lower peaks and lesser volumes. This study can provide a more integrated template for downstream flood risk management under the impact of climate change and human activities.</p>	[Xie, Yuzuo; Guo, Shenglian; Xiong, Lihua; Tian, Jing] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Feng] Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Bur Hydrol, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China	Wuhan University	Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.	yuzuoxie@whu.edu.cn; slguo@whu.edu.cn; xionglh@whu.edu.cn; jingtian@whu.edu.cn; fxiong07@whu.edu.cn		Xiong, Lihua/0000-0001-6990-2414; Guo, shenglian/0000-0002-8594-4988	National Natural Science Foundation of China [51879192]; China Three Gorges Corporation [0799254]; Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project) [274310]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Three Gorges Corporation; Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project)(Research Council of Norway)	This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51879192), China Three Gorges Corporation (0799254), and the Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project No. 274310).		81	3	3	7	58	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4441		WATER-SUI	Water	OCT	2021	13	19							2687	10.3390/w13192687	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192687			24	Environmental Sciences; Water Resources	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources	WI3UF		gold			2024-04-22	WOS:000708288900001

This study was conducted in hazard-prone districts, Kurigram (riverbank erosion-prone) and Nilphamari (drought-prone), of the northwest region of Bangladesh to compare farmers' perceptions of CC with meteorological trends, and to examine farm adaptation measures. A total of 252 smallholder households were interviewed. Household survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and field observations were carried out to collect the primary data. The findings revealed that farmers' perceptions of CC were consistent with the meteorological trends of the past 30 years (1986-2015) and showed increasing temperature parameters and decreasing rainfall parameters. Farmers perceived negative impacts were increased summer temperature and length of summer days, decreased rainfall intensity, number of rainy days and length of winter days as well as increased intensity of floods, droughts, riverbank erosion and other natural hazards. The farmers also noted significant moderate to high impact of CC on agricultural production. The practiced adaptation strategies were low to medium, and almost all the households applied traditional strategies including compost and manure in their fields and practiced crop rotation as well as homestead gardening to minimize the adverse impact of CC. The study recommends bridging information gaps between the scientific community and farmers about CC adaptation options to meet challenges posed by CC. This study also provides field-based evidence for devising CC mitigation and adaptation policies.	[Roy, Debashis; Datta, Avishek; Kuwornu, John K.

J	Wasko, C; Nathan, R				Wasko, Conrad; Nathan, Rory			Influence of changes in rainfall and soil moisture on trends in flooding	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Flooding; Extreme rainfall; Soil moisture; Trend analysis; Antecedent moisture conditions; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; NON-STATIONARITY; SPATIAL EXTENT; BASE-FLOW; DATA-SETS; AUSTRALIA; RUNOFF; TEMPERATURE; GENERATION	Despite the expectation that increases in rainfall with climatic change will result in increases in pluvial flooding, there is more historical evidence for decreases in flood magnitude. In Australia, as in many other parts of the world, flood magnitudes are mostly decreasing, despite increasing rainfall extremes. Here, we show how changes in soil moisture have led to decreasing flood magnitudes while rainfall extremes have been increasing. Using gauged streamflow, catchment average rainfall, and modelled soil moisture data across Australia we confirm that streamflow peaks (or floods) that occur at least once a year are strongly related to both the peak rainfall causing the flood and the antecedent soil moisture conditions preceding the storm event. Regions where the magnitude of the peak flow has decreased are visually and statistically correlated to regions of decreasing soil moisture. Flood magnitudes are more likely to increase only for the rarest events, with increases in rainfall offset by decreases in soil moisture for more frequent events. A recurrence interval dependent tipping point is identified beyond which trends in catchment rainfall outweigh those of soil moisture trends and dominate the flood response. For regions where soil moisture has decreased, this tipping point occurs at an average recurrence interval of ten years or more. As most studies investigating trends in flooding generally use annual maxima, changes in soil moisture are likely to be the dominant mechanism behind observed flood trends. Hence changes in soil moisture conditions need to be considered when predicting catchment flood response due to climatic change.

J	Nandi, S; Swain, S				Nandi, Saswata; Swain, Sabyasachi			Analysis of heatwave characteristics under climate change over three highly populated cities of South India: a CMIP6-based assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Heatwave; CMIP6; Maximum temperature; South India	WAVES; PROJECTIONS; MODEL; IMPACT	Climate change is arguably the most alarming global concern of the twenty-first century, particularly due to the increased frequency of meteorological extremes, e.g., heatwaves, droughts, and floods. Heatwaves are considered a potential health risk and urge further study, robust preparedness, and policy framing. This study presents an analysis of heatwave characteristics for historical (1980-2014), near-future (2021-2055), and far-future (2056-2090) scenarios over three highly populated cities of South India, i.e., Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Two different approaches, i.e., the India Meteorological Department (IMD) criterion and the percentile-based criterion, are considered for defining the threshold of a heatwave day. Nine general circulation models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) experiment are selected, evaluated after bias correction, and the best performer was utilized to obtain the temperature projections corresponding to two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP 2-4.5 and 5-8.5) for the future periods. The results reveal a high frequency of heatwave days over the cities in recent years from both approaches, which may further exacerbate in the future, thereby putting a large population at risk. The number of heatwave days is much higher for SSP5-8.5 than that for SSP2-4.5, depicting the direct effects of anthropogenic activities on the frequency of heatwaves. The detailed analysis of heatwave projections will help develop equitable heat resilient mitigation and adaptation strategies for the future, thereby alleviating their pernicious impacts.

The CCF was designed as a surcharge value to be added to all new technical flood protection facilities, such as dams, protection walls, and retention areas. This paper deconstructs the conditions and processes that led to the creation of this new policy instrument. Following the instrument choice framework, the paper analyzes in a heuristic manner, the institutions, actors, discourses, and decision context that were part of this process from the early 1990s to 2004, when the instrument was introduced. In order to better understand the scope of this regional instrument, the paper also briefly depicts four non-representative cases of flood risk and protection management, where the instrument was either applied or avoided. The article closes with an assessment of the CCF, concluding that the innovativeness of this instrument faded once the overarching sectoral paradigm shifted from technical flood protection to more comprehensive flood risk management.

Loss of terrestrial biodiversity in Australia: Magnitude, causation, and response	SCIENCE			English	Review							EXTINCTION RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HARE-WALLABY; CONSERVATION; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; DECLINE; MAMMALS; THREATS	Australia's biota is species rich, with high rates of endemism. This natural legacy has rapidly diminished since European colonization. The impacts of invasive species, habitat loss, altered fire regimes, and changed water flows are now compounded by climate change, particularly through extreme drought, heat, wildfire, and flooding. Extinction rates, already far exceeding the global average for mammals, are predicted to escalate across all taxa, and ecosystems are collapsing. These losses are symptomatic of shortcomings in resourcing, law, policy, and management. Informed by examples of advances in conservation practice from invasive species control, Indigenous land management, and citizen science, we describe interventions needed to enhance future resilience. Many characteristics of Australian biodiversity loss are globally relevant, with recovery requiring society to reframe its relationship with the environment.

Faced with growing uncertainties, managers are struggling to find appropriate risk management strategies. Alongside traditional risk management strategies, the concept of Urban Resilience is embedded in political discourses, international and local strategies. However, this concept remains still very abstract for a lot of actors, a buzzword difficult to operationalize. The objective of this work is to concretize urban resilience to floods by proposing a spatial decision support tool co-built with urban managers. The proposed methodology is a holistic approach integrating three indicators of resilience applied to the Avignon rase study (Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur Region).

Recently, it has been recognized that some regions in Egypt have exposed to extreme rainfall events which led in some cases to severe flash floods. In this work, the variability of rainfall characteristics in Egypt was investigated based on a detailed statistical analysis of historical rainfall records at 31 stations. Both parametric (Pearson) and non-parametric (Mann-Kendall and Spearman) tests were applied on annual and seasonal precipitation indices to examine temporal trends. A classification of significant trends was introduced to assess the degrees of their likelihood. The results detected significant trends in annual indices: maximum precipitation, total precipitation, simple daily intensity index, and number of rainy days at 29, 19, 19, and 13% of stations, respectively. Significant trends in seasonal indices were also found at a few stations. For all indices, 77% of the detected significant trends are negative concluding a decrease in the amount of precipitation in Egypt. Additionally, only 6% of the detected trends are classified as less likely, while the rest is likely and extremely likely, indicating a high probability of most detected trends. Generally, the detected trends do not form any spatial pattern in all cases. The results also provided a preliminary impression on the likely impacts of climate change on rainfall characteristics in Egypt.	[Gado, Tamer A.; El-Hagrsy, Rufayda M.; Rashwan, I. M.

Our paper seeks to demonstrate how we, as guests on Maori land, were able to develop a partnership with a Maori community facing difficult adaptation decisions regarding climate change hazards through the pragmatic navigation of multi-disciplinary research and practice. In particular, we co-developed and tested the potential of a serious game (Marae-opoly) approach as a platform which assembles cross-cultural climate change knowledge to learn, safely experiment and inform adaptation decisions. Marae-opoly was developed bespoke to its intended context-to support the creation of mutually agreeable dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) for localized flood adaptation. Game material was generated by drawing together detailed local knowledge (i.e. hydrology, climate data, matauranga hapu) and situated adaptation options and accurate contextual data to create a credible gaming experience for the hapu of Tangoio Marae. We argue that the in-situ co-development process used to co-create Marae-opoly was fundamental in its success in achieving outcomes for the hapu. It also provided important lessons for the research team regarding how to enter as respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a resource to support our partners' adaptation decisions. The paper discusses the steps taken to establish research partnerships and develop the serious game and its subsequent playing, albeit we do not evaluate our indigenous research partners' adaptation decisions. Our contribution with this paper is in sharing an approach which cultivated the ground to enter as respectful guests and work together effectively to provide a resource for our partners' adaptation decisions.

J	Nedergaard, M; Baron, N				Nedergaard, Mikkel; Baron, Nina			Water under the bridge: how place meanings shape second homeowners' engagement in flood risk management in southern Denmark	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Flood risk management; Citizen engagement; Place meanings; Narratives; Second homeowners	SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY; HOME OWNERS; ATTACHMENT; SENSE; PERCEPTIONS; RESIDENTS; LESSONS; POWER	In Europe, climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme precipitation events. Consequently, low-lying areas in southern Denmark may experience increased flooding. In this predominantly rural landscape, large areas of wetland were initially reclaimed for agricultural purposes, before being developed into recreational areas for second homes, many of which are now vulnerable to flooding. Local and national policy on flood risk management and climate change adaptation is based on the assumption that effective adaptation actions require citizen engagement. However, local authorities' efforts to motivate homeowners to engage in collective actions have had mixed results. We adopt a case study approach, and explore how second homeowners' place meanings shape, and are shaped by, how they experienced a climate-related hazard, and how this, in turn, informs their motivation to engage in collective flood risk management efforts. Specifically, in-depth narrative interviews were conducted with second homeowners who experienced an extreme weather event in 2011, which led to severe flooding. The findings show that place meanings can vary within the same stakeholder group, in this case, second homeowners. However, both second homeowners whose place meanings can be likened to that of a "temporary visitor", and those whose place meanings are more akin to that of the "permanent resident" are able to mobilise their place meanings to contest engagement in local authorities' flood risk reduction initiatives.

Mobile Bay in the United States is a large estuarine system along the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coast, providing critical ecosystem services for the nation. This region is however subject to increased urbanization and uncertain impacts of climate change. To ensure sustainability of this important ecosystem, it is imperative to examine the changing spatial patterns of community vulnerability to environmental changes in this region. Using data from the U.S. Census of multiple years, we investigate the changing spatial patterns of social vulnerability at the census block group level in Mobile Bay consisting of Mobile County and Baldwin County over the past 20 years (2000 - 2020). Additionally, we utilize hotspot and cluster analyses to formalize the observations of the spatiotemporal changes. Further, we examine how land use and land cover (LULC) changes co-occur with social vulnerability changes across Mobile Bay. We identify several hotspots where land cover has been converted to urban land and social vulnerability has increased. The investigation of the spatial patterns over a relatively long period helps to deepen the insight into the dynamic spatiotemporal changes of social and environmental vulnerability. This insight can better inform future plans to cope with climate change and ensure sustainability. Specifically, hotspots that have undergone urbanization and increased social vulnerability demand special attention from policy makers for future risk mitigation and disaster planning.

Detention ponds are used in urban stormwater management, providing two-fold benefits: flood risk reduction and pollution load minimization. This paper investigates the performance of nine proposed detention ponds (across the city of Renton, Washington, USA) under different climate change scenarios. First, a statistical model was developed to estimate the pollutant load for the current and future periods and to understand the effects of increased rainfall on stormwater runoff and pollutant loads. The Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM) platform is employed to calibrate an urban drainage model for quantifying stormwater runoff and corresponding pollutant loads. The calibrated model was used to investigate the performance of the proposed nine (9) detention ponds under future climate scenarios of 100-year design storms, leading to identifying if they are likely to reduce stormwater discharge and pollutant loads. Results indicated significant increases in stormwater pollutants due to increases in rainfall from 2023 to 2050 compared to the historical period 2000-2014. We found that the performance of the proposed detention ponds in reducing stormwater pollutants varied depending on the size and location of the detention ponds. Simulations for the future indicated that the selected detention ponds are likely to reduce the concentrations (loads) of different water quality constituents such as ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrate (NO3), total phosphate (TP), and suspended solids (SS) ranging from 18 to 86%, 35-70%, 36-65%, 26-91%, and 34-81%, respectively. The study concluded that detention ponds can be used as a reliable solution for reducing stormwater flows and pollutant loads under a warmer future climate and an effective adaptation option to combat climate change related challenges in urban stormwater management.

Freshwater clupeids vitally control the aquatic food chain by grazing on algae. Despite increasing food availability, IUCN Red List (R) revealed 16 freshwater clupeids with a decreasing population trend. We investigated one such species' reproductive dependencies, Gudusia chapra (Indian river shad), in the lower Gangetic drainage (India) under a mixed context of climate change and overfishing. Monthly rainfall (>= 60-100 mm) and water temperature (>= 31-32 degrees C) are key breeding cues for females. The regional climate seems inclined to fulfill these through the significant part of the breeding season, and indeed the species has maintained consistent breeding phenology over 20 years. Other breeding thresholds relevant to fishing include size at first maturity (>= 6.8 cm; reduced by similar to 25-36%) and pre-spawning girth (Girth(spawn50) >= 7 cm; first record). Girth(spawn50) is a proxy of the minimum mesh size requirement of fishing nets to allow safe passage of "gravid" females (+ 22% bulged abdomen) and breed. The operational fishing nets (3-10 cm mesh) probably have been indulged in indiscriminative fishing of gravid females for generations. Under a favorably changing climate and food availability, existing evidence suggests a fishery-induced evolution in regional females (to circumvent such mesh sizes) through earlier maturation/puberty at smaller sizes. It could be an early warning sign of population collapse (smaller females -> lessening fecundity -> fewer offspring). Overfishing seemed to be a bigger threat than climate change.

In many nations, this global epidemic has affected lives, property, and financial damage. Pakistan has experienced many floods in the past several years. Due to economic, social, and climate change, Pakistan is at risk of flooding. In order to overcome this problem, the institutions of the country have taken various measures. However, these measures are not sufficient enough to ensure the safety of communities and areas that are prone to disasters with a rapid onset. Hence, it is imperative to forecast future flood-related risks and take necessary measures to mitigate the adverse impacts and losses caused by floods. This article is aimed at exploring floods in Pakistan, analyze the adverse effects of floods on humans and the environment, and propose possible sustainable options for the future. The aqueduct flood analyzer software was used to examine the impact of floods on gross domestic product (GDP), urban damage, and people livelihood, with several years of flood protection plans. To adequately assess the future changes, various flood protection levels and three scenarios for each level of protection were employed, which represent the socio-economic and climate change. The findings revealed that if there is no flood protection, a 2-year flood has a 50% probability of flood occurrence in any given area and may cause no significant impact on GDP, population, and urban damage. Similarly, the probability of a flood occurrence in a five-year flood is 20%, which may cause the country's GDP about $20.4 billion, with 8.4 million population at risk and $1.4 billion urban damage. Furthermore, a 10-year flood has a 10% probability of flood occurrence and may affect the national GDP by $28.9 billion, with 11.9 million affected population and $2.4 billion urban damage in Pakistan. The government of Pakistan should devise appropriate climate change policies, improve disaster preparedness, build new dams, and update relevant departments to mitigate the adverse effects of flooding.

These include increasing flood hazards and the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly recognized within strategies to provide multiple ecosystem services to mitigate existing risks and pressures, as well as to make cities more resilient and livable. Although being increasingly addressed within the literature, NBS implementation on the ground still faces many technical and financial barriers. This paper aims to test the potential of selected NBS in mitigating the effects of identified climate change risks, i.e., the UHI effect and urban floods, in the Turin urban area (north-western Italy). Four different intervention NBS-based scenarios are developed. The supply of ecosystem services by NBS in each scenario is assessed using InVEST models and the effectiveness of NBS investments is analyzed by calculating and comparing the associated costs and benefits. Different results in terms of effectiveness and economic viability are observed for each scenario and each NBS. Flood risk mitigation oriented NBS seem to have the most impact, in particular forested green areas and retention ponds. The results are relevant to suggest policy mix strategies to embed NBS in city planning.

In this context, this research aimed to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the socio-biodiversity chains in the region of Medio Jurua-Amazonas. Collections were carried out in two communities located in the Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) Uacari, in July 2022, through participatory workshops. The communities affirm that the extreme flood events of the Jurua River are more intense in recent years, both concerning the extreme levels of the river and in periodicity and speed of flooding. The large floods have impacted the productive calendar, generating losses for farmers. In addition, rubber trees and cassava plantations have been dying with the large floods, and oil seeds are being carried by the water before harvest. The physical data of the Jurua River shows a trend of increasing extreme floods over the last 40 years for the period November to April, highlighting the years 2013 to 2015 and 2021 with the largest positive anomalies. Farmers have adapted their calendars, modified some planting areas to locations with higher altitudes and farther from the river banks, and have sought new rubber matrices. The results point to the need for mitigation and adaptation measures promoted by local governments.

Such stream temperature increase is likely to affect aquatic communities, with predicted declines and range shifts of cold stenothermic species and a facilitated dispersal and population development in temperature-tolerant species, including invasive ones. This study analyzed how thermal changes affect macroinvertebrate community compositions in three differentiated thermal regions within a single stream system. In each thermal region, we used standard surber sampling in combination with in-stream cross-exposure experiments, comparing the thermal response of native vs. non-native gammarids (Gammarus roeselii and Dikerogammarus villosus). Macroinvertebrate species composition was highly dependent on temperature, with indigenous gammarids preferring colder sites and invasive ones such as D. villosus being dominant at higher temperatures. Species composition was also strongly affected by season, substratum and the presence of macrophytes. In light of climate change, consideration of shifts in community composition highly driven by temperature needs to become integrated with biological response patterns related to morphological and flow degradation, chemical pollution and fine sediment. Such an approach is crucial for the effective conservation and restoration of native biodiversity and for a realistic prediction of the ability to reach policy targets for aquatic ecosystems.

The fine-grained vulnerability analysis is necessary but little has been done. A quantitative indicator-based approach for vulnerability assessment of urban water infrastructures was developed, by successively quantifying exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity at the city level. When a spatial downscaling was used to project local precipitations for measuring exposures to urban flooding and drought, 33 indicators were designed to characterize the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of water-related infrastructures in a city. The method was tested with 22 provincial capital cities of China under two emission scenarios including RCP8.5 and RCP4.5. The sensitivity analysis on indicator weights indicates adequate stableness of the assessment system. Around 40 similar to 50% case cities would confront the challenges to better coping with flooding or/and drought hazards due to vulnerable infrastructures. Showing no spatial distribution pattern, the vulnerability mechanism at the city level is multifactorial driving and heterogeneous, while different dimensions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity may dominate separately or synthetically. These findings highlight the necessity of more city-level assessments and city-specific responses of urban infrastructures. The assessment system could serve as a practical tool to facilitate further understanding of climatic vulnerabilities and development of effective adaptation policies.

Expanding the Geographic Boundaries of Melioidosis in Queensland, Australia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE			English	Article							FATAL HUMAN MELIOIDOSIS; DARWIN	Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although this environmental organism is endemic in certain regions of Australia, it is not considered endemic in Southern Queensland, where the last case was reported 21 years ago. We report a climate change-associated outbreak of melioidosis occurring during two La Nina events in a region previously considered nonendemic for B. pseudomallei. During a 15-month period, 14 cases of locally acquired melioidosis were identified. Twelve patients were adults (> 50 years), with diabetes mellitus the most common risk factor in 6 of 12 patients (50%). Eleven patients (79%) had direct exposure to floodwaters or the flooded environment. This study suggests an association between climate change and an increased incidence of melioidosis. In addition, this is the first report of environmental sampling and whole-genome analysis to prove endemicity and local acquisition in this region.	[Gassiep, Ian; Harris, Patrick N.

In a watershed, a particularly important research question concerning the relationship between land use and climate change and the flood risk is the subject of controversy in the literature. This study aims to assess the effects of land use and climate change on the flood susceptibility in the watershed Nhat Le-Kien Giang, Vietnam using machine learning and Land Change Modeler. The results show that Social Ski Driver Optimization (SSD), Fruit Fly Optimization (FFO), Sailfish Optimization (SFO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) successfully improve the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model's performance, with a value of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.96. Among them, the SVM-FFO model was better with the value of AUC of 0.984, followed by SVM-SFO (AUC = 0.983), SVM-SSD (AUC = 0.98), SVM-PSO (AUC = 0.97), respectively. In addition, the areas with high and very high flood susceptibility in the study area increased by about 30 km(2) from 2020 to 2050 with the SVM-FFO model. Our results underline the consequences of unplanned development. Thus, by applying the theoretical framework of this study, decision makers can take sound more planning measures, such as avoiding construction in areas often affected by floods, etc. Although in this study flood susceptibility is studied in a Central Coast province, the results can be applied to other rapidly developing and flood-prone provinces of Vietnam.

We compare the survival model with a flexible logistic model and an extreme gradient boosting algorithm. We estimate the models on a portfolio of mortgages in Florida, consisting of 69,046 loans and 3,707,831 loan-month observations with localization data at the five-digit ZIP code level. We find a statistically significant and non-linear impact of tropical cyclone intensity on default as well as a significant impact of heavy rains in areas with large exposure to flood risks. These findings confirm existing results in the literature and also provide estimates of the impact of the extreme event characteristics on mortgage risk, e.g. the impact of tropical cyclones on default more than doubles in magnitude when moving from a hurricane of category two to a hurricane of category three or more. We build on the identified effect of exposure to flood risk (in interaction with heavy rainfall) on mortgage default to perform a scenario analysis of the future impacts of climate change using the First Street flood model, which provides projections of exposure to floods in 2050 under RCP 4.5. We find a systematic increase in risk under climate change that can vary based on the scenario of extreme events considered. Climate-adjusted credit risk allows risk managers to better evaluate the impact of climate-related risks on mortgage portfolios.

Understanding the future impacts of such events on global populations can provide decision-making support for policies aiming to mitigate climate change. Here, we investigated the population exposure to eight climate extreme indices and drivers of exposure trajectories based on National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 and population projection data under four shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. The results show that by the mid-twenty-first century, most regions worldwide, especially Africa and South America, will continue to experience record-breaking temperatures and compound drought and heatwaves (CDHWs). Regarding population exposure, under SSP3-7.0 in the late twenty-first century, the mean value of the multimodel median expected annual exposure (EAE) of all extreme temperature indices and CDHW reaches 8.12 billion persons per year. Population exposure hotspots will be concentrated in Central Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, mostly in developing countries, where 55.01%-87.42% of the EAE is found. The drivers of exposure trajectories are spatially heterogeneous. The increase in record-breaking probability contributes more than population growth to EAE growth in most regions of the world except Central Asia, the Middle East, and most of Africa. These findings reveal the future trajectories of record-breaking probabilities and population exposures for climate extremes, which can inform understanding of the intersections between climate change and population change and future risk management.

To predict and mitigate the effects of these trends, accurate modeling of urban stormwater changes is required at scales and resolutions meaningful to stormwater management. Although numerous studies have analyzed the effect of climate change on urban flooding risk using the event-based approach, none have incorporated the continuous modelling approach to investigate the whole spectrum of changes in an urban catchment. This study analyzes seasonal changes in future urban hydrological behavior using a mini-ensemble of six state-of-the-art climate model projections and a calibrated hydrological-hydraulic Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The modelling results show future changes in seasonal and monthly hydrological behavior. The notable winter warming is the major driver in the future snow processes, resulting in considerably less snow days and an increase in the flow events frequency during the winter months. The modelling results also suggest an increase in the annual maximum hourly flow in all seasons, with the clearest trend modelled in winter. Monthly average runoff during the cold period is modelled to increase, while no clear trends are detected for the rest of the year. There is a clear added benefit in using convection-permitting regional climate models throughout the year. Overall, the climate change mitigation and adaption strategies in urban catchments should focus more on the whole spectrum of changes rather than only on urban pluvial flooding risk. These findings call for a transition from traditional to a more advanced stormwater management.

The intensity and frequency of this extreme weather event are expected to increase due to significant changes in the present-day climate and land use and land cover (LULC) pattern. India has a very systematic and organized structural program and policies but lacks proper implementations, and adverse effect of climate change and the extreme event goes on in society. This paper is an analysis of floods in India and hazards due to climate change and LULC change patterns. Three models, namely "Eco-biogeography-based optimization (EBO), Random forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM) " were used to obtain the final output to prepare a "Flood susceptibility map ". The result was validated through the "Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) " with "Area under curve (AUC) " values. The future rainfall scenario has been estimated by considering the "General circulation models " through different "shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) ". The values of AUC are 0.915 (EBO), 0.887 (RF), and 0.869 (SVM), respectively. After consideration of different SSPs, the result shows that there is an increasing tendency of flood hazards in the projected period. Among all the employed modelling approaches, the EBO model has notable potential in delineating the possible flood-prone regions for effective flood planning and management. Decision-makers can benefit from country-specific information and regional planner to implement sustainable and long-term measures to overcome this type of hazardous situation.

However, a core method used in the SWAT model, the temperature index method, assumes both the dates for maximum and minimum snowmelt factors and the snowmelt temperature threshold, which leads to inaccuracies in simulating snowmelt runoff in seasonal snowmelt regions. In this paper, we present the development and application of an improved temperature index method for SWAT (SWAT+) in simulating the daily snowmelt runoff in a seasonal snowmelt area of Northeast China. The improvements include the introduction of total radiation to the temperature index method, modification of the snowmelt factor seasonal variation formula, and changing the snowmelt temperature threshold according to the snow depth derived from passive microwave remote sensing data and temperature in the seasonal snowmelt area. Further, the SWAT+ model is applied to study climate change impact on future snowmelt runoff (2025-2054) under the climate change scenarios including SSP2.6, SSP4.5, and SSP8.5. Much improved snowmelt runoff simulation is obtained as a result, supported by several metrics, such as MAE, RE, RMSE, R-2, and NSE for both the calibration and validation. Compared with the baseline period (1980-2019), the March-April ensemble average snowmelt runoff is shown to decrease under the SSP2.6, SSP4.5, and SSP8.5 scenario during 2025-2054. This study provides a valuable insight into the efficient development and utilization of spring water resources in seasonal snowmelt areas.

Particularizing adaptation to non-predominant hazards: A history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland from 1903 to 2019	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Adaptation; Hazards; Wildfires; History; Climate; Ireland	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DOUBLE-EXPOSURE; RIVER; RESILIENCE; ARCHIVES; DROUGHT; AFRICA; MEMORY; FLOODS; SEA	Recent years have seen a historical turn in research on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. This has included a call for historical research that particularizes adaptation in specific locations. This paper responds to this call by using newspaper archives to construct a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland. This study goes beyond existing research that particularizes adaptation, by using this history as a lens through which to evaluate current adaptation policy. In doing so it uncovers problematic mismatches between the experience of local communities living with wildfire hazards and current climate change adaptation policies. National adaptation policy in Ireland presents uncontrolled wildfires as a largely new and unfamiliar hazard that requires innovative management approaches. However, newspaper archives reveal that local communities have adopted a variety of adaptive practices for wildfire hazards for over a century, and that these practices have coevolved with shifting economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. This paper also introduces the concept of non-predominant hazards, that is hazards that are often overlooked, forgotten, or neglected. Historical research on non-predominant hazards can play an important role in making visible trajectories of adaptation for such hazards. This study also points towards how deeper particularization studies that examine the long-term usage of specific adaptation practices can also be used to test the effectiveness of these practices through time, and to offer lessons for contemporary adaptation. These results have implications for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to non-predominant hazards in a variety of contexts.

First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an 'open moment' of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all.

Resilience based analysis is carried out using SWMM for a part of Gurugram City of Haryana, India. For simulating the drainage system response, half-hourly rainfall data available from GPM-IMERG was utilized to estimate the design storm of suitable duration. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to overcome the problem of lack of in-depth data to perform model calibration and validation. Besides, a comparison of three different estimation approaches of subcatchment width, an important SWMM parameter, is also presented. Different rainfall and urban growth scenarios were considered to analyse the drainage system's functional and structural resilience. For the studied UDS, a total of 22 vulnerable nodes were identified through the structural resilience approach, and the functional resilience approach revealed that urbanization has more pronounced effects on UDS than climate change.

The index-flood method, a popular approach for RFFA, is based on the assumption that the flood records within a homogeneous region are identically distributed, except for a site-specific index flood. Because of rapidly changing land-use patterns, human interventions, and climate change, recent studies proposed extension of the index-flood method to account for nonstationarity in flood records. This work compared index-flood-based nonstationary RFFA techniques, in both synthetically generated and real-world homogeneous regions, with sites marked by significant trends in flood records. From the data used in the analysis, it is evident that two recently proposed transformation-based approaches are more suitable compared to other methods, and can capture time-varying behavior of floods effectively.

Employment accessibility and rising seas	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sea-level rise; Climate change; Accessibility	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEVEL RISE; NEW-JERSEY; VULNERABILITY; EXPOSURE; DAMAGE	Recent projections suggest worst-case scenarios of more than six ft (1.8 m) of global mean sea level rise by end of century, progressively making coastal flood events more frequent and more severe. The impact on transportation systems along coastal regions is likely to be substantial. An analysis of impacts for Atlantic and Cape May counties in southern New Jersey is conducted. The impact on accessibility to employment is analyzed using a dataset of sea-level increases merged with road network (TIGER) data and Census data on population and employment. Using measures of accessibility, it is shown how access will be reduced at the block-group level. An additional analysis of low and high income quartiles suggest that lower-income block groups will have greater reductions in accessibility. The implication is that increasing sea levels will have large impacts on people and the economy, and large populations will have access to employment disrupted well before their own properties or places of employment may begin to flood (assuming no adaptation).

It is acknowledged that climate change will persist and perhaps intensify in the future, and it is thus meaningful to explore the quantitative impacts of these changes on hydrological regimes. The Jiulong River basin serves as an important watershed on the southeast coast of China. However, future hydrological changes under the combined impacts of climate change and land use change have been barely investigated. In this study, the climate outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were corrected and spatially downscaled by a statistical downscaling method combining quantile mapping and machine learning. The future high-resolution land use maps were projected by the CA-Markov model with land use changes from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) as constraints. The future dynamic vegetation process was projected by the Biome-GBC model, and then, the future hydrological process under four representative concentration pathways and shared socioeconomic pathways (RCP-SSP) combined scenarios was simulated by a distributed hydrological model. Based on the copula method, the flood frequency and corresponding return periods were derived. The results demonstrated that future precipitation and air temperature would continue to rise, and future land use changes would have different developing pathways determined by the designs in various SSP-RCPs. Under the combined impacts of climate and land use change, the total available water resources will increase due to increasing precipitation, and the high flow and low flow will both increase at three stations under the four SSP-RCPs. The annual 1-day maximum discharge is projected to increase by 67-133% in the last decade of the 21st century, and the annual 7-day minimum discharge is projected to increase by 19-39%. The flood frequency analysis showed that the Jiulong River basin would face more frequent floods in the future. By the end of the 21st century, the station-average frequency of a historical 100-year flood will increase by 122% under the most optimistic scenario (SSP126) and increase by 213% under the scenario of greatest regional rivalry (SSP370). We demonstrated that climate change would be the major cause for the increase in future high flows and that land use change would dominate future changes in low flows. Finally, we recommend integrated and sustainable water management systems to tackle future challenges in this coastal basin.

Potential climate change-related increases in flood intensity are therefore of major societal concern as more than 40 million people live in flood-prone areas in downstream Bangladesh. Here we report on new flood projections using a hydrological model forced by bias-adjusted ensembles of the latest-generation global climate models of CMIP6 (SSP5-8.5/SSP1-2.6) in comparison to CMIP5 (RCP8.5/RCP2.6). Results suggest increases in peak flow magnitude of 36% (16%) on average under SSP5-8.5 (SSP1-2.6), compared to 60% (17%) under RCP8.5 (RCP2.6) by 2070-2099 relative to 1971-2000. Under RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 (2070-2099), the largest increase in flood risk is projected for the Ganges watershed, where higher flood peaks become the 'new norm' as early as mid-2030 implying a relatively short time window for adaptation. In the Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers, the climate impact signal on peak flow emerges after 2070 (CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections). Flood peak synchronization, when annual peak flow occurs simultaneously at (at least) two rivers leading to large flooding events within Bangladesh, show a consistent increase under both projections. While the variability across the ensemble remains high, the increases in flood magnitude are robust in the study basins. Our findings emphasize the need of stringent climate mitigation policies to reduce the climate change impact on peak flows (as presented using SSP1-2.6/RCP2.6) and to subsequently minimize adverse socioeconomic impacts and adaptation costs. Considering Bangladesh's high overall vulnerability to climate change and its downstream location, synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation and transboundary cooperation will need to be strengthened to improve overall climate resilience and achieve sustainable development.

This research aims to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for flood damage estimation and mitigation, particularly in a tropical urban city. In this study, interdisciplinary fields were integrated through statistical downscaling, hydrologic-hydraulic modeling, and the development of flood damage curves. Relationships between tangible flood damage and flood-borne outbreak with flood depths were elucidated to predict future damage. Various flood mitigation strategies were evaluated. Herein, Hat Yai Municipality in Southern Thailand was selected as the study area. The flood simulation was conducted for 2010 and the highest flood damage sensitivity was exhibited by non-commercial buildings due to significant commercial stock damage, which was followed by that observed for detached houses. There was a strong linear relationship between the number of patients infected with leptospirosis and flood depth (R 2 = 0.85). For climate change studies, flood maps for storms with 20-, 50-, and 100-year return periods under the A2/RCP8.5 scenario were generated using hydrological-hydraulic 1D/2D model; these maps were applied with the developed flood damage curves for damage estimation. It was found that reducing flood damage by implementing agroforestry and expanding the main bypass channel provides comparable damage reductions of -255% and - 27.5%, respectively, under the worst-case scenario of a 100-year return period in 2040-2059. Therefore, to deal with uncertain climate change situations, the incorporation of structural and non-structural measures is recommended. Such a combination when coupled with an eight-hour flood awareness time can result in a damage reduction of -59.9%. A flood warning system was in high demand by residents in the area; however, damage reduction from this measure alone was not high (approximately -17.0%) when compared to that obtained with other measures; consequently, additional measures were needed.

To restrict urban expansion in the outskirts, a common strategy is to densify existing neighbourhoods. Densification implies the increase of water impervious area which increases the vulnerability to flooding during extreme precipitation events. Sustainable urban drainage systems are considered as a strategy to handle stormwater runoff locally and thus relieve the sewage system. This study investigates the combined quantitative hydrological impact of densification and sustainable stormwater management measures in a residential neighbourhood in Munich, Germany. The living-lab approach pursues the application of nature-based solutions in a real planning case to achieve positive climate effects while densifying the neighbourhood. The study is based on single event simulations of three return periods with the physically based software PCSWMM. The events are implemented for both current and climate change precipitation intensities of the RCP 8.5 projection for 2040-2069. Three scenarios are implemented: a status quo, a business as usual scenario (additional buildings without compensation measures) and a best-case scenario (one additional floor with green roofs disconnected from the sewers in combination with rain gardens and porous pavements on the land parcels). The comparison between the different scenarios focuses on three main aspects of the water balance, namely, infiltration, runoff and storage. The results show that measures for sustainable stormwater management are crucial elements to cope with an increasing number of heavy precipitation events due to climate change. The best-case scenario significantly outperforms the other two concerning water infiltration, surface runoff and storage. Most notably is the impact of climate change projection rainfall intensities for 2040-2069. The outcomes for these intensities clearly show the positive impact of sustainable water-sensitive design. The results demonstrate that it is in fact possible to enhance the water balance and gain new living space simultaneously if a sustainable urban planning strategy is implemented that includes future-oriented stormwater management.

J	Lee, YH				Lee, Young-Hyun			CORPOREALITY, GENETIC TECHNOLOGY, AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD	KRITIKA KULTURA			English	Article						gene technologies; genetic alteration; human corporealities; climate change; trans-corporeality; Margaret Atwood; The Year of the Flood; pandemic; capitalism		In her novel The Year of the Flood, Margaret Atwood vividly illustrates the unmistakable impact of climate change on people's lives these days. Genetic manipulation has become one of the technologies that people have grown dependent on to solve environmental problems in this age of climate change, where severe droughts, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and the like are being reported more frequently than ever. But genetic engineering has profound consequences for human corporealities, as both COVID-19 and The Year of the Flood show. In the novel, Atwood presents a world where humanity finds it hardly possible to survive without genetic fiddling. We find ourselves in a similar situation in real life, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic where genetic alteration technology is essential: studies have shown that vaccination using genetic engineering is the best way to halt the spread of the virus, but no one can give a definite answer to its long-term effects on bodies. Atwood illustrates through the Paradice Project episode in the novel that such a genetic experiment can make the ecological future more uncertain and unstable in the age of climate crisis. Though a few monopolistic multinational GMO companies touted genetic engineering technologies as a benevolent solution, it has become evident that they are only doing so for their own profit, as exemplified by the Vitamin pill episode in the novel.. In the real world and in The Year of the Flood, climate change and multinational capitalism exert a bad influence on biodiversity. With human and nonhuman animal bodies being mistreated more than ever as materials for the gene industry, Atwood shows how badly women are exploited in an age of genetic engineering. As we depend too much on genetic technologies, we tend to overlook the small but influential agencies within human and nonhuman assemblages, which result in dismissing the entanglement between human and nonhuman beings. It is becoming more and more difficult to imagine how we can function without genetic alteration, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vulnerability assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67-2 degrees C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model, our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70% of their current habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers, among others.

However, although urban runoff drainage systems are configured mainly based on rainfall analysis, climate change influences their hydrological properties substantially. This research introduces an innovative methodology to analyze climate variations on optimal low impact developments (LIDs) of urban drainage systems in historical periods based on annual impacts (AIs) in projection periods considering uncertainties assessments. First, Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is employed for simulating the process of rainfall-runoff considering quality and quantity analyses. This simulation model is coupled with a nondominated genetic algorithm- II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm to minimize the cost of LIDs, flood volume, and pollutant load. Then, future runoff and daily rainfall are projected on a yearly basis, including maximum, minimum, and median rainfall, to identify how climate change affects catchment properties. These projections and an ensemble model are obtained based on the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), which considers uncertainties. After that, the projected daily precipitation is fragmented into hourly segments utilizing the change factor approach (CFA). Finally, the ideal optimum type, size, and placement of the chosen LIDs are determined using the presented simulation-optimization (SO) model. To prove the effectiveness and appropriateness of the presented framework, it is implemented in a real-world study area in Darabad catchment, Tehran, Iran. Results indicate that the developed optimal LIDs are well-designed and sufficient in both the historical and projection periods. The findings also depict that with the current LIDs established for the historical period, the flooding volume and summation of total suspended solid (TSS) and total Nitrogen (TN) removals are decreased by 55.96% and 60.2% compared to when LIDs are not adopted. In addition, employing the developed LIDs based on an ensemble model results in the runoff volume and pollutants removal decline of up to 31.39% and 46.9%, respectively.

J	Kempf, M				Kempf, Michael			Enhanced trends in spectral greening and climate anomalies across Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						NDVI; Greening trend; Climate change; Drought; Landcover change; Climate extremes	NATURAL DISTURBANCES; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; FOOD SECURITY; TIME-SERIES; HEAT; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; SAHEL; FOREST	Europe witnessed a strong increase in climate variability and enhanced climate-induced extreme events, such as hot drought periods, mega heat waves, and persistent flooding and flash floods. Intensified land degradation, land use, and landcover changes further amplified the pressure on the environmental system functionalities and fuelled climate change feedbacks. On the other hand, global satellite observations detected a positive spectral greening trend-most likely as a response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming. But which are the engines behind such shifts in surface reflectance patterns, vegetation response to global climate changes, or anomalies in the environmental control mechanisms? This article compares long-term environmental variables (1948-2021) to recent vegetation index data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), 2001-2021) and presents regional trends in climate variability and vegetation response across Europe. Results show that positive trends in vegetation response, temperature, rainfall, and soil moisture are accompanied by a strong increase in climate anomalies over large parts of Europe. Vegetation dynamics are strongly coupled to increased temperature and enhanced soil moisture during winter and the early growing season in the northern latitudes. Simultaneously, temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture anomalies are strongly increasing. Such a strong amplification in climate variability across Europe further enhances the vulnerability of vegetation cover during extreme events.

The changes of runoff and suspended load have attracted extensive attention. The hydrological data of Gajiu and Yunjinghong stations in Lancang River from 1964 to 2019 were analyzed by using wavelet analysis, double mass curve and abrupt change analysis. The temporal trends in runoff and suspended load were evaluated. Results revealed that the reduction of suspended load was much more profound than the change of runoff. There was a slight downward trend in annual runoff due to climate change. After the completion of Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs, the proportion of runoff in flood season decreased by 22.64 and 30.75%, respectively. Wavelet analysis was used to reveal the characteristics of runoff evolution. With the operation of reservoirs, suspended load appeared abrupt changes in 1993 and 2008. The amount of suspended load during 2009-2019 decreased by 95.47-98.78% compared with that before the reservoir construction. This paper presents the latest quantitative study on the temporal variation of runoff and suspended load since the completion of Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs, which is of great importance for guiding the operation of reservoirs and maximizing the value of the whole Lancang-Mekong River basin.

Therefore, evaluation of the performances of GCMs is crucial for development of adaptation and mitigation measures and risk reduction against climate change impacts. This study quantified the performances of 10 GCMs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and their CMIP6 equivalents in replicating precipitation over East Asia during 1975-2005. The CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs and their multi-model ensembles (MMEs) were annually and seasonally compared with the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation. Compromise Programming was used to rank GCMs by aggregating their scores obtained using statistical performance indices. Taylor diagram was used to assess their relative performances and GCMs' ability to replicate seasonal precipitation distribution was evaluated. Results revealed most CMIP6 GCMs' have better replicability of GPCC precipitation than CMIP5 GCMs. The MME mean of the CMIP6 showed better replicability of annual and seasonal GPCC precipitation than that of CMIP5. The CMIP6 MME also showed efficiency in simulating the seasonal precipitation distribution over East Asia. This study indicates improvements of some CMIP5 GCMs in their CMIP6 equivalents over East Asia. Findings from this study can be significant to policy makers and engineers in reducing the uncertainties in prediction of events such as floods and droughts.

J	Marlow, T; Elliott, JR; Frickel, S				Marlow, Thomas; Elliott, James R.; Frickel, Scott			Future flooding increases unequal exposure risks to relic industrial pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						environmental inequality; flood risk; legacy pollution; social vulnerability; climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY; JUSTICE; INCOME; RACE	Climate change is increasing the probability that urban communities with lengthy histories of land-based industrial pollution and ongoing residential segregation will experience more frequent and destructive flooding in the years ahead. This paper investigates where these past, present, and future forces will converge to potentially produce a new type of climate injustice, as the flooding of former, or 'relic,' industrial sites threatens to transport sequestered industrial contaminants off site. Merging property-level flood-risk projections from the First Street Foundation with historical data on former hazardous manufacturing facilities in 6 U.S. cities, we identify more than 6000 relic industrial sites with elevated flood risk over the next 30 years. Exploratory spatial analysis reveals that these sites cluster spatially to create identifiable zones of cumulative impact, within which as many as 560 thousand residents and 229 thousand housing units are currently located. Spatial multilevel modeling further indicates that socially vulnerable groups (i.e. racial minorities, those with lower incomes, and those residing in less autonomous housing) are consistently and disproportionately likely to live in these areas. These findings highlight the need to develop new strategic plans to rethink site-based strategies of remediation and to engage residents of historically marginalized communities in planning efforts as government agencies at all levels work to make their cities more resilient and environmentally just in the age of climate change.

J	Filippi, ME				Filippi, Maria Evangelina			A role for municipal governments in leveraging transformative change for urban disaster risk management: The experience of Santa Fe, Argentina, with urban flood risk	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Disaster risk management; Transformation; Institutionalisation; Municipal governments; Santa Fe; Argentina	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; RESILIENCE; INTERVENTIONS; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; SYSTEMS; CITIES; ORGANIZATIONS	The increasing and disproportionate impacts associated with disaster risk and climate change risk in cities and the urgency for action have sparked academic and policy debates about transformation in the context of urban disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. Yet, the vague, ambiguous and diverse understandings of the concept of transformation, combined with a lack of empirical grounding, deter the possibilities of its application in policy and practice, including a constructive engagement with municipal governments in leveraging fundamental change. Building upon the amalgamation of insights from sociological institutionalism, policy process research and complexity theories in organisation studies, the paper proposes an institutionalisation framework as a heuristic device to make sense of transformation. The framework unpacks types, mechanisms and agents of change across three phases - emergence, embeddedness and sustained change - and is applied to analyse the experience of the municipal government of Santa Fe, Argentina, with disaster risk management over a decade. The findings confirm the two productive tensions that traction transformation, namely, change/stability and leadership/networked spaces, and that the loci of fundamental change are distributed across time, space and agentic actors. The framework and case study jointly illustrate intervention points for municipal governments to catalyse transformative change when advancing urban disaster risk management.

With the continued increase in population, rice will play a key role in achieving the food security. However, in the constantly shrinking scenario of rice fields, the necessity of these extra grains of rice must be met by reducing the yield loss due to various abiotic and biotic stresses. The adverse effects of climate impact both quality and quantity of rice production. One of the most desirable applications of CRISPR/Cas technology would be to develop climate smart rice crop to sustain and enhance its productivity in the changing environment. In this review, we analyze the desirable phenotypes and responsible genetic factors, which can be utilized to develop tolerance against major abiotic stresses imposed by climate change through genome engineering. The possibility of utilizing the information from wild resources to engineer the corresponding alleles of cultivated rice has been presented. We have also shed light on available resources for generating genome edited rice lines. The CRISPR/Cas mediated genome editing strategies for engineering of novel genes were proposed to create a plant phenotype, which can face the adversities of climate change. Further, challenges of off-targets and undesirable phenotype were discussed.	[Biswal, Akshaya K.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Mangrauthia, Satendra K.; Reddy, M.

Impacts of climate-induced disasters and climatic variability on cropping pattern and crop production in Satkhira district have been studied. Thirty-five year (1980-2014) climatic data (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) were used for seasonal (Kharif-I, Kharif-II, and Robi) trend analysis. It has been identified that the cropping pattern needed to be modified by local farmers due to climate change impacts and crop production has declined severely in the study areas. For instance, in the Kharif-II season, during the period 2008-2009 with an agricultural land area of 13,670 hectares, the average production was only 2.58 mt per hectare. The study shows a significant strong positive correlation between seasonal average rainfall and seasonal average humidity (r = 0.75, p < 0.05) during the Robi season. A significant strong negative correlation between seasonal average temperature and seasonal average humidity (r = - 0.60, p < 0.05) during the Kharif-I season was also found. We suggest some adaptation strategies to cope with the changing condition such as increased use of salt- and flood-tolerant varieties, floating bed vegetable cultivation, and dyke cropping system (mainly for vegetable), which can eventually reduce vulnerabilities and increase food security.

Managing these, often compounding, hazards is challenging, especially as climate change drivers, such as sea-level rise and more intense storms will likely lead to a greater incidence of compound coastal water events (CCWE). Using data from focus group interviews conducted with 41 planners and emergency managers, we examine the mitigation approaches pursued by rural counties in ENC located along the coast and those adjacent to it that share estuarine environments or linked riverine systems. Findings show that communities seek funding to clear streams and channels, to implement buyouts and elevation projects and for infrastructure maintenance. Communities also undertake floodplain management to minimize flood exposure while facing several barriers to adequate mitigation.

The latest IPCC reports of 2022 recall the importance of taking concrete actions, especially through the implementation of actions able to make cities more resilient. However, the current scientific discourse predominantly revolves around policies, theoretical aspects and specific case studies. This study aims to provide an updated analysis of the existing scientific literature, with an additional focus on the role of assessment and monitoring frameworks in urban adaptation. By employing qualitative and quantitative methodologies, supported by VOSviewer for co-occurrence network analysis, this paper reveals novel clusters and thematic groupings within the ongoing debate. Results include the identification of new clusters and thematic grouping and the identification of potential future trends.

In New Caledonia, Ouvea atoll is one of the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise. The population strongly oriented towards his lagoon, is concerned about shoreline erosion and wants to build a climate change adaptation strategy. This paper presents a research-action device aimed to renforce people's resilience in the proper regulatory environment to customary Kanak lands. The creation of a coastline participatory monitoring as data acquisition instrument, and sharing "inhabitants" and "experts" knowledges, is the heart of the approach. The dissemination of information to the population is one of the aims.

Research on impacts of natural disasters on housing markets is mostly limited to hedonic property studies and does not consider impacts on home ownership. Combining historical data on natural disasters in the United States with household data, we use a differences-in-differences approach to estimate the effects of natural disasters on home ownership rates. Results indicate a 3-5-percentage-point decrease in the home ownership rate among households that migrate to areas hit by severe natural disasters. An updating of risk priors given additional information regarding recent disasters may be responsible for such decreases. These results improve our understanding of how natural disasters impact housing markets and inform urban policy responses to climate change.

We model how society adapts to manage disaster risks to capital stock. Optimal adaptation-a mix of firm-level efforts and public spending-varies as society learns about the adverse consequences of global warming for disaster arrivals. Taxes on capital are needed alongside those on carbon to achieve the first best. We apply our model to country-level control of flooding from tropical cyclones. Learning rationalizes empirical findings, including the responses of Tobin's q, equity risk premium, and risk-free rate to disaster arrivals. Adaptation is more valuable under learning than a counterfactual no-learning environment. Learning alters social-cost-of-carbon projections due to the interaction of uncertainty resolution and endogenous adaptive response.

The impacts are dynamic, uncertain and contested. We use riskscapes as a lens to analyse how New Zealand has perceived and mediated natural hazard and climate risks over time. We identify five different national riskscapes using a historical timeline, which have changed as global risks cascade into national and sub-national governance. We find that while there has been a major effort to reflect the dynamic and systemic language of risk theory in national policy, a significant challenge remains to develop appropriate governance and implementation strategies and to shift from long-held ways of doing and knowing.

We propose a framework to examine future climate migration patterns using models of human migration. Our framework requires that we distinguish between historical versus climate driven migration and recognizes how the impacts of climate change can extend beyond the affected area. We apply our framework to simulate how migration, driven by sea level rise, differs from baseline migration patterns. Specifically, we couple a sea level rise model with a data-driven model of human migration and future population projections, creating a generalized joint model of climate driven migration that can be used to simulate population distributions under potential future sea level rise scenarios. The results of our case study suggest that the effects of sea level rise are pervasive, expanding beyond coastal areas via increased migration, and disproportionately affecting some areas of the United States.

But what form should such stories take? In this essay, I argue that speculative fiction can make public the climate crisis, not only as a calamity of the physical environment but also as a predicament of the cultural environment-of the systems of representation through which society has related to complex environmental issues among their various actors and in the vast scales of time and space. The essay amplifies the environmental uncanny to produce a speculative fiction that grapples with something as indescribable as climate change. In conclusion, "Of Oil and Ice," a geostory, casts an iceberg as a planetary protagonist and relates its trajectory as it migrates from the Antarctic ice shelf to a glass of water in the Persian Gulf.

Multiple sources of uncertainty influence CCA decisions besides climate trends, and their saliency and people's responses vary depending on the role/function of the decision-maker and the timeframe of the decision. Concerns involve situational uncertainties, response options, and their consequences. Decision-makers are more likely to incorporate uncertainties in their adaptation decisions than suppress them or delay action, although the response is sensitive to the type of information sought and timeframes.

Having an improved understanding of extreme rainfall patterns can better inform stormwater managers about current and future flooding scenarios, so they can minimize potential damages and disruptions. In this study, the scaling invariant properties of annual maximum precipitations (AMPs) are used for describing the regional patterns of extreme rainfalls over Guam. AMPs are calculated at seven stations in Guam and exhibit distinct simple scaling behavior for two different time frames: (1) from 15 min to 45 min; and (2) from 45 min to 24 h. With these two different behaviors, the conventional estimation methods for sub-hourly durations overestimate the frequencies at a site in which breakpoints are clearly observed, while the proposed Scaling Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) method, based on the Scaling Three-NCM (S3NCM) method, provides comparable estimates. A new regional extreme rainfall analysis approach based on scaling exponents is introduced in this study. Results show distinct extreme rainfall patterns over Guam. Moreover, the numerical and graphical analyses identify that a tropical cyclone may increase daily AMPs by 3%, on average.

Climate change is an urgent concern, yet strong disagreements divide the city's population on the nature of appropriate responses to climate crisis. We find that urban activists in Mumbai make an explicit connection between social justice and climate justice. This paper studies three social movements working in Mumbai to secure access to housing, water and sanitation for marginalized communities. Building on the work of Nancy Fraser, Iris Marion Young and Henri Lefebvre, we argue that climate injustice in Mumbai has roots in structures of inequality based in class, gender, religion and migration status. Climate adaptation strategies run the risk of exacerbating inequalities when disasters strike. We seek design solutions that centre on inclusive justice rather than technocratic market forces.

The present study analyzed extreme precipitation weather events across four Indian cities in different climatic conditions. The study uses IMD precipitation datasets from 1900 to 2004 to analyze different atmospheric influencing parameters like ENSO, AMO, and IOD on future extreme precipitation conditions. The Bayesian analysis is carried out for nonstationary analysis of extreme indices like Rx1 Day, SDII, R10, and CWD with a 10, 20, 50, and 100 years return period. Significant outcomes of the comparative study of the stationary and nonstationary analysis showed an intensification in extreme precipitation across Indian cities for all return periods using the CWD indicator. The remaining three indicators of the nonstationary study suggested intensifying extreme rainfall across all Indian cities except Guwahati.

It is a phenomenon, however, from which there are few examples to learn. This paper examines relocation processes underway in three low-lying coastal villages in Fiji, each affected by coastal erosion and flooding. Drawing on the concept of "everyday agency," it considers how environmental changes and planned relocation initiatives are resisted, accommodated, or shaped through daily activities and decision-making. For residents of these three villages, climate change adaptation is not only a matter of adapting to environmental changes, but a process of actively steering a way through unfolding dimensions of planned relocation. The findings respond to increasingly audible calls to recognise the agency of people living in climate-vulnerable places, and to highlight everyday responses to climate impacts and adaptation initiatives.

The climatic regimes in Bangladesh are changing as well as the world does. However, this species is threatened by climate change. Occurrences of data on threatened and endangered species are frequently sparse which makes it difficult to analyse the species suitable habitat distribution using various modelling approaches. The current paper used maximum entropy (Maxent) and educational global climate model (EdGCM) modelling to predict and conserve the suitable habitat distributions for Tossa species in Bangladesh to the year 2100. Nine environmental variables, 239 occurrence data and two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were used for the Maxent modelling to project the impact of climate change on the Tossa distributions. Furthermore, the EdGCM was used to study the climatic space suitability for the Tossa species in the context of Bangladesh. Both of the climatic scenarios were used for the prediction to the year 2100. The Maxent model performed better than random for the Tossa species with a high AUC value of 0.86. Under the RCP scenarios, the Maxent model predicted habitat reduction for RCP4.5 is 2%, RCP8.5 is 9% and EdGCM is 10.2% from the current localities. The predictive modelling approach presented here is promising and can be applied to other important species for conservation planning, monitoring and management, especially those under the threat of extinction due to climate change.

The changes taking place on our planet make it necessary for farmers to understand and assess how they can counteract the damage of climate change by adopting sustainable strategies to cope with the future. This makes environmental, economic and social sustainability more relevant than ever in the production sector. The research, in relation to the spread of exceptional conditions, which cause damage and extraordinary changes in the production system of farmers, aims to define a sustainable assessment model by evaluating the three pillars of sustainability. The proposed methodology, which is based on participatory planning of investment choice, starts from the assumption that the application of methodologies regarding the choice of investment projects must be placed in a broader context than just economic evaluation, including all dimensions of sustainability. Through the involvement of industry stakeholders, it emerged that the implementation of drastic measures is the long-term optimal choice.

Although past studies have predicted the spatiotemporal variations in flood risk, these have appreciable limitations, viz. (i) flood risk is predicted mainly by accounting for one driver at a time (either ocean flooding or fluvial flooding); and (ii) monetization of flood damage due to future flooding had not been investigated. However, multiple drivers could lead to flooding in coastal areas. This study presents an innovative approach for investigating the cumulative effects of urbanization, changes to the rainfall regime, and sea level rise on consequential flood damage in a coastal urban area. A comprehensive flood damage and hazard prediction model was developed by integrating 1D-2D aspects of MIKE FLOOD and GIS technology to assess the flood scenarios for 2040, 2070, and 2100 by investigating three predictor variables: urbanization, rainfall regime, and sea level rise. The factorial design approach was used to construct a total of 27 future flood scenarios. Time horizons of 30 years provided for effectively capturing climate change and its influence on the hydrologic regime. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was applied to create a statistical model based on future scenarios for each time horizon. Results confirmed that changes to the rainfall regime significantly influence the average annual damage (AAD) caused by flooding for all time horizons. At the same time, the significance of the effects of urbanization and sea level rise was found to vary. The model predicts that by 2040, urbanization would exacerbate AAD, with a significant contribution from sea level rise. In contrast, sea level rise would provide a marginally greater and more significant contribution to AAD compared to urbanization in 2040 and 2070. Compared to the base year 2017, AAD was 78%, 197%, and 351% higher in 2040, 2070, and 2100, respectively. The proposed flood damage prediction model developed can guide modelers and decision-makers in assessing the compounding flood damage for future flood management in any geographic location.

However, in a climate change perspective, significant gaps can still be observed in literature addressing the key role of rainfall input and related variability within urban flood impact models. The present research attempts to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of using a large ensemble of bias-corrected Euro-CORDEX climate projections on flood hazard estimations, with the goal of understanding the propagation of future climate variability in terms of flooding outputs for the urban environment. With this aim, a scenario analysis is performed for two return periods (10 and 200 years) building on nineteen climate projections for future horizon 2071-2100 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios by means of CADDIES Caflood inundation model, using a test case in the City of Naples (Italy). Model outcomes are investigated and discussed in terms of relevant metrics and indicators available in literature targeting both general hazards, evaluated in terms of runoff volumes and flooded areas, and sectoral hazards, specified by a number of relevant literature hazard classifications. Modelling outcomes are analysed and normalised with respect to baseline values representing current climate conditions to emphasize potential impacts of climate change. Results show that flood features increase more slowly than rainfall, and the relationship between rainfall and flood increase is linear, with decreasing slope with increasing return period. Furthermore, the spread in rainfall input due to the use of different climate projections does not inflate through the impact modelling stages, albeit a dependence on the indicators used to model flood impacts can be observed. The outcomes of the research can be of aid to managers, designers and policy makers to understand the impacts of climate change in floodprone urban areas and, in perspective, to adapt urban areas exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of solutions.

Therefore, in 2015, to better monitor the level of adaptation to flooding of Quebec residents living in or near a flood-prone area, the Quebec Observatory of Adaptation to Climate Change developed five indices of adaptation to flooding, according to the chronology of events. The present study was conducted 4 years later and is a follow-up to the 2015 one. Two independent samples of 1951 (2015) and 974 (2019) individuals completed a questionnaire on their adoption (or non-adoption) of flood adaptation behaviors, their perception of the mental and physical impacts of flooding, and their knowledge of the fact that they lived in a flood-prone area.The results of the study demonstrated the measurement invariance of the five indices across two different samples of people over time, ensuring that the differences (or absence of differences) observed in flood-related adaptive behaviors between 2015 and 2019 were real and not due to measurement errors. They also showed that, overall, Quebeckers' flood-related adaptive behaviors have not changed considerably since 2015, with adaptation scores being similar in 2019 for four of the five flood indices. Moreover, the results indicated an increase in self-reported physical and mental health issues related to past flooding events, as well as a larger proportion of people having consulted a health professional because of these problems. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of flood adaptation in Quebec over the past 4 years and confirms that the five adaptive behavior indices developed in 2015 are appropriate tools for monitoring changes in flood adaptation in the province. Finally, our results showed that little has changed in Quebeckers' adoption of adaptive behaviors, highlighting the need for awareness raising in order to limit the impacts that climate change will have on the population.

The concept of urban resilience may be an interesting means of responding to urban flood issues. The objective of this research is to propose a spatial decision support tool based on geovisualization techniques and a resilience assessment method. The goal is to localize the level of resilience modelled in different territories. The methodology proposed consists of integrating three resilience indicators applied to a case study in Avignon (Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region, France) and the use of geovisualization techniques: using GIS for data processing and analysis, visualization, mapping, and model processing. The methodology integrates decision-making by identifying characteristics capable of improving urban resilience and facilitating its understanding using a visual tool. The results demonstrate the usefulness of modelling resilience using geovisualization techniques to identify the potential for local resilience; integrate local stakeholders into a process of clarifying the concept through the contribution of visualization; and consider easier access to this concept based on data analysis, processing and visualization through the design of maps.

The red hocicudo mouse (Oxymycterus rufus) inhabits subtropical grasslands and riparian habitats and has increased its abundance in recent years in central Argentina agroecosystems. This paper describes the long-term temporal changes in O. rufus abundance in Exaltacion de la Cruz department, Buenos Aires province, Argentina, in relation to weather fluctuations and landscape features, as well as analyzes the spatio-temporal structure of captures of animals. We used generalized liner models, semivariograms, the Mantel test, and autocorrelation functions for the analysis of rodent data obtained from trappings conducted between 1984 and 2014. O. rufus showed an increase in abundance across the years of study, with its distribution depending on landscape features, such as habitat types and the distance to floodplains. Capture rates showed a spatio-temporal aggregation, suggesting expansion from previously occupied sites. O. rufus was more abundant at lower minimum temperatures in summer, higher precipitation in spring and summer, and lower precipitations in winter. Weather conditions affected O. rufus abundance, but there was local variation that differed from global patterns of climate change.

We present a geoarchaeological study in a long-term settled catchment in the Pergamon micro-region to disentangle the Holocene geomorphodynamics and triggering factors, for example, climate change and human activity. The analyses of eight radiocarbon-dated sediment profiles from the Tekkedere alluvial fan and its catchment indicate four principal sedimentation phases. Phase 1 (ca. 6.2 to 5-4 ka) is dominated by the floodplain aggradation of the receiving Bakircay River, which is followed by the formation of floodplain soils (phase 2). Substantial geomorphodynamic changes occurred around 4 ka (phase 3), when the edge of the floodplain was buried by fan sediments of the tributary Tekkedere creek. This is attributed to supraregional aridization and rapid climate change events, superimposed by the onset of local human activities. Repeated cycles of coarse- and fine-textured fan sediments with age inversions after ca. 3.8 ka and valley infills younger than 1300 yr BP indicate the strong erosion and redeposition of sediments in phase 4. These increased geomorphodynamics may coincide with the changing settlement pattern and thus reflect human-environment interactions.

The regional-scale assessment is based on physical characteristics and predicted/measured changes in the abiotic drivers and ecosystem responses. The major Climate Change stressors were identified in order of importance as change in climatic and hydrological processes, ocean circulation and temperature regimes, sea level rise, increase in frequency and intensity of sea storms, and ocean acidification. Flow-related ecosystem responses included changes in mouth state, salinity regimes, biochemical regimes (nutrient fluxes), and floods and related sediment deposition/erosion cycles. The regional vulnerability assessment provides a summary of the key shifts scaled as high, medium, and low in estuary state. Changes in oceanic processes and temperature regimes drive shifts in nearshore temperatures of the transitional zones, with related ecological responses (e.g., range expansion). However, most structural and functional changes are expected along cool temperate and subtropical biogeographical regions, leading to notable shifts in mouth closures and salinity regimes, which in turn will affect estuary function and estuary-associated species. Monitoring and management of resources (e.g., fresh water and fisheries allocations) need to consider this in long-term planning.

The most common solutions such as seawalls and breakwaters are expensive and often lead to unexpected disastrous effects on the neighboring unprotected areas. In recent years, this awareness has guided coastal managers to adopt alternative solutions with lower environmental impact to protect coastal areas, defined as Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs). NBS are quite popular around the world but are often analyzed and implemented individually at pilot sites. This contribution analyzes the effectiveness of two NBS to mitigate coastal impacts (coastal flooding and erosion) under three historical storms along the EmiliaRomagna coasts and the induced improvements due to their potential integration. Through numerical simulations with XBeach, this study demonstrated that the presence of seagrass meadows of Zostera marina produces an average attenuation of 32 % of the storm peak with a maximum attenuation of 89 % in incoming wave height. Seagrass also mitigates flooded areas and maximum inundation depths by 37 % and 58 % respectively. The artificial dune leads to higher mitigation in terms of inundation of the lagoon (up to 75 %), also avoiding any morphological variations behind it. Seagrass has also been shown to be able to reduce beach erosion volumes up to 55 %. The synergic effect of the two NBS improves the capacity to mitigate both inundation (with a benefit of up to 77 % for flooded area attenuation with respect to cases without any defenses) and coastal erosion. Results of the study suggest that the two NBS will work together to produce co-benefits in terms of preservation of their efficiency, development of habitats for organisms and vegetation species, and thereby offering an important social value in terms of possible tourism, recreation and research.

Two approaches are commonly used to formulate adaptation measures, namely bottom-up and top-down, each with inherited limitations. A sound bridge between both approaches is low-regret adaptive measures, which result in win-win scenarios, as they provide solutions to current pressures and contribute to building CC adaptive capacity. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a term that includes a series of techniques that enhance groundwater storage for later use or environmental purposes. MAR is often mentioned in the literature as a CC adaptation measure. Nonetheless, few examples explicitly prove this point. We show through the Los Arenales MAR systems (Central Spain) that MAR is a low-regret CC adaptive measure. We evaluate a series of social and environmental challenges that MAR systems contribute to solving, as well as their attributes that diminish the expected impacts of CC in the study area. MAR in the Los Arenales groundwater body has resulted in an overall increase in groundwater levels; a reduction in groundwater pumping energy and costs and CO2 emissions; restoration of a surface water body; improvement in rural population indexes; and enhanced groundwater demand control and CC adaptive capacity through irrigation communities. To cope with CC, the Los Arenales MAR systems can be operated even if decreasing streamflow precludes the use of river water surpluses; they provide surface storage volume to mitigate flooding; and they decrease the impacts of droughts and water scarcity. This research proves that MAR is a water management tool capable of providing solutions to several pressures simultaneously in the present and future, an attribute particularly useful when dealing with adaptation gaps in developing countries, rural areas, or regions lacking long-term climatic data.

Paleoenvironmental records allow us to extend the instrumented record and study recent environmental impacts in a long-term context with natural pre-industrial conditions. Here, we investigate grain size, stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes, elemental composition, and diatom abundance in sediments to construct a 7000-year paleoenvironmental history of Weeks Bay, Alabama, a NOM National Estuarine Research Reserve. Four major floods of the Fish River since 1986 CE are independently identified in the Weeks Bay sediment record, validating the bay setting as an archive of flood events. Thirty-four flood events were identified over the last 5000 years, with two periods of intense flood activity coinciding with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, indicating association of relatively short-term dimate events and enhanced storm activity. Further, multiple paleoenvironmental proxies indicate marine conditions during formation of the bay similar to 6600 calendar years Before Present (cal yr BP) and a brackish transition as the estuary became restricted similar to 2000 cal yr BP. High total organic carbon/nitrogen values indicate nitrogen limitation in Weeks Bay. Increase in organic content, diatoms, and redox- and nutrient-associated elemental proxies over the last 300 years, with dramatic increase in algal abundance since the 1980s, strongly suggest that human activities (i.e. land clearing, agriculture) increased ecological feedbacks in the bay.

Yellow River flooding during the past two millennia from historical documents	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Yellow river flooding; historical document; climate change; river management; human adaptation	NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE TEMPERATURE; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LATE HOLOCENE; TIBETAN PLATEAU; LAST HALF; SOLAR; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCY; BASIN	The Yellow River has caused suffering to people with its devastating floods throughout human history. Understanding the occurrence of Yellow River floods and their relationship with climate change is crucial for sustainable water governance in North China. Here we synthesize historical and climatic records in the Yellow River basin to investigate their relationship during the past two millennia. Based on historical archives of river floods and levee breaches, we developed a decadally resolved Yellow River flooding frequency record from 221 BCE to 1949 CE, which provides a rare chance to perceive the river's long-term flood dynamics. As revealed, the Yellow River flooding can be divided into two distinct stages: an early stage of low-frequency floods from the 220s BCE to the 890s CE; and a late stage of high-frequency floods during the 900s-1940s CE. A substantial increase in flooding frequency around the 10th century fell within the transition period into the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), during which the Yellow River basin featured warm and wet climate conditions. Coincidentally, human management of the Yellow River intensified as a response to more severe and frequent floods. The intense river management persisted thereafter and resulted in the super-elevation of the riverbed, which made the river more prone to flooding. Consequently, the Yellow River flooding frequency remained high even after entering the Little Ice Age, during which the river basin featured cool temperature and reduced precipitation. Our study suggests that the dramatic transition from a previous cool, dry into a warm, wet climate during the MCA period triggered intense human management of river channels and the establishment of the flood-prone nature of the Yellow River.

Adaptive measures are suggested to respond to the challenge. Aiming at quantitatively assess the impact of adaptive measures on optimal water resources allocation, we proposed a framework based on reliability, resilience and vulnerability indicators. Two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) of one global climate model were used to project future climate, and the variable infiltration capacity hydrological model was used to simulate streamflow. Three adaptive measures [water saving measure, water transfer project, dynamic control of flood limiting water levels (FLWLs) for reservoir operation] were combined to eight scenarios, then scenarios were applied to the allocation model to get different optimal allocation schemes which were assessed by RRV indicators. The results show that water saving measure decreases the vulnerability by 79 x 10(6) m(3), water transfer project decreases the resilience by 17% in every scenario and dynamic control of FLWLs increases the reliability by 23.53% to the greatest scale. But the impacts of latter two adaptive measures are restricted to the areas which are geographically close to water supply projects. The uneven spatial distribution and decrease of streamflow will increase the risk of water shortage in the future. Optimal water allocation can reduce this risk and make 23 of 28 operational zones stable. Water saving measure is significantly valid in the rest 5 operational zones, but its impact is not positive to all water use sectors. Overall, our study helps understanding the interaction between adaptive measures and water resources system, and making guidelines for effective adaptation planning.

Coastal areas gathering large numbers of population, capital, and industries are vulnerable to suffering from the compound floods caused by hydrological and oceanic processes. The disaster mechanisms of compound floods are more complex, and the consequences are even more serious. Based on the existing research results, this article sorts out the main disaster mechanisms of compound floods in coastal areas and explains the main methods, including using statistical models to study the dependence between flood drivers or joint probability and numerical models to simulate compound flood inundation, and presents the characteristics of different methods. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different models and analyze their uncertainties. Current research seldom considers the rainfall-runoff-storm surge compound flood and the effect of climate change. In addition, there are only a few kinds of literature that integrate statistical models and numerical models to investigate compound flood hazard. Uncertainties in compound flood study methods are also less considered. Future investigation should focus on the characteristics and uncertainties of different models and consider the impact of climate change on compound floods. These will help to fully understand compound floods, research models, and provide effective opinions for flood management in coastal areas.

This will cause regional alterations to the hydrological cycle. For proper water management, anticipating these changes is necessary. In this study, the basin of Lake Erken (Sweden) was simulated with the recently released software SWAT+ to study such alterations in a short (2026-2050), medium (2051-2075) and long (2076-2100) period, under two different climate change scenarios (SSP2-45 and SSP5-85). Seven global climate models from the latest projections of future climates that are available (CIMP 6) were compared and ensembled. A bias-correction of the models' data was performed with five different methods to select the most appropriate one. Results showed that the temperature is expected to increase in the future from 2 to 4 degrees C, and precipitation from 6% to 20%, depending on the scenario. As a result, water discharge would also increase by about 18% in the best-case scenario and by 50% in the worst-case scenario, and the surface runoff would increase between 5% and 30%. The floods and torrential precipitations would also increase in the basin. This trend could lead to soil impoverishment and reduced water availability in the basin, which could damage the watershed's forests. In addition, rising temperatures would result in a 65% reduction in the snow water equivalent at best and 92% at worst.

Changing River Network Synchrony Modulates Projected Increases in High Flows	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; Columbia River; extremes; flood; large rivers; streamflow	CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; 21ST-CENTURY CLIMATE; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; SPATIAL DEPENDENCE; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; EXTREMES; FLOODS; BASIN	Projections of change in high-flow extremes with global warming vary widely among, and within, large midlatitude river basins. The spatial variability of these changes is attributable to multiple causes. One possible and little-studied cause of changes in high-flow extremes is a change in the synchrony of mainstem and tributary streamflow during high-flow extremes at the mainstem-tributary confluence. We examined reconstructed and simulated naturalized daily streamflow at confluences on the Columbia River in western North America, quantifying changes in synchrony in future streamflow projections and estimating the impact of these changes on high-flow extremes. In the Columbia River basin, projected flow regimes across colder tributaries initially diverge with warming as they respond to climate change at different rates, leading to a general decrease in synchrony, and lower high-flow extremes, relative to a scenario with no changes in synchrony. Where future warming is sufficiently large to cause most subbasins upstream from a confluence to transition toward a rain-dominated, warm regime, the decreasing trend in synchrony reverses itself. At one confluence with a major tributary (the Willamette River), where the mainstem and tributary flow regimes are initially very different, warming increases synchrony and, therefore, high-flow magnitudes. These results may be generalizable to the class of large rivers with large contributions to flood risk from the snow (i.e., cold) regime, but that also receive considerable discharge from tributaries that drain warmer basins.

Nonstationary frequency analysis of the recent extreme precipitation events in the United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Nonstationary frequency analysis; Extreme precipitation; IDF curves	ANNUAL MAXIMUM; FUTURE CHANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL; ENSO; DURATION; FLOOD; INTENSITY; STATIONARITY; WEATHER	The intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change is likely to influence the extreme precipitation characteristics (i.e., intensity, duration and frequency). These precipitation characteristics are integrated to construct Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves that are widely used to design civil infrastructure systems. These IDF curves are typically derived based on the stationary assumption, however, the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events likely to become nonstationary as a consequence of climate change. During the past decades, unusual extreme precipitation events with more than thousand-year return periods were recorded in the United States. This study investigates the nonstationary nature of the most recent extreme precipitation events occurred over different durations (1-, 3- and 5-days) by incorporating time-varying covariates, such as time, maximum temperature, mean temperature, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation cycle (ENSO). The nonstationary frequency analysis for these extreme events was conducted using nonstationary Generalized Extreme Value distribution by incorporating the time-varying covariates. It was observed that most of the temporal evolution of extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern, which may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events, especially during hurricane events. Different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis, and the type of covariate may differ when the accumulated period of extreme precipitation event increased. Based on the Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis, the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach.

Their elevated areas provide essential ecosystem services both for the surrounding mountainous regions and particularly for adjacent lowlands. Impacts of a warmer climate affect these services and have negative consequences on the supply of water, on biodiversity and on protection from natural hazards. Mountain social-ecological systems are affected by these changes, which also influence communities' risk perception and responses to changing climate conditions. Therefore, to understand individual and societal responses to climate change in mountain areas, aspects and drivers of risk perception need to be scrutinised. This article presents the findings of a literature review of recent English language publications on risk perception in connection to climate change and related natural hazards in mountain regions worldwide. Studies were selected from recorded entries in JSTOR, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science covering the period 2000-2019 and analysed in two steps (structured exploratory analysis, n = 249 and in-depth analysis, n = 72) with respect to the studies' research question, methodology, geographical scope and risk perception drivers. The review reveals that socio-demographic factors, like gender, age and personal experiences, have a crucial impact on individual risk perception. Some of the less tangible but nevertheless decisive factors are important in mountain regions such as place attachment and socio-cultural practices. In conclusion, there is however little information in the literature which addresses the specific situation of risk perception in mountain areas and its influence on communities' responses to environmental changes. Further, we observed a strong gap concerning the integration of indigenous knowledge in risk perception research. Many studies overlook or oversimplify local knowledge and the cultural dimensions of risk perception.

We examined the economic, social and demographic impacts of drought drawing on 27 in-depth interviews in two cohorts of PLHIV in Hlabisa, uMkhanyakude district, KwaZulu-Natal. Thematic analysis revealed how drought enforced soil water depletion, dried-up rivers, and dams culminated in a continuum of events such as loss of livestock, reduced agricultural production, and insufficient access to water and food which was understood to indirectly have a negative impact on HIV treatment adherence. This was mediated through disruptions in incomes, livelihoods and food systems, increased risk to general health, forced mobility and exacerbation of contextual vulnerabilities linked to poverty and unemployment. The systems approach, drawn from interview themes, hypothesises the complex pathways of plausible networks of impacts from drought through varying socioeconomic factors, exacerbating longstanding contextual precarity, and ultimately challenging HIV care utilisation. Understanding the multidimensional relationships between climate change, especially drought, and poor HIV care outcomes through the prism of contextual vulnerabilities is vital for shaping policy interventions.

The integration of sedimentary facies, elemental geochemistry and magnetic susceptibility, together with an age model based on tephrochronology, enable reconstruction of the main hydrological and climate changes in the region. Arid conditions, represented by thick gypsum interval at the bottom of Mh2 core occurred during Bronze Age. However, the period extending from Iron Age to the Present time is characterized by alternating episodes of higher effective moisture and severely arid climatic conditions. Magnetic and geochemical compositions provide information concerning changes of elemental and mineralogical compositions from flood events materials interrupted by thin deposits of aeolian origin. Indeed, six binary data consist of dominant silty fractions rich in heavy minerals and increasing with wadi-derived elements like Na2O/K2O and Na2O/Fe2O3. These wadi sediments are covered with sandy/silty Saharan aeolian input occurring commonly after rapid and short climate change towards drier conditions. These sandstorm events are known for increasing redox-sensitive elements Na2O/K2O.

In the case of drought analysis, it is important to properly consider the duration, so, in this study, univariate frequency analysis is performed using the partial duration series. In addition, a bivariate frequency analysis is performed using a relatively simple bivariate exponential distribution to give a more realistic return level to major drought events in the past while reflecting the correlation between drought severities and durations. The drought severity-duration-frequency curves using each of the two frequency analyses are derived, and these curves are used to examine how the drought phenomenon currently in progress is evolving. From this, the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, as well as the points to be aware of in application, are discussed. Finally, using the two approaches to the proposed drought frequency analysis, the behavior of Korea's future extreme droughts is investigated under the conditions of various future climate change scenarios.

Furthermore, an increasing frequency of extreme droughts in dammed rivers is expected because dams homogenize the flood pulse and decrease the river level. In this study, we evaluated the effects of extreme river-level oscillations on the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in a floodplain river. We analysed 47 years of river-level data and 17 years of benthic macroinvertebrate data. Our findings indicated that (1) extreme river-level oscillations promoted environmental conditions that were distinct from the regular oscillation; moreover, environmental characteristics were more heterogeneous in extreme oscillations than regular oscillations; (2) extreme oscillations were associated with a decreased richness, density, and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates, promoting the dominance of tolerant taxa. Furthermore, in the studied river, a large hydroelectric power plant was built 19 years ago, which (3) decreased the river-level downstream, accentuating the occurrence of extreme drought, which has become more common after damming. We emphasize the importance of long-term biological monitoring considering the more frequent occurrence of extreme river-level oscillations in response to factors such as dam building and climate change.

Uncertainty associated with climate change has resulted in a shift towards flood resilience as it helps deal with unexpected climatic perturbations that impact extreme flows. The concept of resilience has increased in popularity, leading to a multitude of definitions, measurements and applications. This paper systematically reviews the FRM literature to provide clarity on the differing perspectives of resilience and how they influence successful implementation of the concept. Our analysis assesses where FRM is positioned within three pre-defined interdisciplinary understandings of resilience. The polysemic nature of resilience has produced a multitude of different perspectives that prevent successful operationalisation. Resilience is interdisciplinary; therefore it requires integration between top-down and bottom-up FRM approaches, as well as a more holistic approach to the interdependence between temporal and spatial scales.

J	Sirigu, S; Montaldo, N				Sirigu, Serena; Montaldo, Nicola			Climate Change Impacts on the Water Resources and Vegetation Dynamics of a Forested Sardinian Basin through a Distributed Ecohydrological Model	WATER			English	Article						climate change; ecohydrological model; forest; leaf area index; runoff; water resources; Mediterranean basin	LAND-SURFACE; SOIL-WATER; HYDRAULIC REDISTRIBUTION; TIME-SERIES; WOODY COVER; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHT; TRENDS; ECOSYSTEM; RUNOFF	Climate change is impacting Mediterranean basins, bringing warmer climate conditions. The Marganai forest is a natural forest protected under the European Site of Community Importance (Natura 2000), located in Sardinia, an island in the western Mediterranean basin, which is part of the Fluminimaggiore basin. Recent droughts have strained the forest ' s resilience. A long-term hydrological database collected from 1922 to 2021 shows that the Sardinian forested basin has been affected by climate change since the middle of the last century, associated with a decrease in winter precipitation and annual runoff, reduced by half in the last century, and an increase of similar to 1 degrees C in the mean annual air temperature. A simplified model that couples a hydrological model and a vegetation dynamics model for long-term ecohydrological predictions in water-limited basins is proposed. The model well predicted almost one century of runoff observations. Trees have suffered from the recent warmer climate conditions, with a tree leaf area index (LAI) decreasing systematically due to the air temperature and a vapor pressure deficit (VPD) rise at a rate of 0.1 hPa per decade. Future climate scenarios of the HadGEM2-AO climate model are predicting even warmer conditions in the Sardinian forested basin, with less annual precipitation and higher air temperatures and VPD. Using these climate scenarios, we predicted a further decrease in runoff and tree transpiration and LAI in the basin, with a reduction of tree LAI by half in the next century. Although the annual runoff decreases drastically in the worst scenarios (up to 26%), runoff extremes will increase in severity, outlining future scenarios that are drier and warmer but, at the same time, with an increased flood frequency. The future climate conditions undermine the forest's sustainability and need to be properly considered in water resources and forest management plans.

From this perspective, repeated drought and flood events in the lower north of Thailand were investigated. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of climate change on major crop yields and the water footprint (WF). Five global circulation model datasets from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), known as Shared Socioeconomic Path-ways (SSPs), were selected. Three future periods: near (2015-2039), mid (2040-2069), and far future (2070-2100) under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios were used to predict the major crop yields and WF changes in the future. The precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were projected to increase in all pe-riods under both scenarios. Rice yields in irrigated areas were predicted to rise gradually over the three projection periods under SSP245 but decline in mid and far-future periods under SSP585. There was a predicted reduction of first and second rice crop yields by -6.0% to -17.7% under SSP585. Fortunately, those rice yields were expected to increase in the near-future period under SSP245 by 3.0% to 4.3%. Growing maize, soybean, or mung bean in-stead of a second rice crop will have a less negative impact on future climate change. Changing from growing rice to be planting maize twice per year and growing cassava had increased favorability in rain-fed areas. The WF changes in the future were associated with future crop yield changes; therefore, the decrease in WFs was due to an increase in crop yield and vice-versa. The total WFs of maize, soybean, mung bean, and cassava production were roughly half that of rice production, indicating that these crops are suitable alternatives in the dry season.

At present, current methodology are limited in their scope, particularly with respect to inadequate representation of the uncertainty in the hydroclimatological modelling chain. This paper proposes spatially consistent comprehensive impact and uncertainty methodological framework for the identification of compound hydro-hazard hotspots - hotspots of change where concurrent increase in mean annual flood and drought events is projected. We apply a quasi-ergodic analysis of variance (QE-ANOVA) framework, to detail both the magnitude and the sources of uncertainty in the modelling chain for the mean projected mean change signal whilst accounting for non-stationarity. The framework is designed for application across a wide geographical range and is thus readily transferable. We illustrate the ability of the framework through application to 239 UK catchments based on hydroclimatological projections from the EDgE project (5 CMI5-GCMs and 3 HMs, forced under RCP8.5). The results indicate that half of the projected hotspots are temporally concurrent or temporally successive within the year, exacerbating potential impacts on society. The north-east of Scotland and south-west of the UK were identified as spatio-temporally compound hotspot regions and are of particular concern. This intensification of the hydrologic dynamic (timing and seasonality of hydro-hazards) over a limited time frame represents a major challenge for future water management. Hydrological models were identified as the largest source of variability, in some instances exceeding 80% of the total variance. Critically, clear spatial variability in the sources of modelling uncertainty was also observed; highlighting the need to apply a spatially consistent methodology, such as that presented. This application raises important questions regarding the spatial variability of hydroclimatological modelling uncertainty. In terms of water management planning, such findings allow for more focussed studies with a view to improving the projections which inform the adaptation process.

Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as drivers' (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and buffers' (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation.

However, the inherent complexity of urban environments and their uncertain future conditions necessitate exploring innovative approaches and tools to assist the current planning practices. This paper presents a workflow rooted in model-based scenario planning for long-term adaptation planning given uncertain futures. To demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness, a pertinent case study was conducted in a flood-prone area of Rome. The study employed a land-use change model to examine potential urban growth patterns, considering the uncertain implementation of new poles of attraction. This interdisciplinary study constitutes an initial stride toward implementing uncertainty within urban planning frameworks. Future prospects encompass the integration of multiple models for cross-scale analysis, embracing further critical environmental and social aspects. This research contributes to advancing urban resilience strategies. It enhances the understanding of adapting to an uncertain future in the face of climate change, as urban areas must embrace comprehensive planning to ensure flexible adaptation when faced with climate-driven uncertainties in long-term planning. In conclusion, the study underscores that embracing uncertainty is a challenge and a pivotal opportunity to shape resilient and adaptable urban futures.

However, the focusses in existing researches have been either on finding the best strategy by scenario analysis method or optimal design of LID practices under the hypothesis of unchanged grey infrastructures. Little is known regarding the synergistic effect of synchronous optimization design of both green and grey infrastructures. In the study, we conduct green-grey infrastructures synchronous optimization by modifying the decision variables of traditional simulation-optimization frameworks and investigate how external uncertainties will affect their performance. The methodology was applied to a case study in Suzhou, China. The results showed that although the cost of green-grey synchronous optimized scenarios is lower than that of green optimized only scenarios by 1.69-4.19 thousand USD per km(2), the runoff/pollutants reductions of green-grey synchronous optimized scenarios are 0.11%-5.24% higher than that of green optimized only scenarios. In the green-grey synchronous optimized scenarios, green infrastructures can contribute to runoff/pollutants control by 50%-63%/62%-70%, while grey infrastructures can contribute to the remaining part by 37%-50%/30%-38%.

Over half of known human pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							LAND-USE CHANGE; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; HEALTH IMPACTS; VECTOR-BORNE; DROUGHT; FLOODS; TRANSMISSION; PROJECTIONS; PREVALENCE; CHALLENGES	It is relatively well accepted that climate change can affect human pathogenic diseases; however, the full extent of this risk remains poorly quantified. Here we carried out a systematic search for empirical examples about the impacts of ten climatic hazards sensitive to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on each known human pathogenic disease. We found that 58% (that is, 218 out of 375) of infectious diseases confronted by humanity worldwide have been at some point aggravated by climatic hazards; 16% were at times diminished. Empirical cases revealed 1,006 unique pathways in which climatic hazards, via different transmission types, led to pathogenic diseases. The human pathogenic diseases and transmission pathways aggravated by climatic hazards are too numerous for comprehensive societal adaptations, highlighting the urgent need to work at the source of the problem: reducing GHG emissions.

Subsequently, a higher proportion of the country's population will be exposed to water-related challenges. This study analyzes and projects the long-term spatio-temporal changes in precipitation using the data from 2005 to 2099 across two large river basins of Pakistan. The plausible precipitation data to detect the projected trends seems inevitable to study the future water resources in the region. For, policy decisions taken in the wake of such studies can be instrumental in mitigating climate change impacts and shape water management strategies. Outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climate models for the two forcing scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 have been used for the synthesis of projected precipitation data. The projected precipitation data have been synthesized in three steps (1) dividing the area in different climate zones based on the similar precipitation statistics (2) selection of climate models in each climate zone in a way to shrink the ensemble to a few representative members, conserving the model spread and accounting for model similarity in a baseline period of 1971-2004 and the projected period of 2005-2099 and (3) combining the selected model's data in mean and median combinations. The future precipitation trends were detected and quantified, for the set of four scenarios. The spatial distribution of the precipitation trends was mapped for better understanding. All the scenarios produced consistent increasing or decreasing trends. Significant declining trends were projected in the warm wet season at 0.05% significance level and the increasing trends were projected in cold dry, cold wet and warm dry seasons. Framework developed to project climate change trends during the study can be replicated for any other area. The study therefore can be of interest for researchers working on climate impact modeling.

The article argues that there is an intersectional lens through which black local women's experiences of vulnerability to the impact of climate change disasters need to be understood and addressed. Qualitative research methodologies were employed to collect data through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with local black African women from four areas in Durban who have experienced frequent floods over the past years. Personnel from eThekwini municipality's Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department and Disaster Management Department were also interviewed. The feminist political ecology perspective was used to unpack the nuances in power relations that engendered black African women's vulnerability and adaptation to flood impacts within the municipality. The study's findings revealed that the overall vulnerability experiences of black African women in Durban are shaped by factors relating to the lack of an 'intentionally gendered' approach to adaptation governance in the municipality. Adopting an intentional approach to adaptation governance is essential to inform policies responding to local black Africans' vulnerability and adaptation experiences within the study's context.

Weather-Related Fatalities in Australia between 2006 and 2019: Applying an Equity Lens	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						extreme weather; climate change; heat; cold; flood; storm; resilience; preparedness; co-morbidities; mortality	DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS; DETERMINANTS; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY; HEALTH	Extreme weather events can cause significant human, economic and infrastructure losses. Within a changing climate, heatwaves, droughts, and floods are becoming more frequent and severe. Unfortunately, those who are most vulnerable are often disproportionately impacted. In this study, we examined the epidemiology of weather-related fatalities due to excessive heat (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 codes X30); excessive cold (X31); storm and flood (X37; X38); and other causes (X32, X33, X39) in Australia between 2006-2019. There were 682 deaths due directly to weather-related events (41% excessive cold; 37% excessive heat; 15% storms and floods). The mean age of a weather-related victim in Australia was 60.8 years (SD = 24.1), with people aged 65+ years 12.8 times (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.23-17.6) more likely to die due to a weather-related event. As the planet warms our study identifies declining excessive cold-related deaths, while other types of weather events remain steady or increase. In the context of climate change we must protect those most at risk; children and adolescents due to storms and floods, those with co-morbidities (particularly circulatory system disorders) and the elderly. Special attention should be paid to preventing excessive heat-related death among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and international visitors.

AI-Enabled Autonomous Drones for Fast Climate Change Crisis Assessment	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Artificial vision; climate change; deep learning (DL); edge computing; sustainable ICT; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)	UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES; LEARNING FRAMEWORK; UAVS; NETWORKS	Climate change is one of the greatest challenges for modern societies. Its consequences, often associated with extreme events, have dramatic results worldwide. New synergies between different disciplines, including artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing can lead to radically new approaches for the real-time tracking of natural disasters that are also designed to reduce the environmental footprint. In this article, we propose an AI-based pipeline for processing natural disaster images taken from drones. The purpose of this pipeline is to reduce the number of images to be processed by the first responders of the natural disaster. It consists of three main stages: 1) a lightweight autoencoder based on deep learning; 2) a dimensionality reduction using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm; and 3) a fuzzy clustering procedure. This pipeline is evaluated on several edge computing platforms with low-power accelerators to assess the design of intelligent autonomous drones to provide this service in real time. Our experimental evaluation focuses on flooding, showing that the amount of information to be processed is substantially reduced, whereas edge computing platforms with low-power graphics accelerators are placed as a compelling alternative for processing these heavy computational workloads, obtaining a performance loss of only 2.3 x compared to its cloud counterpart version, running both the training and inference steps.

Application of the Water-Energy-Food Nexus Approach to the Climate-Resilient Water Safety Plan of Leh Town, India	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate-resilient water safety plans; Water-Energy-Food Nexus; water security	FLASH FLOODS; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; WEB; GIS	Climate-resilient water safety plans (CR-WSPs) have been developed as a risk-based approach to ensure a safe drinking-water supply while addressing the increasing stress on water resources resulting from climate change. Current examples of the application of CR-WSPs show a strong sectoral approach that fails to explore the potential synergies between other climate-sensitive sectors related to water, such as food and energy. This can increase the vulnerability or decrease the overall resilience of urban systems when planning climate change adaptation measures. In this work, the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus approach was applied in the formulation of a CR-WSP in Leh Town, India, a city with rapid development and population growth located in the Himalayas-one of the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change. The WEF Nexus approach was applied in the system description using a critical infrastructure approach and in the formulation of scenarios for risk management which exploited intersectoral synergies through water reclamation with resource recovery using constructed wetlands. The improvements in WEF security and risk reduction were demonstrated through indicators and risk mapping with geographical information systems (GISs). The methods for integrating the WEF Nexus approach in CR-WSPs provided through this work can serve as a base for a trans-sectoral, resilient approach within risk-based approaches for water security.

In particular, climate-related flood risk is increasingly recognized as a potential threat in the capital city of Tehran. Accordingly, the present study aimed to provide a framework/assessment tool to measure Tehran's resilience to flood risks. To this end, 21 professionals from different disciplines were selected through a purposive sampling procedure and were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The analysis procedure resulted in the identification of 3 themes, 15 categories, 40 subcategories, and 235 codes. The themes were social, economic, and organizational; The identified categories were culture and education (since culture is something to be learned through formal and informal education this component has two features: culture and education), participation, trust, attitude, solidarity, resources, empowerment, flexibility, credit, supervision, intercommunication, rules, specialization, and research. Validation of the indicators and their usability based on the opinions of local experts was used to calibrate the assessment tool and ensure its context-sensitivity. The results of this research can help planners and policymakers to increase their awareness of flood resilience. The approach taken in this research may also be useful for developing flood resilience assessment tools in other Iranian cities as well as in other cities of the Global South with similar conditions.

Attribution of Detected Temperature Trends in Southeast Brazil	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						greenhouse gases; attribution; model uncertainty; Brazil	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PART I; MODEL	Southeast Brazil has great economic importance for Brazil and is highly vulnerable to extreme events like floods and droughts. Studies have shown an increase of temperature in this region. Using a new detection and attribution framework (Ribes et al., 2017, ) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, this change is found to be largely due to greenhouse gases. We estimate that greenhouse gases contribute a warming of 0.95 to 1.5 degrees C to the observed warming trend of 1.1 degrees C between 1955 and 2004. Temperature changes from natural and nongreenhouse gas anthropogenic forcing are estimated to be small over this period. Results are robust using different time windows. Using the Community Earth System Model ensembles to evaluate the impacts of internal variability, observational and model error shows that most uncertainty arises from model error. Plain Language Summary Southeast Brazil has great economic importance for Brazil and is highly vulnerable to extreme events like floods, droughts, and heat waves. Many studies link those kind of events with an increase in temperature due to climate change, largely caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. This study tested whether or not human-induced climate change is responsible for the observed increase in temperature in Southeast Brazil. The observed 1.1 degrees C per 50-year trend is largely due to increasing greenhouse gases, which means that they have a significant role in observed changes in Southeast Brazilian temperatures.

It is also known that coastal communities have been relying on those natural resources for their livelihoods in different ways. It is from this interdependence that this study was proposed, to analyse the role of coastal resources in sustaining community livelihoods of the coastal communities in the changing climate in two villages, Msinga and Nyamisati, all based in Rufiji district, Tanzania. The study employed the mixed method design whereby household questionnaires,-key informant interviews, focus group discussions, field observations and literature review were used to collect primary and secondary data. Findings show that coastal resources including fish and mangrove are impacted by sea level rise, storm surges, tropical storms, droughts, floods and change in salinity conditions eventually compromising their integrity. Consequently livelihoods that depend on these resources such as fisheries and agriculture in the delta have declined in productivity over the past 10 years, causing food insecurity to majority of households. People have been adapting in different ways with respect to climate change impacts mainly through the use of social networks and coastal resources utilization particularly sale of fish, mangrove logs and timber. However, utilization of such resources was unsustainable as it entailed overexploitation and use of prohibited fishing gears and unlawful harvesting of mangrove. Nonetheless, coastal communities are still vulnerable to climate change impacts owing to low resource base, whereby women are the most vulnerable group due to poor participation in decision making at family level. Besides, to monitor coastal resources utilization, institutions were put in place through policy and legal frameworks. Enforcement of bylaws with respect to resources utilization such as permits for mangrove and fisheries utilization and ban of agriculture in the delta was meant to make coastal natural resources more resilient to the impacts of climate change. However, some of enforcements of some bylaws made community members prone to impacts of climate variability and change by being landless. The study recommends the integration of participatory approaches regarding the natural coastal resources management including capacity building to women in order to build their resilience to impacts of climate variability and change.

Knowing their spatiotemporal dynamics therefore constitutes a strategic tool to help decision-makers. Based on documentary research, geographic information system (GIS), image processing, and field work, this article maps land use on Manoka Island between 1986 and 2018 and identifies the drivers of change and avenues for intervention with a view to strengthening climate change mitigation. The results show a decrease of 4% in forest area on Manoka Island, representing an average of 112 ha of inland forest and 267 ha of mangrove converted between 1986 and 2018. This increases the degraded forest area by 268% (degraded mangrove and degraded inland forest) and exposes some camps to erosion and flooding. Reduction in forest area is mainly linked to the harvesting of fuelwood and the conversion of forests into farmland and residential areas. Settlements have increased in area from 15 ha in 1986 to 90.4 ha in 2018 to the detriment of natural spaces.

More than two-thirds of the qualitative survey respondents had encountered at least one event of natural disaster before marriage. Quantitative data confirmed significantly higher exposure to flood and river erosion among the coastal population. The quantitative data also suggested a positive association between shocks related to climate events and the incidence of child marriage, while the qualitative data indicated multiple themes related to the causes of child marriage, such as economic vulnerability, coping with risk and patriarchal norms. Yet the qualitative study respondents did not directly refer to natural disasters and climate changes when narrating their marital histories. The qualitative and quantitative evidence does not suggest that dowry-related factors are leading to early marriage. Rather, child marriage appears to be a coping strategy adopted by households in response to their increased vulnerability to natural disasters.	[Asadullah, M.

Increased water risks to global hydropower in 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C Warmer Worlds	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Climate change; Paris agreement; Floods; Droughts; Hydropower	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; POWER; ADAPTATION; RESERVOIRS; ENERGY; MODEL; DAMS	Hydropower plays an important role within the renewable energy sector and supports the achievement of international energy security targets. Yet this sector is also vulnerable to droughts which affect generation potential, and high flows which can cause structural and operational damage. Here we use river flows calculated using a multi-model ensemble to investigate the potential water risks which current and planned global hydropower generation capacities may face at 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warmer worlds. We find that the global hydropower sector will have to face diverse, simultaneous, and compound water risks. We estimate that about 65% of current global hydropower installed capacity will be exposed to risk from recurrent high river flows (here understood as the change in the 1-in-100-years flow). Up to 75% of existing hydropower capacity in Europe, North America and MENA is located in areas where droughts are projected to become at least 10% longer when compared to historical conditions. Achieving a 1.5 degrees C warming target would reduce these risks, compared to a 2.0 degrees C scenario.

Coastal cities will face more severe compound flooding under climate change. Although some studies have analyzed compound flooding under climate change, there is a lack of research considering the combined effect of sea level rise (SLR) and future rainfall changes, especially lack of the jacking effect of SLR on the volume and duration of compound flooding. This paper investigates the impact of future rainfall changes and SLR on compound flood risk, via a case study of a coastal city, Haikou, China. Future rainfall in Haikou is ob-tained by bias correction of rainfall from five global climate models (GCMs) in CMIP5. The SLR in 2050 and 2090 is predicted according to IPCC. Then, a 1D/2D hydrological-hydrodynamic model for dynamic simulation of surface runoff is applied to simulate compound flooding. Results show that both future rainfall changes and SLR will lead to the increase of flood extent, flood depth and flood duration. But future rainfall changes will have a greater impact on flood, and the combined effect of future rainfall changes and SLR on flood is greater than the sum of their individual effects. The individual effects of SLR and future rainfall changes would increase flood depth in 10.6 % and 32.1 % of the study area, respectively, while their combined effect would increase this proportion to 34.9 %. Also, the jacking effect of SLR on compound flooding will lead to an increase in flood volume, but it presents a nonlinear relationship that gradually slows down with the increase of SLR. A SLR of 0.3 m and 0.63 m will lead to a 2.34 % and 3.22 % increase in flood volume, respectively. And the jacking effect of SLR is more obvious when future rainfall changes are considered, which will lead to a sharp increase in the duration of compound flooding. Moreover, water storage facilities and tidal gates are effective ways to reduce the impact of climate change on compound flooding.

However, measuring municipalities' adaptation progress presents its share of difficulties especially when it comes to comparing (on similar dimensions and over time) the situation of different municipal entities and to linking adaptation impacts to local actions. Longitudinal studies with recurring indicators could capture changes occurring over time, but the development of such indicators requires great emphasis on methodological and psychometric aspects, such as measurement validity. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and validate an index of adaptation to heatwaves and flooding at the level of municipal urbanists and urban planners. Methods: A sample of 139 officers working in urbanism and urban planning for municipal entities in the province of Quebec (Canada) completed an online questionnaire. Developed based on a literature review and consultation of representatives from the municipal sector, the questionnaire measured whether the respondent's municipal entity did or did not adopt the behaviors that are recommended in the scientific and gray literature to adapt to heatwaves and flooding. Results: Results of the various metrological analyses (indicator reliability analysis, first order confirmatory factor analysis, concurrent validity analysis, and nomological validity assessment analysis) confirmed the validity of the index developed to measure progress in climate change adaptation at the municipal level. The first dimension of the index corresponds to preliminary measures that inform and prepare stakeholders for action (i.e., groundwork adaptation initiatives), whereas the second refers to measures that aim to concretely reduce vulnerability to climate change, to improve the adaptive capacity or the resilience of human and natural systems (i.e., adaptation actions). Conclusion: The results of a series of psychometric analyses showed that the index has good validity and could properly measure the adoption of actions to prepare for adaptation as well as adaptation actions per se. Municipal and government officials can therefore consider using it to monitor and evaluate adaptation efforts at the municipal level.

In order to ascertain the possible synergetic impact of these factors associate to climatic change in this plant species physiological and growth responses. Our results indicated that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration improved plant physiological performance under suboptimal root-flooding and saline conditions plants. Thus, this positive impact was mainly ascribed to an enhancement of energy transport efficiency, as indicated the greater P-G, N and Sm values, and the maintaining of carbon assimilation capacity due to the higher net photosynthetic rate (A(N)) and water use efficiency (iWUE). This could contribute to reduce the risk of oxidative stress owing to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, plants grown at 700 ppm had a greater capacity to cope with flooding and salinity synergistic impact by a greater efficiency in the modulation in enzyme antioxidant machinery and by the accumulation of osmoprotective compounds and saturated fatty acids in its tissues. These responses indicate that atmospheric CO2 enrichment would contribute to preserve the development of Salicornia ramosissima against the ongoing process of increment of soil stressful conditions linked with climatic change.

It is documented that increasing extreme rainfall and flooding cause more nutrient runoff into waterbodies, initiating numerous harmful algal bloom (HAB) events, especially in fragile ecosystems. We analyze the dramatic economic damage of one of these episodes in Mar Menor, the largest salt-water lagoon in Europe. We show that when the public perceived the severity of environmental degradation, the return on housing investment was 43% lower in the surroundings than in similar neighboring zones 6 years after the HAB (2015). This represents a loss in housing wealth of more than 4000 million euros, around ten times the gains of changing from dry-farming to irrigated crops, which makes this ecosystem fragile. Hence, we quantify some of the economic consequences of ecological deterioration linked to episodes of Global Climate Change.

Glacial retreat and the development of glacial lakes and drainage systems provide opportunities for hazardous events such as GLOFs. We observe that the stability of lagoons and their associated barriers are controlled by the frequency and magnitude of storms approaching the coasts, access to sediment supplies and resilience to sea-level rise. Based on multidecadal remote sensing data, we were able to identify the rate of glacial recession, the development of glacial lakes, vegetation response to climate change and a GLOF event, and shoreline and lagoon responses to the environmental shifts within the small catchment. Here we present an example of lagoon system evolution where a glacial outburst flood exerted significant control over lagoon drainage and coastal barrier stability.

With a substantial body of literature amassed since the term's inception in 2015, there is a need to systematically review existing literature to identify overarching gaps and trends, according to disciplinary focus, geographic scope, and key themes, and direct future research inquiry and policy recommendations. This review consists of bibliometric analysis and thematic analysis for NBS studies in urbanism. NBS studies were found to relate strongly with other concepts of 'Ecosystem Services', 'Green Infrastructure', 'Climate Change', and 'Risk management and Resilience', which align with four major thematic goals set by the European Commission. Within NBS scholarship, various sub-themes have emerged, namely, 'Greening', 'Urban Development', 'Water', 'Wellbeing', and 'Governance'. Furthermore, we illustrate that the amount and thematic focus of NBS research have been unevenly distributed worldwide. Analysis of emerging trends shows a recent increase in topics, such as adaptive governance of NBS, and the incorporation of social justice in sustainability transitions. Based on an assessment of extant NBS literature, we offer some recommendations for the future direction of the research fields.

Green infrastructure performance in mitigating floods depends on plant responses to meteorological forcing. This puts urban green infrastructure in risk under a changing climate. In this study, the resilience and efficiency of London's green infrastructure under climate change is evaluated. The coupled water and carbon dynamics were evaluated using a mechanistic ecohydrological model forced with the new generation of 2018 UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). It was found that despite overall reductions of runoff production in London under climate change in winter/autumn, current urban green infrastructure in London can lose its efficiency due to the elevated levels of plant water stress unless it operates in an integrated manner with the traditional grey infrastructure drainage system. Plant water stress induced mostly by changes in climate is expected to limit vegetation performance during the end of growing seasons. The negative effects of varying climatic factors on vegetation dynamics can only be partially alleviated by the positive effects of the elevated CO2 concentration level, and are highly uncertain due to the large uncertainty of climate projections.

The well-known Grain for Green Program (GGP) implemented in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) of China, greatly modify the flow patterns and result cascading effects on the freshwater provisioning services of watershed ecosystem. Studies about the impacts of climate and land use changes on streamflow increased rapidly in recent years; however, the evolution characteristic of the freshwater provisioning services under climate change and vegetation restoration is poorly understood. Based on an index-based ecosystem service approach, the annual freshwater provisioning index (FWPI) was calculated and evolution of the freshwater provisioning services were analyzed from 1958 to 2014 for nine watersheds in the YRB. According to a coupled ecohydrological model (CLM-GBHM) developed in the YRB, two vegetation scenarios consisting of fixed leaf area index (LAI) in 1982 and remote-sensed LAI among 1982-2014were established and the annual FWPI under both scenarios were simulated. The respective influence of vegetation restoration and climate on the freshwater provisioning services were finally quantitatively analyzed. The results show that the annual FWPI had a general decrease in most of watersheds in the past 57 years. The increased precipitation during 2000-2014 significantly improved the freshwater provisioning services by 0.8 %-21.3 % among 9 watersheds in comparison with those during 1980-1999, considering the respective impact of climate change. The restored vegetation after the GGP carried out since 1999 had a negative influence on the freshwater provisioning services in the YRB. The mean annual FWPI obviously reduced by -11.9 % and -3.6 % in the upper YRB and the entire basin, respectively, and it reduced by -2.4 %similar to-5.8 % in five tributary watersheds during 2000-2014. A significant positive correlation between the mean annual FWPI(S1-S2) which denoting the difference between FWPI under two vegetation scenarios (S1, S2), and the average slope was observed (R-2 = 0.52 and p < 0.05), indicating the negative effect of the raised slope on the freshwater provisioning services. Above results suggest that the precipitation is one critical climate factor of enhancing the freshwater provisioning services, whereas the negative influence of the vegetation restoration and slope changes on the freshwater provisioning should be considered when implementing the GGP for enhancing other hydrological services such as soil erosion control and the flood regulation in different river basins. Results from this study would provide scientific insights in enhancing ecology protection and sustainable utilization of water resources of watershed ecosystems..

The impervious transformation and changes in local climatic conditions increase the risk of frequent pluvial flooding in Kathmandu. Therefore, this study aims to assess the integrated impact of urbanisation and climate change on pluvial flooding in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, using the Personal Computer Storm Water Management Model. The future daily rainfall from three Regional Climate Models under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the observed daily data has been disaggregated to hourly series using temporal rainfall disaggregation. The result shows that the combined impact on pluvial flood is likely to intensify with relatively more contribution from climate change. The CNRM-CM5-CSIRO-CCAM under the RCP 4.5 scenario projects the maximum increase (60-90%) in flood volume for current (75%) and extreme (90%) imperviousness, under a 2-year and 20-year return period (RP) with the extent of the flood area increasing more than the depth. For a 2-year RP, areas with a depth of 0.10-0.25 m are likely to expand while those from 0.25 to 0.40 m in depth are projected to have more velocity, and these trends are expected to be magnified for higher RPs. The study shows that even though urbanisation contributes less to urban pluvial flood, it can be a catalyst for exaggerating other factors and implementing management measures. For instance, the application of small-scale rainwater harvesting, and overflow storage reduced the runoff, thereby reducing the flood volume by 20-35%. Furthermore, the findings highlight the need for planning management strategies such as evaluation and upgrading of conventional drainage systems with low impact measures (rainwater harvesting and green roofs); technical and financial assistance to urban dwellers in adopting the management measures or a combination of them based on the location, requirements, and availability of information and resources to reduce the effects of pluvial flood in Kathmandu.

J	Sharifi, A				Sharifi, Ayyoob			Trade-offs and conflicts between urban climate change mitigation and adaptation measures: A literature review	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Climate change; Mitigation; Adaptation; Conflict; Trade-off; Interaction	LOW-CARBON; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CO-BENEFITS; SYNERGIES; RESILIENT; CITY; CONSUMPTION; INTEGRATION; STRATEGIES; TRANSPORT	Many cities around the world are increasingly developing plans and policies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These plans and policies are often focused on either mitigation or adaptation. This dichotomized approach can be problematic and result in trade-offs. In other words, efforts aimed at enhancing mitigation (adaptation) may hinder achieving adaptation (mitigation) objectives. Additionally, conflicts may arise as there might be inconsistencies between some mitigation and adaptation measures. Since trade-offs and conflicts between adaptation and mitigation measures can undermine effectiveness and efficiency of municipal activities, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize them. This study aims to provide a better understanding of potential trade-offs and conflicts through reviewing literature on the interactions between urban adaptation and mitigation measures. This is done through bibliographic analysis and detailed content analyses of selected papers. Results of this review show that research on trade-offs and conflict has gained traction since the publication of the fourth assessment report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies. In particular, limited research exists on the Global South cities. Also, according to the findings, existing research is mainly focused on trade-offs associated with measures related to energy, land use, transport, water, building, green infrastructure, and waste sectors. It is found that mitigation measures may have negative impacts on adaptation by increasing exposure to risks such as the urban heat island effect and flooding and/or by eroding livelihood options of poor and marginalized groups and causing equity concerns. In contrast, adaptation measures may increase greenhouse gas emissions by, among other things, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. It is discussed that integrated assessment frameworks should be utilized to deal with trade-offs and conflicts. Finally, some recommendations for better uptake of integrated frameworks are provided.

One example of such recommendations are climate change allowances. These are often based on expected changes in design precipitation as given by climate model simulations, and are used as a buffer on top of current design values to avoid a future increased damage potential as a consequence of climate change. We here compute expected changes in precipitation design values, so-called climate factors (CFs), for the Nordic-Baltic region, based on 3 km convection permitting simulations from the Nordic Convection Permitting Climate Projections project. These have the advantage of explicitly resolving convection, which has been shown to be the main contributor to increased rainfall. We assess the dependence of the CFs on rainfall duration, return period, and geographical location, focusing on the summer (convective) season, short durations and the high emission scenario RCP8.5. We also compare these CFs to those computed from a non-convection permitting regional climate model ensemble.We found higher CFs for the longer return period, with only few exceptions, and distinctly higher CFs going from daily to sub-daily durations. However, the different simulations give conflicting results for very short-duration rainfall (<3 h). The huge difference in the climate sensitivity of driving GCMs dominates the magnitude of estimated return levels. Our analysis is shaped by the high computational costs of running convection permitting models, resulting in a very limited ensemble (3 members) representing a single emission scenario (RCP8.5). Therefore, we believe that combining results from convection permitting simulations with a larger ensemble (21 members) of non-convection permitting simulations adds value to the assessment of robust climate change allowances for heavy precipitation in the Nordic-Baltic region.

In this study, future changes in the extreme floods and their hydrodynamic responses are projected by driving the external coupling of the hydrological and hydrodynamic models using the precipitation and temperature outputs of the general circulation models (GCMs) in seven emission scenarios, and the impact of climate change is evaluated. The Baiyangdian Lake and its controlled catchment are selected as our study area. Results show that: (a) both the daily runoff and the lake water levels are well simulated, (b) compared with the baseline scenario, extreme riverine floods are projected to increase evidently throughout the catchment with mean rates of 33.2%, 14.1% and 10.9% in the RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively because of increasing precipitation; consequently, the total lake inflow also increases by 13.5%-150.9%, most of which are from Zhulong, Xiaoyi, Tanghe, and Fuhe Rivers, and (c) the water level of the Baiyangdian Lake increases temporally during the flood seasons in all the scenarios, and the increase in water level is 0.27-1.29 m greater than that in the baseline scenario; consequently, the water depth in 55.8% and 73.4% of lake area increases over 1.0 m in the future short-term and long-term scenarios, respectively; the inundation area also increases by 23.4%-26.7% in the future scenarios, except in the long-term RCP4.5 scenario. The northeastern and south-central regions of Baiyangdian, which are near Xiong'an New Area, have a relatively high inundation risk.

Freshwater resources to support food production are very limited in this region. Future climate predictions include more consistent and longer wet periods with increasing surplus rainfall, which will enhance flood and flash flood occurrences in the MENA. Demand management of groundwater resources and managed aquifer recharge (MAR, also called groundwater replenishment, water banking, and artificial recharge, is the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers for subsequent recovery or environmental benefits) represent essential strategies to overcome the challenges associated with groundwater depletion and climate change impacts. Such strategies would enable the development of groundwater resources in the MENA region by minimizing the stress placed on these resources, as well as reducing deterioration in groundwater quality. Groundwater augmentation through recharge dams is a common practice in different countries around the globe. Most dams in the MENA region were built to enhance groundwater recharge, and even the few protection dams also act as recharge dams in one way or another. However, the operating systems of these dams are mostly dependent on the natural infiltration of the accumulated water in the reservoir area, with limited application of MAR. This review presents analyses of groundwater renewability and the effectiveness of recharge dams on groundwater recharge, as well as the potential of MAR technology. This study indicates that the recharge efficiency of dam's ranges between 15 to 47% and is clustered more around the lower limit. Efficiency is reduced by the clogging of the reservoir bed with fine materials. Therefore, there is a need to improve the operation of dams using MAR technology.

Considering the important role of the meteorological parameters on climate change, in this research the effectiveness rate of various meteorological parameters including the mean minimum and maximum annual temperature (Max-Temp and Min-Temp), the mean annual temperature (M-Temp), the mean annual sunshine (Sunshine), the mean annual relative humidity (Humidity), the mean annual wind speed (Wind) and the mean of annual precipitation (Rainfall) on United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) aridity index was assessed and prioritized using the Backward Multiple Ridge Regression (BMRR). In this study, the meteorological data series of 25 synoptic stations in Iran with different climate conditions during 1967-2017 was used. The results indicated that the BMRR method had a nice capability to predict the UNEP index using the above-mentioned meteorological parameters (the linear regression between observed and predicted the UNEP index had no difference with perfect reliable line (Y = X) at 0.05 significant levels and the R-2 between two mentioned data series were significant at 0.01 levels at all stations). According to the results, Rainfall, Wind and Max-Temp parameters were the most effective parameters on the UNEP aridity index, respectively and the Min-Temp, M-Temp and Sunshine parameters were the least effective parameters on the UNEP index, respectively. Therefore, it is suggested that all human activities that have direct or indirect effects in the increasing temperature and reducing the rainfall must be revised and optimized based on the principles of sustainable development.

Assessment of SWAT spatial and temporal transferability for a high-altitude glacierized catchment	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							UNGAUGED MESOSCALE CATCHMENTS; DAMMA GLACIER; CONTINUOUS SIMULATION; FLOOD ESTIMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PART II; MODEL; RUNOFF; REGIONALIZATION; FUTURE	In this study, we investigated the application and the transferability of the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a partly glacierized Alpine catchment characterized by extreme climatic conditions and steep terrain. The model was initially calibrated for the 10 km(2) watershed of the Damma glacier Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) in central Switzerland using monitoring data for the period of 20092011 and then was evaluated for 2012-2013 in the same area. Model performance was found to be satisfactory against both the Nash-Sutcliffe criterion (NS) and a benchmark efficiency (BE). The transferability of the model was assessed by using the parameters calibrated on the small watershed and applying the model to the approximately 100 km(2) catchment that drains into the hydropower reservoir of the Goscheneralpsee and includes the Damma glacier CZO. Model results were compared to the reservoir inflow data from 1997 to 2010 and it was found that the model predicted successfully snowmelt timing and autumn recession but could not accurately capture the peak flow for certain years. Runoff was slightly overestimated from late May to June, when it is dominated by snowmelt. Finally, we investigated the response of the greater catchment to climate change using three different climate change scenarios, and the results were compared to those of a previous study, where two different hydrological models, PREVAH and ALPINE3D, were used. The methodology presented here, where SWAT is calibrated for a small watershed and then applied for a bigger area with similar climatic conditions and geographical characteristics, could work even under extreme conditions like ours. However, greater attention should be given to the differences between glacier melt and snowmelt dynamics. In conclusion, this assessment test on the transferability of SWAT on different scales gave valuable information about the strengths and weaknesses of the model when it was applied under conditions different to those under which it was calibrated.

They offer various ecosystem services in cities, for example, by mitigating the risk of floods, providing water purification, groundwater regulation, and biodiversity promotion. Urban wetlands also provide recreational opportunities such as swimming and boating, that improve citizens' well-being. Unfortunately, human activities and environmental factors have been the primary reasons that have destroyed urban wetlands. To identify the main factors which threaten wetlands, as a case study, we investigated the environmental history of six urban wetlands in Helsinki starting from 19(th) century to the present. We collected historical information from available documents such as research articles, technical reports, maps, and photos, and then we compared the past situation of these urban wetlands with the current conditions throughout history. We also support our statements by referring to urban wetlands with similar conditions from different continents to explain the reasons for wetlands' disappearance, degradation, or survival. We show that population growth, land-use change, and climate change have been the main threats that have caused the degradation and even the loss of urban wetlands. We discuss the influencing factors which threaten urban wetlands and we highlight the role of policy and decision-makers in the rehabilitation and maintenance of urban wetlands.

J	von Bulow, CW; Liu, XF				von Bulow, Catharina Wolff; Liu, Xiufeng			Ready-made oTree applications for the study of climate change adaptation behavior	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Economic experiment; Behavioral economics; oTree; Choice under risk and uncertainty; Coordination and communication	RISK-AVERSION; COMMUNICATION; COMPETITION; MITIGATION; DECISION; COASTAL; COORDINATION; INDIVIDUALS; INVESTMENTS; PREVENTION	Adaptation to climate change is an intricate decision-making process that requires balancing costs and uncertain benefits in a setting with high stakes and low probabilities. Risk preferences then shape the way individuals or groups adapt to these settings, dependent or independent of public policy. With the aim of shedding light on these preferences and aid policy efficiency, we develop a set of Climate Change Adaptation Applications based on oTree (CAT). The set consists of eight discrete apps that correspond to different risk perception biases and corrective treatments. From a scientific perspective CAT can be used to better understand adaptation decision constraints at the individual and community level, while from a policy perspective it can help policy makers plan or improve existing adaptation strategies. A pilot experiment with 75 subjects was conducted to evaluate CAT functionality and the decision-making process. The experiment examined adaptation decisions under different risk levels in a home flood context. It successfully explored the impact of unknown risks, various time horizons, framing conditions, and group dynamics. The results show that adaptation decisions are strongly correlated with risk levels, and adaptation rate increases when uncertainty is introduced. Collective adaptation increases in group dynamics, although polarization is observed, and uncertainty reinforces this through collective inaction. In addition, typical subject characteristics, including age, gender and home ownership, have a significant impact on adaptation.

Transportation and its infrastructure remain particularly vulnerable to such events despite their crucial role in many socioeconomic activities and commuter safety. Despite the adverse climate change projections, there is limited research providing a holistic and quantified overview of the impact of rare, extreme flash floods on the transportation of affected areas both in terms of infrastructure and circulation. The research team surveyed the effects of an extreme flash flood at Mandra, Greece, aiming to provide a systematic overview of the extent and typology of its impacts on transportation. The study quantifies the effects on different elements of transportation infrastructure, as well as vehicle circulation disturbances using floating car data. Results show an extensive impact with approximately 40% of the mad network inundated or inaccessible and over 80% of river crossings (bridges, fords, and culverts) suffering damages, debris deposition and/or flooding, while critical cross-sections of the drainage network were diminished. Circulation was affected heavily with significant vehicle speed drops, travel times and distances increasing in and around the affected area. The findings indicate a considerably higher degree of impacts in comparison with less rare flash floods, implying that transportation systems may require extensive adaptation to address the increase of extreme events' frequency induced by climate change.

To understand how these combined stressors affect forest conditions, we identified forest patches adjacent to urban land, analyzed adjacent land cover, modeled forest inundation, and sampled 100 sites across the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay watersheds. We found that the majority of forest patches are adjacent to urban land and projected flooding will affect 8-19% of regional forested land. We observed non-native invasive plants in 94% of forest plots. Trees were predominantly native, but over half of shrub stems were invasive species and more than 80% of plots contained invasive woody vines. Disturbance of human origin was correlated with abundance of invasive trees. Signs of deer activity were common. Richness and number of growth forms of invasive plants were related to adjacent agricultural land cover. These data reveal that streamside forests are impacted by the interacting stressors of urbanization, climate change, and invasive species spread. Our results emphasize the importance of protection and restoration of forests in urban regions and point to the need for a social-ecological systems approach to improve their condition.

Land-cover change and urban growth in the Mexico-Lerma-Cutzamala Hydrological Region, 1993-2018	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						ESA-CCI; Urbanization; GIS; Water systems; Mexico City	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; WATER; CITY; MANAGEMENT; EXPANSION; PROCAMPO; RECHARGE; IMPACTS	The Mexico-Lerma-Cutzamala Hydrological Region (MLCHR) encompasses all areas serving water needs of Mexico City Metropolitan Area and is home to 26.8 million people. Historically, this region has experienced extensive environmental and land cover changes due to urbanization, agricultural expansion, deforestation, growing population, floods and droughts. The main objectives of the study are to quantify the land cover changes and to identify spatial/temporal patterns of urban growth during 1993-2018. The results revealed that within the MLCHR over 25 years, urban land cover grew by 82% from its original extent in 1993. Shrubland and cropland contributed the most to the new urban land. The rate of change to urban has been increasing, from 38 km2/year in 1993-2004 to 53 km(2)/year in 2004-2018. Additionally, the spatial pattern of urbanization has become more dispersed over time, as new transitions to urban are happening farther away from existing urban land. This study is the first to quantify and locate urbanization within the entire hydrological region that serves the water and sanitation needs of the megalopolis. Its results will support future modeling efforts to understand the impacts of climate change on surface water bodies and aquifers within the MLCHR under different climate -change scenarios and to identify populations most vulnerable to projected water stress.

Effects of individual stresses on plant traits are well studied, although less is known about the impacts of sequences of different stresses. We used savoy cabbage to study the consequences of control conditions (well-watered) versus continuous drought versus drought followed by soil flooding and a potential recovery phase on shoot growth and leaf metabolism. Under continuous drought, plants produced less than half of the shoot biomass compared to controls, but had a >20% higher water use efficiency. In the soil flooding treatment, plants exhibited the poorest growth performance, particularly after the "recovery" phase. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio was at least twice as high, whereas amino acid concentrations were lowest in leaves of controls compared to stressed plants. Some glucosinolates, characteristic metabolites of Brassicales, showed lower concentrations, especially in plants of the flooding treatment. Stress-specific investment into different amino acids, many of them acting as osmolytes, as well as glucosinolates, indicate that these metabolites play distinct roles in the responses of plants to different water availability conditions. To reduce losses in crop production, we need to understand plant responses to dynamic climate change scenarios.

The future climatic alterations under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), i.e. 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, are quantified by an ensemble of two different CMIP5 models, i.e. CNRM-CM5.0, GFDL-CM3.0. The outcomes of this study reveal that the future rainfall and temperature may experience an increasing trend with gradual shifting of monsoon from mid-June to mid-May. The average annual streamflow experienced the highest increase during the period 2071-2095, whereas the highest average annual evapotranspiration (ET) is observed for the period 2046-2070 under both the RCPs and resulting in comparatively slower groundwater recharge (GWR) over the basin. In order to implement suitable adaptation strategies for a possible flood scenario on the concerned study basin, three critical sub-basins, namely, sub-basin 1, 4, and 5, were identified. Furthermore, the altered streamflow and ET dynamics may result in a significant shifting in the conventional agricultural practice in the coming future time scales. Conclusively, the outcomes of this study have potential implications for policy makers in formulating the policies related to sustainable water resources management in future scenarios.

Spatial targeting of ICT-based weather and agro-advisory services for climate risk management in agriculture	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							SMART AGRICULTURE; INFORMATION	The increasing frequency of climatic risks, such as flood, drought, heat and cold waves, is causing significant loss of farm productivity and income in agriculturally dependent communities. Timely availability of reliable information on weather conditions, agro-advisories, and market information can help to minimize losses in agriculture. This paper presents a scientific and integrated approach to identify areas of high agriculture vulnerability to climate change and availability of ICT services for dissemination of CSA information in the vulnerable areas. This study was illustrated for India where the majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, and this sector is highly vulnerable to climate change. The study presents four regions: i) high agriculture vulnerability and low ICT services, ii) high agriculture vulnerability and high ICT services, iii) low agriculture vulnerability and low ICT services, and iv) low agriculture vulnerability and high ICT services. This methodology, which is simple, uses available data, and is easy to apply, can be useful to prioritize locations for climate-smart interventions, mode of CSA information dissemination using ICT services, and increase coverage of agro-ICT services through development of ICT services in the locations where climate change impact is high and ICT services are very low. This study also showed that there is a need to improve the quality of existing climate information and agro-advisory services in the climate risk-prone areas.

The results of structural equation analyses showed that municipal authorities' attitude toward the adoption of adaptation behaviors (i.e., the degree to which the performance of an adaptive behavior is positively or negatively valued by municipal officers) and perceived control (barriers) over adaptation behaviors significantly contributed to the prediction of readiness to adopt the behavior.

In recent years, influenced by climate change, the Hai-River Basin (HRB) has experienced multiple large-scale flood disasters. During the widespread extraordinary flood event from July 28th to August 1st, 2023, eight rivers witnessed their largest floods on record. These events caused significant damage and impact on economic and social development. The development of hydrological models with better performance can help researchers understand the impacts of climate change, provide risk information on different disaster events within watersheds, support decision-makers in formulating adaptive measures, urban planning, and improve flood defense mechanisms to address the ever-changing climate environment. This study examines the potential for enhancing streamflow simulation accuracy in the HRB located in Northeast China by combining the physically-based hydrological model with the data-driven model. Three hybrid models, SWAT-D-BiLSTM, SWAT-C-BiLSTM and SWAT-C-BiLSTM with SinoLC-1, were constructed in this study, in which SWAT was used as a transfer function to simulate the base flow and quick flow generation process based on weather data and spatial features, and BiLSTM was used to directly predict the streamflow according to the base flow and quick flow. In the SWAT-C-BiLSTM model, SWAT parameters with P values less than 0.4 in each hydrological station-controlled watershed were calibrated, while the SWAT-D-BiLSTM model did not undergo calibration. Additionally, this study utilizes both 30 m resolution land use and land cover (LULC) map and the first 1 m resolution LULC map SinoLC-1 as input data for the models to explore the impact on streamflow simulation performance. Among five models, the NSE of SWAT-C-BiLSTM with SinoLC-1 reached 0.93 and the R-2 reached 0.95 during the calibration period, and both of them stayed at 0.92 even in the validation period, while the NSE and R-2 of the other four models were all below 0.90 in the validation period. The potential impact of climate change on streamflow in the HRB was evaluated by using predicted data from five global climate models from CMIP6 as input for the best-performing SWAT-C-BiLSTM with SinoLC-1. The results indicate that climate change exacerbates the uneven distribution of streamflow in the HRB, particularly during the concentrated heavy rainfall months of July and August. It is projected that the monthly streamflow in these two months will increase by 34% and 49% respectively in the middle of this century. Furthermore, it is expected that the annual streamflow will increase by 5.6% to 9.1% during the mid-century and by 6.7% to 9.3% by the end of the century. Both average streamflow and peak streamflow are likely to significantly increase, raising concerns about more frequent urban flooding in the capital economic region within the HRB.

Climate change is generating extreme climate events, affecting ecosystem integrity and function directly through increases in abiotic stress and disturbance and indirectly through changes in the strength of biotic interactions. As consumers play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate conditions, improved understanding of their role under changing environmental conditions is necessary to accurately anticipate climate change impacts on ecosystem integrity. 2. We evaluated if prolonged periods of extreme rain, a climatic event increasing in severity in many places around the world, and coincident increases in coastal flooding duration intensify consumer control of foundational salt marsh grass structure and quantify the consequences of flooding-consumer interactions on salt marsh range extent. To achieve this, we analysed: historic trends in crab grazing; crab numbers and activity in and out of rainy years on the low marsh edge; vegetation retreat from the low marsh edge at a plot scale in a manipulative exclosure experiment; vegetation retreat at a landscape-scale from drone image analyses; and the vertical erosion in the lowest edge of an Argentinean salt marsh. 3. During flooded periods, crabs congregated in the low marsh, resulting in localized overgrazing of salt marsh grass and the rapid horizontal retreat of the marsh edge (98.5 cm on average). Salt marsh edge retreat resulted in a loss of similar to 4.5% of the total marsh area at the landscape scale. Inside crab exclusion plots, although grass cover declined slightly during the study period, the marsh edge did not retreat. 4. Synthesis. This study provides experimental evidence that an extreme climate event can destabilize a local consumer-prey interaction, indirectly triggering the range contraction of a critical coastal habitat. This work contributes to a growing body of research demonstrating that consumers can be unleashed, rather than suppressed, by extreme climatic events. Moreover, in cases where consumer fronts form during such events, the result can be not only local (along habitat edges) but also landscape-scale extinction of foundation species and the habitats they biogenically create. Together, this supports the general idea that models of future climate scenarios integrate the indirect effects on ecosystem-regulating food web interactions.

This is further exacerbated by land use transformations, urbanization, over-tourism, sociopolitical tensions, technological innovations, among others. A scenario-informed multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) was applied in the Metropolitan City of Venice integrating qualitative (i.e., local stakeholder preferences) and quantitative information (i.e., climate-change projections) with the aim of enhancing system resilience to multiple climate-related threats. As part of this analysis, different groups of local stakeholders (e.g., local authorities, civil protection agencies, SMEs, NGOs) were asked to identify critical functions that needs to be sustained. Various policy initiatives were considered to support these critical functions. The MCDA was used to rank the initiatives across several scenarios describing main climate threats (e.g., storm surges, floods, heatwaves, drought). We found that many climate change scenarios were considered to be disruptive to stakeholders and influence alternative ranking. The management alternatives acting on physical domain generally enhance resilience across just a few scenarios while cognitive and informative initiatives provided resilience enhancement across most scenarios considered. With uncertainty of multiple stressors along with projected climate variability, a portfolio of cognitive and physical initiatives is recommended to enhance resilience.

It results in accelerated glacial retreat and melting, lake expansion, and runoff increasing on the Third Pole of the earth (Tibetan Plateau, TP), triggering massive changes in fluvial geomorphology and in the hydrological connections of rivers and lakes. Here we document a reorganization of the endorheic basins (the Zonag Lake and Yanhu Lake basins) in the inner TP, and the establishment of a new hydrological connection with the northernmost source of the Yangtze River, during the period 2011-2019. We find that regional climate change and human actions to mitigate its effects have contributed to this historic hydrological connection, which has been absent for thousands of years. Our findings show that under the influence of global warming and increased precipitation, local hydrological systems will continuously evolve, changing the morphology of rivers and lakes, and affecting the water quantity and quality of the Yangtze River. Given the value of this case in indicating the impact of climate change on the water system in alpine mountains, we suggest the need for global observation and research in other regions with endorheic-exorheic connective basins to gain a more comprehensive understanding and allow better management adaptation.

Changes in climate, increasing urbanization and industrialization are creating immense pressure on the coastal environment. Coastal erosion, sea level rise, changing morphology of the coastal areas and extreme weather events are some of the threats that coastal regions are experiencing globally. While various studies have assessed the vulnerability of coastal regions quantitatively and spatially, there is a need to supplement these findings with qualitative insights based on human experiences. Thus, the present study carried out a coastal vulnerability assessment along the coastline of Dakshina Kannada district in Karnataka, India using Shannon's Entropy by including eight parameters i.e., slope, elevation, geomorphology, bathymetry, sea level rise, mean tidal range, mean significant wave height and shoreline change. The study also explored the experiences and perceptions of stakeholders regarding adaptation barriers to climate change vulnerabilities for understanding the ground complexities. Coastal vulnerability index (CVI) revealed that nearly 39.7 km of the coastline is vulnerable including areas along Sasihtlu beach, Munda, New Mangalore Port Batapady beach, Uchilla, Kotekar, Ullal beach, Netravati River Area and Mukka beach. Rainfall induced coastal erosion, lack of coordination among the various stakeholders, policy makers and practitioners regarding a common framework for climate change adaptation strategies were identified adaptation barriers. The findings of CVI and adaptation barriers may be used by practitioners and policy makers for framing the adaptation measures for mitigating the implications of the coastal region.

Climate change effects on indicators of high and low river flow across Great Britain	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Climate change; Hydrological impacts; Rainfall-runoff; UKCP18; Flood; Drought	NATIONAL-SCALE ANALYSIS; BIAS CORRECTION; FUTURE; IMPACTS; ENGLAND; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; BASIN	Changes in river flows, especially extreme high and low flows, could be a particularly important impact of climate change in terms of the hazard to people and the environment. Here, a national-scale grid-based hydrological model is applied, with ensembles of global and regional climate projections from UK Climate Projections 2018, to investigate the potential future changes in both floods and droughts in a consistent way across the whole of Great Britain (gauged and ungauged locations). Using hydrological model outputs for the climate projection ensembles, a clustering technique is applied to highlight ?typical? sets of changes in individual indicators of floods or droughts, but also to look at concurrent changes in pairs of flood and drought indicators. The results for regions across the country generally indicate decreases in low flows combined with increases in high flows up to the end of the 21st century. There is significant variation in results for different regions, with those to the south/east tending to show greater decreases in low flows and a greater range of uncertainty in the projections for high flows. A grid-based cluster analysis also shows potentially important variation within regions, likely related to catchment properties. The potential future changes in derived climate hazards, such as the frequency or severity of floods and droughts, is a key piece of information required for adaptation planning, and the consideration of potential concurrent changes in a range of related hazards/risks, rather than viewing each in isolation, could be vital to avoid maladaptation.

Surprisingly, most studies dealing with the response of reptiles to climate change focus only on a few species. Here, we used a 30-yr monitoring dataset to assess the consequences of climatic variations on a desert reptile community in eastern Australia. Community structure was measured in three habitat plots differing in flood regime using a range of metrics: the number of individuals and species, alpha biodiversity indices, species turnover, functional diversity, and an indicator describing the change in the critical maximum temperature of the community. Although the functional groups of species sharing similar traits were not clustered by habitat plots, diversity indices were highly plot-specific. Community composition significantly shifted over time toward higher abundance of individuals for species tolerant to heat in two plots, whereas we found an opposite trend in the third plot. Importantly, the response patterns of the different diversity indices to climatic parameters were not uniform. Yet, water-related parameters were overall more influential than temperature. A decrease in water availability paired with rising temperatures may have strongly negative impacts. We stress that combining different diversity metrics is critical to better grasp the complexity of community responses to climate change and that predicting future changes in reptile communities of deserts needs to account for the complementarity of different sources of water supply such as those resulting from the dynamics of local rainfalls with flood regime.

We show that Italy can be considered a good representative for rice cultivation in temperate regions that are not freshwater-limited. However, this situation is changing. We report strong evidence linking the largest European reduction of seasonal surface water that have gradually occurred since 2000 over the rice cultivation area of Northern Italy, to the change in paddy management from traditional continuous flooding to a less greenhouse-gases-emitting practice, that is, dry-seeding with postponed flooding. This change was accompanied by several improvements in agro-practices and crop varieties. Concurrently, regional climate rapidly shifted towards sunnier weather conditions that partly contributed to higher rice yields and stability, decoupling yields from inter-annual climate variability, but also reducing water availability. In Northern Italy, a complete shift of rice cultivation towards dry-seeding is not compatible with seasonal water availability, and a number of drawbacks, with respect to the traditional wet seeding, are also identified from literature review. Therefore, in the context of near-term climate change, sustainable rice cultivation in the middle latitudes seems achievable (without limiting production and/or increasing volatility) by balancing traditional and dry-seeding.

Climate changes in the SRIR also have important impacts on social and economic development, as well as on the ecosystems of the downstream irrigation areas in Pakistan. This paper investigates the changes in precipitation characteristics by dividing the daily precipitation rate into different classes, such as light (0-10 mm), moderate (10.1-25 mm) and heavy precipitation (>25 mm). Daily precipitation data from gauging and non-gauging stations from 1961-2015 are used. The results of the analysis of the annual precipitation and rainy day trends show significant (p < 0.05) increases and decreases, respectively, while light and heavy precipitation show significant decreasing and increasing trends, respectively. The analysis of the precipitation characteristics shows that light precipitation has the highest number of rainy days compared to moderate or heavy precipitation. The analysis of the seasonal precipitation trends shows that only 18 stations have significant increasing trends in winter precipitation, while 27 stations have significant increasing trends in summer precipitation. Both short and long droughts exhibit increasing trends, which indicates that the Indus Basin will suffer from water shortages for agriculture. The results of this study could help policymakers cope with floods and droughts and sustain eco-environmental resources in the study area.

J	Stern, SW				Stern, Scott W.			Rebuilding Trust: Climate Change, Indian Communities, and a Right to Resettlement	ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY			English	Article							PROTECTION; LAW; RELOCATION; MIGRATION; REFUGEES; ETHICS; LAND	According to most estimates, more than one hundred million people will be permanently displaced by climate change by 2050. Among the people most at risk of displacement are American Indians. If the government does nothing, or simply does not do enough, hundreds of Indian communities across the United States will be destroyed, the members of these communities devastated, endangered, and displaced. This Article argues, for the first time, that the Indigenous peoples of the United States have an enforceable right to resettlement derived from the federal trust duty toward American Indians. Long a subject of scholarly debate, unrealized potential, and crushed hopes, the trust duty provides a cause of action for Indians to compel the federal government to relocate them to higher ground, to areas where the effects of climate change will no longer threaten their lives and livelihoods. Indeed, the trust duty does not merely guarantee individual Indians federally funded relocation, if they desire it. It guarantees Indian communities relocation as communities. Emerging from treaty obligations and the foundational Indian law cases of the 1830s, the federal trust duty today obligates the federal government to provide educational services, healthcare services, adequate housing, and public safety to Indians. Courts have held that the trust duty requires the federal government to protect their water supplies and their lands, safeguard their wildlife resources, and to clean up hazardous waste. In the last thirty years, most of the litigation around the trust duty has focused on when federal mismanagement of tribal resources is compensable; in these cases, the tribes were seeking monetary damages, not declaratory or injunctive relief. These cases have yielded a confusing, apparently contradictory line of decisions. But they have also left an opening for a more radical interpretation of the trust duty. Unlike cases involving Indians seeking monetary damages, cases involving Indians seeking declaratory or injunctive relief allow courts to infer the existence of enforceable trust duties beyond those explicitly set out in federal law; such broader duties can and have been inferred from statutes, treaties, and the nature of the relationship between the government and Indians. This Article shows that history, treaty language, statutory provisions, and the common law have given rise to a federal trust duty to protect Indian land, resources, homes, and lives from the effects of climate change, and to relocate Indians when this becomes the only way to maintain that protection. This trust duty is so far-reaching that it effectively guarantees a right to resettlement. Such an argument may sound radical. It is not. It is founded in a common sense reading of case law, statutes, treaties, and common law trust principles. What is radical, on the other hand, is abandoning Indian communities that are facing climate annihilation. Compared to calls for new international agreements, bodies, frameworks, and funding to assist those whose homes will soon flood, melt, or otherwise become unlivable, the approach advocated here is quite modest. This Article seeks only to present a doctrinal argument that the federal government has a legal responsibility to relocate the hundreds of Indian communities facing imminent risks from climate change, if these communities assert this right.

For this purpose, twelve static variables and eight rainfall dynamics variables for 2050s (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) were used as conditioning factors. Four machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Extremely Randomize Trees (ERT), Random Forest (RF) and Oblique-Random Forest (ORF) were used to model flood risk. Considering the area under curve (AUC) and other indices, the ORF was the most optimal model. The AUC of the KNN, ERT, RF and ORF for the validation datasets were 0.85, 0.90, 0.89 and 0.92 respectively. The results showed that under two RCPs, spatial distribution of high flood risk areas will change in the future and the trends will be different from the current. These results could provide valuable insights in simulating, predicting and reducing future flood risk.

To understand these changes better, trend analyses of historical data are helpful. However, traditional trend analyses do not address issues related to shifts in the relative contributions of rainfall versus snowmelt floods, or in the frequency of a particular flood type. We present a novel approach for quantifying such trends in time series of floods using a fuzzy decision tree for event classification and applied it to maximal annual and seasonal floods in 27 alpine catchments for the period 1980-2014. Trends in flood types were studied with Sen's slope and double mass curves. Our results reveal a decreasing number of rain-on-snow and an increasing number of short rainfall events in all catchments, with flash floods increasing in smaller catchments. Overall, the results demonstrate the value of incorporating a fuzzy flood-type classification into flood trend analyses.

As the time interval shrinks between recurrent shocks(2-5), the responses of ecosystems to each new disturbance are increasingly likely to be contingent on the history of other recent extreme events. Ecological memory-defined as the ability of the past to influence the present trajectory of ecosystems(6,7)-is also critically important for understanding how species assemblages are responding to rapid changes in disturbance regimes due to anthropogenic climate change(2,3,6-8). Here, we show the emergence of ecological memory during unprecedented back-to-back mass bleaching of corals along the 2,300 km length of the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, and again in 2017, whereby the impacts of the second severe heatwave, and its geographic footprint, were contingent on the first. Our results underscore the need to understand the strengthening interactions among sequences of climate-driven events, and highlight the accelerating and cumulative impacts of novel disturbance regimes on vulnerable ecosystems.

Consequently, initiatives have been undertaken to restore deforested areas. In East Asian countries, particularly those within the Asian Monsoon region, deforestation has contributed to natural disasters such as sediment run-off, landslides, and flooding, which are exacerbated by torrential rainfall. Restoring forest cover is a critical aspect of national land conservation. To achieve this goal, state-led afforestation initiatives have been launched. Successful afforestation efforts have also been considered an indicator of economic development. However, Japan, which implemented afforestation projects successfully in the 1950s and 1970s, has experienced the under-utilization of its forests due to significant changes in economic and societal conditions since afforestation took place. During the 2010s, the Japanese government promoted the industrialization of forestry, encouraging final felling and reforestation. However, there have been issues with immature forest operation methods and low forestry productivity. Furthermore, in the context of intensifying climate change, heavy rainfall-induced disasters have become more intense, with an increased threat to human safety. Research efforts from the natural and social science fields in Japan have helped identify issues that need to be addressed concerning forests where plantation trees are now utilizable. There is a need to identify improved methods of forestry practice that reduce the risk of climate change-related disasters and establish related forest policies.

This study explores the nonstationary flood history of the Las Vegas Wash (LVW) watershed by deconstructing it into its constituent physical drivers. Observations and reanalysis products are used to examine the hydroclimatology, hydrometeorology, and hydrology of flash flooding in the watershed. Annual peak flows have increased nonlinearly over the past seven decades, with an abrupt changepoint detected in the mid-1990s, which is attributed to the implementation of flood conveyance systems rather than changes in land use. The LVW watershed exhibits two pronounced flood seasons, associated with distinct synoptic atmospheric circulations: winter floods linked to inland-penetrating atmospheric rivers and summer floods linked to the North American monsoon. El Nino-Southern Oscillation also plays a role in modulating extreme rainfall and the resultant floods because annual maximum daily rainfall totals positively correlate with El Nino, with Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.36 (p value < 0.05). Winter maximum daily rainfall totals have increased since 1950, whereas summer daily rainfall maxima have decreased. The trends in hydrometeorological drivers interact with urbanization to shift flood seasonality toward more frequent winter floods in the LVW watershed. A process-based understanding of the flood hydrology of the watershed also provides insights into flood frequency analysis and flood forecasting.

A joint spatial factor analysis model to accommodate data from misaligned areal units with application to Louisiana social vulnerability	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Climate change; Louisiana; Social indicators; Social vulnerability; Spatial factor analysis; Spatial misalignment	BAYESIAN FACTOR-ANALYSIS; DISTRIBUTIONS	With the threat of climate change looming, the public health community has an interest in identifying communities at the highest risk of devastation based not only on geographic features but also on social characteristics. Indices of community social vulnerability can be created by applying a spatial factor analysis to a set of relevant social variables measured for each community; however, current spatial factor analysis methodology is ill-equipped to handle spatially misaligned data. We introduce a joint spatial factor analysis model that can accommodate spatial data from two distinct partitions of a geographic space and identify a common set of latent factors underlying them. By defining the latent factors over the intersection of the two partitions, the model minimizes loss of information. Using simulated data constructed to mimic the spatial structure of our real data, we confirm the reliability of the model and demonstrate its superiority over competing ad hoc methods for dealing with misaligned data in spatial factor analysis. Finally, we construct an index of community social vulnerability for each census tract in Louisiana, a state prone to environmental disasters, which could be exacerbated by climate change, by applying the joint spatial factor analysis model to a set of misaligned social indicator data from the state. To demonstrate the utility of this index, we integrate it with Louisiana flood insurance claims data to identify communities that may be at particularly high risk during natural disasters, based on both social and geographic features.

Study focus: We investigate the potential impacts of climate change on precipitation, streamflow, and inland flooding in the NEUS during the mid-21st century. Dynamically downscaled climate projections from three global climate models for historical (1995-2004) and future (2045-2054) periods under business-as-usual scenarios were used to force the hydrologic model WRF-Hydro at 200-meter resolution and create ensemble hydrologic simulations. Additionally, an extreme value model was developed to project the risks associated with low-frequency hydrologic events. New hydrological insights for the region: Results from four major watersheds indicate a significantly wetter regime in winter months and potential drier conditions during late spring to early summer. Discharges in fall are projected to decrease in the northern watersheds and increase toward the south. Extreme flow and water depths resulting from extreme inland flooding are projected to increase by 5-20% and > 100%, respectively. The extent of the total flooded area is likely to be 20% greater by the mid-century. These increased risks can be attributed to (i) an approximate 25% increase in decadal mean and > 40% increase in decadal extreme precipitation intensity, (ii) up to 30% lower snow availability and 5-25% higher evapotranspiration throughout the year, and (iii) a projected 5% increase in soil moisture in all seasons except summer. Furthermore, rapid snow melting in winter will likely cause an earlier peak flow in the rivers.

These lakes modulate the freshwater ecosystem in the region but concurrently pose severe threats to the valley population by means of sudden glacial lake outbursts and consequent floods (GLOFs). The lack of high-resolution multi-temporal inventory of glacial lakes in TP hampers a better understanding and prediction of the future trend and risk of glacial lakes. Here, we created a multi-temporal inventory of glacial lakes in TP using a 30-year record of 42,833 satellite images (1990-2019), and we discussed their characteristics and spatio-temporal evolution over the years. Results showed that their number and area had increased by 3285 and 258.82 km(2) in the last 3 decades, respectively. We noticed that different regions of the TP exhibited varying change rates in glacial lake size; most regions show a trend of expansion and increase in glacial lakes, while some regions show a trend of decreasing such as the western Pamir and the eastern Hindu Kush. The mapping uncertainty is about 17.5%, which is lower than other available datasets, thus making our inventory reliable for the spatio-temporal evolution analysis of glacial lakes in the TP. Our lake inventory data are publicly published, it can help to study climate change-glacier-glacial lake-GLOF interactions in the Third Pole and serve as input to various hydro-climatic studies.

Projecting Flood Frequency Curves Under Near-Term Climate Change	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						design flood estimation; non-stationary flood frequency analysis; climate-informed flood projection; extremes in hydrology; climate change	RISK; PRECIPITATION; NONSTATIONARITY; STATIONARITY; STREAMFLOW; EXTREMES; INCREASE; TRENDS; CMIP5; DEAD	Flood-frequency curves, critical for water infrastructure design, are typically developed based on a stationary climate assumption. However, climate changes are expected to violate this assumption. Here, we propose a new, climate-informed methodology for estimating flood-frequency curves under non-stationary future climate conditions. The methodology develops an asynchronous, semiparametric local-likelihood regression (ASLLR) model that relates moments of annual maximum flood to climate variables using the generalized linear model. We estimate the first two marginal moments (MM) - the mean and variance - of the underlying log-Pearson Type-3 distribution from the ASLLR with the monthly rainfall and temperature as predictors. The proposed methodology, ASLLR-MM, is applied to 40 U.S. Geological Survey streamgages covering 18 water resources regions across the conterminous United States. A correction based on the aridity index was applied on the estimated variance, after which the ASLLR-MM approach was evaluated with both historical (1951-2005) and projected (2006-2035, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) monthly precipitation and temperature from eight Global Circulation Models (GCMs) consisting of 39 ensemble members. The estimated flood-frequency quantiles resulting from the ASLLR-MM and GCM members compare well with the flood-frequency quantiles estimated using the historical period of observed climate and flood information for humid basins, whereas the uncertainty in model estimates is higher in arid basins. Considering additional atmospheric and land-surface conditions and a multi-level model structure that includes other basins in a region could further improve the model performance in arid basins.

The End Point Rate for QGIS (EPR4Q) computes a coastline projection using the End Point Rate method. The Uncertainty Bathtub Model (uBTM) analyses the effects of sea-level rise through the uncertainty of sea-level projections and the vertical error of the Digital Elevation/Terrain Model. The Bruun Rule for Google Earth Engine Model (BRGM) predicts the position of the shoreline with sea-level rise, using topographic and bathymetric data from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Coastal Modeling System, respectively. Based on the regional projections of the Special Report on Climate Change and Oceans and Cryosphere of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the models were applied to a study case on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul-Brazil under different scenarios of sea-level rise expected by the end of this century. The results showed a maximum coastal retreat for the year 2100 of -502 m and -1727 m using EPR4Q and BRGM, respectively. The uBTM with Mapbiomas land use showed a maximum of 44.57 km(2) of urban area affected by sea-level flooding. This study highlights the feasibility of conducting coastal management analysis in GIS environment using non-commercial software. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Millions of people have to flee from droughts or floods either as cross-border refugees or as internally displaced persons (IDPs). The aim of this study was to identify knowledge status and gaps regarding public health consequences of large-scale displacement in these countries. After a scoping review, we conducted qualitative in-depth interviews during 2018 with 39 stakeholders from different disciplines and agencies in these three countries. A validation workshop was held with a selection of 13 interviewees and four project partners. Malnutrition and a lack of vaccination of displaced people are well-known challenges, while mental health problems and gender-based violence (GBV) are less visible to stakeholders. In particular, the needs of IDPs are not well understood. The treatment of mental health and GBV is insufficient, and IDPs have inadequate access to essential health services in refugee camps. Needs assessment and program evaluations with a patients' perspective are either lacking or inadequate in most situations. The Horn of Africa is facing chronic food insecurity, poor population health and mass displacement. IDPs are an underserved group, and mental health services are lacking. A development approach is necessary that moves beyond emergency responses to the building of long-term resilience, the provision of livelihood support and protection to reduce displacement by droughts.

The resulting floods killed over 400 people and displaced a million more. Here, a high resolution setup (4 km) of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used in conjunction with a hydrological model (WRF-Hydro, run at 125 m resolution) to explore the circumstances that caused the floods. In addition to a control experiment, two additional experiments are performed by perturbing the boundary conditions to simulate the event in pre-industrial and RCP8.5 background climates. Modelled rainfall closely matched observations over the study period, and it is found that this would this would have been about 18% heavier in the pre-industrial due to recent weakening of monsoon low-pressure systems, but would be 36% heavier in an RCP8.5 climate due to moistening of the tropical troposphere. Modelled river streamflow responds accordingly: it is shown the six major reservoirs that serve the state would have needed to have 34% more capacity to handle the heavy rainfall, and 43% had the deluge been amplified by an RCP8.5 climate. It is further shown that this future climate would have significantly extended the southern boundary of the flooding. Thus it is concluded that while climate change to date may well have mitigated the impacts of the flooding, future climate change would likely exacerbate them.	[Hunt, Kieran M.

Operating at multiple levels of governance, these organizations help manage the deleterious effects of changing climate for different sectors of human-environment systems. How they frame vulnerability, what influences their framings, why are their framings aligned or misaligned: while these are critical questions for managing vulnerability, they are often overlooked in the literature. By 'framing' we mean how actors understand and evaluate key factors of vulnerability. Through a case study in Bangladesh, we analyze how vulnerability is framed by the leading organizations across five sectors and three levels of governance. Drawing from key-informant interviews, we developed a spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach and identified vulnerability hotspots. With few variations, our study reveals that the Earnings of vulnerability are mostly aligned across scale irrespective at which stakeholders are operating. Collectively, proximity to river/sea along with poverty, schooling, cropping intensity, soil salinity, and availability of multipurpose disaster shelters are identified as key determinants of vulnerability by all organizations. They prioritize infrastructural and agricultural development as basis for vulnerability management. We argue that similarity of the understanding of vulnerability across scale would facilitate adaptation decision-making process. However, less focus on socio-economic criteria can undermine the success of adaptation initiatives. While the findings of this study can assist the decision-makers of Bangladesh in coastal vulnerability management, the methodological approach should be useful to assess coastal vulnerability in other parts of the world as well.

Here we use 30-year observed streamflow data (1991-2020) and numerical models to assess the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the Macquarie Marshes (the Marshes), a large floodplain wetland complex in the semi-arid region of New South Wales, Australia. A fast ecohydrologic emulator based on network linear programming with side constraints was developed to simulate the spatial and temporal responses of different wetland vegetation types to water regime. The emulator represents the wetland by a series of inter-connected level-pool reservoirs with the volume-discharge relationship obtained from a calibrated quasi-2d hydrodynamic model. The emulator reproduces daily flows and volume with good accuracy (Nash-Sutcliffe statistic ranging from 0.61 to 0.96) with 1/26,000 of the computational effort. We use the emulator to simulate the potential effects of climatic variability on vegetation by running the model over 30 years of observed data and 1000 statistically representative 30-year streamflow time series, which were generated using a stochastic model calibrated to the gauged flows. The collection of results for all 1000 contemporary simulations indicates the Marshes experience severe conditions 43% (+/- 18%) of the time in a 30year period. We then ran an additional 6000 simulations to assess the combined impacts of climate variability and future climate change at the end of the century. For the driest future climates (-60% and -30% reduction in runoff), the Marshes remain in severe condition 89% (+/- 6%) and 63% (+/- 16%) of the time, respectively, while no major differences with respect to the contemporary conditions were found for the wetter future. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying the extent and uncertainty in the degradation of these ecosystems due to climate variability and change for informing management decisions.

Regional atmosphere-ocean models are used to investigate the storm surge and coastal inundation that might be produced by a similar storm under the warmer ocean temperature and higher sea level projected for the future climate. Warming causes the storm to intensify, with the minimum sea level pressure decreasing from 955 mb during Isabel to similar to 950 mb in 2050 and similar to 940 mb in 2100. The stronger storm and higher mean sea level amplify the peak water level by similar to 0.5 m in 2050 and similar to 1.2 m in 2100. The total inundated area over Chesapeake Bay expands by 26% in 2050 and 47-62% in 2100. Over the rural Dorchester County, the inundated area shows moderate expansion in the future climate but the average inundation depth is 30% higher in 2050 and 50-70% higher in 2100. The number of houses flooded increases from 1420 during Hurricane Isabel to 1850/2190 in 2100 under the climate change scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5/8.5. The inundated area in Baltimore is 2.2 km(2) during Hurricane Isabel, expands to 5.1 km(2) in 2050, and reaches 8.1/9.1 km(2) in 2100 under RCP 4.5/8.5. The estimated flood damage to Baltimore increases from $29 million in 2003 to $98/100 million in 2050 and $150/162 million in 2100 under the median projection of RCP 4.5/8.5. These estimates are subjected to uncertainty due to different climate change scenarios and different climate model projections.

J	Barbi, PSR; Tavassoti, P; Tighe, S				Barbi, Paula Sutherland Rolim; Tavassoti, Pejoohan; Tighe, Susan			Enhanced Pavement Design and Analysis Framework to Improve the Resiliency of Flexible Airfield Pavements	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article						flexible airfield pavements; pavement design; climate change; cumulative damage factor; resilient pavements	DAMAGE	Changes in climatic conditions can directly affect pavement performance. However, accounting for environmental factors in airport pavement design remains a challenge since design methods such as FAA rigid and flexible iterative elastic layered design (FAARFIELD) do not consider moisture and temperature variation as input. Therefore, to address this research gap and improve the resilience of airport pavements, this research proposes a new methodology for the structural design of flexible airport pavements. The proposed methodology in this research was applied to a case study of an international airport in Canada, using actual field data. Five scenarios were evaluated including the current climate, temperature increase, lower matric suction, and two flooding events. The results of the proposed design method showed that the traditional FAARFIELD analysis can possibly overestimate fatigue damage, and underestimate rutting damage. The outcomes showed that climate change can increase pavement damage and shorten the service life from 7 to 14 years in the scenarios evaluated. It was also concluded that the lowering of the matric suction can result in the highest damage levels. Considering the implications of climate change on transportation infrastructure, the proposed methodology can contribute to designing more resilient airport pavements in the future, since it accounts for climate variations, temperature, and moisture changes, as well as extreme events such as flooding over the design life of flexible airport pavements.

Ice ranging in thickness from a few centimeters to 0.5 m occupied a large volume of the channel, forcing flows out of its banks. On two occasions, multiple consecutive days of uncharacteristically warm weather caused a spike in snowmelt, and bankfull stage was surpassed 60 days before peak runoff. The flow events occurred in late winter, six months after a wildfire had burned a large portion of the watershed at medium-to-high severity. Ash and other organic materials were mobilized during the overbank flows, and we observed evidence of recent ash deposition in the floodplain and high ash concentrations in the channel. During the same time period, camera footage captured the formation and collapse of a large accumulation of ice and snow at a log jam. Because climate change projections and recent observations indicate higher variability in weather patterns, wildfire regime, and precipitation events, winter flooding associated with ice, although not widely documented in small mountain streams, may become more common. Flooding and subsequent deposition of ash and other sediment can disrupt fluvial processes, impair the local biotic community, cause property damage, and impact drinking water sources.

Husn) is a staple crop of the Mediterranean countries, where more frequent waterlogging events are predicted due to climate change. However, few investigations have been conducted on the physiological and agronomic responses of this crop to waterlogging. The present study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of two waterlogging durations (i.e., 14 and 35 days) on two durum wheat cultivars (i.e., Svevo and Emilio Lepido). An integrated analysis of an array of physiological, biochemical, biometric, and yield parameters was performed at the end of the waterlogging events, during recovery, and at physiological maturity. Results established that effects on durum wheat varied depending on waterlogging duration. This stress imposed at tillering impaired photosynthetic activity of leaves and determined oxidative injury of the roots. The physiological damages could not be fully recovered, subsequently slowing down tiller formation and crop growth, and depressing the final grain yield. Furthermore, differences in waterlogging tolerance between cultivars were discovered. Our results demonstrate that in durum wheat, the energy maintenance, the cytosolic ion homeostasis, and the ROS control and detoxification can be useful physiological and biochemical parameters to consider for the waterlogging tolerance of genotypes, with regard to sustaining biomass production and grain yield.

Though the implications of climate impacts for health and wellbeing are well documented, to date, adaptations are largely evaluated by financial cost and their effectiveness in reducing risk. Looking across different forms of adaptation to floods, we use existing literature to develop a typology of key domains of impact arising from interventions that are likely to shape health and wellbeing. We suggest that this typology can be used to assess the health consequences of adaptation interventions more generally and argue that such forms of evaluation will better support the development of sustainable adaptation planning.

J	Somani, R				Somani, Rozina			Global Warming in Pakistan and Its Impact on Public Health as Viewed Through a Health Equity Lens	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES			English	Article						global warming; Pakistan; public health; flooding; climate justice; global health		Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. The recent monsoon season caused widespread, deadly flooding, affecting 15% of the total population when extreme heat waves were followed by the worst rains and floods in the country's history. But Pakistan was not the cause of its own misfortune. The atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the greatest contributor to climate change. If we look at the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we find that Pakistan is, like all developing nations, essentially a non-contributor of the problem, contributing considerably less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, although significant factors exacerbating the effects of climate change in Pakistan include an inadequate sewage system, air pollution from industrial waste, and deforestation, the country could not afford to proactively fix these, nor prepare for flooding and heavy rains. It lacks the funding for climate resilience efforts. As a result, Pakistan is suffering from a high prevalence of poor health outcomes. Children, the elderly, women, and the homeless, especially those living with poverty and disease, are at a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Since mitigating the devastating effects of climate change will continue to be an ongoing challenge for Pakistan, it urgently needs financial investment so that it can build climate-resilient infrastructures and institute mechanisms to deal with global warming's worst effects. Industrialized nations are responsible for global warming, and they must take responsibility for fighting global warming by helping developing countries cultivate greater public health emergency preparedness.

The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of flood risk in the Petite Nation River watershed, located in southern Quebec, Canada. A survey was conducted with 130 residents living on a floodplain in this river watershed, which had been affected by floods in the spring of 2017. Participants were asked about different aspects related to flood risk, such as the flood hazard experience, the physical changes occurring in the environment, climate change, information accessibility, flood risk governance, adaptation measures, and finally the perception of losses. An analysis of these factors provided perspectives for improving flood risk communication and increasing the public awareness of flood risk. The results indicated that the analyzed aspects are potentially important in terms of risk perception and showed that the flood risk perceptions varied for each aspect analyzed. In general, the information regarding flood risk management is available and generally understandable, and the level of confidence was good towards most authorities. However, the experiences of flood risk and the consequences of climate change on floods were not clear among the respondents. Regarding the adaptation measures, the majority of participants tended to consider non-structural adaptation measures as being more relevant than structural ones. Moreover, the long-term consequences of flooding on property values are of highest concern. These results provide a snapshot of citizens' risk perceptions and their opinions on topics that are directly related to such risks.

Two primary climatic drivers of ecosystem structure and function in Australia are fire and aridity, to which Australian flora and fauna have shown marked adaptability. Australian vegetation shows resilience to climate extremes of flooding rains, droughts and heatwaves such that variability in primary productivity of Australian vegetation has a tangible effect on the global carbon cycle. Nonetheless, Australian flora and ecosystems could be vulnerable to projected climate change (e.g. to increasing vapour pressure deficit). Refugia are also vulnerable to climate change, with conditions in these areas already near the tipping point for a change in community composition. Ensuring genetic diversity during directional change in climate (e.g. increasing aridity) requires proactive approaches to conservation and restoration projects. To address these challenges, TERN provides environmental RI at three scales of observation: (i) environmental monitoring using remote sensing techniques at a landscape and continental scale; (ii) a spatially extensive network of ecosystem monitoring plots; and (iii) intensely measured sites collecting detailed data on ecosystem processes. Through partnerships with international environmental RIs, TERN enables research that addresses global challenges, on the first steps toward the forecasting of ecosystem-climate interactions.

Effective climate change adaptation requires that we acknowledge this complexity. Theoretical literature on sustainability transitions has highlighted this and called for deeper acknowledgment of systems complexity in our research practices. Are we heeding these calls for systems' research? We used hydrohazards (floods and droughts) as an example research area to explore this question. We first distilled existing challenges for complex human-nature systems into six central concepts: Uncertainty, multiple spatial scales, multiple time scales, multimethod approaches, human-nature dimensions, and interactions. We then performed a systematic assessment of 737 articles to examine patterns in what methods are used and how these cover the complexity concepts. In general, results showed that many papers do not reference any of the complexity concepts, and no existing approach addresses all six. We used the detailed results to guide advancement from theoretical calls for action to specific next steps. Future research priorities include the development of methods for consideration of multiple hazards; for the study of interactions, particularly in linking the short- to medium-term time scales; to reduce data-intensivity; and to better integrate bottom-up and top-down approaches in a way that connects local context with higher-level decision-making. Overall this paper serves to build a shared conceptualisation of human-nature system complexity, map current practice, and navigate a complexity-smart trajectory for future research.

There have been many debates about implementing resilience thinking that allow cities and communities to prepare for possible stresses and shocks. Although there are sets of frameworks aimed at building inclusive resilience strategies fostering participation and engagement, there is limited resilience-related literature on how to conceptualize participation. Through an extensive review of various kinds of publications on resilience, policy documents, and case studies, which emphasize the concepts of participation, coordination, and co-creation, this review explores and investigates how citizen participation is discussed and applied in the context of participatory resilience. We conclude that participatory approaches possess a great potential to enhance multistakeholder cooperation, social innovation, and capacity building for resilience. Realization of the potential of participatory resilience will remain limited, however, unless participation strategies and frameworks are made more transparent, inclusive, and context-sensitive.

As a critical flood control measure, passive urban blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is incapable of effectively utilizing available storage capacity to mitigate peak flows during cloudburst events. At storm peak times, landscape-based BGI may overflow to the drainage system, contributing to downstream flooding risks. To alleviate the effect, this research investigated an adaptive RTC solution that would predischarge the BGI and initiate runoff detention during the most vulnerable period of peak intensity. A case study of a RTC-enhanced landscape detention basin in Tongzhou, Beijing, was conducted using 2D1D modeling. To minimize peak-time overflow under extreme conditions, the studied smart BGI equipped with sensors and electronically movable gates was actuated by both rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms. Modeling results indicate that the proposed predictive solutions reduced catchment peak outflow by 7.6% to 45.1% over the passive system during three historical cloudburst events. This proposal proves that similar RTC applications could be scaled up to additional landscape projects to increase urban sustainability towards climate change and extreme precipitation.

J	Moulton, H; Carey, M				Moulton, Holly; Carey, Mark			Futuremaking in a disaster zone: Everyday climate change adaptation amongst Quechua women in the Peruvian Cordillera Blanca	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Futuremaking; Everyday adaptations; Capabilities; Glaciers; Andes; Quechua	SITUATED KNOWLEDGES; POLITICS; GENDER; JUSTICE; VULNERABILITY; CAPABILITIES; PLACE; WATER	The Peruvian Andes has experienced widely publicized, climate change induced glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which increasingly threaten the lives of thousands of the region's residents. However, the everyday adaptations of the most historically marginalized populations in the Andes-often Quechua women in highland communities-are frequently obscured by a singular focus on glacier and water management to prevent highimpact but infrequent GLOFs. This focus on glacier hazards downplays and renders invisible the ways that Quechua women actually adapt to climate change by labeling them 'highly vulnerable' despite a limited understanding of their daily lives. Through a case study in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this article advances a feminist framework of everyday adaptation called 'futuremaking' that challenges the current ice-andwater-focused paradigm of adaptation policy in glaciated regions. We draw on interviews with Quechua women, participant observation on adaptation planning teams, and informal expert interviews to advance the futuremaking framework, which prioritizes the everyday and future desires of women and households over technical adaptations that view people as vulnerable. Futuremaking is a feminist process of everyday adaptation in a disaster zone that relies on A) Prioritizing the everyday over the someday; B) Intergenerational well-being and community networks of care, and; C) Dynamic and embodied adaptations to uncertainty. We argue that futuremaking both challenges the efficacy of adaptation projects currently underway in the Andes and charts a path towards more transformative adaptation interventions by prioritizing capabilities and feminist networks of care over managing damage and disaster.

Revisiting hydro-ecological impacts of climate change on a restored floodplain wetland via hydrological/hydraulic modelling and the UK Climate Projections 2018 scenarios	WETLANDS			English	Article						Climate change; floodplain; MIKE SHE; UKCP18; Aeration stress	LOWLAND WET GRASSLAND; RIVER FLOW; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; RE-CREATION; MIKE SHE; LAND-USE; RESTORATION; PLANT; RIPARIAN	The hydro-ecological impacts of 40 UK Climate Projections 2018 scenarios on a restored lowland England river floodplain are assessed using a MIKE SHE / MIKE 11 model. Annual precipitation declines for 60% of scenarios (range: -26%-21%, with small, <5%, declines for the central probability level). Potential evapotranspiration increases for all probability levels except the most extreme, very unlikely, 10% level (range: -4%-43%, central probability 9%-20%) Mean, peak and low river discharges are reduced for all but the extreme 90% probability level. Reduced frequency of bankfull discharge dominates (at least halved for the central probability level). Floodplain inundation declines for over 97% of 320 scenario-events. Winter water table levels still intercept the surface, while mean and summer low levels are reduced. Declines in mean summer floodplain water table levels for the central probability level (0.22 m and 0.28 m for the 2050s and 2080s, respectively) are twice as large as those in the more dynamic riparian area. Declines reach 0.39 m for some 10% probability level scenarios. Simulated hydrological changes differ subtly from a previous assessment using earlier UK climate projections. A soil aeration stress index demonstrates that, under baseline conditions, prolonged high winter floodplain water tables drive long periods of low root-zone oxygen, in turn favouring vegetation communities adapted to waterlogged conditions. Climate change reduces aeration stress and the extent of appropriate conditions for these plant communities in favour of communities less tolerant of wet conditions.

The pandemic-environment linkage also includes circumstances when regions experienced extreme weather events, such as floods and cyclones, and disaster management became challenging. This study aims to examine the trends in public discourses on Twitter on these interactions between the pandemic and environment. The present study follows the most recent literature on understanding public perceptions - which acknowledges Twitter to be an abundant source of information on public discussions on any global issue, including the pandemic. A Python-based code is developed to extract Twitter data spanning over a year, and analyze the presence of covid-environment related keywords and other attributes. It is found that the Twitterati aggressively viewed the impacts (such as economic slowdown and high mortality) of the pandemic as miniatures of the results of future climate change. The community was also highly concerned about the varying air and plastic pollution levels with the change in lockdown and covid prevention policies. Extreme weather events were a high-frequency topic when they impacted countries such as India, the USA, Australia, the Philippines and Vietnam. This study makes a novel attempt to provide an overview of public discourses on the pandemic-environment linkage and; can be a crucial addition to the literature on assessing public perception of environmental threats through Twitter data mining.

Coastal lagoons are amongst the most vulnerable habitats, and they are undergoing extensive human impact due to their high production rates and the close proximity of urban and agricultural centers. The Mar Menor, the largest saltwater lagoon in Europe, is an example of a highly impacted ecosystem. In December 2016 and September 2019, climate change-induced DANA (upper-level isolated atmospheric depression) flooding events took place there, temporarily altering the lagoon oceanographic properties. Data gathered throughout the lagoon (11 stations inside and 1 outside the lagoon) from 2016 to 2021 were analyzed in order to assess the variability of seawater parameters: salinity, density, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen, due to DANA events. Results showed a change in seawater parameters that were reestablished at different rates, 4 and 10 months in 2016 and 2019, respectively, following a description of the environmental conditions and effects that have been reported after extreme rainfall in the lagoon. The amount of rainfall correlated with changes in the analyzed seawater parameters, such as an increase in turbidity and chlorophyll-a values. Furthermore, turbidity correlated with chlorophyll-a and oxygen saturation, while density correlated with salinity. Such extreme weather events are worsened by climate change, growing more frequent and between shorter intervals in time. In order to decelerate ecosystem decline, comprehensive management plans are needed to address the various factors that might add to anthropic impacts in natural environments.

A Framework for Cloud to Coast Adaptation: Maturity and Experiences from across the North Sea	LAND			English	Article						climate change adaptation; coastal protection; flood risk management; maturity analysis; resilience; sustainable development; systems approach	WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; PATHWAYS; CAPABILITY	The low-lying coastal areas of the countries around the North Sea are exposed to flooding and the influence of sea level rise. The countries in the North Sea Region need to continue to adapt if the associated risk is to be well-managed into the future. In addition to reducing flood risk, adaptation measures can bring development opportunities for those same places. These opportunities, however, are unlikely to be achieved through a 'defence only' paradigm, and instead a new approach is needed that simultaneously reduces risk and promotes liveable places, ecosystem health and social well-being. The building blocks of this new approach are promoted here and are based on an adaptation process that is collaborative and takes a whole-system, long-term perspective. The approach developed through the Interreg funded project, C5a, brings together governments, practitioners and researchers from across the North Sea to share policies, practices and the emerging science of climate change adaptation and enabling sustainable development. The new approach reflects a Cloud to Coast management paradigm and emerged through a combination of knowledge exchange and peer-to-peer learning across seven case studies. Central to the case studies was a maturity analysis of existing capabilities across the North Sea countries and their ability to adopt the new approach. This paper presents the results of this analysis, including the common challenges that emerged and the methods and examples of good practice to overcome them. Building upon these findings, the paper concludes by presenting four priority policy directions to support the uptake of the Cloud to Coast approach.

Four river basins of Southeast Asia were selected for the study. They included the Pampanga River Basin (PRB) in the Philippines, the Solo River Basin (SRB) in Indonesia, the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB) in Cambodia and Vietnam, and the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPRB) in Thailand. Flood damage to rice crops was assessed by flood damage functions considering flood depth and duration and the growth stage of rice plants. Flood characteristics such as flood depth, duration, and distribution were computed using the rainfall-runoff-inundation model to assess flood hazards under the present and future climatic conditions produced by MRI-AGCM3.2S. The damage assessment methodology for rice crops employed in this study was verified using data on past flood events. Then, flood damage assessment was conducted for both the present climate (1979-2003) and future climate (2075-2099) conditions, using MRI-AGCM3.2S precipitation datasets. Flood damage was assessed for worst cases chosen from each climate period and for floods of 50- and 100-year return periods with different rainfall patterns chosen from each climate scenario. The results of flood hazard and damage assessment show that the flood inundation area for a 100-year flood may increase in the future by 20% in PRB; by 66% in SRB; by 27% in LMRB; and by 27% in CPRB. The flood damage area of paddy fields for a 100-year flood may also increase in the future by 16% in PRB; by 55% in SRB; by 23% in LMRB; and by 13% in CPRB.

So, the study attempts to provide fully insight into water-related risks in present and near-future using an ensemble of CMIP6 models in combination with the methods of risk and GIS-based analysis on a provincial scale of Vietnam. The results show a dominant of floods and cyclone hazards, followed by droughts, landslides and seawater intrusion observed in present. Meanwhile, under climate change scenario of SSP3-7.0 in near-future (2021-2040), an expected decreasing in precipitation by -13.6% for provinces in the north of Vietnam is illustrated. Most importantly, in spring and summer, maximum temperature can increase faster than those in autumn, winter and annual. Dealing with water-related risks, it is expected that there are 6 out of 63 provinces at very high risk level.

It is not known if synchrony and asynchrony of ecological and physical processes such as flood disturbance and plant phenology may similarly be affected by climate change. Here, by spatially merging temperature and flood peak data, we show for the first time that in Central and Eastern Europe, annual river flood peaks increasingly occur within the thermal growing season. This is due to the combined effect of earlier spring onsets and later flood peaks. Such increased physical-phenological synchrony may especially impact river biogeomorphology and riparian floodplain ecosystem functioning through uprooting of seedlings and increased hydraulic roughness during major flood events.

To prevent disasters and minimize loss of life and economic harm, government agencies have started implementing large-scale projects; however, budgetary constraints and overly optimistic designs have prevented the desired results. This study aims to prove that flood adaptation models using small-scale technologies can ameliorate the impact of torrential rainfall events. A new hydrology analysis model was applied to a district in Seoul, Korea that is prone to frequent floods. The results were encouraging and indicated the effectiveness of careful planning and urban design.

Considering hydric systems in integrated spatial planning will be crucial in mitigating, adapting, and reversing climate change's catastrophic effects. This paper focuses on fluvial restoration as part of urban and territorial regulatory frameworks in the Andalien River and the city of Concepcion in Chile. We consider three work scales: (i) basin, (ii) river reaches which focus on the city-river interplay, and (iii) site-specific, deepening the discussion around the last two. The objective is to elaborate an interdisciplinary dialogue between urban design, fluvial dynamics, and the Chilean regulatory framework where property rights play a predominant role in the management of natural resources (water and land). In this regard, the 'New Latin American Constitutionalism' offers concrete possibilities to operationalize an emerging paradigm that recognizes legal personhood for Nature. The incorporation of an ecological function to property rights emerges as a new way in which the principles of resilient urban development can be applied in order to combine river dynamics and urban growth.

More recently, climate change is steadily increasing stress on aging traditional, gray infrastructure. Recent trends in river management present an opportunity to address both the ecological degradation and climate stress. A strategic focus on riverscapes as critical natural infrastructure can serve as ecosystem-based adaptation to improve resilience to climate change and restore river ecosystem health. As traditional, gray infrastructure ages and fails under increasing climate stress, there is opportunity to rebuild with improved understanding of the value of the ecosystem services that healthy riverscapes provide. River valley bottoms, including source-water wetlands and riverscape floodplains, are the critical natural infrastructure areas deserving of protection and restoration to build resilience to increased frequency and severity of fires, floods and droughts associated with climate change. Since healthy riverscapes need space and water, the long-standing focus on restoring natural flow regimes makes sense. Equally crucial to restoring river health is to give rivers space and freedom to exercise (i.e., flood and adjust their channels).

One such event is the formation of a landscape scar at Zonag Lake caused by a climate change-induced outburst flooding event that occurred on 15 September 2011. During the winter, the scar region became a new birthplace for sandstorms, and since the flooding, remote sensing monitoring shows that between 2011 and 2020, there were 285 sandstorm days (between November and March), relative to none prior. The outburst flooding event and consequential sandstorms threaten the key lambing area of the Tibetan antelope (Chiru), affect the water balance of the Zonag Lake and downstream lakes, and may even impact on the flow in the Yangtze River. Active human intervention may be needed to repair this new desert spit and reverse the slew of consequences which may otherwise lead to significant population declines in one of the major Chiru breeding grounds due to the progressive loss of vegetation productivity across their main breeding area.

Large-scale climate elements need to be downscaled to the regional level for hydrologic applications. Here, a new Nonhomogeneous Hidden Markov Model (NHMM) called the Bayesian-NHMM is presented for downscaling and predicting of multisite daily rainfall during rainy season over the Huaihe River Basin (HRB). The Bayesian-NHMM provides a Bayesian method for parameters estimation. The model avoids the risk to have no solutions for parameter estimation, which often occurs in the traditional NHMM that uses point estimates of parameters. The Bayesian-NHMM accurately captures seasonality and interannual variability of rainfall amount and wet days during the rainy season. The model establishes a link between large-scale meteorological characteristics and local precipitation patterns. It also provides a more stable and efficient method to estimate parameters in the model. These results suggest that prediction of daily precipitation could be improved by the suggested new Bayesian-NHMM method, which can be helpful for water resources management and research on climate change.

This is especially problematic for climate change adaptation that relies on actions at various scales: from governments to individuals. Empirical evidence on individual adaptation to climate-induced hazards reveals diverse behavioral and social factors affecting economic considerations. Yet, implications of replacing the rational optimizer by realistic human behavior in nature-society systems models are poorly understood. Using an innovative evolutionary economic agent-based model we explore different framings regarding household adaptation behavior to floods, leveraging on behavioral data from a household survey in Miami, USA. We find that a representative rational agent significantly overestimates household adaptation diffusion and underestimates damages compared to boundedly rational behavior revealed from our survey. This "adaptation deficit" exhibited by a population of empirically informed agents is explained primarily by diverse "soft" adaptation constraints-awareness, social influences-rather than heterogeneity in financial constraints. Besides initial inequality disproportionally impacting low/medium adaptive capacity households post-flood, our findings suggest that even under a nearly complete adaptation diffusion, adaptation benefits are uneven, with late or less-efficient actions locking households to a path of higher damages, further exacerbating inequalities. Our exploratory modeling reveals that behavioral assumptions shape the uncertainty of physical factors, like exposure and objective effectiveness of flood-proofing measures, traditionally considered crucial in risk assessments. This unique combination of methods facilitates the assessment of cumulative and distributional effects of boundedly rational behavior essential for designing tailored climate adaptation policies, and for equitable sustainability transitions in general.

J	Thampanishvong, K; Limmeechokchai, B				Thampanishvong, Kannika; Limmeechokchai, Bundit			Reviews of Low Carbon Scenarios, Carbon Neutrality, and Net Zero Emissions in Thailand: Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Macroeconomy	ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS			English	Article							TRANSPORT SECTOR; CO2 MITIGATION	Long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns result in global climate change. Human activities that burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas have been identified as the main driver of climate change. The extreme weather events, especially floods and droughts, have already caused severe economic impacts. These impacts will continue to intensify unless transformative and holistic adaptations are put in place. The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) aims at keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve the targets, balancing between anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks needs strong efforts and long-term low emissions development strategies of the participating countries. Thailand's long-term low GHG emissions development strategy (LT-LEDS) submitted to UNFCCC in 2022 included national adaptation and economy-wide GHG mitigation in the energy, industrial processes and product use, waste, agriculture and land use, land-use change and forestry sectors, and international supports needed to meet the net zero emissions targets. Thus, this paper reviews several low-carbon development strategies in Thailand to meet the targets of carbon neutrality and net zero emissions. The impacts of LT-LEDS include GHG emissions reduction and the macroeconomic impacts. Results of several low-carbon development strategies in Thailand show that achieving the nationwide carbon neutrality and net zero GHG emissions is possible; but all feasible options and measures need to be implemented immediately.

Considering the regional urgency, there is an immense need to find more equitable solutions for water management. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the climatic factors impacting the hydrological regime in North America, including changes in surface runoff, groundwater storage, and the forested watershed, based on current trends and future projection scenarios. Moreover, this paper critically overviews need-based solutions for effective water management at a regional scale. The study shows that many areas of North America are exposed to extreme events such as prolonged droughts, devastating floods, wildfires, and altering precipitation patterns. Consequently, these changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts on water resources, leading to water supply deficiencies and influencing water flows and quality in the Southwestern United States, prairie provinces in Canada, and Mexico. The projection of warming around the region experiences spatial and seasonal variations because of the diversity in climatic conditions. Overall, in North America, winter is expected to warm more than other seasons causing earlier runoff and a decline in snowmelt. Given the physical and economic constraints that limit the development of new utilities, emphasis should be placed on strengthening nature-based solutions such as green infrastructure. Thus, the findings suggest an integrated water resource management approach is required, along with climate-induced innovative technologies, to secure the water resources while preparing for the forecasted challenges of tomorrow.

Climate related changes to flood regimes show an increasing rainfall influence	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Floods; Shifting flood regimes; Climate change; Flood frequency analysis	TRENDS; MAGNITUDE; RIVER; STREAMFLOW; FREQUENCY; IDENTIFICATION; VARIABILITY; EVENTS; BASIN; PEAKS	Climate change can result in changes to floods and flood regimes, but the relationship between floods and climate change is complex and poorly understood. The flood regime influences the nature, severity, and timing of flood events for any watershed. Flood regimes should be viewed as a continuum with completely nival (snowmelt-driven) watersheds at one end of the continuum and purely pluvial (rainfall-driven) watersheds at the other. Flood regimes are important for the operation of flood defenses and to better understand how changes in the flood regime can affect the magnitude of flood events. Data from 46 long term streamflow gauging stations from reference hydrologic networks (RHNs) in Canada (23) and the US (23), are examined to detect changes that have occurred, or are continuing to occur, in flood regimes from watersheds responding only to climate variations and changes. Peaks over Threshold (POT) flood events are used to investigate changes in the timing of flood events. Seasonality measures, using circular statistics, illustrate changes in the nature of the flood regime based on changes in the timing and regularity of flood threshold exceedences. A nival fraction is determined for each watershed and for each year based on a clustering of the flood events into two groups, representing nival and pluvial events. Changes to the flood regime over time, and based on annual temperature, are determined from logistic regression of the number of nival and pluvial events for each year. While strongly nival watersheds show no changes, roughly 15% of the stations exhibit significant changes that represent shifts towards the pluvial end of the flood regime continuum, which has implications for design flood estimation and the operation of flood control infrastructure.

GlacierNet2: A hybrid Multi-Model learning architecture for alpine glacier mapping	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION			English	Article						Glacier mapping; Alpine glacier; Debris-covered; Snow-covered; Remote sensing; GlacierNet; Deep-learning; Convolutional neural network; Boundary delineation	DEBRIS-COVERED GLACIERS; SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MASS CHANGES; SUPRAGLACIAL DEBRIS; CENTRAL HIMALAYA; CHALLENGES; MOUNTAINS; INVENTORY; RETREAT	In recent decades, climate change has significantly affected glacier dynamics, resulting in mass loss and an increased risk of glacier-related hazards including supraglacial and proglacial lake development, as well as catastrophic outburst flooding. Rapidly changing conditions dictate the need for continuous and detailed ob-servations and analysis of climate-glacier dynamics. Thematic and quantitative information regarding glacier geometry is fundamental for understanding climate forcing and the sensitivity of glaciers to climate change, however, accurately mapping debris-cover glaciers (DCGs) is notoriously difficult based upon the use of spectral information and conventional machine-learning techniques. The objective of this research is to improve upon an earlier proposed deep-learning-based approach, GlacierNet, which was developed to exploit a convolutional neural-network segmentation model to accurately outline regional DCG ablation zones. Specifically, we devel-oped an enhanced GlacierNet2 architecture that incorporates multiple models, automatic post-processing, and basin-level hydrological flow techniques to improve the mapping of DCGs such that it includes both the ablation and accumulation zones. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GlacierNet2 improves the estimation of the ablation zone and allows a high level of intersection over union (IOU: 0.8839) score, which is higher than the GlacierNet (IOU: 0.8599). The proposed architecture provides complete glacier (both accumulation and ablation zone) outlines at regional scales, with an overall IOU score of 0.8619. This is a crucial first step in automating complete glacier mapping that can be used for accurate glacier modeling or mass-balance analysis.

Vulnerable regions to such disturbances have been widely studied in some areas, but considerably less is known about other vulnerable regions that are key to global climatic regulation, such as Amazonia. In terms of the human dimensions of climate impacts, rural and indigenous communities in developing regions are among the most vulnerable due to their limited economic capital and direct reliance on natural resources. The purpose of this research was to reveal local perceptions about the impacts of, and adaptations to, recent climatic and associated hydrological changes caused by extreme events in the Brazilian Amazon. We worked in severely impacted rural Amazonian riverine communities utilizing a qualitative case study approach that included interviews, observation while living in the community, and participatory mapping. Our results indicate that participants perceived that there has been an increased occurrence and intensity of hydroclimatic events in the last decade, especially extreme floods. Findings also show that the repeated occurrence of extreme floods resulted in severe impacts, including some that had never been experienced by the local communities, such as the complete loss of perennials. We found that a wide range of locally devised responses was implemented, despite incipient governmental support. Data also showed that responses have evolved significantly over time due to local experience with repeated extreme events. A variety of factors also affected participants' abilities to respond to hydroclimatic changes, notably information exchange among farmers and access to technological advancements.

Moreover, this ecosystem type was frequently affected by river regulation, leading to groundwater table lowering; however, river revitalization has, in some locations, achieved some restoration of groundwater levels. In this study, we investigated the growth-climate sensitivity and growth modulation after groundwater-level manipulation for Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. and Quercus robur L. in one of the most important floodplain forest complexes in Central Europe. We constructed three different types of tree ring chronologies to reflect the high frequency variability, medium-low frequency variability, and basal area increment. We found F. angustifolia to be more sensitive than Q. robur to both drought and groundwater level fluctuations. Moreover, F. angustifolia showed more pronounced short-term and long-term growth decreases after artificial ground water level alteration than did Q. robur. We also found that the groundwater level increase due to river revitalization reduced the climate sensitivity for both F. angustifolia and Q. robur. The decrease in climate sensitivity associated with revitalization was more pronounced for F. angustifolia which, moreover, showed a greater basal growth after river revitalization. Our results suggest that F. angustifolia will be more threatened than Q. robur by the diminution in groundwater availability and increase in drought with ongoing climate change. They also show that river revitalization can be a suitable management tool to help the adaptation to climate change.

Climate change exacerbates the uncertainties of flash flood risk worldwide. Tourist attractions are particularly vulnerable to flash floods. In this study, precipitation-driven changes in flash flood occurrence are projected for the Nanshan Scenic Zone (NSZ), a famous scenic spot with approximately 6 million annual visitors in China. Historical hourly precipitation series (1991-2012) set a baseline, and future hourly precipitation series for 13 selected general circulation models (GCMs) and the multi-model mean (MME) during 2020-2049 and 2070-2099 under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 emission scenario are simulated by a stochastic downscaling hourly weather generator. A cumulative event rainfall and rainfall duration (E-D) threshold is used to detect flash flood events in historical and future periods. All 13 GCMs project a unanimous increase in flash flood occurrence for both future periods. MME annual flash flood occurrence is projected to increase by 72% and 78% during 2020-2049 and 2070-2099, respectively. The range projected by 13 GCMs is 22% 111% and 39% 117%, respectively. The MME projections indicate that variations of no less than 50% occur in both future periods in March, April, July, October and November. Variation in extreme heavy precipitation (similar to 40%) is much greater than variation in mean precipitation (similar to 10%) in the NSZ. The increase in flash flood occurrence might be attributed to the increase in the total amount of extreme heavy precipitation. Flood managers and stake-holders in the NSZ should adopt adaptation and risk reduction measures since the months with the largest increase in flash flood occurrence coincide with the peak tourist season.

Effects of water level alteration on carbon cycling in peatlands	ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						Peatlands; carbon cycling; climate change; anthropogenic disturbance; water level	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; GREENHOUSE-GAS BALANCES; PLANT FUNCTIONAL-GROUP; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PEAT SWAMP FOREST; LAND-USE CHANGE; METHANE EMISSIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO2 EXCHANGE; SHORT-TERM	Globally, peatlands play an important role in the carbon (C) cycle. High water level is a key factor in maintaining C storage in peatlands, but water levels are vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. This review examines literature related to the effects of water level alteration on C cycling in peatlands to summarize new ideas and uncertainties emerging in this field. Peatland ecosystems maintain their function by altering plant community structure to adapt to changing water levels. Regarding primary production, woody plants are more productive in unflooded, well-aerated conditions, whileSphagnummosses are more productive in wetter conditions. The responses of sedges to water level alteration are species-specific. While peat decomposition is faster in unflooded, well aerated conditions, increased plant production may counteract the C loss induced by increased ecosystem respiration (ER) for a period of time. In contrast, rising water table maintains anaerobic conditions and enhances the role of the peatland as a C sink. Nevertheless, changes in DOC flux during water level fluctuation is complicated and depends on the interactions of flooding with environment. Notably, vegetation also plays a role in C flux but particular species vary in their ability to sequester and transport C. Bog ecosystems have a greater resilience to water level alteration than fens, due to differences in biogeochemical responses to hydrology. The full understanding of the role of peatlands in global C cycling deserves much more study due to uncertainties of vegetation feedbacks, peat-water interactions, microbial mediation of vegetation, wildfire, and functional responses after hydrologic restoration.

These perceptions, norms, and practices are disturbed by coupled environment-development externalities. This study employs the Vietnamese Mekong floodplains as an exemplary case to illustrate how floods impact agrarian communities and how they have experienced flood alterations driven by hydropower development and climate change in recent years. Drawing on thematic and narrative analyses of qualitative data (focus group discussions and interviews) collected in three agrarian communities in the Vietnamese Mekong floodplains, sources drawn from various news outlets, and academic materials, we argue that disrupted flood environments in the floodplains have triggered affective flood reminiscences, catalysing shifts to incremental and transformative adaptation to achieve resilience. We build a nuanced understanding of how social memory helps to enhance human-environment relationships in response to highly complex hydrological dynamics in the delta.

Quantification of historical land use is therefore critical for assessing the degree of human impact and requires integration of geography, ecology and history. This paper examines the impact of climate change, land-use and exposure to international markets on the terrestrial ecology in Suoursveit, in southeast Iceland between AD 1700 and 1901. For this we use historical data concerning land-use, livestock and demography, and mapping of glacier advance, glacier outburst floods (jokulhlaups) and agricultural land. Change in land-use or population during the eighteenth century was insignificant. Population declined in the first two decades of the nineteenth century due to the advance of Breioamerkurjokull glacier. After AD 1820, Suoursveit became part of international market for agricultural products, which facilitated population and livestock increase. This led to overgrazing and severe land degradation in the nineteenth century.

Fluvial system structure is presented in the first section of the paper along with permafrost controls over its functioning, which vary across fluvial system compartments. The distinction is drawn between primarily fluvial landforms that are expected to adjust to future hydrology with less permafrost constraints, and primarily cryogenic landforms evolving in line with permafrost disturbances. The influence of permafrost on fluvial action varies across compartments: on hillslopes, permafrost mostly controls the occurrence of surface runoff, in river valleys and channels, sediment erodibility, while thermal interaction is essential for growing thermo-erosional gullies. Observed and projected changes in permafrost and hydrology are outlined, and their relevance for cryo-fluvial evolution of fluvial systems is reviewed. Based on these projections, future changes in fluvial action in each compartment are discussed. On hillslopes, where permafrost exerts important controls on hillslope hydrology, fluvial activity of overland flow is expected to decrease following the active layer deepening and decreased overland flow duration. In erosional networks, controlled by thermal interaction between runoff and permafrost terrain, higher water temperature is expected to increase the occurrence and rates of thermo-erosional gully development. In river valleys and channels, where permafrost controls the erodibility of bed and bank material, the expected fluvial feedbacks vary across scales and stream orders, and include changes in seasonality of channel deformations, increased retreat rates in lower river banks and decreased, in higher banks, along with floodplain subsidence, and minor potential for complete destabilization of existing channel patterns. Future collateral effects of fluvial change include alterations of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and societal impact that must be accounted for in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

This flood pulse and its long-term dynamics under the Mekong River basin's (MRB) fast socio-economic development and climate change need to be identified and understood. However, existing studies fall short of sufficient time coverage or concentrate only on changes in water level (WL) that is only one of the critical flood pulse parameters influencing the flood pulse ecosystem productivity. Considering the rapidly changing hydroclimatic conditions in the Mekong basin, it is crucial to systematically analyse the changes in multiple key flood pulse parameters. Here, we aim to do that by using observed WL data for 1960-2019 accompanied with several parameters derived from a Digital Bathymetry Model. Results show significant declines of WL and inundation area from the late 1990s in the dry season and for the whole year, on top of increased subdecadal variability. Decreasing (increasing) probabilities of high (low) inundation area for 2000-2019 have been found, in comparison to the return period of inundation area for 1986-2000 (1960-1986). The mean seasonal cycle of daily WL in dry (wet) season for 2000-2019, compared to that for 1986-2000, has shifted by 10 (5) days. Significant correlations and coherence changes between the WL and large-scale circulations (i.e., El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)), indicate that the atmospheric circulations could have influenced the flood pulse in different time scales. Also, the changes in discharge at the Mekong mainstream suggest that anthropogenic drivers may have impacted the high water levels in the lake. Overall, our results indicate a declining flood pulse since the late 1990s.

The determinants and public health outcomes of recurrent home flooding in urban contexts, however, are not well understood. A household survey was used to assess neighborhood and household level determinants of recurrent home flooding in Detroit, MI. Survey activities were conducted from 2012 to 2020. Researchers collected information on past flooding, housing conditions and public health outcomes. Using the locations of homes, a "hot spot" analysis of flooding was performed to find areas of high and low risk. Survey data were linked to environmental and neighborhood data and associations were tested using regression methods. 4803 households participated in the survey. Flooding information was available for 3842 homes. Among these, 2085 (54.26%) reported experiencing pluvial flooding. Rental occupied units were more likely to report flooding than owner occupied homes (Odd ratio (OR) 1.72 [95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.49, 1.98]). Housing conditions such as poor roof quality and cracks in basement walls influenced home flooding risk. Homes located in census tracts with increased percentages of owner occupied units (vs. rentals) had a lower odds of flooding (OR 0.92 [95% (CI) 0.86, 0.98]). Household factors were found the be more predictive of flooding than neighborhood factors in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Flooding and housing conditions associated with home flooding were associated with asthma cases. Recurrent home flooding is far more prevalent than previously thought. Programs that support recovery and which focus on home improvement to prevent flooding, particularly by landlords, might benefit the public health. These results draw awareness and urgency to problems of urban flooding and public health in other areas of the country confronting the compounding challenges of aging infrastructure, disinvestment and climate change.

The vulnerability of this coastal region is likely to increase under the future climate change context. This research aims to develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) of multi-hazardous events for the eastern coastal region of Bangladesh. Eight parameters, mostly focused on physical vulnerability, were considered in this study. Various thematic layers were prepared for each parameter using spatial techniques, and all parameters were assigned a vulnerability ranking. Finally, a CVI was developed and the related values were categorised into five distinct classes (i.e., very high, high, moderate, low, and very low). Results indicate that approximately 121 km (32%) of the coastline of the study area is in high-to very high-vulnerability zones. Low elevations, gentle slopes, high storm surge impacts, sandy coastlines, high shoreline erosion rates and high sea-level changes are the most important factors of high to very-high vulnerability zones. The moderately vulnerable area covers approximately 119 km (32%) of the coastline. Meanwhile, 78 (21%) and 59 (16%) km of the coastlines are in low-to very low-vulnerability zones, respectively. These coastlines are characterised by steep slopes with high elevations, low tide range and storm surge heights as well as less erosion. The CVI results were validated by qualitative observations acquired from the field. The findings of this study can be applied by policymakers and administrators to develop effective mitigation plans and minimise the likely impacts of coastal multi-hazards.

To guarantee satisfactory decisions in the face of deep uncertainties, adaptive policy pathways might be used. Adaptive policy pathways are designed to take actions according to how the future will actually unfold. In adaptive pathways, a monitoring system collects the evidence required for activating the next adaptive action. This monitoring system is made of signposts and triggers. Signposts are indicators that track the performance of the pathway. When signposts reach pre-specified trigger values, the next action on the pathway is implemented. The effectiveness of the monitoring system is pivotal to the success of adaptive policy pathways, therefore the decision-makers would like to have sufficient confidence about the future capacity to adapt on time. On time means activating the next action on a pathway neither so early that it incurs unnecessary costs, nor so late that it incurs avoidable damages. In this paper, we show how mapping the relations between triggers and the probability of misclassification errors inform the level of confidence that a monitoring system for adaptive policy pathways can provide. Specifically, we present the trigger-probability mapping and the trigger-consequences mappings. The former mapping displays the interplay between trigger values for a given signpost and the level of confidence regarding whether change occurs and adaptation is needed. The latter mapping displays the interplay between trigger values for a given signpost and the consequences of misclassification errors for both adapting the policy or not. In a case study, we illustrate how these mappings can be used to test the effectiveness of a monitoring system, and how they can be integrated into the process of designing an adaptive policy.

Since there is concern about increased extremes with higher hazard potential under climate change, alterations of EVA are introduced for which statistical properties are no longer assumed to be constant but vary over time. In this study, both stationary and non-stationary EVA models are used to derive design life levels (DLLs) of daily precipitation in the pre-alpine Oberland region of Southern Germany, an orographically complex region characterized by heavy precipitation events and climate change. As EVA is fraught with uncertainties, it is crucial to quantify its methodological impacts: two theoretical distributions (i.e., Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution), four different parameter estimation techniques (i.e., Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), L-moments, Generalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation (GMLE), and Bayesian estimation method) are evaluated and compared. The study reveals large methodological uncertainties. Discrepancies due to the parameter estimation methods may reach up to 45% of the mean absolute value, while differences between stationary and non-stationary models are of the same magnitude (differences in DLLs up to 40%). For the end of this century in the Oberland region, there is no robust tendency towards increased extremes found.

We investigated the hydrological processes of Lake Qinghai and the surrounding watershed that have influenced water level and lake area from 1956 to 2019. Relationships among water level, climate change and human activities were also assessed. Water level and lake area were positively correlated with precipitation and runoff into the lake, and negatively correlated with evaporation. Climate change factors including precipitation and runoff were the primary causes of lake level change, whereas human activities, including variation in a human footprint index, land use, and grassland irrigation, were secondary factors. A time series model forecasted that from 2020 to 2050 water levels will increase further by 2.45 m. Although this increase in water level may have some benefits, such as reduced local desertification, the expansion of lake area will continue to flood low beaches, pasture lands, near shore infrastructure and roads, and impact tourism locations. However, continued water level rise may also have negative ecological effects, such as reduce habitat of seasonal birds and reduced water quality due to erosion and sediment resuspension in shallow nearshore lake areas. Local stakeholders, government authorities, and scientists should give greater attention to anticipated changes in water level, and further ecological studies and infrastructure adaptation measures should be implemented.

Study focus: Hydro-climatic processes in the TP are greatly sensitive to global climate change, but are not well understood nowadays due to the lack of hydro-climatic observations. In this study, runoff variation and response to precipitation on multi-spatial and temporal scales were identified and quantified by using a comprehensive approach, based on time series of monthly runoff and precipitation during 1961-2015.New hydrological insights for the region: Annual runoff and flood season runoff mainly showed a downward trend from 1961 to 2015 in the upper-middle reaches of the YZB. Spatially similar non-monotonous changes were also detected with a turning point around 2000, which was greatly affected by precipitation. Periodic changes of annual and flood season runoff were significant on an approximate 3-year, which was well correlated with precipitation and obviously different from dry season runoff. The long-range trend of runoff in 1961-2015 may be related to scaling behaviors in the midstream where about 10.7-14.9% of the trend of runoff were explained by precipitation in flood seasons. Precipitation changes contributed to above 50% of the runoff tendency and thus can be considered as the major driving factor of runoff changes in the upper stream and NY sub-basin. The study provides a new understanding of runoff-precipitation variation through a comprehensive and quantitative analysis.

The use of observed temperature relationships for informing changes in hydrologic extremes takes many forms, from simple proportional change approaches to conditioning stochastic rainfall generation on observed temperatures. Although generally focused on understanding changes to precipitation, there is an implied transfer of information gained from precipitation-temperature sensitivities to flooding as extreme precipitation is often responsible for flooding. While reviews of precipitation-temperature sensitivities and the non-stationarity of flooding exist, little attention has been given to the intersection of these two topics. Models which use temperature as a covariate to assess the non-stationarity of extreme precipitation outperform both stationary models and those using a temporal trend as a covariate. But care must be taken when projecting changes in flooding on the basis on precipitation-temperature sensitivities, as antecedent conditions modify the runoff response. Although good agreement is found between peak flow-temperature sensitivities and historical trends across Australia, there remains little evaluation of flood projections using temperature sensitivities globally. Significant work needs to be done before the use of temperature as a covariate for flood projection can be adopted with confidence. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.

This prediction imposes an implicit continuum of choices on all, ranging from: do nothing (beyond the status quo) to further prepare (paying the costs as they occur); through to invest now (in, for example, flood mitigation infrastructure) in the hope that such investments will reduce damage later. Good choices require good information. In this paper, we provide an empirical demonstration of one method (the life satisfaction approach) for generating quantitative estimates of both the tangible and intangible cost of disasters ? the cost of doing nothing (beyond the status quo). We use data collected from almost 400 households in a flood prone region of the Philippines, finding that from 2008 to 2013, flooding generated an average of US$86 per annum in financial damages for each household. Our model predicts that the average respondent would require a one-off payment of between US$2,577 and US$3,221 (3.5 to 4.4 times the average annual income) to ?compensate? them for the additional intangible costs of flooding. Estimated total compensation exceeds estimated financial damage by about 1/3 ? suggesting that assessments, which do not account for intangibles may substantially underestimate the cost of doing nothing.

These conditions place pressure on municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate adaptation.

The Role of Traditional Knowledge in Coastal Adaptation Priorities: The Pamunkey Indian Reservation	WATER			English	Article						traditional ecological knowledge; sea level rise; shoreline management; erosion; coastal hazards	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM SURGES; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK	Coastal reservations are increasingly vulnerable to hazards exacerbated by climate change. Resources for restoration projects are limited. Storm surge, storms, tidal flooding, and erosion endanger artifacts and limit livelihoods of tribes in coastal Virginia. GIS offers a platform to increase communication between scientists, planners, and indigenous groups. The Pamunkey Indian Tribe engaged in a participatory mapping exercise to assess the role of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in coastal management decision-making and its capacity to address flooding. Priorities and strategies were spatially referenced using maps of potential sea level rise for 2040, 2060, and 2080, input into a resilience matrix to identify benchmarks for each phase of disaster resilience building, and contextualized with oral histories. Results highlight increased immediacy to protect housing and heritage sites along the shoreline as well as maintain access to the Reservation. Preferences toward structural solutions guided by and facilitating TEK options were expressed. Additional community capacities, tribal council support, federal assistance, impact assessments, and coordination would facilitate risk reduction project implementation. The screening process integrates TEK with planning and is transferable to neighboring tribes.

J	Hickey, A; Senevirathna, L				Hickey, Adrian; Senevirathna, Lalantha			Performance of regional water purification plants during extreme weather events: three case studies from New South Wales, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Bushfire; Climate change; Climate extremes; Drought; Flooding; Water management; Water quality; Water supply	CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN STORMWATER; QUALITY; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; RUNOFF	Climate change is altering weather patterns, which affects water supply systems globally. More frequent extreme weather events like floods, droughts, and heatwaves are impacting the availability of raw water sources that supply cities. These events can lead to less water, higher demand, and potential infrastructure damage. Water agencies and utilities must develop resilient and adaptable systems to withstand shocks and stresses. Case studies demonstrating the impact of extreme weather on water quality are important for developing resilient water supply systems. This paper documents the challenges faced by regional New South Wales (NSW) in managing water quality and supply during extreme weather events. Effective treatment processes, such as ozone treatment and adsorption, are used to maintain drinking water standards during extreme weather. Water-efficient alternatives are provided, and critical water networks are inspected to identify leaks and reduce system demand. Local government areas must collaborate and share resources to ensure that towns can cope with future extreme weather events. Systematic investigation is needed to understand system capacity and identify surplus resources to be shared when demand cannot be met. Pooling resources could benefit regional towns experiencing both floods and droughts. With expected population growth in the area, regional NSW councils will require a significant increase in water filtration infrastructure to handle increased system loading. Continuous research, regular strategy reviews, and innovative approaches are essential to ensure a secure and reliable water supply during future extreme weather events.

As the climate changes, coastal communities relying on OWTS are particularly vulnerable, as soil-based wastewater treatment may be reduced by water inundation from storm surge, sea level rise and associated groundwater rise, and heavy rainfall. Despite the vulnerabilities of OWTS to increased precipitation and sea level rise, there is little known about how onsite wastewater managers are responding to current and future climate risks. We conducted interviews with wastewater operators and installers and health regulators to understand the functioning, management, and regulation of OWTS in the current climate, challenges with rising sea levels and increases in extreme weather events, and what adaptation strategies could be implemented to mitigate negative impacts. Our results indicate that heavy precipitation and storm surges cause malfunctions for conventional septic systems where traditional site variables (e.g., soil type or groundwater level) are undesirable. Weather and climate are not required regulatory factors to consider in system selection and site approval, but many OWTS managers are aware of their impacts on the functioning of systems, and some are preemptively taking action to mitigate those impacts. Our findings suggest that filling gaps in the current communication structure between regulators and homeowners relying on OWTS is critical for coastal communities in the Carolinas to build climate resilience into decentralized wastewater infrastructure.

Coastal adaptation to climate change through zonation: A review of coastal change management areas (CCMAs) in England	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Coastal management; Coastal zonation; Sea-level rise; Coastal adaptation; Climate change; Coastal policy; Coastal erosion	LEVEL; CLASSIFICATION; NOURISHMENT; DYNAMICS; RETREAT	Climate change and accelerated rates in sea-level rise are expected to increase flooding and erosion on the world's coastlines. Coastal managers and planners face the challenge of helping communities to adapt to the changing coast. Traditionally hard engineering has been used to defend communities on the coast, but as this option becomes unsustainable and financially unviable, coastal managers are increasingly employing planning policy to mitigate the risk posed by coastal change. Zonation of coastal change areas and delineation of erosion extents, such as set-back lines, are used globally to restrict development in the coastal zone. In England there is policy in place to allow planning authorities to restrict certain development in areas expected to be affected by coastal change. This study aims to examine how coastal planning authorities in England have implemented coastal change adaptation policies, specifically Coastal Change Management Areas (CCMA). These areas should include sections of coast that will experience significant change over the next 100 years through erosion, accretion or flooding. Through an analysis of planning documents, we have found that since the policy was introduced in 2012, only 15% of coastal planning authorities have designated a CCMA, with just 5.7% of the coast of England designated as a CCMA. We have found that inadequate and ambiguous guidance has reduced the effectiveness of the national policy with coastal planning authorities unsure of which datasets to apply for delineating areas of coastal change. This has led to vulnerable coastal areas being omitted from CCMAs. The datasets that are available for mapping the coastal change areas are found to vary in erosion extent and do not account for expected increases in the rate of sea-level rise. We suggest that for coastal zonation and climate change adaptation policy to be successful, a robust methodology, including a classification of coastal typologies and their response to sea level rise, is needed to delineate the extent of erosion or coastal change over the next 100 years. Understanding and mapping coastal response to sea level rise will aid planning authorities to build more resilient communities on the coast.	[Kirby, J.

Land-use change increases climatic vulnerability of migratory birds: Insights from integrated population modelling	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						band-recovery data; climate change; habitat loss; integrative modelling; mortality; reproduction; wetland habitat	DUCK NEST SUCCESS; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; HABITAT LOSS; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; CONSEQUENCES; PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY	Knowledge of land-use patterns that could affect animal population resiliency or vulnerability to environmental threats such as climate change is essential, yet the interactive effects of land use and climate on demography across space and time can be difficult to study. This is particularly true for migratory species, which rely on different landscapes throughout the year. Unlike most North American migratory waterfowl, populations of northern pintails (Anas acuta; hereafter pintails) have not recovered since the 1980s despite extended periods of abundant flooded wetlands (i.e. ponds). The mechanisms and drivers involved in this discrepancy remain poorly understood. While pintails are similar to other ducks in their dependence on ponds throughout their annual cycle, their extensive use of croplands for nesting differentiates them and makes them particularly vulnerable to changes in agricultural land use on prairie breeding grounds. Our intent was to quantify how changes in land use and ponds on breeding grounds have influenced pintail population dynamics by developing an integrated population model to analyse over five decades (1961-2014) of band-recovery, breeding population survey, land-use and pond count data. We focused especially on the interactive effects of pond counts and land use on pintail productivity, while accounting for density-dependent processes. Pintail populations responded more strongly to annual variation in productivity than survival. Productivity was positively correlated with pond count and negatively correlated with agricultural intensification. Further, a positive interaction between pond count and agricultural intensification was insufficient to overcome the strong negative effect of agricultural intensification on pintail productivity across nearly all pond counts. The interaction also indicated that pintail populations were more negatively impacted by the decrease in ponds associated with climate change under higher agricultural intensification. Our results indicate that pintail populations have become more vulnerable to climate change under intensified land use, which suggests that future conservation strategies must adapt to these altered relationships. The interactive effects of land use and climate on demography should be considered more frequently in animal ecology, and integrated population models provide an adaptable framework to understand vital rates and their drivers simultaneously.

It is anticipated that climate change will increase the frequency, intensity, and unpredictability of flooding events. This stress affects 10-15 million hectares of wheat every year, resulting in 20-50% yield losses. Since this crop greatly sustains a population's food demands, providing ca. 20% of the world's energy and protein diets requirements, it is crucial to understand changes in soil and plant physiology under excess water conditions. Variations in redox potential, pH, nutrient availability, and electrical conductivity of waterlogged soil will be addressed, as well as their impacts in major plant responses, such as root system and plant development. Waterlogging effects at the leaf level will also be addressed, with a particular focus on gas exchanges, photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars, membrane integrity, lipids, and oxidative stress.

We use multiple types of data to predict how changes in the environment affect cross-border migration. Nationally representative migration data are combined with remote-sensing measures of flooding and rainfall and in situ measures of monsoon onset, temperature, radiation, and soil salinity to characterize environmental migration patterns. We further evaluate which groups are more susceptible to cross-border migration to examine how environmental factors shape the demographic composition of the country. We find migration to neighboring countries declines with short-term, adverse weather but increases with soil salinity. The soil salinity effect remains particularly persistent among poorer households. Investments targeting risks faced by the poor and non-poor remain crucial, as retention of the earnings skills, and experience of the latter enhances national resilience.

Managed Retreat in the United States	ONE EARTH			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PROPERTY ACQUISITION; PLACE ATTACHMENT; DECISION-MAKING; FLOOD; ADAPTATION; RELOCATION; VULNERABILITY; HURRICANES	Managed retreat-the purposeful, coordinated movement of people and assets out of harm's way-is a controversial and often overlooked adaptation tool but also a potentially transformative one. In the United States, managed retreat has occurred primarily through federally funded property acquisition programs that are unlikely to be able to scale to meet the future demands of climate change. There are numerous psychological, institutional, and practical barriers to engaging in managed retreat, so understanding how United States communities have overcome these barriers, even at a small scale, could provide insights for applying retreat in other contexts and at larger scales. This paper articulates why the United States needs managed retreat to be viable at scale, identifies barriers, recommends areas for scholarship and practice to learn from past experience, and argues for a national vision for coastal adaptation, such as a National Seashore, to provide a coordinating and motivating focus for future work.

Rainfall analysis with stationary and nonstationary approach for observed and future conditions is performed for (1950-2015 period) observed data of 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 6 hour and projections (2015-2098 period) of 10, 15 minutes and 1, 6 hour for Ankara province, Turkey. Daily projections are disaggregated to finer scales, 5 minutes storm durations, then five minutes time series aggregated to the storm durations that are subject of interest. Nonstationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models and stationary GEV models for observed and future data are obtained. Nonstationary model results are in general exhibited smaller return level values with respect to stationary model results of each storm duration for observed data driven model results. Considering the projected data driven model results; on average nonstationary models produce mostly lower return levels for mid and longer return periods for all storm durations and return periods except one hour storm duration. Depending on the models and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), there are different results for the future extreme rainfall input; yet all results indicate a decreasing extreme trend.

The Intensity - Duration - Frequency (IDF) curves are important means of evaluating the efficiency of irrigation and drainage systems. The necessity to update IDF curves arises from the need to gain better understanding of the impacts of climate change. This study explores an approach based on weighted Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and temporal disaggregation method to develop future IDFs under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) emission scenarios. The work consists of 20 ensemble GCMs, three RCPs (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) and two projection periods (2050s and 2080s). The study compared three statistical distributions and selected Generalized Extreme value (GEV) being the best fitting distribution with baseline rainfall series and therefore used for IDF projection. The result obtained shows that, the highest rainfall intensities of 19.32, 35.07 and 39.12 mm/hr occurred under 2-, 5-, and 20 years return periods, respectively. IDFs from the multi-model ensemble GCMs have shown increasing intensity in the future for all the return periods. This study indicated that the method could produce promising results which can be extended to other catchments.

J	Htun, N				Htun, Nay			Holistic and integrated systemic policies and practices for decarbonization	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						decarbonizing; energy efficiency; energy policy; sustinable and resilient development	CLIMATE-CHANGE	A bold, visionary, transforming, systemic, holistic, integrated, caring, inclusive, equitable, sustainable, and resilient paradigm for fast transitions toward a clean energy and decarbonized future is imperative and urgently needed. Business as usual and silo approaches are not viable with the changes that are occurring. These changes are linked and interacting systems of physical, natural, health, social, economic, finance, governance, and institution.The effects and impacts are dire, existential, and pervasive.The 2021 IPCC Report Physical Science Basis: Summary for Policymakers, in clear language stated "it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land".The scientific communities in the US, Europe, Asia and other regions all subscribe to this situation.Well documented global empirical evidence is also confirming the profound systems and systemic transformations that are occurring.Business, industry, and the general public, in particular youths, worldwide are all increasingly demanding actions - that transcend words of what needs to be done to deeds of how and now.In the US, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would allocate US 370 billion for combating climate change and clean energy production. The IRA is the largest climate spending package ever.President Biden has called for 100% clean electricity by 2035 and pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels by the end of this decade, doubling the previous target.A decarbonized future was endorsed by Leaders at the 2021 G-7 Carbis, UK Summit. There is growing realization that the global climate change crisis requires strengthened and expanded global cooperation with new, innovative and non-bureaucratic mechanisms for collaboration.The 2021 IPCC Report summarized that global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the mid- century under all emissions' scenarios considered. "Global warming of 1.5 and 2 degrees C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades." The UNEP and IEA contends reducing anthropogenic methane emissions will help mitigate climate change and is a cost-effective proposition.The release of methane and micro-organisms from melting of permafrost needs to be better studied and understood., The confluence of increased heat, humidity, fine particulates air pollution, water contaminants and the COVID pandemic, will exacerbate health burdens. This will have serious consequences for human wellbeing, and cascading into national and global security. With climate change, therapeutics and vaccines will not work.The article provides a brief overview of the unprecedented climate related hurricanes, storms, floods and wildfires disasters occurring in all regions of the world. It highlights of some of the key effects, impacts and consequences with current policies and practices with regard to the energy-climate conundrum. There is an imperative to change course toward a decarbonized future.A number of systemic expeditious interventions are delineated.

In this paper, we investigate how changes in mean values and variability of weather variables may affect rice yield using panel data for 30 districts of Tamil Nadu State from 1971 to 2018. We estimate a fixed-effects regression model with panel-corrected standard errors. Results show that rainfall and temperature have a statistically significant impact on rice yield. Furthermore, weather variability, measured as standard deviations of temperature and rainfall, has a negative effect on rice yields. We use the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-5 outputs and dynamically downscaled the weather outputs using the regional climate model. The results of the climate model showed that the rise in temperature and disruptions in rainfall patterns including both excessive and deficient rainfall events in Tamil Nadu will continue in the future under different climate scenarios. Projected changes in the weather variables are likely to decrease rice yield in Tamil Nadu from 0.7 to 6.3% under the low emission scenario and 4.1 to 20.1% in the high emission scenario during 2022-2050 (relative to 1971-2018). These projections have implications for the planning and targeting of climate adaptation technologies such as drought-tolerant and flood-tolerant varieties to lessen the adverse impact of weather variability due to climate change in the future.

Unfortunately, there is a gap between climate science and engineering planning and design, which is partially filled in this study, whose aim is to evaluate the expected reliability over a planning horizon of a hy-draulic infrastructure and its uncertainty for hydroclimatic projections. To achieve this goal, we implemented hydrological deep learning models that are driven by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). After validating and testing the hydrological deep learning models, sample series of the annual maximum flood (AMF) were generated for different mountain rivers of Chile and used for a standard frequency analysis that updates the exceedance probability of the flood events used for the hydraulic design. We found that the mean and the standard deviation of the sample series of the AMF are the key parameters that enable quantifying temporal changes in the exceedance probability of the design flow. The cumulative effects of these changes are summarized by the projected reliability over the planning horizon of the infrastructure, and the age of the infrastructure at which this projected reliability equates to the design reliability, quantifies the impact of climate change on the expected security of the hydraulic project. We show that the infrastructure that was designed for the smaller exceedance probability is more vulnerable to climate change, where the updated planning horizon can be as small as 45% of the planning horizon used for the design.

While the majority of the effects are negative for agricultural production, some can be beneficial. Our work presents the evaluation of the changes in the duration of the great vegetation period (delineated with the beginning and end of days with an average temperature T >= 5.0 degrees C) and the vegetation periods of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus Thumb.) and beetroot (Beta vulgaris L.). Data sets on the average monthly air temperatures for the period 1961-2020 from one hundred agroclimatic stations in Slovakia were selected for the estimation of the future average air temperatures using statistical methods (linear trendline). Based on the temperature requirements of the selected crops, the potential maximum duration of the vegetation period was estimated for several decades from 2041 up to 2100. The results clearly showed prolongation of the vegetation periods and changes of their zonation in Slovakia. In 2011-2020, the duration of the beetroot vegetation period in the southernmost part of Slovakia (Danubian Lowland) was 15-20 days longer than in decade 1971-1980. It is expected, that this value will rise by another 10-15 days in decade 2091-2100. Since 1971-1980, watermelon vegetation period duration increased by 5-10 days when compared to decade 2011-2020. It is expected that by 2091-2100, its duration will prolong by another 30-35 days.

In this study, we have considered the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Analytical Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) for the estimation of gully erosion susceptibility in Dwarkeswar River basin. The ensemble Global circulation Model (GCM) has been considered for simulating the rainfall scenario in the projected period, i.e. 2100s. All selected parameters' VIF (variance inflation factor) and TOL (tolerance) ranges are 1.05 to 11.56 and 0.20 to 0.95, respectively. In the training dataset, AUC values of SVM, ANN and DLNN are 0.95, 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. In the case of validation, AUC values are .86, 0.87 and 0.90, respectively. Here, the DLNN is the most optimal model in terms of the predictive capacity. The AUC (Area Under Curve) values from ROC (Receiver operating characteristics Curve) of the DLNN model for training and validation datasets are 0.96 and 0.90, respectively. The values of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV in the case of validation datasets in DLNN are 0.88, 0.76, 0.80 and 0.79, respectively. There is an increasing tendency of rainfall and gully erosion susceptibility in the projected period. This type of information is helpful to the decision maker in this respective region to implement the long-term planning for escaping this type of situation.

To lower the consequences and losses caused by hazardous events, it is important to understand the magnitude of each hazard and the potential impact area. The main objective of this study was to propose a new approach to integrating hazard maps to detect hazardous areas on a national scale, for which area-limited data are available. The integrated hazard maps were based on a merging of five hazard maps: floods, land use changes, landslides, climate change impacts on floods, and climate change impacts on landslides. The integrated hazard map consists of six maps under three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and two time periods (near future and far future). The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used as a tool to combine the different hazard maps into an integrated hazard map. From the results, comparing the increase in the very high hazard area between the integrated hazard maps of the far future under the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, Khammouan Province has the highest increase (16.45 %). Additionally, the very high hazard area in Khammouan Province increased by approximately 12.47% between the integrated hazard maps under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of the far future. The integrated hazard maps can pinpoint the dangerous area through the whole country, and the map can be used as primary data for selected future development areas. There are some limitations of the AHP methodology, which supposes linear independence of alternatives and criteria.

Resilience of trees and the vulnerability of grasslands to climate change in temperate Australian wetlands	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Wetland; Woody encroachment; Canopy condition; Drought; Climate change	WOODY PLANT ENCROACHMENT; SHRUB ENCROACHMENT; EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS; LAND-USE; WATER; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; INVASION; REQUIREMENTS; CONSEQUENCES	Objectives Observations from wetlands across the globe suggest a consistent pattern of woody encroachment into wetland grasslands, altering habitat structure and ecological function. The extent to which hydrological changes have contributed to woody invasion of wetland grasslands is unclear. Our objective was to compare rates of woody encroachment in Australian floodplain wetlands between wet and dry hydrological phases. We test the hypothesis that contraction of non-woody wetland vegetation (grasses and rushes) would be concentrated in dry phases, co-incident with recruitment of the River Red Gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis lower in the floodplain. Methods We conduct the first detailed mapping of habitat change in two of the largest forested wetlands in inland Australia, comparing wet and dry hydrological phases. Detailed photogrammetry, supported by extensive ground survey, allowed the interpretation of high resolution aerial photography to vegetation community level. Results We found a consistent pattern of decline in non-woody vegetation, particularly amongst grasses utilising the C-4 photosynthetic pathway. The C-4 grasses Pseudoraphis spinescens and Paspalum distichum showed steep declines in the Barmah Millewa and Macquarie Marshes respectively, being replaced by River Red Gum E. camaldulensis. C-3 sedges proved more resilient in both systems. Conclusions Our results suggest that a pattern of tree expansion into non-woody wetland vegetation, characteristic of wetlands across the globe, is a major habitat structural change in the Australian floodplain wetlands studied. Projected hydrological impacts of climate change are likely to further restrict wetland grass foraging habitat in these semi-arid floodplain wetlands.

Study focus: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is projected to experience significant impacts from future climate change and these impacts include but are not limited to increases in extreme precipitation, flooding and droughts. This study investigates the potential impacts of climate change and uncertainties on future floods and low flow conditions in the rivers and streams of Massachusetts. Fourteen downscaled GCM projections under two greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are used as inputs into a distributed hydrological model to obtain future streamflow conditions. New hydrological insights for the region: Seasonal change projections of 100-year flood and a measure of drought (the seven-day, ten-year low flow - Q(7,10)) are estimated through the near-term (years 2021-2060) and the far-term (years 2060-2099) relative to the base period (years 1981-2016). The median estimates of 100-year flood during winter report a 15 % or higher increases in many watersheds at the far-term. In contrast, flood magnitudes in spring show decreases for most of the watersheds during both near- and far-term. For seven-day, ten-year low flow estimates, largest decreases are projected during the fall and this trend is found to be consistent across future time periods. Two emission scenarios have shown similar trends for most cases although change projections are seen to be more prominent for RCP8.5 when compared to RCP4.5.

On the need to integrate uncertainty into US water resource planning	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Uncertainty; Climate; Projections; Water resources; Risk	SANTA-CRUZ RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL MODEL; MANAGEMENT; EXTREMES; TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION; STATE	A changing climate is expected to introduce uncertainty into water resource management decision making. We examined the latest publicly-available, state-level guidance regarding the management of water supplies and demands concerning risks associated with drought, flooding, and climate change. We found state-level guidance supplementing the federally-backed flood mitigation program to be updated most regularly (54% in the last 5 years; 84% in the last decade). Yet, the underlying floodplain mapping data these local planning efforts rely on are acknowledged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to be chronically outdated. Drought planning guidance was found to be most outdated (16% last updated in the last 5 years; 18% almost two decades ago), and across the U.S., almost universally (94%) reactive (emergency response) rather than proactive (mitigation or management). Although 79-94% of states provide some level of guidance regarding water supply and demand, the projections themselves may significantly predate the guidance. Many (70%) U.S. states still lack climate change impact guidance, particularly non-coastal states and those impacted by increased water scarcity rather than flooding. Strategies are rare (4%) for addressing the impacts of increased variability and uncertainty to meet inelastic demands with finite supplies. We conclude significant gaps exist in planning to address known or projected risks of climate-related impacts. Specific recommendations, including the implementation of a nationwide water census, are provided to improve both the data and knowledge base of water management and reduce current vulnerabilities.

J	de Bruijn, E; Dieperink, C				de Bruijn, Esme; Dieperink, Carel			A Framework for Assessing Climate Adaptation Governance on the Caribbean Island of Curacao	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						good governance; climate change adaptation; Curacao; small island developing states	DEVELOPING STATES; LEVEL	It is becoming increasingly clear that Caribbean islands are very vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, longer periods of droughts, loss of biodiversity, more extreme weather events (flooding and hurricanes), and increased freshwater demands. Addressing these issues encourages good climate change adaptation governance. So far, however, the literature has not discussed what good governance could mean in this context. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to address this knowledge gap by developing an assessment framework and showing its usefulness. The framework is based on a review of the literature and is applied in an assessment of adaptation practices in Curacao. The assessment is based on a review of Curacao policy documents and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. We found that the developed framework was useful for obtaining a better insight into the quality of adaptation governance on Caribbean islands, and that in the Curacao practices, the good governance principles of transparency and inclusiveness are better elaborated in comparison to connectivity, accountability and government effectiveness. We conclude the paper with some reflections on the potential of the framework and some suggestions for further research.

Future climate change in the Agulhas system and its associated impact on South African rainfall	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Agulhas system South African; rainfall climate change CCSM4,; CMIP5	ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; BOUNDARY-LAYER; HEAT FLUXES; VARIABILITY; OCEAN; LEAKAGE; REGION; OSCILLATION; TEMPERATURE; CMIP5	South African climate variability has been linked to changes in both the Agulhas system and external forcing (i.e. CO2 and ozone). We analysed future climate change in the Agulhas system volume transport and its associated impacts on South Africa's precipitation using the Community Climate System Model version 4 as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5. Output from one historical and three future greenhouse gas emission scenarios were examined to project various climate storylines. We found that the Agulhas Current volume transport decreases across all three scenarios and that the current displays a strong baroclinic component with an increase in transport at the surface and decrease at intermediate depths. Agulhas leakage was found to increase with historical emissions. Additionally, an east-west dipole pattern for convective precipitation was found over South Africa, with an increase over the eastern region related to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in the western region linked to the location of Hadley cell edge latitude. Moving into the 21st century, future predictions in regional climate variability are shown to be dependent on the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions and are extremely important for South Africa, a region prone to drought and flooding and home to a large population dependent on rain-fed agriculture.

Riverine islands and coastal communities are the pri-mary victims due to their geographical position. The riverine islands (char) of Bangladesh are fre-quently flooded, necessitating context-specific flood management policies and actions that re-quire an in-depth investigation of household vulnerability level. Therefore, this study assesses the vulnerability level of riverine island dwellers to flooding. Data were collected from 384 house-hold heads living in geographically isolated char areas. A context-specific composite flood vul-nerability index was developed under the IPCC framework. The results reveal that all households are vulnerable to flooding and are poorly able to cope with its adverse effect. Households living near the mainland have a somewhat more adaptive capacity than distant households. Flood vul-nerability is mainly determined by char households' flood perception, damage, and access to food, water and health resources during flooding. Riverbank erosion, recurrent floods, a lack of employment, and limited access to essential public services were also identified as the primary socio-economic and natural causes of flood vulnerability. To decrease the livelihood risk and pro-mote char dwellers' resilience, a char-based policy plan with both a short-and a long-term focus is required.	[Sarker, Md Nazirul Islam; Firdaus, R. B.

While organized convection is well studied in the tropics and mid-latitudes, few studies have focused on the physics and climate change impacts of pan-Arctic convective systems. Using a convection-permitting model we showed in a predecessor study that organized convective storm frequency might triple by the end of the century in Alaska assuming a high emission scenario. The present study assesses the reasons for this rapid increase in organized convection by investigating dynamic and thermodynamic changes within future storms and their environments, in light of canonical existing theories for mid-latitude and tropical deep convection. In a future climate, more moisture originates from Arctic marine basins increasing relative humidity over Alaska due to the loss of sea ice, which is in sharp contrast to lower-latitude land regions that are expected to become drier. This increase in relative humidity favors the onset of organized convection through more unstable thermodynamic environments, increased low-level buoyancy, and weaker downdrafts. Our confidence in these results is increased by showing that these changes can be analytically derived from basic physical laws. This suggests that organized thunderstorms might become more frequent in other pan-Arctic continental regions highlighting the uniqueness and vulnerability of these regions to climate change.

One of the prominent concerns in the context of organizational sustainability is the impact of climate change and extreme weather events (EWEs), which create discontinuity and damages to business operations. In this respect, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable to EWEs, such as flash floods, having disastrous consequences to SMEs that tend to be ill-prepared. Taking into consideration that these negatives effects are also transferred into the local communities in which SMEs are located, it is crucial to create appropriate mechanisms that will enable these enterprises to build relevant capacities and acquire necessary resources in order to deal with relevant disruptive events. With this in mind, this paper attempts to delineate the emerging literature in relation to strategic approaches in dealing with high impact/low probability EWEs. With this analysis, we aim to provide insights for enhancing the robustness of SMEs against such natural hazards through effective resilience and adaptation strategies. The paper reveals that resilience to EWEs is indeed a multifaceted issue posing numerous challenges to SMEs. Taking into account their intrinsic characteristics, there is a need for a holistic management approach that will assist SMEs to safeguard their assets against extreme weather.

In this circumstance, cities need to be aware of threats and opportunities to improve their capacity in addressing these challenges. This paper identifies priorities, barriers and enablers of these capacities. Through the City Blueprint((R)) Approachan integrated baseline assessment of the urban water cycle11 Asian cities are assessed. Three cities are selected for an in-depth governance capacity analysis of their challenges with a focus on floods. Solid waste collection and treatment and access to improved drinking water and sanitation can be considered priorities, especially in cities with considerable slum populations. These people are also disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate-related hazards. The high variation of water management performance among Asian cities shows high potential for city-to-city learning by sharing best practices in water technology and governance. Combining interventions, i.e., by exploring co-benefits with other sectors (e.g., transport and energy) will increase efficiency, improve resilience, and lower the cost. Although governance capacities varied among cities, management of available information, monitoring and evaluation showed to be reoccurring points for improvement. Cities are also expected to increase implementation capacities using better policy, stricter compliance and preparedness next to promoting community involvement. Consequently, the city transformation process can be more concrete, efficient and inclusive.

The procedure has been applied to the Biala Tarnowska catchment, Southern Poland. Future climate projections of rainfall and temperature are used as inputs to the precipitation-runoff model simulating flow in part of the catchment upstream of a modeled river reach. An application of a lumped-parameter emulator instead of a distributed flow routing model, MIKE11, substantially lowers the required computation times. A comparison of maximum inundation maps derived using both the flow routing model, MIKE11, and its lump-parameter emulator shows very small differences, which supports the feasibility of the approach. The relationship derived between maximum annual inundation areas and the upstream flow of the study can be used to assess the floodplain extent response to future climate changes. The analysis shows the large influence of the one-grid-storm error in climate projections on the return period of annual maximum inundation areas and their uncertainty bounds.

J	Keller, GR				Keller, Gordon Rex			Infrastructure Adaptation and Climate Resilience for California's National Forests	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article; Early Access						sustainability and resilience; transportation systems resilience; transportation infrastructure protection and preparedness; countermeasures		This paper describes the road infrastructure found in California's national forests, their vulnerabilities, and specific measures that can be taken to adapt to projected climate change effects, thus minimizing damage from fires and storms. Over the past 40 years this region has been hit by numerous climate change-related events including droughts, major forest fires, major storms, and flooding. Billions of dollars in damage have been sustained and numerous lives lost. It is necessary now to assess vulnerabilities, rank resources at risk, and prioritize adaptation actions. The Forest Service has recently been involved in infrastructure vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy projects involving climate model studies, interviews, a literature review, local workshops, website information, and publication of the project findings. Different agency vulnerability assessment methods have been reviewed to establish a functional assessment and risk analysis methodology. Efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change have included greenhouse gas reduction from agency vehicles, evaluating alternative transportation routes, implementing energy-saving measures, and identifying "stormproofing" road design measures to reduce the vulnerability of roads to extreme climate-related events. Much of the effort has been the identification of road adaptation and resiliency measures, particularly measures that are practical and implementable at minimum cost. These measures include: routine road maintenance; relocating road segments as needed; adding trash racks and diversion prevention dips to prevent culvert failures; building stream simulation projects; protecting bridges from debris and scour; covering soil with deep-rooted vegetation; and using soil bioengineering stabilization and deep-patch shoulder reinforcement to prevent local slope failures.

These concerns are reinforced by evidence of increasing economic losses associated with flooding in many parts of the world, including Europe(2). Any changes in river floods would have lasting implications for the design of flood protection measures and flood risk zoning. However, existing studies have been unable to identify a consistent continental-scale climatic-change signal in flood discharge observations in Europe(3), because of the limited spatial coverage and number of hydrometric stations. Here we demonstrate clear regional patterns of both increases and decreases in observed river flood discharges in the past five decades in Europe, which are manifestations of a changing climate. Our results-arising from the most complete database of European flooding so far-suggest that: increasing autumn and winter rainfall has resulted in increasing floods in northwestern Europe; decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation have led to decreasing floods in medium and large catchments in southern Europe; and decreasing snow cover and snowmelt, resulting from warmer temperatures, have led to decreasing floods in eastern Europe. Regional flood discharge trends in Europe range from an increase of about 11 per cent per decade to a decrease of 23 per cent. Notwithstanding the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the observational record, the flood changes identified here are broadly consistent with climate model projections for the next century(4,5), suggesting that climate-driven changes are already happening and supporting calls for the consideration of climate change in flood risk management.

People whose livelihood depends on the agriculture and food sector, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), face significant risk. In contexts with gendered roles in agri-food systems or where structural constraints to gender equality underlie unequal access to resources and services and constrain women's agency, local climate hazards and stressors, such as droughts, floods, or shortened crop-growing seasons, tend to negatively affect women more than men and women's adaptive capacities tend to be more restrained than men's. Transformation toward just and sustainable agri-food systems in the face of climate change will not only depend on reducing but also on averting aggravated gender inequality in agri-food systems. In this paper, we developed and applied an accessible and versatile methodology to identify and map localities where climate change poses high risk especially for women in agri-food systems because of gendered exposure and vulnerability. We label these localities climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspots. Applying our methodology to LMICs reveals that the countries at highest risk are majorly situated in Africa and Asia. Applying our methodology for agricultural activity-specific hotspot subnational areas to four focus countries, Mali, Zambia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, for instance, identifies a cluster of districts in Dhaka and Mymensingh divisions in Bangladesh as a hotspot for rice. The relevance and urgency of identifying localities where climate change hits agri-food systems hardest and is likely to negatively affect population groups or sectors that are particularly vulnerable is increasingly acknowledged in the literature and, in the spirit of leaving no one behind, in climate and development policy arenas. Hotspot maps can guide the allocation of scarce resources to most-at-risk populations. The climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspot maps show where women involved in agri-food systems are at high climate risk while signaling that reducing this risk requires addressing the structural barriers to gender equality.

The goal is to reorganize energy industry allocation to make China's energy the most efficient, which would thus help achieve sustainable development goals. The biggest contribution and of this paper is not only to enlarge the scale and take into account the sustainable aspects, but also to consider climate change factors that have been ignored in the past as exogenous variables. For the first time, we take stock of the optimal allocation of new and tradition energy sources and carbon dioxide. This study uses the Dynamic ZSG-DDF model with exogenous variables and undesirable outputs to find a way to redistribute carbon dioxide, new energy, and tradition energy from different provinces on the premise of maximizing efficiency, thus achieving the goal of reducing carbon and saving the earth. The research results show that the energy efficiency of tradition energy is higher than that of new energy in various provinces. At the same time, the China government must comprehensively review the quota targets of new energy, tradition energy, and carbon dioxide (CO2) in each province as quickly as possible. Currently, the quotas of various provinces are seriously misplaced, and 26 provinces in total have great room for improvement.

Furthermore, conventional climate models are unable to realistically represent the type of intense storms which dominate the West African monsoon. This paper presents a decision-first framing of climate research in co-production of a climate-hydrology-flooding modelling chain, linking scientists working on state-of-the-art regional climate science with decision-makers involved in city planning for future urban flood management in the city of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The realistic convection-permitting model over Africa (CP4A) is applied at the urban scale for the first time and data suggest significant intensification of high-impact weather events and demonstrate the importance of considering the spatio-temporal scales in CP4A. Hydrological modelling and hydraulic modelling indicate increases in peak flows and flood extents in Ouagadougou in response to climate change which will be further exacerbated by future urbanisation. Advances in decision-makers' capability for using climate information within Ouagadougou were observed, and key recommendations applicable to other regional urban areas are made. This study provides proof of concept that a decision-first modelling-chain provides a methodology for co-producing climate information that can, to some extent, bridge the usability gap between what scientists think is useful and what decision-makers need.

However, the main reason for the increasing uptake of this type of solution is their many benefits for the local inhabitants, including recreational value. Previous studies on recreational value focus on studies of existing nature sites that are often much larger than what is considered as new NBS for flood adaptation studies in urban areas. We thus prioritized studies with smaller areas and nature types suitable for urban flood adap-tation and divided them into four common nature types for urban flood adaptation: sustainable urban drainage systems, city parks, nature areas and rivers. We identified 23 primary valuation studies, including both stated and revealed preference studies, and derived two value transfer functions based on meta-regression analysis on existing areas. We investigated trends between values and variables and found that for the purpose of planning of new NBS the size of NBS and population density were determining factors of recreational value. For existing NBS the maximum travelling distance may be included as well. We find that existing state-of-the-art studies over-estimate the recreational with more than a factor of 4 for NBS sizes below 5 ha. Our results are valid in a Eu-ropean context for nature-based solutions below 250 ha and can be applied across different NBS types and sizes.

The western Amazon basin has recently gone through extreme flood levels that resulted in population declines of species used for wild meat, principally white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), red brocket deer (Mazama americana), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), and black agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa). The Cocama (Kukama) people of the Samiria River have adapted to the declining wild meat populations by greatly reducing hunting and increasing their fishing activity. We evaluated the sustainability of subsistence hunting of peccaries, deer, lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), large rodents, and primates in flooded forests of the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve using camera trap capture rates, density from distance transects, and participatory interviews with Cocama villagers from 2009 to 2018. Peccaries, deer, and large rodents are recovering from population declines that occurred during extreme floods, which suggests that hunting levels are allowing these populations to grow. The primates and lowland tapir have healthy population sizes and stable numbers, which suggests people are hunting these species at sustainable levels. Our results indicate that changes in hunting patterns by the Cocama have permitted peccary, deer, and large rodent populations to recover to varying degrees during years of normal flood levels. The Cocama people are adapting to climate change in a way that agrees with conservation goals and reinforces the importance of community-based approaches to conservation in the Amazon.

The aim of our study was to track the influence of long-term climate change (i.e. temperature fluctuations) on past dynamics of aquatic primary producers. Sedimentary pigments were separated and quantified in 182 samples that span the last ca. 10,000 years. There was an increasing trend in sedimentary pigment concentrations from basal to upper sediment layers, suggesting a gradual increase in lake trophic status through time. Using additive models, our results suggested that primary producer dynamics in Lake Peipsi were closely related to temperature fluctuations. We, however, identified two periods (early Holocene and after ca. 2.5 cal ka BP) when the relationship between primary producer composition and temperature was weak, suggesting the influence of additional drivers on the primary producer community. We postulate that: (a) the increase of primary producer biomass in the early Holocene could have been caused by input of allochthonous organic matter and nutrients from the flooded areas when water level in Lake Peipsi was increasing, and (b) changes in the abundance and structure of primary producer assemblages since ca. 2.5 cal ka BP was related to widespread agricultural activities in the Lake Peipsi catchment. These results suggest that human activities can disrupt the relationship between the primary producer community and temperature in large, shallow lakes.

J	Li, JD; Strong, C; Wang, J; Burian, S				Li, Jiada; Strong, Courtenay; Wang, Jun; Burian, Steven			An Event-Based Resilience Index to Assess the Impacts of Land Imperviousness and Climate Changes on Flooding Risks in Urban Drainage Systems	WATER			English	Article						urban drainage flooding; impact study; urban infill; SWMM; flood resilience	URBANIZATION; RUNOFF; MANAGEMENT; CITY; ADAPTATION; HOHHOT; SAFE	Assessing the resilience of urban drainage systems requires the consideration of future disturbances that will disrupt the system's performance and trigger urban flooding failures. However, most existing resilience assessments of urban drainage systems rarely consider the uncertain threats from future urban redevelopment and climate change, which leads to the underestimation of future disturbances toward system performance. This paper fills in the gap of assessing the combined and relative impacts of future impervious land cover and rainfall changes on flooding resilience in the context of a densely infilled urban catchment served by an urban drainage system in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. An event-based resilience index is proposed to measure climate change and urbanization impacts on urban floods. Compared with the traditional resilience metric, the event-based resilience index can consider climatic and urbanized impacts on each urban flooding event; the new resilience index assist engineers in harvesting high-resolution infrastructure adaptation strategies at vulnerable spots from the system level to the junction level. Impact comparison for the case study shows that impervious urban surface changes induce greater effects on the system performance curves by magnifying the maximum failure level, lengthening the recovery duration, and aggravating the flooding severity than rainfall intensity changes. A nonlinear logarithmic resilience correlation is found; this finding shows that flooding resilience is more sensitive to the land imperviousness change due to urban redevelopment than rainfall intensity changes in the case study. This research work predicts the system response to the disturbances induced by climate change and urban redevelopment, improving the understanding of impact analysis, and contributes to the advancement of resilient urban drainage systems in changing environments.

With the increasing imperviousness caused by rapid urbanization and the rising frequency and severity of extreme events caused by climate change, the hydrological status of the urban area has changed, resulting in urban floods. This study aims to identify trends and gaps and highlight potential research prospects in the field of urban flooding in South Asia. Based on an extensive literature review, this paper reviewed urban flood hazard assessment methods using hydraulic/hydrological models and urban flood management practices in South Asia. With the advancement of technology and high-resolution topographic data, hydrologic/hydraulic models such as HEC-RAS/HMS, MIKE, SWMM, etc., are increasingly used for urban flood hazard assessment. Urban flood management practices vary among countries based on existing technologies and infrastructures. In order to control urban flooding, both conventional physical structures, including drainage and embankments, as well as new innovative techniques, such as low-impact development, are implemented. Non-structural flood mitigation measures, such as improved flood warning systems, have been developed and implemented in a few cities. The major challenge in using process-based hydraulic models was the lack of high-resolution DEM and short-duration rainfall data in the region, significantly affecting the model's simulation results and the implementation of flood management measures. Risk-informed management must be implemented immediately to reduce the adverse effects of climate change and unplanned urbanization on urban flooding. Therefore, it is crucial to encourage emergency managers and local planning authorities to consider a nature-based solution in an integrated urban planning approach to enhances urban flood resilience.

We used ostracods (bivalved micro-crustaceans) to assess the effects of climate change on regional species richness, (re-) distribution and community composition across the river basins of the Southern Cone of South America. Using a range of niche-based models, we present projections of changes in diversity components in the light of two scenarios on increased carbon emissions: the moderate-optimistic (RCP 4.5) and the pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios from four climate models on 2050 and 2080 scenarios. Future projections show increase in the number of (mapped) cells with a richness up to five species as compared to present-day situations. La Plata basin (LPLA) presents the highest species loss, mainly in the Paraguay and Parana rivers, while the species gain occurred mainly in the La Puna Region, North Chile-Pacific Coast and southern LPLA basins. Global change might impact ostracod communities even on a medium term (2050). Despite losses of local species in all future scenarios, a small portion of the LPLA was identified as a potential future climatic refugia for ostracod communities, while the distribution area in Patagonia was predicted to be extremely small for some ostracods at the southernmost parts of South Argentina-South Atlantic Coast and South Chile-Pacific Coast basins in both futures. These results indicate that non-model organisms can also contribute greatly to formulate evidence-based management plans for aquatic ecosystems under climate change scenarios.

This study was an endeavor to investigate the contributions of climate change to maximum daily discharge (MDD). To this end, the MDD simulation was carried out through implementing the IHACRES precipitation-runoff model in the Payyab Jamash watershed for the 21st century (2016-2100). Subsequently, the observed precipitation and temperature data of the weather stations (1980-2011) as well as 4 multi-model outputs of Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the maximum and minimum Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (2016-2100) were utilized. In order to downscale the output of GCMs, Bias Correction (BC) statistical method was applied. The projections for the 21st century indicated a reduction in Maximum Daily Precipitation (MDP) in comparison with the historic period in the study area. The average projected MDP for the future period was 9 mm/day and 5 mm/day under 2.6 and 8.5 RCPs (4.6% and 2.6% decrease compared with the historical period), respectively. Moreover, the temperature increased in Jamash Watershed based on 2.6 and 8.5 RCPs by 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C(3.7% and 7.4% increase compared with the historical period), respectively. The findings of flow simulation for the future period indicated a decrease in MDD due to the diminished MDP in the study area. The amount of this decrease under RCP8.5 was not remarkable (0.75 m(3)/s), whereas its value for RCP2.6 was calculated as 40m(3)/s (respectively, 0.11% and 5.88% decrease compared with the historical period).

Investigation entailed visual interpretation of LULC analysis (2008-2017) using fine-scale Google Earth imageries, rainfall-runoff analysis using SCS-CN method, determining the supply-demand potential of water storage structures using field-experimentations and PRA tools, and estimation of season-wise water-budget using hydrological (water-balance) equations. Results identified agriculture as the major land-use (similar to 78%) followed by hilly regions (similar to 16%) and water bodies (similar to 3%). Surface runoff was found as the dominating hydrological phenomenon (33-89% of monsoonal rainfall) followed by surface storage (6-36% of annual rainfall) and groundwater flow (4-82% of annual rainfall). Deforestation over hills for firewood, which reduced forest cover by 52%, was observed as the primary concern for soil erosion, thereby siltation of water bodies and higher runoff against percolation. Erratic rainfall patterns (departure range - 42 to 83% during 1998-2017) coupled with sub-graded irrigational systems confined the agricultural practices to one season [South-West monsoon (June-September)]. High unmet drinking water demand (73% to 98%) forced women communities to fetch water by walking 4.5 +/- 1.5 km. Considering the urgent response to collectively combat water-budget imbalance, integrated water security plans were proposed using decentralized participatory watershed development approaches.

Climate change and hydrological regime in arid lands: Impacts of dams on the plant diversity, vegetation structure and soil in Saudi Arabia	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Plant associations; Climate change; Downstream; Flooding; Riparian vegetation	FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; WATER; WADI; DESERT	As the direct effects of climate change on the hydrological regime, Saudi Arabia has constructed more than 522 dams of various capacities as part of economic and environmental development. The study aims to assess the impact of dams on plant diversity, vegetation structure and soil in Saudi Arabia. Thirty-five stands were selected from the dams of different sizes of Saudi Arabia. Vegetation samples were established before (upstream) and after (downstream) the dam, and at the undammed (unaffected by the dam) to compare species diversity in the dam sites and undammed sites and to document the potential effects of dams on vegetation structure. A total of 151 plant species belonging to 36 families have been recorded. The vegetation associations are essentially shrubby with widespread annuals. Six novel associations were identified with the application of TWINSPAN, DCA, and CCA programs. They were named after the characteristic species as follows: VG I: Acacia gerrardii-Caralluma retrospiciens; VGII: Acacia tortilis-Maerua oblongifolia; VGIII: Lycium shawii-Farsetia aegyptiaca; VG IV: Farsetia stylosa-Cornulaca monocantha; VG V: Suaeda aegyptiaca-Salsola imbricata-Prosopis farcta and VGVI: Xanthium strumariumOchradenus baccatus. These plant communities are evaluated and discussed according to their floristic structure, vegetation diversity and edaphic variables. The riparian or streamside zones upstream and downstream that are periodically flooded contain highly diverse plant communities that are structured by flooding, which creates disturbance and acts as a dispersal mechanism for plants than undammed sites.

The Role of Beach Morphology and Mid-Century Climate Change Effects on Wave Runup and Storm Impact on the Northern Yucatan Coast	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						wave runup; climate change; storm impact; sea level rise; SWASH model	GULF-OF-MEXICO; SWASH; PARAMETERIZATION; VULNERABILITY; VARIABILITY; FIELDS; TRENDS; MODEL; SETUP	Wave runup is a relevant parameter to determine the storm impact on barrier islands. Here, the role of the beach morphology on wave runup and storm impact was investigated at four coastal communities located on the northern Yucatan coast. Current wave conditions based on regional wind simulations, topo-bathymetric transects measured at each location, and a nonlinear wave transformation model were employed to reconstruct multi-year runup time series. Dune morphology features and extreme water levels (excluding storm surge contributions) were further employed to determine the storm impact at each site for different return periods. Despite the similar offshore conditions along the coast, extreme water levels (i.e., runup and setup) showed intersite differences that were mainly ascribed to subaerial and submerged morphological features. Numerical results showed that the average surf zone beach slope, sandbars, berm, and dune elevation played an important role in controlling extreme water levels and storm impact at the study sites under the present climate. Moreover, in order to assess the potential effect of climate change on coastal flooding, we analyzed wave runup and storm impact in the best-preserved site by considering wave conditions and sea level rise (SLR) projections under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Modelling results suggest no significant increase in the storm impact regime between the present and future conditions in the study area unless SLR is considered. It was found that to accurately estimate SLR contribution, it should be incorporated into mean sea level prior to performing numerical wave runup simulations, rather than simply adding it to the resulting wave-induced water levels.

This study demonstrates how a multidisciplinary approach integrating geotechnical engineering, hydrology, and climate science can be employed to quantify site-specific impacts of climate change on geotechnical infrastructure. Specifically, this paper quantifies the effects of changes in future streamflow on the performance of an earthen levee in Sacramento, California, considering multiple modes of failure. The streamflows for historical (1950-2000) and projected (2049-2099) scenarios with different recurrence intervals were derived from routed hydrological simulations driven by bias-corrected global climate models. The historical and future flood levels were then applied in a set of transient coupled finite-element seepage and limit equilibrium slope stability analyses to simulate the levee subjected to extreme streamflow. Variability in hydraulic and mechanical properties of soils was addressed using a Monte Carlo sampling method to evaluate and compare the probability of failure of the levee under different historical and future climate scenarios. Three individual modes (underseepage, uplift, and slope stability) along with lower and upper bounds for the combined mode of failure were examined. The results showed that incorporating future floods into levee failure analysis led to considerable reductions in the mean factor of safety and increases in the levee's probability of failure, suggesting that risk assessment based on historical records can significantly underestimate the levee's failure probability in a warming climate. Despite inherent uncertainties in future projections and substantial variability across climate models, evaluating infrastructure against projected extremes offers insights into their likely performance for the future.

Forests annually sequester large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and store carbon above and below ground for long periods of time. Intact forests-largely free from human intervention except primarily for trails and hazard removals-are the most carbon-dense and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems, with additional benefits to society and the economy. Internationally, focus has been on preventing loss of tropical forests, yet U.S. temperate and boreal forests remove sufficient atmospheric CO2 to reduce national annual net emissions by 11%. U.S. forests have the potential for much more rapid atmospheric CO2 removal rates and biological carbon sequestration by intact and/or older forests. The recent 1.5 Degree Warming Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies reforestation and afforestation as important strategies to increase negative emissions, but they face significant challenges: afforestation requires an enormous amount of additional land, and neither strategy can remove sufficient carbon by growing young trees during the critical next decade(s). In contrast, growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential-termed proforestation-is a more effective, immediate, and low-cost approach that could be mobilized across suitable forests of all types. Proforestation serves the greatest public good by maximizing co-benefits such as nature-based biological carbon sequestration and unparalleled ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement, water and air quality, flood and erosion control, public health benefits, low impact recreation, and scenic beauty.

Where Americans live continues to dictate whether they can access cash, food, and medical assistance. What's more, immigrants, territorial residents, and tribal members encounter deteriorated corners of the American welfare state. Nonetheless, despite repeated retrenchment efforts, this patchwork of programs has proven remarkably resilient. Yet, the ability of the United States to meet its people's most basic needs now faces an unprecedented challenge: climate change. As extreme weather events like wildfires and hurricanes become more frequent and more intense, these climatefueled disasters will displace and impoverish more people.

This study quantifies the changes in return levels by fitting the stationary and nonstationary frequency distribution models for annual and seasonal high and low flows of upper Euphrates basin during historical and two projection periods. The projected flows of three selected sub-basins in the upper Euphrates were obtained using HBV-light hydrological model forced by projected daily precipitation and temperature driven from and the most representative regional climate model (RCM) for the study area within the CORDEX-Euro domain. During the historical period, analyses suggest that half of the stations exhibited an increase in return levels (up to 13.5% with GEV), while the remaining four sub-basins experience a decrease in the return levels (up to 27% with GEV). With few exceptions, most of the sub-basins experience an increase (up to 80% with GEV) in return levels of yearly low flows. With few exceptions, the return level of low flows for all seasons generally increases; however, directional variability for high flows is observed. The changes in return levels of yearly projected flows are consistent with historical results in indicating the direction of impact for both near future and far future periods. A decrease in return levels (up to 35% and 22%) in yearly high flows and an increase (up to 100% and 40%) during the near future and far future, respectively. It is projected that the floods of a given return level in the selected sub-basins are becoming milder across all three periods. However, some directional inconsistencies are noted in nonstationarity impact at seasonal scale through projection periods. On yearly basis, the decreasing high flow along with increasing low flow quantiles suggests that the range of extreme occurrences is shrinking. The nonstationarities in high flows as well as low flows should be incorporated in design and development of water resources schemes in the study area.

J	Eingrüber, N; Korres, W				Eingrueber, Nils; Korres, Wolfgang			Climate change simulation and trend analysis of extreme precipitation and floods in the mesoscale Rur catchment in western Germany until 2099 using Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) and the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT model)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change scenarios; Statistical Downscaling Model; Soil & Water Assessment Tool; Extreme precipitation indices; Flood frequency and trends; Mann-Kendall tendency tests	FUTURE CLIMATE; CHANGE IMPACTS; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; RIVER-BASIN; LARS-WG; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES; EVENTS; CIRCULATION	Due to climate change and global warming, speed and intensity of the hydrological cycle will accelerate. In order to carry out regional risk assessment, integrated water resources management and flood protection, far reaching predictions and future scenarios of climate change effects on extreme precipitation and flooding are of particular relevance. In this study, trends in frequencies of extreme precipitation and floods until 2099 are analysed for the German Rur catchment, which is half located in highlands and half in lowlands and therefore has a high topographical and climatological contrast. To predict future trends, coupled modeling is performed based on NCEP reanalysis data and a General Circulation Model (GCM). Assuming HadCM3 future emission scenarios A2a and B2a, an empirical Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) is developed and daily precipitation amounts are projected until 2099 by a stochastic weather generator. The generated precipitation data are used as an input for the ecohydrological Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT model) to simulate daily water discharge until 2099. Statistical trend analyses are implemented based on three annual extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) and the magnitudes of ten flood return periods derived with GEV and Gumbel extreme value distributions for 109 30-year moving periods using regression analyses and Mann-Kendall tendency tests to check for significant trends in the frequencies until 2099. As a result, it could be demonstrated for all EPIs that the frequency of extreme precipitation in the upper Rur catchment will significantly increase by +33% to +51% until 2099 compared to the base period 1961-1990, whereas mostly non-significant negative trends of extreme precipitation can be projected in the lowlands. For runoff, it was found that the magnitudes of the ten flood return periods will significantly increase by +31% for B2a to +36% for A2a until 2099 compared to the base period.

BLOOMS; PLATEAU LAKE DIANCHI; ALGAL BLOOMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EUTROPHIC LAKE; XIANGXI BAY; METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; YANGTZE FLOODPLAIN	Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) are expanding world-wide, adversely affecting aquatic food production, recreational and tourism activities and safe drinking water supplies. China's inland waters have been increasingly threatened by CyanoHABs during the past several decades. The environmental factors controlling CyanoHABs are highly variable in space and time in China due to significant variations in climate, geography, geological and geochemical conditions among its many regions. Here, we synthesize diverse examples among Chinese water bodies regarding interactive effects of anthropogenic, climatic and geographic drivers influencing CyanoHAB potentials and dynamics in lakes and reservoirs; in order to provide a perspective and integrative approach to mitigating CyanoHABs. In China's many shallow water bodies, water quality is highly susceptible to human activity and to changing climatic and hydrological conditions, when compared to deeper lakes. Rapid increases in population, economic activity, and wastewater have accelerated CyanoHABs in China since 1980s, especially in the heavily urbanized, agricultural and industrial regions in the middle and lower Yangtze River basins. Climatic changes have provided an additional catalyst for expansion of CyanoHABs. In particular, rising spring temperatures have accelerated the onset and proliferation of Microcystis spp, blooms in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River basin. Large hydroelectric and water supply projects, like the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), have altered hydrological regimes, and have led to an increase of CyanoHABs in reservoirs and tributaries due to increases in water residence times. Manipulating water level fluctuations in the TGR may prove useful for controlling CyanoHAB in its tributary bays. Overall,CyanoHAB mitigation strategies will have to incorporate both N and P input reductions in these shallow systems. Furthermore, nutrient reduction strategies must consider climate change-induced increases in extreme weather events, including more intense rainfall and protracted heat waves and droughts, which can extend the magnitudes and duration of CyanoHABs. Ensuring the maintenance of natural hydrologic connectivity between lakes and rivers is of utmost importance in mitigating CyanoHABs throughout China.

Each type reflects both geological setting and a Holocene geomorphic history associated with the degree of infill driven by marine and terrestrial processes. Of the 180 estuaries found within the state of New South Wales (NSW) many occur in national parks or are not significantly modified by human activities. For those estuaries where human activities are directly impacting environmental conditions and social, cultural and economic functions of the waterways, the management challenge is more complex. We combine the biophysical and socio-economic characteristics for the NSW coast to identify four "estuary contexts", referred to as: 1) intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs), 2) coastal lakes, 3) deltaic floodplains, and 4) drowned river valleys. Each context may require different governance arrangements to address the coastal management requirements as outlined in recently introduced NSW legislation and planning policy. Such arrangements become especially urgent given threats facing private and public assets in low-lying locations around the shores of these estuaries as sea level continues to rise and climate change adaptation strategies set out in local government Coastal Management Programs are developed and implemented.

FLOOD SUSCEPTIBILITY ANALYSIS USING FREELY AVAILABLE DATA, GIS, AND FREQUENCY RATIO MODEL FOR NAGPUR, INDIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						flood modeling; remote sensing; inland cities; climate change; urban flooding	STATISTICAL-MODELS; BIVARIATE; REGIONS	Nagpur, the geographical center of India, has witnessed flooding consistently for the past ten years due to urbanization and climate change. Cities like Nagpur, which are newly prone to disasters, need to identify flood-prone areas for planning city development and mitigation measures. Developing countries lack data to generate susceptibility maps, thus remote sensing (RS) and GIS have been used in this study. Ten flood-causing parameters namely altitude, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), landuse/landcover (LULC), soil texture, rainfall, surface runoff, distance from river, lithology and landforms, have been mapped for Nagpur on ArcGIS10.8 using freely available data. The frequency ratio (FR) model has been adopted, with 70% of flood locations used for machine learning and the remaining 30% for validation. Parameters of surface runoff (FR up to 4.30), landform (FR up to 3.58), lithology (FR up to 2.36), and high rainfall (FR up to 1.82) have shown a maximum positive relationship with the flood-prone areas. The results having 80.90% accuracy and validation of 81.58%. proved that the selected parameters can be robustly adopted for mapping flood susceptible areas.	[Gaurkhede, N. T.; Adane, V.

Since the 1950s, gradual changes and an increase in climate warming have been observed. Previous research has been indicating potential associations between climate warming and spatiotemporal changes in precipitation. Moreover, the regional patterns of precipitation have a key role in the continuous monitoring of climate characteristics and natural hazards such as floods and droughts. Therefore, precise and accurate measurements of precipitation concentration and spatiotemporal variability in their patterns are very crucial. In this study, a new method for measuring precipitation concentration is developed and applied to 54 meteorological stations in Pakistan. Furthermore, to assess the precipitation patterns, the proposed method provides solid evidence for considering the effect of temperatures under climate warming. Furthermore, using the spatial correlation between the proposed method and its competitor, a comparative analysis is made to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Moreover, the spatial variability structure in various precipitation patterns is assessed and compared using spatial predictive maps. Outcomes associated with this research show significant deviations between the proposed method and the existing one. These findings can contribute to a better understanding of precipitation concentration in relation to climate warming.

In this paper, we examine and compare how global crises and local disasters influence public perceptions of multiple hazards in Italy and Sweden. To this end, we integrate information about the occurrence of hazardous events with the results of two nationwide surveys. These included more than 4000 participants and were conducted in two different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic corresponding to low (August 2020) and high (November 2020) levels of infection rates. We found that, in both countries, people are more worried about risks related to experienced events. This is in line with the cognitive process known as the availability heuristic: individuals assess the risk associated with a given hazard based on how easily it comes to their mind. Epidemics, for example, are perceived as less likely and more impactful in Italy compared to Sweden. This outcome can be explained by cross-country differences in the impact of, as well as governmental responses to, COVID-19. Notwithstanding the ongoing pandemic, people in both Italy and Sweden are highly concerned about climate change, and they rank it as the most likely threat.

Impact of droughts on industrial emissions into surface waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Drought; Industrial emissions; Surface waters; Toxics Release Inventory; Publicly owned treatment facilities; Environmental justice	HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES; CLIMATE-CHANGE	In this paper, we examine the impact of droughts on industrial emissions into surface waters and transfers to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). We use industrial discharges into surface waters data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database. We employ runoffs normalized using previous 61-year average runoffs as a proxy for drought. We match both the discharges into surface waters and the runoffs at the 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) level. Our analysis indicates that normalized runoffs of the current and previous years positively influence industrial emissions into surface waters. We also find that the impact of uneven availability of water on emissions is higher on larger facilities. Normalized runoffs of the current and previous years do not have a statistically significant influence on transfers to publicly owned treatment works. However, normalized runoffs of the previous year do affect transfers of larger facilities. Businesses are dependent on water not only for their operations but to discharge their pollutants as well. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods. Therefore, every business that requires significant quantities of water must plan to cope with uneven availability of water.

Due to this, a question that every urban area must answer is: Are we ready to face these new challenges? The renovation of all the pipes that compose the drainage system is not a feasible solution, and, therefore, the use of new solutions is an increasing trend, leading to a new operational paradigm where water is stored in the system and released at a controlled rate. Hence, technologies, such as stormwater tanks, are being implemented in different cities. This research sought to understand how Climate Change would affect future precipitation, and based on the results, applied two different approaches to determine the optimal location and sizing of storage units, through the application of the Simulated Annealing and Pseudo-Genetic Algorithms. In this process, a strong component of computational modeling was applied in order to allow the optimization algorithms to efficiently reach near-optimal solutions. These approaches were tested in two stormwater networks at Bogota, Colombia, considering three different rainfall scenarios.

In this study, we simulated the current and future snowmelt runoff in a poorly gauged river basin of the Hindukush region under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate change scenarios. Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) furnished with satellite snow cover maps and hydro-meteorological data were used to simulate the daily river discharge for the period 2000-2005. The results indicated that SRM has effectually simulated the runoff in Chitral River with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.85 (0.84) and 0.88 (0.83) in the basin-wide (zone-wise) application during the calibration and validation periods, respectively. The results obtained under future climate change scenario showed similar to 14-19% increase in mean summer discharge under three mid-21(st) century RCP (2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) scenarios. While an increase of similar to 13-37% is expected under late-21(st) century RCP scenarios. This study can help water resource managers to plan and manage peak discharges from the Chitral River Basin in the future and can thus prevent major losses due to floods in the area.

Dynamic flood modeling essential to assess the coastal impacts of climate change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIFF RETREAT; WATER LEVELS; PACIFIC; EROSION; PROJECTIONS; STORM; SHORE; VULNERABILITY; STATISTICS	Coastal inundation due to sea level rise (SLR) is projected to displace hundreds of millions of people worldwide over the next century, creating significant economic, humanitarian, and national-security challenges. However, the majority of previous efforts to characterize potential coastal impacts of climate change have focused primarily on long-term SLR with a static tide level, and have not comprehensively accounted for dynamic physical drivers such as tidal non-linearity, storms, short-term climate variability, erosion response and consequent flooding responses. Here we present a dynamic modeling approach that estimates climate-driven changes in flood-hazard exposure by integrating the effects of SLR, tides, waves, storms, and coastal change (i.e. beach erosion and cliff retreat). We show that for California, USA, the world's 5th largest economy, over $150 billion of property equating to more than 6% of the state's GDP and 600,000 people could be impacted by dynamic flooding by 2100; a three-fold increase in exposed population than if only SLR and a static coastline are considered. The potential for underestimating societal exposure to coastal flooding is greater for smaller SLR scenarios, up to a seven-fold increase in exposed population and economic interests when considering storm conditions in addition to SLR. These results highlight the importance of including climate-change driven dynamic coastal processes and impacts in both short-term hazard mitigation and long-term adaptation planning.

We investigated fisheries of the Lower Amazon in Brazil using a wavelet analysis of a 13-year data series of fishery catches, environmental variables, and climatic indices, to determine how these variables affected catches of different species. The catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of gillnet and line fisheries increased over time. Relative humidity, latent heat, and sea surface temperatures influenced productivity of both fisheries. El Nino had a negative and immediate effect on gillnet CPUE, while its effect on line fishing was positive, with an eight month lag. Our findings indicate that fishery productivity was modulated by climate events, which influenced ecosystems and modified habitats and ecological niches, and thereby impacted fishery productivity.

To interpret river loads of metals and SSC we have furthermore followed meteorological trends since 1961 and additionally calculated future trends for the Gothenburg region, located on the west coast of Sweden. During periods of a short-term increase in precipitation we found an increased particle bound metal transport in urban watercourses of the Gota alv River. In addition, a correlation between studied parameters indicates that surface runoff from brownfields most likely is the main source to the increased transport of pollutants in river systems rather than re-suspension of polluted river sediment.

Evidence of Range Shifts in Riparian Plant Assemblages in Response to Multidecadal Streamflow Declines	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate change; environmental flows; LiDAR; Mediterranean climate; range contraction; recruitment; riparian vegetation; stream flow decline	SOUTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEUCOPOGON ERICACEAE; TREE RECRUITMENT; VEGETATION; RIVER; DROUGHT; DISTURBANCE; MIGRATION; EXPANSION	Riparian corridors are thought to form hydrological refugia that may buffer species and communities against regional climate changes. In regions facing a warming and drying climate, however, the hydrological regime driving riparian communities is also under threat. We examined recruitment in response to streamflow declines for species inhabiting the riparian zone in southwest Western Australia, testing the extent to which the riparian system has buffered riparian communities from the drying climate. We stratified 49 vegetation transects across the >600 mm per annum regional rainfall gradient encompassed by the Warren River Catchment. Local hydrological conditions were estimated over two 10-year periods; 1980-1989, and 2001-2010, to quantify changes in the flood regime. Mixed effects models tested the relationship between rainfall and flooding on the relative frequency of immature to mature individuals of 17 species of trees and shrubs common to the riparian zones. At the low-rainfall extent of their geographic range, the relative frequency of immature riparian species decreased with declining flow, whereas at the high-rainfall extent of their geographic range the relative frequency of immature individuals increased with declining flow. These results suggest that the geographic ranges of riparian species may be contracting at the low-rainfall margin of their range, while at the high-rainfall margin of their geographic range, reduced flooding regimes appear to be opening up new habitat suitable for recruitment and narrowing the river corridor. No such patterns were observed in upland species, suggesting the river may be buffering upland species. We discuss these findings and their implications for ongoing management and species conservation in a region projected to face further, significant rainfall declines.

Forecasting the phenology of fish migration is thus critically important to implement management actions aimed at protecting fish during their migration. In this study, an 11-year monitoring survey of Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar) from the Ourthe River, Belgium, was analysed within a European Special Area of Conservation to improve the understanding of environment-induced spring migration. A logistic model was fitted to forecast smolt migration and to calculate phenological indicators for management, i.e. the onset, end, and duration of migration, while accounting for the influence of photoperiod, water temperature, and hydrological conditions. The results indicated that the photo-thermal units accumulated by smolts above a 7 degrees C temperature threshold was a relevant proxy to reflect the synergistic effect between temperature and photoperiod on smolt migration. After integrating the effect of river flow pulses, the model accurately explained the inter-annual changes in migration timing (R-2= 0.95). The model predictions provide decisive management information to identify sensitive periods during which mitigation measures (e.g. hydropower turbine shutdown, river discharge management) should be conducted to promote smolt survival. The model was used to predict phenological characteristics under future scenarios of climate change. The results suggest a joint effect of hydrological alterations and water warming. Temperature increases of 1-4 degrees C were associated with earlier initiation of migration, 6-51 days earlier, and spring flood events greatly influenced the duration of the migration period. Accordingly, the combined effects of human-induced modifications of the hydrological regimes and increasing temperatures could result in a mismatch between the smolt and favourable survival conditions in the marine environment.

The assessment under different scenarios is carried out using Aqueduct Global Flood Analyzer in which all the analyses are based on the gross domestic product (GDP), population, and the present and future (2030) urban damage. In this study, to effectively estimate future changes, three scenarios were employed, namely, IPCC Scenario A2, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenario which represents climate change, and the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenario which represents socio-economic change. All these scenarios were employed from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report. To determine current mean monthly precipitation, 1981-2010 data were used and Meteonorm V7 software was employed for the generation of the mean monthly precipitation from 2011 to 2100. The level of flood protection employed is a 10-year one which is used to identify the population at risk, the effects of this event on the GDP and to determine the rate at which urban damage is happening. Utilizing Meteonorm V7 software, average monthly precipitation is predicted. This study determined that, in any year, the majority of Zimbabwe has a low to medium (2-3% probability) flood occurrence in which a 10-year flood has a 10% occurrence probability in any given year. If there is no flood protection employed, this 10-year flood could cause around 74.9 million USD affected GDP, 119 thousand affected population and 49.5 million USD urban damage. As much as it is impossible to eliminate drought and flood events, a diminution approach and proper planning and preparation before their occurrence reduce the economic and social losses.

In this study, a comparative analysis between historical data (1971-2013) and future climate change scenarios (2010-2039, 2040-2069 and 2070-2099) of the hydrological regime in the Eo river, in the north of Spain, is carried out in order to assess the ecological and hydro-geomorphological risks over the short-, medium- and long-term. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied on a daily basis to assess climate-induced hydrological changes in the river under five general circulation models and two representative concentration pathways. Statistical results, both in calibration (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE): 0.73, percent bias (PBIAS): 3.52, R-2: 0.74) and validation (NSE: 0.62, PBIAS: 6.62, R-2: 0.65), are indicative of the SWAT model's good performance. The ten climate scenarios pointed out a reduction in rainfall (up to -22%) and an increase in temperatures, both maximum (from +1 to +7 degrees C) and minimum ones (from +1 to +4 degrees C). Predicted flow rates resulted in an incrementally greater decrease the longer the term is, varying between -5% (in short-term) and -53% (in long-term). The free software IAHRIS (Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration in Rivers) determined that alteration for usual values remains between excellent and good status and from good to moderate in drought values, but flood values showed a deficient regime in most scenarios, which implies an instability of river morphology, a progressive reduction in the section of the river and an advance of aging of riparian habitat, endangering the renewal of the species.

UIB water supplies are mostly contributed from the high-altitude snow and glacier fields situated in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayan ranges. Any change in the flows of these river catchments due to climate variability may result in the form of catastrophic events like floods and droughts and hence will adversely affect the economy of Pakistan. This study aims to simulate snowmelt runoff in a mountainous sub-catchment (Shyok River basin) of the UIB under climate change scenarios. Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) coupled with remotely sensed snow cover product (MOD10A2) is used to simulate the snowmelt runoff under current and future climate scenarios in the study area. The results indicate that (a) SRM has efficiently simulated the flow in Shyok River with average Nash-Sutcliff coefficient value (R-2) of 0.8 (0.63-0.93) for all six years (2000-2006) of basin-wide and zone-wise simulations, (b) an increase of 10% (by 2050) and 20% (by 2075) in SCA will result in a flow rise of similar to 11% and similar to 20%, respectively, and (c) an increase of 1 degrees C (by 2025), 2 degrees C (by 2050), 3 degrees C (by 2075) and 4 degrees C (by 2100) in mean temperature will result in a flow rise of similar to 26%, similar to 54%, similar to 81% and similar to 118%, respectively. This study suggests that SRM equipped with remotely sensed snow cover data is an effective tool to estimate snowmelt runoff in high mountain data-scarce environments.

The current work compares the drivers of hydrological flux changes and flood reoccurrences in the Lijiang River basin. Using satellite images, SWAT and HEC-HMS models, Mann-Kendall and Minitab trend tests, analysis on climatic as well as land use/land cover changes (LULCC) were carried out statistically. Daily hydrometeorological data were quantitatively analyzed during 1967-2016 for fluctuation regime and pattern recognition. A more uneven rainfall pattern in recent decades was found aligned with the excessive runoff. The average temperature and relative humidity have continuously increased by 0.96 degrees C and decreased by 3 %, respectively during the last 50 years. Land use maps were used to observe the watershed land conversion during pre/post-development via GIS. Although up to 76 % increase in urbanized areas was detected; however, only 0.6 % of LULCC was noticed which had a 0.1 % change in the curve number (CN) in the entire watershed. HEC-HMS model results revealed negligible changes of hydrographs with and without LULCC. Our study suggests that the main cause of the recent flood upward trends is ascribed to the precipitation pattern changes as a response to global warming, rather than LULCC. The result is underpinned by a rise in the extreme intensity rainfall event's frequency. The need for sustainable development to adapt to the new situation was supported by the outcomes.

Such events commonly have a severe impact on major cities. Especially in Brazilian cities, the combination of climate change and unplanned urban growth on steep slopes has led to floods and landslides that killed thousands of people over the past decade. Once an extreme event impacts a city, a series of emergency events (henceforth named e-events) are registered by the citizens (by calling the local emergency telephone number). These e-events may vary from a small flood to a large-scale landslide. Thus, it is a top priority for governments to respond to these e-events as fast and as efficiently as possible. The problem is that the number of e-events is usually larger than the number of people (and vehicles) to respond to them. Another challenge is that these vehicles have to cross an impacted city with major traffic jams. The routes have to consider real-time traffic data to avoid streets with heavy traffic. This article proposes an approach named IRONSTONE, which aims at collecting the topology of the city and real-time traffic data to generate optimized routes for teams to respond to e-events. The proposed approach was evaluated with real scenarios of the city of Niteroi and the results are promising.

These developments generally lead to an increase in the risk of coastal flooding. This article focuses on systems to protect against this hazard, and presents a bibliographical analysis on methods and operational tools to strengthen their resilience. This analysis is carried out by considering that a system of protection is a component of the territory to which it provides protection and that it is therefore necessary to study in depth the relations between this system and the various components of the territory (the natural environment, the built environment and the social and institutional environment). Based on this hypothesis, the concepts of risk and resilience applied to floods are specified and the protection and adaptation strategies commonly used in recent decades are described. This retrospective on concepts and strategies leads us to structure the state-of-the-art analysis on methods and operational tools in relation to two issues: 1) understanding risks; 2) adapting and transforming protection systems. In each case, the use of the concept of resilience implies a clear distinction between systemic and analytical approaches. Finally, this bibliographical analysis reveals the need to revise the protection system concept in order to promote the integration of these systems in the territories. Accordingly, new methodological developments could be considered using ecosystem and socio-economic approaches.

Hydroclimatic impact on mediterranean tree crops area - Mapping hydrological extremes (drought/flood) prone parcels	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydroclimatic extremes; SPI; Olive, citrus and avocado trees; GIS; Adaptability to climate change	STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; MODELS; METHODOLOGY; RAJASTHAN; CYCLE; RISK	Hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods are recognized as environmental disasters causing several negative effects especially on the agricultural section. These phenomena and their proper management have attracted the attention of hydrologists and agricultural scientists. This paper evaluates the climate change effects on hydrological extremes based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in the North-Western part of Crete (Greece) for the period of 1960-2019. This area is considered to be one of the most important agricultural regions in the Mediterranean, dominated by tree cultivations. The climate trend line for SPI values shows slight decrease, indicating more intense dry periods for the next decades, especially for semi-mountainous areas. A notable result of this analysis is that more frequent dry and wet spells have appeared in the last three decades. In addition, a fuzzy based GIS modeling approach for estimating both droughts and floods prone areas named "SPIsERS" is developed, incorporating the special distribution of long-term time period Standardized Precipitation Index (SPIs), Evapotranspiration, Runoff accumulation and Soil available water capacity. The proposed methodology was validated for several flood and drought affected areas that have been historically recorded in the study area. According to the results 24.67% of the total tree crops parcels in the study region is prone to hydrological extremes (droughts or floods). Finally, for adapting to the inevitable adverse effects of climate change, water-saving and flood protection measures for Mediterranean tree crops areas are proposed.

In a globally connected economy, damages can cause remote perturbations and cascading consequences-a ripple effect along supply chains. Here we show an economic ripple resonance that amplifies losses when consecutive or overlapping weather extremes and their repercussions interact. This amounts to an average amplification of 21% for climate-induced heat stress, river floods, and tropical cyclones. Modeling the temporal evolution of 1.8 million trade relations between >7000 regional economic sectors, we find that the regional responses to future extremes are strongly heterogeneous also in their resonance behavior. The induced effect on welfare varies between gains due to increased demand in some regions and losses due to demand or supply shortages in others. Within the current global supply network, the ripple resonance effect of extreme weather is strongest in high-income economies-an important effect to consider when evaluating past and future economic climate impacts.

This landscape is characterized by wide floodplains and various terrace levels at different elevations. A set of older terraces with ages between 50 and > 200 ka occupy the higher portions of central Amazonia, whereas multiple terraces next to floodplains occur at lower elevations and display ages of a few thousand years. These lower terraces, referred to as middle-lower terraces, reveal what can be perceived as a stochastic pattern both in space and time. Despite the widespread occurrence of these geomorphic features, no process-oriented analysis has been conducted to explain their formation. Here, we develop a landscape evolution model referred to as SPASE (Sedimentary Processes and Alluvial Systems Evolution) to explicitly account for fluvial erosion and deposition in combination with lateral channel migration to explore the controls on terrace development. The model results show that the higher terraces were deposited under the condition of a higher base level for the basins upstream of the confluence between the Solimoes and Negro rivers. The subsequent decrease in the base level initiated a phase of gradual incision, thereby resulting in the current fluvial configuration. The model also predicts that high-frequency climate changes resulted in the construction of middle-lower terraces at various elevations which, however, are all situated at lower elevation than the higher terrace levels. Our model shows that dry-to-wet shifts in climate, in relation to the modern situation, yield a landscape architecture where middle-lower terrace levels are better preserved than wet-to-dry changes in climate, again if the current situation is considered as reference. Finally, our results show that fast and widespread landscape changes possibly occurred in response to high-frequency climate changes in central Amazonia, at least since the Late Pleistocene, with great implications for the distribution and connectivity of different biotic environments in the region. Because of this short timescale of response to external perturbations, we suggest that the streams in central Amazonia possibly also respond in rapid and sensitive ways to human perturbations.

However, few studies have compared and analyzed the livelihood vulnerability and adaptation strategies of farmers in different disaster-threatened areas under the background of climate change. Based on survey data of 327 households in the areas threatened by mountain floods, landslides and debris flow in Sichuan Province, this study analyzed the characteristics of livelihood vulnerability and adaptation strategies of households in the areas threatened by different disaster types and constructed multinomial logistic regression models to explore their correlations. The findings show that: (1) The livelihood vulnerability indices of farmers in different hazard types showed different characteristics. Among them, the livelihood vulnerability index of farmers in landslide-threatened zones is the highest, followed by the livelihood vulnerability index of farmers in debris-flow-threatened zones, and finally the livelihood vulnerability index of farmers in flash flood threat zones. At the same time, all three natural hazards show a trend of higher vulnerability in the sensitivity dimension than in the exposure and livelihood resilience dimensions. (2) The nonfarming livelihood strategy is the main livelihood strategy for farmers in different disaster-type-threatened areas. At the same time, the vulnerability of farmers choosing the nonfarming livelihood strategy is much higher than that of farmers choosing the part-time livelihood strategy and pure farming livelihood strategy, and the vulnerability of sensitivity dimension is higher than that of the exposure dimension and livelihood resilience dimension. (3) For farmers in landslide- and debris-flow-threatened areas, livelihood resilience is an important factor affecting their livelihood strategy. There was a positive correlation between livelihood resilience and farmers' choice of pure agricultural livelihood strategies in these two natural-disaster-threatened areas. This study deepens our understanding of the characteristics and relationships of farmers' livelihood vulnerability and adaptation strategies under different disaster types in the context of climate change, and then provides the reference basis for the formulation of livelihood-adaptive capacity promotion-related policy.

The aerobic rice system can be a transformational approach to replace conventional rice in the face of climate change and scarcity of resources due to its high input-use efficiency. However, it could not be adapted widely yet due to several challenges like higher weed infestation and low nitrogen (N) use efficiencies. This transformed system can only be adapted at a wider scale through investigation of associated constraints and risks and provision of potential adjustive measures. Aerobic rice crop failure can be reduced if the availability of suit-able and stress-resistant cultivars with early improved vigour, and short-duration characteristics are ensured for maintaining the reproductive capability under resource stressed environment. This transformed rice sys-tem exhibits limited response to applied N because of increased losses due to higher volatilization and rapid coupled nitrification-denitrification processes under alternate wetting and drying systems. Shifting from the flooded to aerobic rice system bringing changes in crop water demand, organic matter (OM) turnover, N dynamics, weed flora, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. Along with N-losses, continuous monocrop-ping, higher weed infestation, weedy rice emergence, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, nutrient disorders, higher prevalence of pathogens and diseases, increased panicle sterility, and an increase in soilborne patho-gens lodging are other major constraints negatively impacting the widespread adaptation of aerobic rice. This article reviews the climate change status, its associated impacts on the sustainability of traditional rice systems, and the rationale for transforming from traditional to aerobic rice systems. Furthermore, it describes the major challenges associated with the aerobic rice system, thereby presenting management strategies ensuring its wider adaptation for sustainable rice production in the face of projected climate change and scarcity of resources.

Those have caused unprecedented losses of human lives and property in some countries, affecting the livelihoods of many people. Climate change and natural disasters are the two hotspots of scientific research today, and there is a certain degree of correlation between the two. Although countries worldwide have long known about climate change and its threats to human existence and have been discussing countermeasures, they have still not been able to carry out concerted and practical actions. The study takes Canada as an example, and selects six representative provinces to evaluate the temporal change characteristics of extreme temperature at different sites. We use MATLAB software to perform multiple linear regression, linear fitting methods, and Pearson correlation analysis to analyze spatial changes and time-space trends. The method studies the relationship between the emergence of extreme weather and climate change and uses the evolutionary game theory to explore whether there is any contradiction between global warming and extreme local cold. The study found: (i) The maximum temperature of most provinces in Canada will be constantly higher, and the minimum temperature will be lower. Generally speaking, the average temperature of each year is slowly decreasing. (ii) The average temperature data of British Columbia (Eastern Pacific) and Quebec (West Atlantic) show that ocean temperature has a specific effect on land temperature in surrounding areas. (iii) Pearson correlation analysis shows that the emergence of extreme weather is closely related to climate change. (iv) The evolution path of the two-party game shows that global warming and the occurrence of extreme local cold are not contradictory. Under the conditions, there is a certain degree of synchronization between the two, interacting and influencing each other.

Flood Risk and Vulnerability from a Changing Climate Perspective: An Overview Focusing on Flash Floods and Associated Hazards in Jeddah	WATER			English	Review						floods; flash floods; Jeddah City; hazards; climate change; SDG6	SAUDI-ARABIA; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; KINGDOM; AREA; MANAGEMENT; INTENSITY	Natural hazard threats have grown as a result of climate change, fast demographic development, and major urbanization. Devastating floods have occurred in several areas of the world recently, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is located in a region with a dry environment. In arid or semi-arid regions, rapidly forming flash floods associated with debris flowing down over dry water courses leading to a potential threat to both lives and property. Being located at the coastal plain of western Saudi Arabia, Jeddah City has witnessed an unexpected amount of rainfall events in recent years. Such extreme rainfall events, integrated with other factors, namely topography, land use, surface runoff, etc., have led to flood generation, which is alarming indeed. Herein, this paper addresses the varying climatic classifications of the Kingdom, its risk and vulnerability, followed by reasoning about the impact of flash flood events and the associated casualties and property losses. Further, it reports about the existing strategies of the government and proposes a systematic way forward on how to alleviate such events in future. Thus, risk variables have been discovered and integrated in the context of climate change and rising anthropogenic strain on coastal communities to give planners and decision makers tools to assure effective and appropriate flood risk management.

Our main objective was to study the water quality and to assess the bacteriological and eutrophication risks in the temperate shallow urban lagoon of the Parque Unzue (Gualeguaychu, Argentina), and to predict these risks in climate change scenarios considering the temperature and the rains as indicators. This urban shallow lagoon is in a recreative multiuse park (Gualeguaychu city), in the floodplain of the Gualeguaychu river in the Center-East of Argentina (Neotropical region). Twenty-seven sampling in 3 sampling points (n = 81) were carried out during 2015-2019, and physicochemical and bacteriological parameters were measured. Phosphorus, organic matter, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and total coliforms (TC) frequently had a moderate and very high contamination factor (CF), and the pollution load index (PLI) indicated contamination with a frequency of 74.1 %. Moreover, the index (WQI) indicated poor (66.7 %) and good (33.3 %) water quality. Bacteriological and eutrophication predictive risk models showed an increase of the TC and the Chl-a concentration generating a current and future high risk of contamination of the lagoon under climate change scenarios that could generate ecosystemic function losses in the short-term.

Cities in the PRD are vitally important to China in relation to their socio-economic contributions. From recent evidence, this strongly urbanized area is vulnerable to, and currently facing bigger incidences of, coastal and urban flooding. Flood risk is growing in low-lying coastal areas due to rapid urbanization and increasing flood hazards exacerbated by climate change. Frequent intensive rainstorms, sea-level rise, typhoons and surges threaten large populations and their economic assets, causing severe socio-economic and ecological impacts in the PRD cities. Current flood risk management (FRM) in the delta is still predominately focused on using traditional techno-fixes and infrastructure paradigms, lacking sufficient strategic planning and flood protection to develop adequate flood resilience. Recent urban floods, enhanced by storm surges and intensive rainstorms, have affected multiple PRD cities and drawn attention to flood risk as a major challenge in the PRD's coastal cities. This review encourages development of long-term FRM practices with provincial and municipal authorities working together more closely to develop better-integrated regional FRM strategies for the PRD.

Flood inundation occurring in deltaic environments are caused by both river runoff and tides. Furthermore, flood risk in deltas can be exacerbated by composite driving forces, such as future climate change, land-use change, and sea-level rise. Flood hazard maps have provided one way to visualize flood risk, and are generally created with future projection. However, existing hazard maps have not incorporated the tidal effect and have not assessed the impact of these three future driving factors simultaneously. Here we presented a method to quantify and visualize the tidal effect on flood inundation under current and future scenarios by coupling rainfall-runoff and inundation models, and tide level data. We found simulations of the composite future scenario indicate a 1.27-fold increase in the inundation area, with a two-fold increase in the extent of the tidal effect for the case of a with any return period rainfall event. These achievements can be used to provide flood hazard maps that also visualize the tidal effect. This new information will enhance our understanding of flood risk in low-lying areas and contribute further to disaster risk reduction.

In this study, the large-scale distributed variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model was used to simulate future hydrological processes in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin (YZRB), China, with a combination of the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, fifth phase) and MIROC5 (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, fifth version) datasets. The results indicate that the performance of the VIC model is suitable for the case study, and the variation in runoff is remarkably consistent with that of precipitation, which exhibits a decreasing trend for the period 2046?2060 and an increasing trend for 2086?2100. The seasonality of runoff is evident, and substantial increases are projected for spring runoff, which might result from the increase in precipitation as well as the increase in the warming-induced melting of snow, glaciers and frozen soil. Moreover, evapotranspiration exhibits an increase between 2006?2020 and 2046?2060 over the entire basin, and soil moisture decreases in upstream areas and increases in midstream and downstream areas. For 2086?2100, both evapotranspiration and soil moisture increase slightly in the upstream and midstream areas and decrease slightly in the downstream area. The findings of this study could provide references for runoff forecasting and ecological protection for similar studies in the future.

In this study, we characterize the swings between flood and drought events and assess their spatiotemporal frequency and magnitude under climate change. Different scenarios for nonstationary flood and drought swings are investigated over three major river basins in northwest North America. In addition, two novel indices are developed to quantify the severity of the compound flood and drought events in a changing climate. The frequency of flood-to-drought events is projected to increase, with occurrences at the 1.5 degrees C global warming level happening almost twice than that of the base period. Such transitions are expected to occur more frequently if the world progressively warms. Additionally, the transition time of flood-to-drought events is projected to decrease across all three basins in the study area. Even though drought-to-flood events are expected to become less frequent in a changing climate, the southwest Columbia basin stands out as a hotspot for such transitions. Furthermore, floods are expected to occur earlier in the season, while droughts are projected to occur later, highlighting the increasing variability of floods and droughts of compound hydroclimatic events in a warming world. Additionally, there is a possibility of increased severity for such compound events if global warming is not limited. Our findings assert the necessity of integrating mitigation measures targeting lagged compound flood and drought events into disaster risk reduction strategies.

Climate change-triggered vulnerability assessment of the flood-prone communities in Bangladesh: A gender perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Adaptive capacity; Flood; Gendered vulnerability; Gender-based livelihood vulnerability index; (GLVI); Vulnerability assessment	ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CHANGE ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; DISASTER; FRAMEWORK	Despite a significant development in vulnerability scholarship, how climatic drivers compounding with non-climatic forces cause differential vulnerability to climatic change is very scant. The purpose of this research is to illustrate the differential vulnerability of rural populations to floods in Bangladesh. To achieve this goal, empirical data - both primary and secondary - were procured. A quantitative research design was applied using a structured interview technique to collect field data. Secondary data on rainfall and temperature were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD). We assessed gender differential vulnerability using Hahn et al.'s Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). Our empirical findings revealed that women had a greater vulnerability to flooding with an LVI score of 0.550 compared to their men counterparts (0.484). Vulnerability varies in terms of health, water, food, sanitation, socio-demographic aptitudes, and agriculture-based livelihood, and floods. We also found that women's adaptive capacities (e.g., knowledge, and skills) were more potential to undermine flood vulnerability. While both men and women experienced high flood exposure, women were highly sensitive to flood hazards because of their social roles, locations, unequal access to decision-making power, and resource entitlements. Also, the intersection of diverse social disparities undermines adaptive capacity and reshapes exposure and sensitivity to floods. Our research, therefore, suggested that risk-driven plans and policy interventions are required to reduce the impacts of intersectional factors that cause greater gender-differentiated vulnerability. Future research further can examine how places and multifaced social factors interact and intersect in producing differential susceptibility to climate change in the developing world.

In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the UDS of Gurugram City, India, through the concepts of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) is presented. A stormwater management model (SWMM) was set up to model the existing UDS response to a design storm of a 5-year return period. The increase in percentage imperviousness (due to urbanization) and rainfall intensity (due to climate change) are considered the governing factors for functional failures. The results revealed climate change to be a more severe threat to UDS than urbanization, while their combinations can further worsen the repercussions. The structural failure was modelled using the single link-failure scenarios, where 3 and 12 conduits possessed low resilience and no resilience (severe), respectively. The role of SuDS in enhancing the resilience of UDS was assessed by simulating all these functional and structural failure scenarios for three SuDS-implemented conditions, i.e., only infiltration trenches (SuD(SIT)), only retention ponds (SuD(SRP)), and both of them together (SuD(SIT+RP)). The SuDS abated the flood magnitudes, delayed the time to peak flow, and stored an additional volume of water within the catchment, thereby justifying their efficacy to mitigate the pluvial flood and enhance the resilience of UDS. The findings of this study encourage implementing SuDS over the developing countries to bring down the frequency of urban floods.

A Stepwise and Dynamic C-Vine Copula-Based Approach for Nonstationary Monthly Streamflow Forecasts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Monthly streamflow prediction; Dynamic C-vine copula; Nonstationarity; Generalized additive models with location; scale; and shape (GAMLSS); Climate change	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; RIVER FLOOD HAZARD; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YANGTZE-RIVER; MODELS; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE	In recent years, the stationary assumption of hydroclimatic variables as well as their temporal and spatial dependence structure have been challenged due to anthropogenic and climate changes. This study developed a stepwise and dynamic C-vine copula-based conditional model (SDCVC) to incorporate the nonstationarity into a monthly streamflow prediction, which depicted the predictor-predictand association on the basis of monthly streamflow and rainfall series of upstream and downstream stations in the Yangtze River basin of China. The model consists of (1) nonstationary modeling of the margins and nonstationary temporal and spatial dependence structure by the generalized additive models with location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) and C-vine copula incorporating climate-related indexes as covariates during training time frames; and (2) a four-dimensional C-vine copula-based conditional quantile function to generate the simulated series during validation time frames. Three kinds of nonstationary models corresponding to different degrees were investigated to show the impact of nonstationarity on the streamflow forecasting. The proposed SDCVC model considering highest degree of nonstationarity outperformed the other two nonstationary models in terms of the performance metrics, because the SDCVC model not only described the dynamic change of time-varying connections between parameter and the large-scale climate forcings, but the stepwise strategy, by selecting the optimum time horizon, helped increase forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, the SDCVC model is superior, to some extent, to classical data-driven approaches [support vector regression (SVR) and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)] in terms of the performance metrics.

A broad picture of climate change is not sufficient to carry out an impact assessment on a regional scale. Recent news on the occurrence of floods on a regional scale over India throws an urgent need to look at the patterns of changes in rainfall on a more regional scale. Kerala, the southwestern state of the Indian peninsula, is known to be the gateway of monsoon for the summer monsoon season to the mainland. This study is evaluating the causes of the recent variability in the rainfall pattern over Kerala during the southwest monsoon season. It is found that the Kerala rainfall is decreasing at the rate of 3 mm/year for the past 100 years, with an abrupt decrease of 6.7 mm/year after 1960. The causes of such a decrease are a point of discussion in this study. It is found that the ocean parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean heat content and ocean heat fluxes are increasing at an alarming rate in the recent decade over the North West Equatorial Indian Ocean, including the Arabian sea. The pattern of the Findlater jet and the ocean response clearly identifies the North West Equatorial Indian Ocean as a hot spot which creates maximum variability in the southwest monsoon dynamics.

This study reveals the spatial variability of rainfall trends in Sri Lanka from 1989 to 2019 as an indication of climate change. The exclusivity of the study is the use of rainfall data that provide spatial variability instead of the traditional location-based approach. Henceforth, daily rainfall data available at Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation corrected with stations (CHIRPS) data were used for this study. The geographic information system (GIS) is used to perform spatial data analysis on both vector and raster data. Sen's slope estimator and the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test are used to investigate the trends in annual and seasonal rainfall throughout all districts and climatic zones of Sri Lanka. The most important thing reflected in this study is that there has been a significant increase in annual rainfall from 1989 to 2019 in all climatic zones (wet, dry, intermediate, and Semi-arid) of Sri Lanka. The maximum increase is recorded in the wet zone and the minimum increase is in the semi-arid zone. There could be an increased risk of floods in the southern and western provinces in the future, whereas areas in the eastern and southeastern districts may face severe droughts during the northeastern monsoon. It is advisable to introduce effective drought and flood management and preparedness measures to reduce the respective hazard risk levels.

Here we simulate the river-floodplain-reservoir inundation dynamics over the MRB for 1979-2016 period using a newly integrated, high-resolution (similar to 5 km) river hydrodynamics-reservoir operation model. The framework is based on the river-floodplain hydrodynamic model CaMa-Flood in which a new reservoir operation scheme is incorporated by including 86 existing MRB dams. The simulated flood extent is downscaled to a higher resolution (similar to 90 m) to investigate fine-scale inundation dynamics, and results are validated with ground- and satellite-based observations. It is found that the historical variations in surface water storage have been governed primarily by climate variability; the impacts of dams on river-floodplain hydrodynamics were marginal until 2009. However, results indicate that the dam impacts increased noticeably in 2010 when the basin-wide storage capacity doubled due to the construction of new mega dams. Further, results suggest that the future flood dynamics in the MRB would be considerably different than in the past even without climate change and additional dams. However, it is also found that the impacts of dams can largely vary depending on reservoir operation strategies. This study is expected to provide the basis for high-resolution river-floodplain-reservoir modeling for a holistic assessment of the impacts of dams and climate change on the floodpulse-dependent hydro-ecological systems in the MRB and other global regions.

This work aims to investigate the effects of climate change and regulation of floodgates and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on WLF and lake volume in Huayang Lakes during the past 52 years. The results revealed that precipitation is the dominant factor that leads to seasonal variation of lake levels, whereas regulation of floodgates and TGD are the key drivers of hydrology regime change in the past 20 years. Natural lake regime has higher water level when there is more precipitation and less lake volume. Floodgates and TGD regulations have changed this pattern since 2003, causing less difference in water level in spite of more precipitation and lake recession. Under the combined impacts of floodgates and TGD regulations, Huayang Lakes have experienced a prolonged outflow time since 2003 and the contribution rate caused by the floodgates and TGD regulations has increased by 19.90%. Additionally, the water level of Huayang Lakes decreased by approximately 0.3 similar to 0.5 m from September to November, but it showed no alteration from January to March in the past two decades. This indicated that floodgate regulations used for agricultural irrigation and fishery culture dominate the hydrology regime in winter and early spring. This study is beneficial for aquatic ecosystem protection in floodgate-controlled lakes under the circumstance of climate change and vigorous anthropology activities.

This method can contribute to cost-effective decision-making on climate change adaptation in many of the world's coasts. Cost-effective coastal flood adaptation requires a realistic valuation of losses, costs and benefits considering the uncertainty of future flood projections and limited resources for adaptation. Here we present an approach to quantify the flood protection benefits of beaches accounting for the dynamic interaction of storm erosion, long-term shoreline evolution and flooding. We apply the method in Narrabeen-Collaroy (Australia) considering uncertainty in different shared socioeconomic pathways, sea-level rise projections, and beach conditions. By 2100, results show that failing to consider erosion can underestimate flood damage by a factor of 2 and maintaining present-day beach width can avoid 785 million AUD worth assets from flood damage. By 2050, the flood protection and recreational benefits of holding the current mean shoreline could be more than 150 times the cost of nourishment. Our results give insight on the benefits of beaches for adaptation and can help accelerate financial instruments for restoration.

The Yangtze River Basin accounts for approximately 30% of China's gross domestic product (GDP) and is an engine for the country's rapid economic growth. One commonly held belief is that climate change has intensified extreme flood events, leading to increasing economic damage in the Yangtze River. Here, we quantitatively attributed economic exposure to climate change (i.e. climate-induced changes in weather-related events) and GDP growth, and assessed benefits, i.e. the reduction in economic exposure, from flood defence dikes of varying heights. To do this, we developed a framework by combing a large scale hydrological model, a hydraulic model, and long-term GDP data. We find that climate-induced changes in flood inundation area and resulted economic exposure were decreasing overall, whereas GDP growth drove the increases of potential economic exposure to floods. We also reveal that the basin average flood defence dikes should be at least approximately 3.5 m high to achieve an about ten-year average flood occurrence. Our results have significant policy and socioeconomic development implications.

To partly fill this gap, this study empirically assesses the transformational adaptation to climatic hazards in two mangrove-dependent coastal fishing communities in Bangladesh: Mathurapur near the Sundarbans, and Batayan near Nijhum Dwip. The study uses data collected by semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews in 2018-2019. Results show that cyclones, floods, salinity intrusion and riverbank erosion adversely affect the communities. The study identifies five groups of transformational adaptation: system-wide (e.g., cyclone shelter), restructuring (e.g., concrete housebuilding and livelihood diversification), path-shifting (e.g., migration), innovative (e.g., technological development) and multi-scale (e.g., reforestation programmes). The study finds that transformational adaptations are more effective to avert the impacts of severe climatic hazards than the conventional ones. Effectiveness of the transformational adaptation can be improved further by reducing uncertainty in climate projections, increasing awareness, building sufficient cyclone shelters, technological innovation, relocating people from hazardous zones, enhancing coastal reforestation programme and providing more fund for the implementation of effective adaptation strategies.

We argue that environmental stressors such as cyclones, riverbank erosion, salinity intrusion, and floods have negative impacts on people?s lives by reducing their livelihood options. Twelve in-depth interviews (Livelihood Histories) and twelve Focus Group Discussions (FGD) based on two Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools (Village Timeline and Contextual Change) were carried out in three different sites in coastal Bangladesh were conducted under the study. Our study finds that when there are insufficient adaptation strategies to environmental stressors, many people turn to livelihoods banned by the government. These ?illegal livelihoods? include using fine mesh nets to collect shrimp fry in the rivers as well as logging in the Sundarbans. These people are often the poorestand vulnerable, and law enforcement only exacerbate their vulnerability. We end by concluding those that have turned to ?illegal livelihoods? as a result of detrimental environmental stressors should be viewed as a special category of vulnerable people by policymakers, and steps need to be taken to ensure resilience to different environmental stressors.

Prioritization of the key underlying sustainability indicators of urban green drainage infrastructure systems	URBAN WATER JOURNAL			English	Article						Urban; green; sustainability; drainage; climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; RESPONSE RATES; WATER; URBANIZATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; CHALLENGES; EMISSIONS	Assessments of urban green drainage infrastructure (UGDI) have always been a headache in contemporary times which is a roadblock to enticing investors. This study prioritized the underlying sustainability indicators of UGDI systems in Ghana. After an exhaustive literature review, some identified sustainability indicators were compounded into semi-structured questionnaires. Sixty-two built environment professionals were asked to rate the significance of each indicator. A parametric test was used to prioritize the indicators. The results indicated that the most significant underlying sustainability indicators were; 'Flood control', 'Compliance with sustainable development goals', 'multi-functionality', 'energy efficiency and GHG emissions' and 'Initial Construction Cost'. To understand how UGDI performs with regards to flood and pollution mitigation, specific geographical performance indicators are required. This is an under-explored area in the Ghanaian context. Hence, the indicators espoused in this study serve as a starting point for the development of appropriate frameworks to aid the implementation of UGDI.	[Owusu-Manu, D.; Seidu, S.; Danso, A.

Hypotheses about the cultural and demographic impacts of a series of droughts have primarily been developed from the environmental and archaeological records of southeastern Arabia. Here we examine these human-environment interactions by integrating ongoing research from northern Arabia. While droughts and extreme environmental variability in the Holocene had significant impacts on human societies, responses varied across space and time and included mobility at various scales, as well as diverse social, economic and cultural adaptations, such as the management ofwater resources, the introduction of pastoral lifeways, and the construction of diverse types of stone structures. The long-term story of human societies in Arabia is one of resilience in the face of climate change, yet future challenges include rising temperatures and flash flooding. The history of human responses to climatic and ecosystem changes in Arabia can provide important lessons for a planet facing catastrophic global warming and environmental change.

Toward More Actionable Flood-Risk Information	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						flood risk; decision-making; climate change; uncertainty	WEATHER GENERATOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; LAND-USE; MODELS; HAZARD; UNCERTAINTY; VULNERABILITY; EXPOSURE; INSIGHTS	The increasingly urgent need to develop knowledge and practices to manage flood risks drives innovative information design. However, experts often disagree about design practices. As a result, flood-risk estimates can diverge, leading to different conclusions for decision-making. Using examples of household-scale fluvial (riverine) flood-risk information in the United States, we assess design features and risk communication approaches that may lead to more actionable information for decision-making. We argue that increased attention to uncertainty characterization and model diagnostics is a critical intermediate step for developing simpler approaches for designing flood-risk information. Simpler frameworks are desirable because flood risks change over time, and simpler frameworks are less costly to update. Developing frameworks for large spatial domains require collaboration grounded in principles of open science. Finally, systematically evaluating how decision-makers access and use information can provide new insights to guide risk communication and information design.	[Cooper, C. M.; Sharma, S.; Nicholas, R.

In this paper, we report on new research on rock art at a site called Djarrng in western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. Djarrng was heavily impacted by Tropical Cyclone Monica in 2006. We have visited the site sporadically since 1992, most recently in September 2019. We also have photographs taken in 1979 and accessed others taken in 1965 and so are in a position to document change to rock art panels over a 54 year period. We discuss not only change at the site as a result of the cyclone but also more general changes to rock art imagery at Arnhem Land sites in the past two hundred years, as well as lessons learnt from natural disasters that could be important for future rock art conservation.

The input for stochastic model is derived from a Regional Climate Model. The sub-hourly extreme rainfall intensity derived from stochastic model outputs was validated against observed rain-gauge data over the historical period. Considering the advantage in computational efficiency of the stochastic downscaling method, thousand scenarios of rainfall projections at very high temporal and spatial resolution were generated. The implication of this approach is that, from these stochastically downscaled time series of rainfall, it is possible to study future sub-hourly extreme rainfall intensities which would be useful to address issue of flash floods/drainage systems.

The flood narrative of Genesis 6-9, for example, has been readily employed to motivate endangered species protection and to reflect on the rising seas and mass extinctions associated with climate change. The distinctive features of any retelling of the Noah's ark story reflect the needs of historically situated and culturally embedded audiences. This paper focuses on four versions of Noah's story: in Genesis, in the Qur'an, at Ark Encounter theme park, and in Darren Aronofsky's film Noah. Analysis identifies the narrative choices that align each telling with its cultural context and draws out insights for adapting the story for the contemporary climate crisis. A conclusion addresses issues of race and racial injustice in traditional interpretations of Noah's story, and highlights approaches to redress those inequities in new imaginings of the flood narrative.

Areal Models for Spatially Coherent Trend Detection: The Case of British Peak River Flows	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC IMPACTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOODS; PRECIPITATION; ENGLAND; EUROPE; UK	With increasing concerns on the impacts of climate change, there is wide interest in understanding whether hydrometric and environmental series display any sort of trend. Many studies however, focus on the analysis of highly variable individual series at each measuring location. We propose a novel and straightforward approach to trend detection, modelling the test statistic for trend at each location via an areal model in which the information across measuring locations is pooled together. We exemplify the method with a detailed study of change in high flows in Great Britain. Using areal models, we detect a statistically relevant signal for a positive trend across Great Britain in the recent decades. This evidence is also found when different temporal subsets of the records are analysed. Further, the model identifies areas where the increase has been higher or lower than average, thus providing a way to prioritise intervention.

Sustainable management of water resources necessitates an examination of spatiotemporal variation in climatic parameters such as precipitation and temperature to quantify their relationships with the river discharge. The present study develops both parametric and non-parametric models by modifying the tools of 'R' statistical software (version 3.2.2) to investigate variations in 11 climatic parameters for a 117-year dataset (1900-2017) in Ganges River basin of India. The novelty of the modified hydroclimatic spatiotemporal trend model is its ability to explore seasonal trends and Sen's slopes of climatic parameters while avoiding trend-autocorrelation complications using an advanced Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Furthermore, relationships among the Sen's slopes of each climatic parameter are assessed to investigate the trend interdependencies. Parametric modeling has been performed to develop relationships among precipitation and remaining climatic parameters. Model validation results suggest non-parametric model to quantify relationships between precipitation and river discharge for a long-term data series. The results demonstrate that the forecasted precipitation exhibits a gradually decreasing trend leading to a significantly decreasing trend in river discharge (15-21%) for the next three decades (2030, 2040 and 2050). The model outcomes guide the water managers towards framing sustainable policies for managing water supplies, floods and droughts, hydropower development, barrage operation control, and environmental flows.

However, investigating flood events in urbanized plains is challenging as anthropogenic behaviors can change river flow without rainfall. In addition, while the frequency and magnitude of floods have been well examined, knowledge about variations in the rate of flood change is still limited. To fill these gaps, we proposed a scheme that focused on flood responses to rainfall to detect changes in flood characteristics in the Central Taihu Basin, a highly urbanized region in the Yangtze River Delta of China. Four characteristic metrics were adopted to summarize the flood hydrograph, including the peak, increment, rising rate, and falling rate. We then examined trends of these metrics based on the selected rainfall-flood events from ten hydrological stations during 1970-2020. Subsequently, the reduction method was used to separate the impacts of regional climate change and human activities on flood characteristics alterations. Furthermore, the importance of fifteen factors was quantified by the random forest model. We found that there is a significant upward trend in the evolution of flood characteristics, except for the increment of floods. Flood characteristics exhibit higher values when rainfall accumulates, indicating stronger responses of floods to a large amount of rainfall. The results also show that human activities dominate and impact the peak, rising rate, and falling rate of floods more than climate change. Meanwhile, although cumulative precipitation is the most important factor, flood characteristics are also susceptible to anthropogenic factors, such as land use change and hydraulic engineering construction. Our findings, which provide insights into flood event identification and enhance the understanding of regional flood changes, will serve as a reference for water resource management and flood mitigation in urbanized areas.

Investigating extreme hydrological risk impact on water quality; evidence from Buffalo catchment headwater, Eastern Cape, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Hydrological drought; Hydrochemistry; Confusion matrices; Spatio-temporal assessment; Wavelet coherence	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; LAND-USE; DROUGHT; RIVER; UNCERTAINTY; SENSITIVITY; PARAMETERS; INDICATOR	Evidence from increasing mineralization, micropollutant concentrations, waterborne epidemics, an algal boom, and dissolved organic matter has provided substantial evidence that climate change impacts water quality. While the impact of the extreme hydrological event (EHE) on water quality (WQ) has aroused considerable research interest, research uncertainty has been premised on WQ data scarcity, a short time frame, data non-linearity, data structure, and environmental biases on WQ. This study conceptualized a categorical and periodic correlation using confusion matrices and wavelet coherence for varying standard hydrological drought index (SHDI; 1971-2010) and daily WQ series (1977-2011) of four spatially distinct basins. By condensing the WQ variables using chemometric analyses, confusion matrices were assessed by cascading the SHDI series into 2-, 3-, and 5-phase scenarios. 2-phase revealed an overall accuracy (0.43-0.73), sensitivity analysis (0.52-1.00), and Kappa coefficient (- 0.13 to 0.14), which declines substantially with the phase increase, suggesting the disruptive impact of EHE on WQ. Wavelet coherence depicted the substantial (R-n(2)(u, s) = 0.5 ) mid-and long-term (8-32 days; 6-128 days) co-movement of streamflow over WQ, confirming the varying sensitivity of WQ variables. Land use/land cover mapping and the Gibbs diagram corroborate the eventful WQ evolution by EHE and their spatial variability concerning landscape transformation. Overall, the study deduced that hydrologic extreme triggers substantial WQ disruption with dissimilar WQ sensitivity. Consequently, suitable chemometric indicators of EHE impacts such as WQ index, nitrate-nitrogen, and Larson index at designated landscapes were identified for extreme chemodynamics impact assessment. This study proffers a recommendation for monitoring and managing the impact of climate change, floods, and drought on water quality.

Long-term changes in hydrological processes are referred to as climate change for an area. Urbanization, population growth, and economic growth are all having negative effects on the environment. The study of trends in the long term is essential from climatic change and socioeconomic perspectives. Examining the temporal variations in rainfall is crucial because changes in rainfall patterns and distribution can have a significant impact on the amount of water available in a watershed. The objective of the study is to assess the long-term (1902-2021) temporal trends in seasonal (winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) and annual rainfall for the Rajsamand district of Rajasthan state using the innovative trend analysis (ITA) technique. Due to its ability to provide results in graphical form, the innovative trend analysis approach is a very useful tool for detecting patterns in rainfall time series data. This technique is also used to detect trends as 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high,' which should be considered in future studies on floods 'high' and drought 'low', respectively. Based on the above study, it is observed that no trend is detected for the annual season, a positive trend is detected in the winter season and a Negative trend is detected for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in some regimes respectively. The ITA of the S-W monsoon also specifies that in the low regime the nature of the trend is increasing and in the high regime nature of the trend is decreasing. This research will serve as a scientific foundation for assessing and mitigating the effect of climate change on the environment in order to reduce the risk of weather patterns.

Facing frequent extreme weather events worldwide, how to improve cropland system resilience to climate change (CSRCC) and thus ensure food production has been concerned. Although a small number of studies have attempted to evaluate CSRCC through single or multiple indicators, few studies have considered the perspective of the three basic capacities of resilience (i.e., robustness, adaptability, and transformability), which could ignore the dynamic characteristics of cropland system resilience against shocks within a certain period. Therefore, this study first constructs an evaluation index system from the three capacities of system resilience. Then, taking Hubei province, China, as a case and comprehensively using the methods of Delphi, AHP, and TOPSIS to assess the spatio-temporal characteristics of CSRCC at the municipal scale from 2011 to 2018. On this basis, the regional disparities of CSRCC are analyzed by using the Theil coefficient. The results show that the CSRCC of Hubei province fluctuates on a downward trend, with the lowest in 2017 and the highest in 2013. Most municipalities have witnessed a pattern of fluctuated decline, except for a few ones in the plains, such as Wuhan and Jingmen. Generally, municipalities in the plains have greater scores, while some municipalities in the southern and eastern hilly regions show higher adaptability and transformability. In addition, adaptability contributes the least to the CSRCC at the municipal scale. At last, indicator selection against different research objects, influencing mechanism of CSRCC, and policy implications are discussed. This study is expected to provide a reference for the practice in sustainable management and utilization of cropland systems.

As global climate change intensifies, it is essential to explore the future hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects on the basin to provide evidence for water resources management and ecological restoration in the area. This study offers a framework for assessing the future multi-dimensional hydrological regime alteration and its ecological effects. Selected from Global Climate Models (GCMs) that performed well in the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the VIC model was forced by the GCMs after downscaling and bias-correction. Then the hydrological regime alteration and potential ecological effects in the region under SSP126, SSP245, SSP585 future scenarios were systematically assessed by the IHA-RVA system, and the contribution of different uncertainty sources was quantified through the two-way ANOVA. The results indicated that: (1) The temperature and precipitation will increase in the future under all scenarios, while the runoff tends to show a downward trend. By 2015-2100, the flow under SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios may vary from-44.7 to 13.0 %,-48.7 to 2.43 %,-53.7 to 4.0 %, respectively, when compared to the reference period (1961-1990). (2) Moderate alterations with RVA = 33 % will be observed in the hydrological regime in the basin under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, and low alterations with RVA = 26.7 % under the SSP126 scenario. The spring discharge of the basin will decrease significantly, and the annual extreme flow is projected to decrease, but the frequency of drought and flood events will tend to increase. (3) There are multiple sources of uncertainty in predicting the future hydrological regime in the SYRB. The uncertainty due to the climate model is the dominant factor, fol-lowed by the interaction between emission scenarios and the climate model, and the average contribution to uncertainty of them is 69.5 % and 20.8 % respectively. The uncertainty of emission scenarios is mainly reflected in winter flow, while the climate model mainly affects the summer flow and annual maximum flow, and the uncertainty of interaction between them varies in different periods.

Flood risk assessment (FRA) is moving towards an approach that encompasses social, climatic, and environmental changes. Advances in climate and hydraulic modelling allow the development of long-term scenarios with greater reliability. However, the coupling of human behaviour in the process of flood risk assessment is still in an embryonic phase. Here we attempt to fill this gap by (1) coupling a socio-hydrological model with an urban flood model using a cellular automata approach, and (2) using climate change projections to estimate flood risk in the coming decades. We illustrate our analytical framework with an application in a Brazilian catchment, showing its potential in developing long-term scenarios that can ultimately improve the process of flood risk assessment.

J	Thomas, KA				Thomas, Kimberley Anh			Shifting baselines of disaster mitigation	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Maladaptation; delta; Vietnam; Bangladesh; hazards	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL; DELTA; ADAPTATION; BANGLADESH; POLDERS; IMPACTS	Large-scale water management systems were introduced to the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong Deltas in the latter half of the twentieth century to manage extreme water hazards and increase food production. However, these systems significantly altered their respective hydrological regimes, often creating worse socio-ecological conditions and greater vulnerability to floods and seawater intrusion than existed previously. Despite this history of disaster experience, climate change adaptation measures in the Ganges-Brahmaputra and Mekong Deltas use contemporary socio-ecological conditions as the baseline for disaster mitigation efforts. Paradoxically relying on old approaches to address future climate threats, disaster planners overlook how current conditions in both deltas are unstable outcomes of historical processes. These cases illustrate that large-scale and capital-intensive climate responses may fail to measurably reduce disaster risk. The concept of shifting baselines, borrowed from fisheries science, becomes helpful for selecting more appropriate reference points for disaster mitigation than current conditions.

Adapting our homes and critical infrastructure to sustain the effects of climate dynamics requires novel data-driven interdisciplinary approaches for efficient risk mitigation. We develop a new systematic framework based on the machinery of statistical and machine learning tools to evaluate water-related home insurance risks and quantify uncertainty due to varying climate model projections. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of data depth to the analysis of weather and climate ensembles, which remains a novel territory for statistical depth methodology as well as the field of environmental risk and ensemble forecasting in general. We illustrate the new data-driven methodology for risk analysis in application to rainfall-related home insurance in the Canadian Prairies over 2002-2011.Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

However, these developments have numerous inherent environmental hazards such as water and air pollution, a loss of habitats, increased coastal erosion, the transfer of invasive species between connected watercourses and lakes, and the transport of pollutants through watercourses to coastal areas. Climate change may aggravate these environmental problems through changing temperatures, reduced precipitation, enhancing the adverse impact of excess nutrient discharge, and the entry of invasive species. In this study, we analyse the main European inland waterway corridors and their branches to assess the ecological viability of a pan-European inland waterway network. The environmental viability of such network depends on the right assessment of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity.

In contemporary adaptation planning, building resilience is considered together with objectives such as sustainability, productivity and transformations. An adaptation planning process (termed water-sensitive city adaptation planning process (WSCapp)) may be used to incorporate flexibility or incremental flexible adaptation measures in a comprehensive adaptation strategy, such as when planning water-sensitive cities. This paper applies WSCapp in the context of adapting to urban flooding in Melbourne, Australia, which aspires to become a water-sensitive city. Application of WSCapp - through nine steps of analysis - has helped identify appropriate adaptation measures and economic adaptation pathways. In the case of Melbourne, of the three adaptation measures considered, the combination of rainwater tanks at the household level and the flood-proofing of households was found to be the most effective. WSCapp is fundamental for future work with urban planning and infrastructure consultants and can greatly benefit them with obtaining a more flexible and sustainable flood management response.

Three different distribution families, including the Gumbel Extreme Value Type I (GEV), the 3-parameter log-normal (LN3) and log-Pearson type III (LP3) are used to explore the likelihood of potential flash flood based on the 3-day running total streamflow sequences (3D flows). Climate-driven ensemble streamflows are also generated to evaluate how future climate variability affects local hydrology associated with potential flash flood risks. The result indicates that future climate change and variability may contribute to potential flash floods in the study area, but incorporating embedded-uncertainties inherited from climate models into water resource planning would be still challenging because grand investments are necessary to mitigate such risks within institutional and community consensus. Nonetheless, this study will provide useful insights for water managers to plan out sustainable water resources management under an uncertain and changing climate.

The authors show that topography and drainage areas correlate with flood sensitivities as well as with societal behavior. Flooding is one of the most common natural hazards, causing disastrous impacts worldwide. Stress-testing the global human-Earth system to understand the sensitivity of floodplains and population exposure to a range of plausible conditions is one strategy to identify where future changes to flooding or exposure might be most critical. This study presents a global analysis of the sensitivity of inundated areas and population exposure to varying flood event magnitudes globally for 1.2 million river reaches. Here we show that topography and drainage areas correlate with flood sensitivities as well as with societal behaviour. We find clear settlement patterns in which floodplains most sensitive to frequent, low magnitude events, reveal evenly distributed exposure across hazard zones, suggesting that people have adapted to this risk. In contrast, floodplains most sensitive to extreme magnitude events have a tendency for populations to be most densely settled in these rarely flooded zones, being in significant danger from potentially increasing hazard magnitudes given climate change.

Risk assessment of flash flood and soil erosion impacts on electrical infrastructures in overcrowded mountainous urban areas under climate change	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Hydrology; Geoinformatics; Flood risk; Infrastructure; Saudi Arabia	ENVIRONMENT	Risk management of flash floods in arid mountainous cities is challenged by the lack of proper data and the unreadiness of infrastructures to handle large floods. Climate projections predict increasing frequency of extreme droughts and floods over these arid zones aggravating the impacts of flash floods by increasing the hardness of the topsoil, making it less efficient at absorbing rain water. This study assesses the hazards of steadily increasing flash floods on voltage towers around Makkah city using hydrological modeling to simulate flow velocity and volume and erosion intensity of floods. Hydrological modeling estimated the maximum discharge rates at Wadi Numan and Wadi Al-Sharaya outlets as 3142 and 2543 m3/s, respectively. Extreme soil erosion rates are encountered in the lower reaches of these basins (11% of the total area) and severe erosion rates (3.6%) were reported in the planned voltage tower path. Catchment's lower reaches are proved highly vulnerable to soil erosion due to the lack of vegetation cover and high flow accumulations. The study alarms revisiting the risk management policies for infrastructure projects in arid mountainous cities considering the climate change im-pacts on increasing the frequency of unprecedented droughts and floods and their aggravated destructive impacts.

It is essential to fully understand the causes and mechanisms of flood formation to reduce future losses. By taking the extreme flood in the lower Yangtze River in 2020 as an example and using hydrological and rainfall data of the basin, the formation process and triggering factors of a flood disaster were analyzed in this study. The flooding process can be divided into six typical stages, in which the long duration plum rain season, frequent and high-intensity rainstorms, and high overlapping rainfall areas are the preconditions for flood formation, whereas frequent encounters of floods in the main stream and tributaries of the middle and lower Yangtze River are the decisive factors. In addition, flood drainage along the lower reaches and the jacking effect of the downstream tide level play a role in promoting flooding. During this process, the joint operation of cascade reservoirs plays a key role in the prevention of catastrophic floods. The aforementioned results can provide a reference for flood control strategies in case of similar floods in the future.

As the value of wetlands continues to be exploited, hydrological connectivity becomes increasingly significant. In this paper, the characteristics and development of hydrological connectivity research from 1998 to 2018 were analyzed through the scientometric analysis based on Web of Science database. CiteSpace, an analytical software for scientific measurement, is used to visualize the results of the retrieval. The analysis results of co-occurrence, co-operative and co-cited network indicate that the hydrological connectivity is a multidisciplinary field which involves the Environment Science and Ecology, Water Resources, Environmental Sciences, Geology and Geosciences. According to Keyword cooccurrence analysis, ecosystem, floodplain, dynamics, climate change and management are the main research hotspots in each period. In addition, the co-cited analysis of references shows that "amphibians" is the largest cluster of hydrological connectivity, and the "channel network" is the most important research topic. It is worth noting that the "GIWS" (Geographically Isolated Wetlands) is the latest research topic and may be a major research direction in the future.

Understanding when and how smolts migrate to the sea is crucial to understanding how salmon populations will be affected by both climate change and the elevated salmon lice concentrations produced by salmon farms. Here, acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the fjord migration of wild post-smolts from four rivers across two fjord systems in western Norway. Smolts began their migration throughout the month of May in all populations. Within-population, the timing of migration was multimodal with peaks in migration determined by the timing of spring floods. As a result, migrations were synchronized across populations with similar hydrology. There was little indication that the timing of migration had an impact on survival from the river mouth to the outer fjord. However, populations with longer fjord migrations experienced lower survival rates and had higher variance in fjord residency times. Explicit consideration of the multimodality inherent to the timing of smolt migration in these populations may help predict when smolts are in the fjord, as these modes seem predictable from available environmental data.

Resilience Viewed through the Lens of Climate Change and Water Management	WATER			English	Review						adaptation; catchment; climate change; indicator; resilience; water management	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; FLUVIAL FLOOD RISK; ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE; RESOURCE SYSTEM; CATCHMENT; FUTURE; VULNERABILITY; DROUGHT; RESISTANCE; REGIMES	Resilience is not a new idea but there has been an upsurge in efforts to operationalize the concept within water management. This review begins with a synopsis of related themes around persistent and emerging pressures on freshwaters; environmental thresholds (or tipping points); 'safe' operating conditions; multiple stable states; regime shifts. A case is made for viewing and managing the resilience of water systems at nested scales. Indicators are needed to track evolving climate risks as well as to measure socio-ecological responses. Catchment properties can identify those river systems that are more or less likely to return to a pre-disturbance state; resilience further depends on institutional and social landscapes. Ideally, allied notions of resistance and reliability are applied alongside resilience to broaden the portfolio of adaptation measures. Water managers would also benefit from more consistent use of resilience terminology; incentives to build back better after catastrophes; strategic monitoring of incipient threats and tipping points; availability of long-term adaptation indicators; coordinated efforts to reduce non-climatic pressures on freshwaters (especially in headwaters); evidence-based, practical guidance on adaptation measures that build resilience.

J	Li, JD				Li, Jiada			A data-driven improved fuzzy logic control optimization-simulation tool for reducing flooding volume at downstream urban drainage systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban drainage systems; Real-time control; Fuzzy logic control; Genetic algorithm; SWMM_FLC; Accumulated flooding volume	REAL-TIME CONTROL; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE APPROACH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OPTIMAL OPERATION; STORMWATER; URBANIZATION; ALGORITHM; RUNOFF; PERFORMANCE; STORAGE	The uncertainty of climate change and urbanization imposed additional stress for urban drainage systems (UDSs) by intensifying rainfall frequency and magnifying peak runoff rate. UDSs are among the stormwater infrastructures that can be controlled in real-time for mitigating downstream urban flooding. In this paper, a data-driven improved real-time control optimization-simulation tool called SWMM_FLC, which is based on the FLC (fuzzy logic control) and GA (genetic algorithm), was developed for smart decision-making of flooding mitigation. A calibrated and validated SWMM model was used for applying SWMM_FLC to explore the potential in reducing downstream flooding volume at UDSs. The results show that the data-driven enhanced GA optimization significantly reduces fuzzy system deviations from 0.22 (non_optmial scenario) to 0.07 (optimal scenario). The accumulated flooding volume reduction by up to 4.55% under eight artificial rainfall scenarios discloses the possibility of adopting SWMM_FLC as appropriate software to assist decision-makers to effectively minimize urban flooding volume at downstream urban drainage systems.

J	Babovic, F; Mijic, A				Babovic, Filip; Mijic, Ana			Economic Evaluation of Adaptation Pathways for an Urban Drainage System Experiencing Deep Uncertainty	WATER			English	Article						urban water; urban drainage; deep uncertainty; decision making		As Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty methodologies are becoming more widely utilised, there has been a growth in the use and generation of Adaptation Pathways. These are meant to convey to policy makers how short-term adaptations can act as elements of longer-term adaptation strategies. However, sets of Adaptation Pathways do not convey the individual pathway's relative costs and benefits. To address this problem in relation to urban pluvial flooding, an economic analysis of a set of Adaptation Pathways was conducted. Initially, a methodology to conduct an economic assessment for deterministic climate change scenarios is developed. This methodology is then modified, using methods that underpin real options to assess how a pathway performs across a bundle of possible futures. This delivered information on how the performance of adaptations can vary across different climate change scenarios. By comparing the deterministic analysis to the new method, it was found that the order in which options are implemented greatly affects the financial performance of an Adaptation Pathway, even if the final combination of options is identical. The presented methodology has the potential to greatly improve decision making by informing policy makers on the potential performance of adaptation strategies being considered.

The objective of this study was to assess how the future climate would affect flooding in Ethiopia's lower Bilate catchment. In order to simulate flood occurrences and maps for various climate scenarios, two hydraulic models-HEC-RAS and a semi-distributed physically based HEC-HMS hydrologic model-were utilized. For the baseline (1971-2000), mid-term (2041-2070), and long-term (2071-2100) cycles under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, the bias-corrected data of five climate models were used. The baseline and future period stream flow data were used to produce the flood events for the 50- and 100-year return floods. Flood inundation area and depth were computed using the HEC-RAS model. The flood risk map of the catchment was developed by combining the flood vulnerability and hazard indexes. Future predictions showed that the catchment's maximum and minimum temperatures and average annual precipitation would rise, which also increase the yearly stream would flow. According to the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, the intensity of future floods will rise and inundate an area ranging from 88.5 to 161 ha considering the 50 and 100-year flood. The worst case scenario under RCP8.5 is the possible inundation of 161 hectares of the studied reach that could be inundated by a 100-year cycle flood. Climate change will make flooding more difficult in the 2050s and 2080s, yet an extreme and riskier flood may happen in the 2050s under the RCP8.5 scenario. The results of this study could aid non-governmental and governmental organizations in their efforts to better control flood risk in the lower Bilate catchment.

This study traces the development of a narrative of human-caused climate change in southern France in the first half of the nineteenth century that mirrored to-day's rhetoric of the Anthropocene, and it exposes the interplay of social and environmental forces in the establishment of this narrative. Drawing on natural archives and instrumental data as well as traditional archival sources and con-trasting these indices with literature on Alpine flooding from the period, it maps French intellectual environmental perceptions against the realities of climate and weather in early nineteenth-century Provence. In this context, concerns about human influence on the climate stemmed less from actual climate change than from major social transformations, which made inhabitants of Provence increasingly aware of and susceptible to environmental forces, and flooding in particular. Through this case study, the paper exposes the importance of recognising and accounting for human perceptions in charting environmental change. It also contributes to environmental history by identifying late Little Ice Age conditions in Mediterranean France, and it reaffirms the value of an interdisciplinary, integrative approach to the study of climate change.

However, there are not enough studies showing the effect of climate change on hydrologic design frequency. Therefore, to estimate the optimal design frequency according to future climate change scenarios, this study examined urban flooding area and extreme rainfall frequency that can change in the future. After estimating the optimal design frequency, hydrological risks of 413 local river basins were evaluated according to Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 after regenerating daily rainfalls from the HadGEM2-ES model into hourly rainfalls using the Poisson cluster. For the RCP 4.5, hydrological risks increased relative to the established design frequency by 3.13% on average. For the RCP 8.5, hydrological risks increased by 2.80% on average. The hydrological risks increased by 4.58% in the P2(2040-2069) period for the RCP 4.5, and by 4.39% in the P1 (2021-2039) period for the RCP 8.5. These results suggest that the hydrologic design frequency in the future will likely decrease, and the safety of river basins will also decrease.

With such a framework, standard centralized systems (CS), IES with distributed generation (IES-DG) and IES with bidirectional energy conversion (IES+P2G) enabled by power-to-gas (P2G) facilities can be analyzed. The framework embeds the model of each single production plant in an integrated power-flow model and then couples it with a stochastic failures model and a climate-induced failure model, which simulates the occurrence of extreme weather events (e.g., flooding) driven by climate change. To illustrate how to operationalize the analysis in practice, a case study of a realistic IES has been considered that comprises two combined cycle gas turbine plants (CCGT), a nuclear power plant (NPP), two wind farms (WF), a solar photovoltaicS (PV) field and a power-to-gas station (P2G). Results suggest that the IESs are resilient to climate-induced failures.

Yet there is sparse evidence into the specific ways in which identity processes shape adaptation planning and responses. This paper proposes three key ways to understand the relationship between identity formation and adaptation processes: (a) how social identities change in response to perceived climate change risks and threats; (b) how identity change may be an objective of adaptation; and (c) how identity issues can constrain or enable adaptive action. It examines these three areas of focus through a synthesis of evidence on community responses to flooding and subsequent policy responses in Somerset county, UK and the Gippsland East region in Australia, based on indepth longitudinal data collected among those experiencing and enacting adaptation. The results show that adaptation policies are more likely to be effective when they give individuals confidence in the continuity of their in-groups, enhance the self-esteem of these groups, and develop their sense of self-efficacy. These processes of identity formation and evolution are therefore central to individual and collective responses to climate risks.

Spatial and Temporal Changes in Nesting Behavior by Black Skimmers (<i>Rynchops niger</i>) in New Jersey, USA, from 1976-2019	WATERBIRDS			English	Article						Beach nesting birds; climate change; coexistence; endangered species; habitat loss; Least Tern; interspecific interactions; sea level rise; Sternula antillarum	SEA-LEVEL RISE; HABITAT USE; COASTAL; RESPONSES	Sea level rise from anthropogenic climate change threatens waterbird species worldwide. In New Jersey, USA, one such waterbird, the Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger), uses both salt marsh islands and beaches for nesting colony sites. Both habitats vary in flood risk, with salt marsh islands typically being more vulnerable especially in the face of sea level rise. Given that sea level has increased in the mid-Atlantic region over the past four decades, we hypothesized that Black Skimmers have shifted their colonies from salt marshes to beaches, and that this change has led to an increase in coexistence with Least Terns (Sternula antillarum). We analyzed 44 years of seabird population census data from New Jersey and found that the probability that a Black Skimmer colony was located on a salt marsh island, as opposed to a beach, significantly declined over the survey period. Additionally, the probability of coexistence with Least Terns significantly increased. Such climate change driven population shifts of endangered species may have significant consequences for their conservation in human modified systems where habitat is already limiting.	[Tattoni, D.

Understanding climate change and long-term planning for enhanced storm and flooding hazards are imposing more stringent requirements on the robustness, precision, and accuracy of the estimates than have hitherto been needed. Taking advantage of novel retracking algorithms, particularly developed for the coastal zone, the present work aims at establishing an objective baseline processing chain for wave height retrieval that can be adapted to all satellite missions. In order to determine the best performing retracking algorithm for both Low Resolution Mode and Delay-Doppler altimetry, an objective assessment is conducted in the framework of the European Space Agency Sea State Climate Change Initiative project. All algorithms process the same Level-1 input dataset covering a time-period of up to two years. As a reference for validation, an ERA5-based hindcast wave model as well as an in-situ buoy dataset from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service In Situ Thematic Centre database are used. Five different metrics are evaluated: percentage and types of outliers, level of measurement noise, wave spectral variability, comparison against wave models, and comparison against in-situ data. The metrics are evaluated as a function of the distance to the nearest coast and the sea state. The results of the assessment show that all novel retracking algorithms perform better in the majority of the metrics than the baseline algorithms currently used for operational generation of the products. Nevertheless, the performance of the retrackers strongly differ depending on the coastal proximity and the sea state. Some retrackers show high correlations with the wave models and in-situ data but significantly under- or overestimate large-scale spectral variability. We propose a weighting scheme to select the most suitable retrackers for the Sea State Climate Change Initiative programme.

Here, we demonstrate seasonal sediment-transport regime shifts from the 1960s to 2000s in four cryosphere-fed rivers characterized by glacial, nival, pluvial, and mixed regimes, respectively. Spring sees a shift toward pluvial-dominated sediment transport due to less snowmelt and more erosive rainfall. Summer is characterized by intensified glacier meltwater pulses and pluvial events that exceptionally increase sediment fluxes. Our study highlights that the increases in hydroclimatic extremes and cryosphere degradation lead to amplified variability in fluvial fluxes and higher summer sediment peaks, which can threaten downstream river infrastructure safety and ecosystems and worsen glacial/pluvial floods. We further offer a monthly-scale sediment-availability-transport model that can reproduce such regime shifts and thus help facilitate sustainable reservoir operation and river management in wider cryospheric regions under future climate and hydrological change.

Aridity is evaluated using the standardized precipitation and streamflow indices (SPI and SSFI). Trends in monthly total precipitation are determined, the features of the streamflow formation during the open-channel period are revealed. The frequency of anticyclones that determines hydrometeorological conditions on the territory of Belarus is calculated. The statistically significant increase in the number of the days with anticyclonic weather over the country during the warm season is found. The increasing frequency of dry conditions in summer months against the background of a rise in the precipitation intensity is highlighted. A simultaneous increase in the frequency of very-low-flow periods on rivers and an increase in the height of warm rainfall floods in some river basins are revealed.	[Danilovich, I.

Assessment of Changes in the Distance of Spawning Migrations of Semianadromous Burbot (<i>Lota lota</i> L., 1758) Spawners Based on Long-term Records of the Abundance of Downstream Migrating Larvae	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						population dynamics; downstream migration; feeding; spawning migration; skipped spawning; climate change; water level; the Ob River	HEPATOSOMATIC INDEX; LOTIDAE	The distance of spawning migrations of semianadromous burbot spawners is reconstructed based on long-term (2000-2017) records characterizing the contribution of the Ural spawning tributaries of the Ob River (the Severnaya Sosva, Synya, Voikar, and Sob) to the generations of this species. It is shown that the Voikar River has played the dominant role in contributing to the total number of burbot generations over the observation period and that the migratory activity of spawners depends on the duration of flooding of the low floodplain. The dynamics of contributions from the northern and southern tributaries are evaluated in the context of possible climate change. It is concluded that burbot spawners have to skip the spawning season during long-distance migrations (over 1000 km) from wintering grounds to spawning grounds.	[Koporikov, A. R.; Bogdanov, V.

An analysis of data collected using semi-structured interviews with 27 households reveals that household adaptability - the ability or capacity to adapt to the impacts of climatic variations - depends on access to livelihood assets. All households have access to social capital through familial networks, which lessens the burden of extreme weather events, namely cyclones and flooding. Households with access to tangible assets such as land and the equipment and resources to utilize it, together with intangible assets like motivation and knowledge are better positioned to adapt their agricultural practices to changing climatic conditions. Households headed by a capable individual were also better positioned to adapt. We conclude that remoteness promotes self-sufficiency and initiative, and access to livelihood assets influences household capacity to adapt.

Growing aridity and the shrinking of glaciers may have important impacts on food security, health, human security and infrastructure in the region and compel people to move. Drawing on the literature on environmental issues in Central Asia and on interviews conducted in the Kuhistoni-Badakhshan Autonomous Region of Tajikistan, this article provides a literature survey on environmental migrations in the region and positions Central Asia in the current debates within the broad environmental migrations literature. The article shows that environmental issues can stand out as an important push factor for out-migration in Central Asia, highlights the important role of the Soviet heritage of environmental management as well as of post-Soviet socio-economic transformations in understanding these issues, and discusses possible adaptation strategies.

The Heihe River basin in Northwest China is crucial for providing water resources to water-scarce regions. Thus, understanding the future runoff trends in the context of climate change can optimize water allocation, alleviate water shortages, and mitigate flood risks in the region. In this study, we use meteorological data from 10 general circulation models under two future scenarios to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and project hydrological processes in the upper Heihe River basin from 2026 to 2100. After examining the future changes in total runoff in the basin, we assess the magnitude, frequency, and timing of daily flood events in the future. The results of the multi-model ensemble averaging (MMEA) method show that the change in the multi-year average annual runoff is -4.5% (2026-2050), -1.8% (2051-2075), and +2.0% (2076-2100) under the SSP245 scenario and -1.0% (2026-2050), +0.4% (2051-2075), and +0.2% (2076-2100) under the SSP585 scenario compared to the historical period. The analysis of flood magnitudes indicates that the basin will experience higher-magnitude floods in the future, with the largest increase rates of 61.9% and 66.4% for the 1-day maximum flows under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. The flood return period is projected to be shorter in the future, and the 1-day maximum flows of a 100-year flood are expected to increase by 44.7% and 63.7% under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, a significant shift in the flood timing is expected, with the highest frequency moving from July to August, representing a one-month lag compared to the historical period. Our findings suggest that the hydrological characteristics of the upper Heihe River basin may be significantly altered in the future due to the effects of climate change, resulting in floods with higher magnitudes and frequencies and different timings. Therefore, it is imperative to consider these changes carefully when developing risk prevention measures.

J	Xue, CL; Qiao, D; Aziz, N				Xue, Chenle; Qiao, Dan; Aziz, Noshaba			Influence of Natural Disaster Shock and Collective Action on Farmland Transferees' No-Tillage Technology Adoption in China	LAND			English	Article						climate change; farmland transfer; technology adoption; Heckman two-stage model	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; COOPERATIVE MEMBERSHIP; APPLE FARMERS; LIVELIHOOD RESILIENCE; WATER CONSERVATION; SOIL CONSERVATION; DECISION-MAKING	Climate change in natural disasters such as droughts and floods has caused people to adopt, extend, and diffuse adaptive agricultural technologies. Meanwhile, the development of the farmland leasing market has pushed agricultural laborers to migrate from rural to urban areas, resulting in less participation in collective action. It is generally believed that no-tillage technology lessens the agricultural production risks instigated by climate change and natural disasters. However, previous literature has given little attention to this phenomenon, especially in the context of China. So, to fill this gap, the current study explores the influence of natural disaster shock and collective action on farmland transferees' no-tillage technology adoption using the data of 621 farmland transferees from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, China. By using Heckman's two-stage and moderating-effect models, the findings initially reveal that in the sample, 249 farmland transferees adopt no-tillage technology, accounting for 40.10% of farmland transferees. The farmland area in which no-tillage technology is adopted accounts for 23.90% of the total farmland area. Natural disaster shock exerts a positive and significant influence on transferees' no-tillage technology adoption, i.e., if the intensity of natural disaster shock increases by one unit, the adoption rate and adoption degree will increase by 24.9% and 9.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, collective action also positively and significantly impacts transferees' no-tillage technology adoption. If the number of transferees participating in collective action increases by one unit, the adoption rate and degree will increase by 13.3% and 6.5%, respectively. Further, it is found that collective action positively moderates the relationship between natural disaster shock and the adoption of no-tillage technology by farmland transferees. Additionally, educational level, agricultural income, farmland area, etc., are also found to influence transferees' no-tillage technology adoption significantly. Moreover, based on gender and organizational participation differences, the findings reveal that the effects of natural disaster shock and collective action are heterogeneous. The results propose that policymakers should take countermeasures such as providing training in no-tillage skills, raising no-tillage subsidy standards, and guiding long-term farmland transference.

Understanding and quantifying this cascade is essential for developing effective adaptation actions. We evaluate and quantify uncertainties in future flood quantiles associated with climate change for four catchments, incorporating within our modelling chain uncertainties associated with 12 global climate models contained in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, five different bias correction approaches, hydrological model parameter uncertainty and the use of three different extreme value distributions for flood frequency analysis. Results indicate increased flood hazard in all catchments for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), with changes in flooding consistent with changes in annual maximum precipitation. We use additive chains and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to quantify and decompose uncertainties and their interactions in estimating selected flood quantiles for each catchment. We find that not only do the contributions of different sources of uncertainty vary by catchment, but that the dominant sources of uncertainty can be very different on a catchment-by-catchment basis. While uncertainties in future projections are widely assumed to be dominated by the ensemble of climate models used, we find that in one of our catchments uncertainties associated with bias correction methods dominate, while in another the uncertainty associated with the use of different extreme value distributions outweighs the uncertainty associated with the ensemble of climate models. These findings highlight the inability to generalise a priori about the importance of different components of the cascade of uncertainty in future flood hazard at the catchment scale. Moreover, we find that the interaction of components of the modelling chain employed are substantial (> 20 % of overall uncertainty in two catchments). While our sample is small, there is evidence that the dominant components of the cascade of uncertainty may be linked to catchment characteristics and rainfall-runoff processes. Future work that seeks to further explore the characteristics of the uncertainty cascade as they relate to catchment characteristics may provide insight into a priori identifying the key components of modelling chains to be targeted in climate change impact assessments.

Mann-Kendall and Sen tests were applied to analyze the extent and direction of lake water level changes. For the purpose of detection of shoreline active zones, digital lake bottom models were developed based on bathymetric measurements. They were integrated with catchment digital terrain model, developed based on data from Airborne Laser Scanning. In analysed period, water levels in the majority of lakes showed a decreasing tendency, as a result of climate change. An increasing tendency was only observed for two lakes caused by the activity of beavers (castor fiber). The study permitted the identification of active shoreline zones with long-term exposure to drying and flooding. These zones are of the highest importance from the point of view of the functioning of water and water-dependent ecosystems, particularly protected species.

There is growing interest in restoring high-elevation woodland and scrub communities by harnessing planting and natural regeneration. Emissions offsetting has been a key driver, yet mountain systems offer slower mechanisms for biomass accumulation due to their typically smaller size, lower density, and slower growth than forests at lower elevations. We argue that the natural capital afforded by mountain woodland restoration is far more comprehensive than carbon sequestration alone and encompasses an important array of ecosystem services and biodiversity gains. Improved opportunities for wildlife and people include natural hazard protection, sheltering, structural variability, vegetation diversity, and recreation. Furthermore, mountain woodland restoration provides critically needed nature-based solutions for reducing threats from escalating climate change such as soil erosion, flooding, warming temperatures, and extreme weather. It is imperative that these benefits are embedded within conservation policy and environmental incentives.

A few local-scale studies indicate that recent climatic changes might accelerate the drainage reorganization process. However, large-scale drainage reorganization during the modern era is rarely documented. This study examines ongoing drainage reorganization on the endorheic Tibetan Plateau (TP) as a primary result of drastic lake expansion. A total of 11 drainage system reorganization events comprising 24 different lake basins and covering a total area of 61,115 km(2) occurred between 2000 and 2018. Assuming the continued growth rate of TP lakes, we project another 20 basins will be reorganized before 2030. These drainage basin reorganizations not only alter hydrological processes in the endorheic TP but may also cause the endorheic-exorheic transition, leading to the upstream sprawl of the Yangtze River Basin and posing outburst flooding risks on China's key infrastructure such as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.

Four main conceptualizations of vulnerability in the literature include vulnerability as a threshold, as exposure to hazards, as a pre-existing condition, and as an outcome. Three main conceptualizations of resilience are resilience as resistance, as recovery, and as creative transformation. This study investigates how local practitioners in Metro Vancouver municipalities perceive and apply these concepts to reduce risk and adapt to flood hazards. Results from focus groups and surveys of practitioners find that the conceptualizations of vulnerability and resilience perceived as most valuable are often not applied in local risk reduction and adaptation efforts. Participants' interpretations of how vulnerability and resilience concepts are applied to four main adaptation strategiesprotect, accommodate, avoid, and retreatreveal nuanced and complex challenges at the intersection of where theory meets practice. As currently operationalized, vulnerability and resilience appear unlikely to lead to anything more than incremental adaptation.

High-tide flooding disrupts local economic activity	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOSSES; IMPACT; DAMAGE; COAST	Evaluation of observed sea level rise impacts to date has emphasized sea level extremes, such as those from tropical cyclones. Far less is known about the consequences of more frequent high-tide flooding. Empirical analysis of the disruption caused by high-tide floods, also called nuisance or sunny-day floods, is challenging due to the short duration of these floods and their impacts. Through a novel approach, we estimate the effects of high-tide flooding on local economic activity. High-tide flooding already measurably affects local economic activity in Annapolis, Maryland, reducing visits to the historic downtown by 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.6%). With 3 and 12 inches of additional sea level rise, high-tide floods would reduce visits by 3.6% (3.2 to 4.0%) and 24% (19 to 28%), respectively. A more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of high-tide flooding can help to guide efficient responses from local adaptations to global mitigation of climate change.

Challenges and opportunities in the use of ponds and pondscapes as Nature-based Solutions	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Ponds and pondscapes; Nature-based Solutions; Nature contributions to people; Freshwater biodiversity; Climate change; Societal challenges	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; STAKEHOLDERS PERCEPTIONS; METHANE EBULLITION; WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; WETLANDS; URBAN; LAKES	Ponds and "pondscapes" (networks of ponds) are crucial habitats for biodiversity and for delivering multiple benefits to humans, so-called "Nature's Contribution to People", such as climate mitigation and adaptation to climate change, creation, and maintenance of habitat for biodiversity, water purification, flood mitigation and cultural benefits (e.g., recreational possibilities). However, ponds are not often considered as Nature-based Solutions to provide all these benefits. In addition, there is insufficient knowledge on how to manage and restore ponds to maximise their role to increase the resilience of ecosystems and society to climate change. To facilitate improved implementation of ponds as Nature-based Solutions for the delivery of a wide range of Nature Contributions to People, it is important to generate and integrate biodiversity, ecosystems, societal, economic and policy knowledge. Hence, there is a need for evidence-based guidance to support the broader use of ponds. Here, we review the role of ponds and pondscapes in delivering Nature's Contributions to People and provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities for their broader implementation as Nature-based Solutions. Finally, we propose a conceptual framework that can help the implementation of pond Nature-based Solutions, and that outlines future research needs.

For that purpose, some meteorological parameters, physical-geographical factors and the flood events data were studied for the 1994-2019 period. The linear trends demonstrate an increasing tendency of air temperature and precipitation. Those trends expressed increased flood occurrences, especially for the 2000s, whereas the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test reveals no significant change. The number of flood events reaches its maximum in 2011 with its peak in May. Out of 191 flood events, half of the occurrences are recorded in the flat areas and southern aspects of the mountains (22% of the country's territory). There is a certain clustering of flood events in the areas with up to 5 degrees slopes (66% of flood events). The most flood vulnerable areas were analyzed and mapped via Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS-based mapping shows the location of flood vulnerable areas in the central, northern parts of the country, and the coastal areas of Lake Sevan. Our methodological approach elaborates the localization of flood-prone sites. It can be used for the flood hazard assessment mapping and risk management.

By creating a climate adaptation framework	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation measure; Risk analysis; Road planning; Transportation; Bayesian networks; Evidential reasoning	BAYESIAN NETWORK; INFRASTRUCTURE; TRANSPORT; SAFETY; RESILIENCE; PORTS	This paper aims to analyse the impacts of climate change to the current and predicted future situations of road transportation in the UK and evaluate the corresponding adaptation plans to cope with them. A conceptual framework of long-term adaptation planning for climate change in road systems is proposed to ensure the resilience and sustainability of road transport systems under various climate risks such as flooding and increased temperature. To do so, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is first employed to evaluate the climate risks in the UK road transport networks. This modelling approach can tackle the high uncertainty in risk data and thus facilitate the development of the climate adaptation framework and its application in the UK road sector. To examine the feasibility of this model, a nationwide survey is conducted among the stakeholders to analyse the climate risks, in terms of the timeframe of climate threats, the likelihood of occurrence, the severity of consequences, and infrastructure resilience. From the modelling perspective, this work brings novelty by expanding the risk attribute "the severity of consequence" into three sub-attributes including economic loss, damage to the environment, and injuries and/or loss of life. It advances the-state-of-the-art technique in the current relevant literature from a single to multiple tier climate risk modelling structure. Secondly, an Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach is used to prioritise the best adaptation measure(s) by considering both the risk analysis results from the FBR and the implementation costs simultaneously. The main new contributions of this part lie in the rich raw data collected from the real world to provide useful practical insights for achieving road resilience when facing increasing climate risk challenges. During this process, a qualitative analysis of several national reports regarding the impacts posed by climate change, risk assessment and adaptation measures in the UK road sector is conducted for the relevant decision data (i.e. risk and cost). It is also supplemented by an in-depth interview with a senior planner from Highways England. The findings provide road planners and decision makers with useful insights on identification and prioritisation of climate threats as well as selection of cost-effective climate adaptation measures to rationalise adaptation planning.

Sen's slope estimator and the Mann-Kendall test were used to investigate the spatial and temporal trends in flood magnitude, based on the annual maximum peak discharge (AMPD) and Peaks Over Threshold magnitude (POT3M) flood series, of twelve typical rivers, from 1970 to 2021. The results showed that, in the AMPD series, 42% of the rivers had significantly decreasing trends, while 8% had significantly increasing trends; in the POT3M series, 25% of the rivers had significantly decreasing trends, while 8% had significantly increasing trends. The regional differences in the QMs from east to west were that, rivers in the eastern region (e.g., Gulang, Zamu, and Xiying rivers) showed significantly decreasing trends in the AMPD and POT3M series; most rivers in the central region had non-significant trends, while the Shule river in the western region showed a significantly increasing trend. Temperatures and precipitation showed a fluctuating increasing trend after 1987, which were the main factors contributing to the change in flood magnitude trends of the AMPD and POT3M flood series in the QMs. Regional differences in precipitation, precipitation intensity, and the ratio of glacial meltwater in the eastern, central and western regions, resulted in the differences in flood magnitude trends between the east and west.

Due to floods and a diverse lithology, this wetland area exhibits high plant and animal biodiversity levels and encompasses more than 185,000 km(2). In 2020, the Pantanal experienced the worst recorded fire episode in history. Hundreds of thousands of hectares burned, threatening habitats and corresponding ecosystem functions. The fire reached regions never burned before, including national conservation units. Although federal authorities have blamed climate change and cultural indigenous practices, environmentalists, scientists, and non-governmental organizations have questioned this foregone conclusion. To better understand this historical event, we examined the burn severity in conservation units most affected by fire and the association with human and climate factors (represented by the fire occurrence distance to roads/waterways/railways and drought severity, respectively) and analyzed fire spatial patterns and durations. Via a comparison of these two factors, we demonstrated that 60% of the fire outbreaks was concentrated at distances less than 5 km from roads, waterways, and railways and that 80% was concentrated at distances less than 10 km from areas with human activities. Since values of the SPEI (drought index) < -2.6 were critical to the spread of fire, a combination of more favorable climate conditions enabled the rapid and irreversible spread of fire. The observed association between fire occurrence and distance to roads makes the ongoing plans for road expansion of great concern, considering the 2020 fire episode, which greatly affected natural vegetation and conservation units across the Pantanal. The determination of trends in fire hot spot regions in the Pantanal can help environmental surveillance and fire control.

The Burdekin River is located in the dry tropics with a seasonally and interannually highly variable discharge, controlled by occasional cyclones and the ENSOdependent monsoon. Even though the peak discharge from cyclonic rainfall is decreased by a dam, large floods still occur during long-duration monsoon. While the dam traps much of the coarse sediment runoff, large amounts still reach the Delta originating from catchments downstream of the dam. The riverbed in the Delta has measurably risen in recent decades. In turn, this increases the flood levels and the threat of channel avulsion. Sand trapping by the dam and in the Delta is also starving the coast of sand, and this generates rapid coastal erosion along the 11 km long Cape Bowling Green peninsula. Climate change is enhancing this coastal erosion as in the last few decades the mean sea level and the frequency of strong winds have increased significantly. The peninsula may breach soon. As the peninsula protects Ramsar-listed wetlands of international significance, its breaching is predicted to impact the fisheries that depend on the Cape (the black marlin billfish) and on the wetlands (mud crabs, barramundi and mangrove jacks), as well as shorebirds and waterbirds. These findings demonstrate the connectivity of water and sediment throughout the river basin and the coast, and the need for management at the basin scale using ecohydrology principles.

Most of the existing nonstationary frequency analysis methods are still controversial and cannot be applied in practice. Furthermore, the nonstationarity of the annual runoff series is caused by nonstationary changes in some specific influencing factors. In this study, we remove the nonstationarity from the annual runoff series by quantifying the relationship between the annual runoff and its driving factors. This denonstationarity process removes the nonstationary influence of the driving factors and is not limited to some specific types of nonstationarity, such as trend and abrupt change. For the annual runoff series of the Weihe River, the annual average temperature (Tave), irrigation area (IA), and reservoir index (RI) are used as the reconstruction factors, respectively. And the decreasing trends in the first and second moments, and an abrupt change in 1993 are removed simultaneously by this denonstationarity method. The stationarity of the denonstationarity series reconstructed by Tave is the best, followed by the denonstationarity series reconstructed by the IA and the RI. Climate change has a more significant impact than human activity on the nonstationary change of the annual runoff. Once the reconstructed series are stationary, the traditional hydrological frequency analysis method is adopted. Reconstructed series with a higher degree of stationarity result in lower uncertainties in the design quantile of the annual runoff, whereas the significant nonstationarity in the original series results in large design value uncertainties.

Micro-business adaptation to climate change in four post-colonial and transitional economies of China	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						climate change adaptation; Institutional trust; Social capital; Business; Public confidence; China	SOCIAL-CONTRACT; FLOOD INSURANCE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE; TRANSFORMATION; VULNERABILITY; POLITICS; TOURISM; URBAN; DELTA	Public expectations of government influence private action for managing climate change risks. Institutional neglect or incompetence result in a loss of trust in public institutions, consequently discouraging the public from taking added responsibility for risk management. This has been explained in terms of social contract, but evidence suggests that a politics of distrust can reinforce alternative social drivers of action, rather than displacing action. This is empirically confirmed by the present study, which examines the tendencies for adopting private protective measures across a gradient of institutional trust. Surveys were conducted in four jurisdictions within China that operate under two different political-economic systems, namely, Hong Kong and Macao (liberal market economy), and Zhuhai and Sanya (socialist market economy). Structured interviews were conducted with 569 business operators to explore how their stated adaptation practice is related to institutional trust and social capital. We found that trust predicted action only in Sanya, which is characterized by a high level of public confidence in authorities. In places of lower institutional trust, social capital became a salient and powerful driver of action. The weakening of the social contracts in Hong Kong and Macao turned their people to alternative social mechanisms. We explain the results in terms of the development trajectories, socio-political norms and institutional settings of these jurisdictions. This study provides insights into how adaptation practice can be mediated by the consequences of a change in political leadership, policy, or governance arrangements that alters the relationship of trust.

We aim to determine the most vulnerable area and understand affected residents of this community who are living in the most sensitive areas caused by flooding events in districts of Temerloh, Pekan, and Kuantan, Pahang. This study involved collecting data for vulnerability index components. A field survey and face-to-face interviews with 602 respondents were conducted 6 months after the floods by using a questionnaire evaluation based on the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI). The findings show that residents in the Temerloh district are at higher risk of flooding damage compared to those living in Pekan and Kuantan. Meanwhile, the contribution factor of LVI-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) showed that Kuantan is more exposed to the impact of climate change, followed by Temerloh and Pekan. Among all the principal components shown, food components were considered to be the most vulnerable. Meanwhile, water components were categorised as the most invulnerable. Preventive planning involves preserving human life, minimising damage to household products, preserving crops and animals, adequate supply of clean water and food, good health and ensuring financial sustainability as an indication of changing livelihoods, sustainable food-storing systems, and other protective steps to curb damage and injury caused by annual flood strikes. Information generated on LVI assessment and adaptation procedures will help policymakers reduce people's vulnerability in the face of floods and ensure proper plans are put in place in all relevant areas.

IDENTIFICATION OF DROUGHT-FLOOD ABRUPT ALTERNATION IN TOBACCO GROWTH PERIOD IN XINGREN COUNTY UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; drought-flood abrupt alternation; moving average method; precipitation anomaly method; tobacco growth period; Xingren County		Climate change causes drought and rainstorm, two extreme hydrological events, to occur interlock, and in a short period of time the rapid transformation of drought and flood disasters, resulting in more difficult rescue and relief, agricultural losses more serious. In order to study the characteristics of drought and flood in tobacco growing period in Xingren County. By defining the Long-cycle Drought-Flood Abrupt Alternation Index (LDFAI) and Short-cycle Drought-Flood Abrupt Alternation Index (SDFAI), the moving average method and precipitation anomaly are used. For the daily precipitation data during the tobacco growth period (5 similar to 8 months) from 1961 to 2012 in Xingren County, A comprehensive analysis of the (LDFAI SDFAI) change trends and monthly precipitation changes during the growth period of tobacco. The characteristics of rapid change of drought and flood in tobacco growing period were identified. The results showed that: the LDFAI in the tobacco growth period are mainly from drought to flood. In the future, there will be an increasing trend from flood to drought, and the strength is reduced; The trend of SDFAI is: increase-decrease-decrease; there is an increasing trend from drought to flood events in May-June; June-July is a period of drought-flood abrupt alternation, and the intensity is higher. In July-August, the flood to drought event has a decreasing trend and the intensity is reduced. During the tobacco maturity period, Monthly average precipitation is higher, the precipitation fluctuates greatly, Extremely prone to Drought-Flood Abrupt Alternation. The research results can provide theoretical basis for the formulation of countermeasures for disaster prevention and mitigation in Xingren County in China	[Zhang, Z. Z.; Yuan, Y.

With climate change causing shifts in the global pattern of flood events combined with rapid urban population growth, the importance of cultivating urban resilience is widely recognized by researchers and practitioners alike. This study develops a Flood Resilience Index (FRI) inspired by the CORFU project, based on natural, physical, economic, social, and institutional attributes of the borough. Secondary data from the Legatum Institute Prosperity Index and the Thriving Places Index were used to allow for replicability and comparison with the rest of the UK. Results derived from the FRI revealed that Southwark's low levels of flooding resilience stem from a combination of natural vulnerabilities, compounded by urban challenges including housing poverty, lack of green space, and limited social capital. By locating the gaps in flood resilience and crossexamining these gaps in light of Southwark Council's flooding management strategy, this study contributes to the understanding of urban flood resilience and provides a framework for evaluating resilience in other urban areas.

An application based on an autonomous operation swimming vehicle (ASV) is being developed that will provide simulations, spatially and depth-resolved water parameter monitoring, bathymetry detection, and respiration measurement. A clustered load system is integrated with a high-resolution sonar system and compared with underwater photogrammetry objects. Additionally, a holistic 3D survey of the water body above and below the water surface is generated. The collected data are used for a simulation environment to train artificial intelligence (AI) in virtual reality (VR). These algorithms are used to improve the autonomous control of the ASV. In addition, possibilities of augmented reality (AR) can be used to visualize the data of the measurements and to use them for future ASV assistance systems. The results of the investigation into a flooded quarry are explained and discussed. There is a comprehensive, high-potential, simple, and rapid monitoring method for inland waters that is suitable for a wide range of scientific investigations and commercial uses due to climate change, simulation, monitoring, analyses, and work preparation.

As one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to extreme weather events and global warming, African countries need adequate and reliable monitoring. Decades of available Earth Observations data represent a tool complementary to the hydro-monitoring network and, in recent decades, they have demonstrated their potential, especially for data-poor regions. In this paper, a review of methods for hydrological and hydraulic modeling and for estimating river discharge by the use of satellite data, specifically radar altimetry and optical sensors, is provided, with particular focus on their role in the climate changes monitoring. More emphasis is placed on their relevance on African basins highlighting limits and advantages.

Detailed assessment of multiple measures is resource-consuming and requires specific expertise, which is not always available. To tackle these issues, in the context of the H2020 project RESCCUE (RESilience to cope with Climate Change in Urban arEas), a methodology to effectively prioritize adaptation measures against extreme rainfall-related hazards in urban areas has been developed. It follows a multi-phase structure to progressively narrow down the list of potential measures. It begins using less resource-intensive techniques, to finally focus on the in-depth analysis on a narrower selection of measures. It involves evaluation of risks, costs, and welfare impacts, with strong focus on stakeholders' participation through the entire process. The methodology is adaptable to different contexts and objectives and has been tested in two case studies across Europe, namely Barcelona and Bristol.

J	Ahmad, AN				Ahmad, Ali Nobil			Disaster cosmologies in comparative perspective: Islam, climate change and the 2010 floods in Pakistan's Southern Punjab	JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							SECURITY	As humanity enters a new era of climate-induced unpredictability, research into the role of religion in shaping perceptions of, and responses to disaster will become increasingly important. This is particularly true of South Asia, which contains dense populations certain to be adversely affected by climate change. This contribution explores the way religion shapes and mediates responses to disaster in Pakistan. Where previous work in this field has focused on extremists and militants, mine considers currents of lived Islam that take explicit stances on questions of natural resource development. Drawing upon extensive primary data, I identify two distinct disaster cosmologies permeating state and society. First, I consider the official Islam of experts and policymakers, whose approach to development is derived from, but arguably surpasses the modernism of British and American colonial and Cold War paradigms in its dogmatic, faith-based belief in the imperative of mastering and exploiting nature. The second is an altogether contrasting formation embedded in a political protest movement representing a marginalized constituency, the Siraiki speaking population of Southern Punjab, which mobilized flood affectees in the aftermath of the 2010 floods around issues of social and environmental justice.

In this paper, the topographic and morphological data of the debris flow basin, the dynamic evolution characteristics of glaciers and glacial lakes were analyzed by using multisource long-term series of remote sensing images. Simultaneously, the distribution of moraines and landslide sources were extracted based on satellite image. In addition, climate change in the study area was analysed using temperature and rainfall data from the last 40 years, revealing that the average temperature in the study area from May to October presented a fluctuating tendency as a whole, especially after 2013, when the temperature gradually increased. As these temperature changes led to continuous melting of the glaciers in the study area, the glacier area decreased from 8,300 km2 in 1988-4,584 km2 in 2019, which decreased nearly 45%. However, the number and area of glacial lakes in the study area gradually increased under a power-law trend, which further led to a significant increase on the possibility of glacial lake rupture in the study area. Due to the joint effects of earthquakes, glacier melting and glacial lake collapse, the debris flows in the study area were well developed, and a total of 122 debris flows were found with varying channel lengths, areas and material sources. Importantly, the characteristics of the glaciers, glacial lakes and climate change in the study area have indicated that the glaciers have retreated, the number of glacial lakes has increased, and the risk of debris flow in this basin will increase in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and early warnings on floods due to glacial lake collapses and debris flows in the study area to improve the risk management of debris flows and floods and the prevention and mitigation of disasters.

A systematic map protocol	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE			English	Article						Climate change; Drought; E-flow; Environmental flow; Flood; Freshwater ecology; Hydrology; Riverine biota	ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; CHANGING CLIMATE; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS; FRAMEWORK; REGIMES	Background Flow variability is considered a fundamental factor affecting riverine biota. Any alterations to flow regime can influence freshwater organisms, and this process is expected to change with the projected climate change. This systematic map, therefore, aims at investigating the impacts of natural (resulting from climatic variability), anthropogenic (resulting from direct human pressure), and climate change-induced flow variability on fish and macroinvertebrates of temperate floodplain rivers in Central and Western Europe. Particular focus will be placed on the effects of extreme low and high discharges. These rare events are known to regulate population size and taxonomic diversity. Methods All studies investigating the effects of flow variability on metrics concerning freshwater fish and macroinvertebrates will be considered in the map, particularly metrics such as: abundance, density, diversity, growth, migration, recruitment, reproduction, survival, or their substitutes, such as biomonitoring indices. Relevant flow variability will reflect (1) anthropogenic causes: dams, reservoirs, hydroelectric facilities, locks, levees, water abstraction, water diversion, land-use changes, road culverts; (2) natural causes: floods, droughts, seasonal changes; or (3) climate change. Geographically, the map will cover the ecoregion of Central and Western Europe, focusing on its major habitat type, namely "temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands". The review will employ search engines and specialist websites, and cover primary and grey literature. No date, language, or document type restrictions will be applied in the search strategy. We expect the results to be primarily in English, although evidence (meeting all eligibility criteria) from other languages within the study area will also be included. We will also contact relevant stakeholders and announce an open call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and abstract, and full text. From eligible studies the following information will be extracted: the cause of flow variability, location, type of study, outcomes, etc. A searchable database containing extracted data will be developed and provided as supplementary material to the map report. The final narrative will describe the quantity and key characteristics of the available evidence, and identify knowledge gaps and knowledge clusters, i.e. subtopics sufficiently covered by existing studies allowing full systematic review and meta-analysis.

J	Yamamoto, K; Sayama, T; Apip				Yamamoto, Kodai; Sayama, Takahiro; Apip			Impact of climate change on flood inundation in a tropical river basin in Indonesia	PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate change; Flooding; NHRCM; Peatland; Quantile mapping; RRI model; Sumatra Island; The Batanghari River basin; Variance scaling	MARITIME CONTINENT; BIAS CORRECTION; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; MODEL; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; SENSITIVITY; MONSOON; RUNOFF; SIMULATIONS	Climate change will have a significant impact on the water cycle and will lead to severe environmental problems and disasters in humid tropical river basins. Examples include river basins in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, where the coastal lowland areas are mostly composed of peatland that is a wetland environment initially sustained by flooding from rivers. Climate change may alter the frequency and magnitude of flood inundation in these lowland areas, disturbing the peatland environment and its carbon dynamics and damaging agricultural plantations. Consequently, projecting the extent of inundation due to future flooding events is considered important for river basin management. Using dynamically downscaled climate data obtained by the Non-Hydrostatic Regional Climate Model (NHRCM), the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was applied to the Batanghari River Basin (42,960 km(2)) in Sumatra Island, Indonesia, to project the extent of flood inundation in the latter part of the twenty-first century. In order to obtain reasonable estimates of the extent of future flood inundation, this study compared two bias correction methods: a Quantile Mapping (QM) method and a combination of QM and Variance Scaling (VS) methods. The results showed that the bias correction obtained by the QM method improved the simulated flow duration curve (FDC) obtained from the RRI model, which facilitated comparison with the simulated FDC using reference rainfall data. However, the high spatial variability observed in daily and 15-day rainfall data remained as the spatial variation bias, and this could not be resolved by simple QM bias correction alone. Consequently, the simulated extreme variables, such as annual maximum flood inundation volume, were overestimated compared to the reference data. By introducing QM-VS bias correction, the cumulative density functions of annual maximum discharge and inundation volumes were improved. The findings also showed that flooding will increase in this region; for example, the flood inundation volume corresponding to a 20-year return period will increase by 3.3 times. River basin management measures, such as land use regulations for plantations and wetland conservation, should therefore consider increases in flood depth and area, the extents of which under a future climate scenario are presented in this study.

J	Ghosh, M; Ghosal, S				Ghosh, Manoranjan; Ghosal, Somnath			Climate change vulnerability of rural households in flood-prone areas of Himalayan foothills, West Bengal, India	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Climate change vulnerability; Himalayan foothills; Livelihood strategy; Environmental profile; Livelihoods insecurity	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; NORTH BENGAL; ADAPTATION; POVERTY; IMPACTS; INDEX; RISKS	The Himalayan foothills of West Bengal are a part of the great Eastern Himalaya, which is by locational virtue a recognized flood-prone area. The area is also well known for frequent and heavy rain storms and climate-induced catastrophic events, such as flash floods due to the unprecedented rains in the Bhutan Himalaya. Therefore, climate-induced disasters like floods have been the prime reasons for rural vulnerabilities. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to find out whether there are any differences between levels of vulnerability amidst agriculture-dependent villages and forest resource-dependent villages in the same flood-prone area or not. In addition, the study will also examine how the agriculture-dependent villages are different from forest resource-dependent villages in terms of climate vulnerability and vice versa. The climate change vulnerability index has been applied, and a total of 100 households have been surveyed covering seven dimensions of vulnerability. The exposure score was found to be the highest in Raja Bhatkhawa (0.41) followed by Nathuar Char (0.30) and Bhelakoba (0.27). No significant differences were found in terms of climatic exposure except in Mendabari. Further, it has been observed that the resilience factors in households like education, workforce opportunities, health, and institutional accessibility are highly uneven, which has been creating hinders to the adaptive capacity. In the villages where overall vulnerability to climate change was found to be high, the adaptive capacity was found to be low. Simultaneously, in those villages, the sensitivity was found to be high. It has been found that the location of the villages plays an important role when it comes to vulnerability because the forest villages are relatively more vulnerable than the agricultural villages. However, the riverside location of Nathuar Char has made this village highly vulnerable; and the people of Nathuar Char have been living with floods, and they are trying to adapt with climate-induced floods. Finally, it has been observed that vulnerability is context dependent (i.e. based on land resources, accessibility to basic infrastructure, water and sanitation facilities, and awareness to disasters) and varies from household to household.

On the Potentials and Limitations of Attributing a Small-Scale Climate Event	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; clouburst; attribution; pseudo-global warming; flash flood	PRECIPITATION; FORMULATION; ENSEMBLE; WEATHER; SCHEME; END	Intense convective storms can be hazardous when occurring over large populated cities. In a changing climate, decision makers and the general public increasingly need to be able to better understand if and to what extent these storms are influenced by anthropological climate change and what to expect as climate continues to warm. Unfortunately due to their limited ability to resolve small-scale features in models, convective storms remain a challenge to the modeling community. Here, we use a forecast-ensemble based method using a convection permitting model with full data-assimilation, to assess the risk of exceeding certain precipitation thresholds related to a critical cloudburst event that occurred over Copenhagen, Denmark. Our results show that this set-up is representing well the overall observed intensities. By adapting a pseudo-global warming approach, we show that both the risk for flooding and the risk for reaching unprecedented precipitation intensity increases resulting from further warming.

By 2050, more than half of the population in the developing countries like India are expected to migrate to urban regions. Urbanization is triggered in developing countries as people migrate to cities in search of employment opportunities resulting in formation of new slums. With high density of population concentration in cities, urban floods are triggered leading to a significant impact of human life and economy of the country. The review focuses on addressing the urban flood occurrence in India and its relationship with population growth climate change. The study also describes the impact of urban floods to the environment and integrated methodologies adopted over decades for the prediction and effective mitigation and management during a disaster event.

Information on geohazards specific to an urban lowland area (river floods, flash floods, mass movement, wind erosion) because of increasing climate change was compiled into a geomorphological map. The most spatially widespread geohazards in Poznan include: (a) on moraine hills/uplands: mass movement, wind erosion, and flash floods (4.9% of the city area); (b) on outwash plains: mass movement and flash floods (8.6% of the city area); (c) on fluvial landforms: mass movement and river floods (9.8% of the city area); (d) within plains of various origin: flash floods (7.6% of the city area). Mass movement affecting short but numerous (and locally steep) slopes, and flash floods are the most widespread geohazards (16 and 14%, of Poznan's area, respectively). Extensive urbanisation especially the expansion of impervious surfaces increases the high risk of flash floods.

For that, a cost analysis of adaptation strategies was carried out over a period of 50 years for Furadouro Beach, Ovar Portugal, a low-lying coastal area with high coastal erosion and frequent overtopping. The results show that cumulative costs of adaptation measures in the combination of defense and accommodation strategies are (sic) 276M, (sic) 164M in accommodation, (sic) 112M in defense and (sic) 75M in retreat. These results are an example of the importance of evaluating adaptation strategies in high-risk areas and show the usefulness of the approach taken as a support to decision making for processes that involve urban management and territorial planning of coastal zones vulnerable to the coastal erosion, wave overtopping and coastal flooding.

Later subsequent revitalization measures, transboundary controlled river management, wetland restorati-on, and integrated planning were realized to reduce the negative effect of groundwater dropping and other environmen-tal problems. This study aimed to follow the dynamic of groundwater level, soil properties and forest vitality as affected by climate change. The continuous dataset (2019-2022) of soil physical and hydrophysical parameters and tree radial growth parameters were obtained. Groundwater level was evaluated by z-score and the means, and standard deviation values were considered. The monthly assessment of soil and climatic conditions showed that the uneven distribution of rainfall and the increase in temperatures have significantly affected the soil hydrological regime and forest growth. Continual monitoring is necessary to prepare projection models, which can help better understand both the soil and tree growth parameters in the changing environment.

Managed retreat through voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; DECISION-MAKING; RELOCATION; ADAPTATION; ACQUISITION; ACCEPTANCE; IMPACTS; POLICY; MODEL; STAY	Retreat from some areas will become unavoidable under intensifying climate change. Existing deployments of managed retreat are at small scale compared to potential future needs, leaving open questions about where, when, and how retreat under climate change will occur. Here, we analyze more than 40,000 voluntary buyouts of flood-prone properties in the United States, in which homeowners sell properties to the government and the land is restored to open space. In contrast to model-based evaluation of potential future retreat, local governments in counties with higher population and income are more likely to administer buyouts. The bought-out properties themselves, however, are concentrated in areas of greater social vulnerability within these counties, pointing to the importance of assessing the equity of buyout implementation and outcomes. These patterns demonstrate the challenges associated with locally driven implementation of managed retreat and the potential benefits of experimentation with different approaches to retreat.

This study aims to spatially and quantitatively assess the changes in extreme precipitation properties by comparing the NOAA Atlas 14 with a new atlas of precipitation frequency estimates (PFE) developed in this study from early 21st-century recordsNew hydrological insights for the region: The NOAA Atlas 14 has quantitatively diverged from the recent 20-year records due to precipitation non-stationarity across the United States. The NOAA Atlas 14 is characterized by more spatially smoothed PFEs compared to the new PFEs, suggesting that employing the NOAA Atlas 14 could lead to an underestimation of physical flood risk at a local scale. As the "new normal" in the 21st century, the majority of the United States faces three times more occurrences of extreme storms corresponding to a 1-in-100-year return period of the 20th century. The recent 20-year extreme events should be treated as the new normal. Until the NOAA Atlas 14 is updated to account for climate-driven non-stationarity and can be shown to resolve local effects better, it is recommended to employ new values between the upper and middle bounds of PFE that capture the non-stationarity of precipitation for the regions where the underestimation of PFEs is highlighted in this study	[Kim, Jungho; Amodeo, Mike; Kearns, Edward J.] First St Fdn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA		Kim, J (corresponding author), First St Fdn, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.

Floodplain lakes (FPLs) are essential parts of complex floodplain ecosystems' biological and hydro-chemical processes. Clear seasonal cycles, determined by the regime of the parent river and closely linked to climatic conditions, are observed in these lakes. Both the quantity and the quality of water are determined by the functional phases of a floodplain lake; limnophase, when the lake is isolated from the river, and potamophase (inundation), when the floodplain lake is overflowed by the river waters. These phases highly modify lake bathymetry, water balance, chemistry, and biology. Human pressure, mostly dam construction and land use changes, alter the frequency, duration, and intensity of natural cycles of inundation. The majority of large rivers in the Northern Hemisphere have been impacted by human activity. Floodplain lakes are also affected by continuous climate change, due to the alterations of the hydrological regimes. Cyanobacterial blooms in floodplain lakes are often characterized by high qualitative and quantitative annual and long-term variability. The main forces driving cyanobacterial blooms can be found in the flooding dynamics and intensity influencing hydraulic residence time and the concentration of biogenic compounds in lake water. Cyanotoxin production and seasonal dynamics in floodplain lakes have been rarely studied, particularly in connection with the hydrological regime. Moreover, the effects of cyanobacterial blooms and their toxicity to organisms inhabiting floodplain lakes, connected rivers, and floodplains are poorly understood. Therefore, knowledge of the processes controlling floodplain lakes' ecological conditions is crucial to implementing water management and restoration practices, protecting those fragile and precious ecosystems from degradation and possible extension.

To slow down climate change and reduce its associated risks, governments around the world are currently developing policies to encourage farmers to engage in adaptation and mitigation efforts. The aim of this study is to assess the adoption and intensity of use of extreme weather adaptation and mitigation strategies among a sample of Missouri farmers and to identify the factors that influence adaptation and mitigation behavior. Of particular interest is the influence of the 2019 Missouri River flooding on adaptation and mitigation efforts. An econometric hurdle model that separates the decision on whether to adopt adaptation/mitigation strategies from the decision on how many strategies to employ was used to achieve the study's purpose. Improving field drainage or soil water retention capacity for potential flooding was found to be by far the most used adaptation. The most used mitigations were increasing use of minimum tillage, managing fertilizer, and planting cover crops. Types of crops grown, farm income, and opinions on extreme weather events were the most important determinants of both adaptation and mitigation decision. Direct experience with the 2019 Missouri River floods is found to only influence adaptation decision. Adaptation and mitigation intensity were found to be strongly influenced by opinions on government support for adaptation and CRP involvement, respectively. Directions for policy and outreach that can promote adaptation and mitigation efforts among farmers are discussed.

However, the future water availability of the region, and even today's runoff regime, are both hotly debated and inadequately quantified. Here, we characterize the contemporary flow regimes and systematically assess the future evolution of total water availability, seasonal shifts, and dry and wet discharge extremes in four most meltwater-dominated basins in the western TP, by using a process-based, well-established glacier-hydrology model, well-constrained historical reference climate data, and the ensemble of 22 global climate models with an advanced statistical downscaling and bias correction technique. We show that these basins face sharply diverging water futures under 21st century climate change. In RCP scenarios 4.5 and 8.5, increased precipitation and glacier runoff in the Upper Indus and Yarkant basins more than compensate for decreased winter snow accumulation, boosting annual and summer water availability through the end of the century. In contrast, the Amu and Syr Darya basins will become more reliant on rainfall runoff as glacier ice and seasonal snow decline. Syr Darya summer river-flows, already low, will fall by 16%-30% by end-of-century, and striking increases in peak flood discharge (by >60%), drought duration (by >1 month) and drought intensity (by factor 4.6) will compound the considerable water-sharing challenges on this major transboundary river.

In October 2019, eastern Japan was hit by Hagibis, a large and high-speed typhoon. This unprecedented typhoon caused the evacuation of over 4000 people, injured more than 300 people, and damaged more than 98,000 dwellings throughout the affected area. Because floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters in Asia, providing an effective early warning system (EWS) is critical to reducing disaster impacts. However, warnings based only on natural hazard monitoring do not offer sufficient protection. Integrating natural hazard monitoring and social media data could improve warning systems to enhance the awareness of disaster managers and citizens about emergency events. We analyzed time-series data including rainfall intensity, 90-min-effective rainfall, and river water level as well as Twitter data related to disaster events during the 5-day period from 11 to 15 October, focusing on the most affected areas in Japan. The analysis included more than 60,000 tweets. Our analysis confirmed the utility of the statistical approach of outbreak detection with social media data in the early detection and local identification of multiple-flood events, and the results from the municipality-level analyses show that tweet frequencies related to the flood disaster ontological categories were significantly correlated to temporal variations in the hazard monitoring data. Thus, flood detection at the administrative level using social media data combined with current hazard monitoring data can enable a decision-driven EWS design. Interactive approaches for decision-making and knowledge production should continue to be considered in the face of climate-change-induced disasters. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Kingston has often caused the most damage due to its high population density and capital exposure. Kingston is crucial to the country's socio-economic stability, and climate change is increasing flood risk, but a local-scale assessment of its flood risk is unavailable. This study fills this gap in the literature by using two models of the integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (inVEST) suite to qualitatively assess Kingston metropolitan pluvial and coastal flood risk. Key locations like Kingston Container Terminal and downtown Kingston are at high coastal flood risk, according to the results. The study also shows that sea level rise (117%) and habitat loss (104%) will increase the highly exposed area. Instead of hard-engineering coastal protection, this study suggests investing in nature-based and ecoengineering solutions to improve coastal resilience and ecosystem services. The urban flood assessment finds downtown, particularly the Mountview and Minor catchments, at high risk due to poor runoff retention and high population density. To fully address downtown pluvial flood risk, structural social reforms are needed. To reduce short-term flood risk, local authorities should consider targeted adaptation measures. These may include maintaining the drainage gully system and reducing surface runoff in uphill downtown areas. Thus, this study seeks to inform Kingston urban planners about risk distribution and suggest adaptation measures to improve flood resilience.

J	Rosinger, AY				Rosinger, Asher Y. Y.			Extreme climatic events and human biology and health: A primer and opportunities for future research	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article							HOUSEHOLD WATER INSECURITY; SEA-LEVEL RISE; HEAT EXTREMES; HOT WEATHER; IMPACTS; DROUGHT; STRESS; FLOODS; EVOLUTIONARY	Extreme climatic events are increasing in frequency, leading to hotter temperatures, flooding, droughts, severe storms, and rising oceans. This special issue brings together a collection of seven articles that describe the impacts of extreme climatic events on a diverse set of human biology and health outcomes. The first two articles cover extreme temperatures extending from extreme heat to cold and changes in winter weather and the respective implications for adverse health events, human environmental limits, well-being, and human adaptability. Next, two articles cover the effects of exposures to extreme storms through an examination of hurricanes and cyclones on stress and birth outcomes. The following two articles describe the effects of extreme flooding events on livelihoods, nutrition, water and food insecurity, diarrheal and respiratory health, and stress. The last article examines the effects of drought on diet and food insecurity. Following a brief review of each extreme climatic event and articles covered in this special issue, I discuss future research opportunities-highlighting domains of climate change and specific research questions that are ripe for biological anthropologists to investigate. I close with a description of interdisciplinary methods to assess climate exposures and human biology outcomes to aid the investigation of the defining question of our time - how climate change will affect human biology and health. Ultimately, climate change is a water, food, and health problem. Human biologists offer a unique perspective for a combination of theoretical, methodological, and applied reasons and thus are in a prime position to contribute to this critical research agenda.

J	Parida, D; Moses, S; Rahaman, KR				Parida, Debadutta; Moses, Sandra; Rahaman, Khan Rubayet			Analysing media framing of cyclone Amphan: Implications for risk communication and disaster preparedness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Cyclone; Amphan; Communication; Policy; Media	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS; NATURAL DISASTERS; FLOOD RISK; MASS-MEDIA; NEWS MEDIA; GOVERNANCE; COVERAGE; REDUCTION; PERCEPTIONS	The role of media framing is drawing significant scholarly attention among disaster and climate scholars in recent times, in terms of its short and long-term impacts on risk preparedness and climate change adaptation. In this paper, we explore the connections between media framing of disasters, and risk communication and preparedness. Through the case of media coverage of eleven newspapers (international and national publications) around the event of Cyclone Amphan in South Asia, we portray a strong media framing around the event. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, the response system in India and Bangladesh could not follow pre-determined disaster action plans and protocols for a coordinated response, due to the risks and restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. Secondly, the journalistic response to cyclone Amphan framed the disaster event as 'natural', thus reinforcing the reliance on a short-term Response & Recovery centric approach (evacuation, rescue, and relief), over long-term approaches such as disaster preparedness and prevention (adaptation, mitigation, and resilience). Finally, we find that media framing focused on personal stories of individuals helps advance the needs of vulnerable groups; yet at the same time concretizes a relief-centric approach that ignores questions around disaster infrastructure, resilience, and climate change adaptation. We contend that an integrated risk communication approach that is adaptive, takes into account multiple risks and complexities while allowing coordinated efforts between actors and institutions is necessary to develop an effective response policy for disasters and climate-induced extreme events in the future.

Gender-based differences in flood vulnerability among men and women in the <i>char</i> farming households of Bangladesh	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Char households; Vulnerability; Floods; Livelihood; Gender; Bangladesh	LOCAL-GOVERNMENT AREA; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FARMERS; RISK; COMMUNITY; ATTITUDES; MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTION	Gender and vulnerability are important issues to examine in the context of flooding caused by climate change. Men and women around the world adapt differently to climate change effects and natural disasters. Therefore, this study examines men and women's level of vulnerabilities and their choices of livelihood practices in char farming households in Zanjira, Bangladesh. The study used primary and secondary data. Both qualitative and quantitative were collected. Quantitative data were collected from a household survey of 115 men and 114 women using a questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected through 15 key informant interviews, 30 focus group discussions, and 18 in-depth interviews. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess men and women's vulnerabilities, including three indices of vulnerability measuring access to livelihood assets were used. A hierarchical regression model was used to perform a gender-based analysis. The percentile score for men was 0.430 units higher than for women, revealing that male respondents were less vulnerable than female respondents in the study area. The results of the regression model showed that the use of gender as an explanatory variable increased the explanatory power of the model and was highly significant. The overall findings of quantitative and qualitative data analysis revealed that floods' impacts were different for men and women and that women were more vulnerable overall, in part because of gender-related sociocultural norms. These differentials in vulnerabilities affected men and women's ability to respond and recover from floods and adapt to new opportunities when disaster strikes.

The RESCCUE Project	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban resilience; cascading effects; climate change; pluvial floods; 1D; 2D coupled models	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; HYDRAULIC EFFICIENCY; METHODOLOGY; IMPACT	The results of recent climate projections for the city of Barcelona show a relevant increment of the maximum rainfall intensities for the period 2071-2100. Considering the city as a system of systems, urban resilience is strictly linked to the proper functioning of urban services and the knowledge of the cascading effects that may occur in the case of the failure of one or more critical infrastructures of a particular strategic sector. In this context, the aim of this paper is to assess urban resilience through the analysis of the behavior of the main urban services in case of pluvial floods for current and future rainfall conditions due to climate change. A comprehensive flood risk assessment including direct, indirect, tangible and intangible impacts has been performed using cutting edge sectorial and integrated models to analyze the resilience of different urban services (urban drainage, traffic, electric and waste sectors) and their cascade effects. In addition, the paper shows how the information generated by these models can be employed to feed a more holistic analysis to provide a general overview of the city's resilience in the case of extreme rainfall events. According to the obtained results, Barcelona could suffer a significant increase of socio-economic impacts due to climate change if adaptation measures are not adopted. In several cases, these impacts have been geographically distributed showing the specific situation of each district of the city for current and future scenarios. This information is essential for the justification and prioritization of the implementation of adaptation measures.

Climate change and local anthropogenic activities such as river regulation and urban growth are raising risk levels in coastal hotspots, like low-lying areas of river deltas. This urges to revise present management strategies to guarantee their future sustainability, demanding a detailed diagnostic of the hazard evolution. In this paper, flooding and erosion under current and future conditions have been assessed at local scale at the urban area of Riumar, a touristic enclave placed at the Ebro Delta (Spain). Process-based models have been used to address the interaction between beach morphology and storm waves, as well as the influence of coastal environment complexity. Storm waves have been propagated with SWAN wave model and have provided the forcings for XBeach, a 2DH hydro-morphodynamic model. Results show that future trends in sea level rise and wave forcing produce non-linear variations of the flooded area and the volume of mobilized sediment resulting from marine storms. In particular, the balance between flooding and sediment transport will shift depending on the relative sea level. Wave induced flooding and long-shore sand transport seem to be diminished in the future, whereas static sea level flooding and cross-shore sediment transport are exacerbated. Therefore, the characterization of tipping points in the coastal response can help to develop robust and adaptive plans to manage climate change impact in sandy wave dominated coasts with a low-lying hinterland and a complex shoreline morphology.

Identifying dominant sources of model spread in an ensemble of hydrologic projections is critically important for developing reliable hydrological projections in support of flooding risk assessment and water resources management; however, it is not well understood due to the multifactor and multiscale complexities involved in the long-term hydrological projections. Therefore, a stepwise clustered Bayesian (SCB) ensemble method will be first developed to improve the performance of long-term hydrological projections. Meanwhile, a mixed-level factorial inference (MLFI) approach is employed to estimate multiple uncertainties in hydrological projections over the Jing River basin (JRB). MLFI is able to reveal the main and interactive effects of the anthropogenic emission and model choices on the SCB ensemble projections. The results suggest that the daily maximum temperature under RCP8.5 in the 2050s and 2080s is expected to respectively increase by 3.2 degrees and 5.2 degrees C, which are much higher than the increases under RCP4.5. The maximum increase of the RegCM driven by CanESM2 (CARM)-projected changes in streamflow for the 2050s and 2080s under RCP4.5 is 0.30 and 0.59 x 10(3) m s(-3) in November, respectively. In addition, in a multimodel GCM-RCM-HM ensemble, hydroclimate is found to be most sensitive to the choice of GCM. Moreover, it is revealed that the percentage of contribution of anthropogenic emissions to the changes in monthly precipitation is relatively smaller, but it makes a more significant contribution to the total variance of changes in potential evapotranspiration and streamflow. Significance StatementIncreasing concerns have been paid to climate change due to its aggravating impacts on the hydrologic regime, leading to water-related disasters. Such impacts can be investigated through long-term hydrological projection under climate change. However, it is not well understood what factor plays a dominant role in inducing extensive uncertainties associated with the long-term hydrological projections due to plausible meteorological forcings, multiple hydrologic models, and internal variability. The stepwise cluster Bayesian ensemble method and mixed-level factorial inference approach are employed to quantify the contribution of multiple uncertainty sources. We find that the total variance of changes in monthly precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow can be mainly explained by the model choices. The identified dominant factor accounting for projection uncertainties is critically important for developing reliable hydrological projections in support of flooding risk assessment and water resources management. It is suggested that more reliable models should be taken into consideration in order to improve the projection robustness from a perspective of the Loess Plateau.

The objective of this study is to explore the major adaptation strategies, the determinants of the decisions of households to flood adaptation, specific prophylactic measures, and the constraints of these adaptation measures. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select the 337 samples for the study. As the data analysis showed, farm households adopted moving to high elevation places, selling cattle, seasonal migration, flood tolerant rice, planting trees, and the construction of a dike as adaptation measures to flood. The binary logistic regression results from both the socioeconomic and protection motivation theory (PMT) showed that marital status, sex, family size, off-farm income, previous flood experience, access to credit, and the average number of extension visits had a statistically significant positive influence on the flood adaptation decision of households. On the other hand, age, educational attainment, farm size, and access to extension played a negative but statistically insignificant role in flood adaptation decision. The scientific novelty of the paper is that its results revealed that not only the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households play a role in the decision-making reactions related to the flood, but also the psychological preparedness of the decision makers. The analysis also drew attention that, due to the mitigation of global influences, in the coming years, households can assume a much more decisive role in the process of local food supply. Therefore, in order to ensure safe supply, climate change-related measures and adaptation strategies must be defined very precisely. Dealing with this phenomenon must be part of social and business innovation as it can cause not only food supply problems but also various migration effects, which, in the short term, would result in the most serious damage to the social system.

It employed a cross-sectional survey of 1370 households across 27 counties in Kenya that are prone to droughts and floods. Bivariate probit regressions reveal that households employ multiple coping measures related to finance, the social safety net and non-finance choices. The use of coping measures vary by household income, household dependency ratio, geographic and agro-climatic contexts, as well as the household head's age and educational attainment. Further, the findings reveal that the use of the social safety net and non-finance coping mechanisms demonstrate complementarities in coping with droughts, suggesting that opportunities to benefit from the social safety net do not dampen livelihood diversification initiatives by the households. Additionally, households in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) depend to a large extent on the social safety net and non-finance livelihood diversification coping mechanisms, signalling the need to explore ways that encourage private sector development in promoting market-oriented coping strategies.

Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism and driving forces for the change of environmental quality with urbanization process is essential to improve the environmental sustainability. In this study, the compounded night light index (CNLI) and remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) were used respec-tively to evaluate the urbanization level and environmental quality in Ethiopia from 2010 to 2020. On this basis, a temporospatial assessment framework was proposed, followed by methods of coupling coordination degree, spatial autocorrelation, elasticity, and decomposition. The results showed that 63 out of 690 woredas experi-enced environmental deterioration. Socioeconomic effect, carbon intensity, and climate change were decom-posed as drivers to environmental quality, with socioeconomic effects contributing >68% of environmental improvement, while carbon intensity and climate change were responsible for >51% and >58% of environ-mental deterioration from 2010 values. Continuous increase in impervious surfaces resulted in a six-fold increase in surface runoff, which raised the flooding risk in sub areas and rural landscapes. This demands reforms of climate strategies and proper livestock management.

J	Xie, ZY; Peng, BH				Xie, Zhenyu; Peng, Benhong			A Framework for Resilient City Governance in Response to Sudden Weather Disasters: A Perspective Based on Accident Causation Theories	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						resilient city; urban resilience; climate change; extreme weather events; disaster governance; accident causation	URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; SPONGE CITY; RISK-MANAGEMENT; INFRASTRUCTURE; IMPLEMENTATION; CONSTRUCTION; CITIES	With climate change, urban resilience is becoming a critical concept for helping cities withstand disasters and accidents. However, current research often focuses on concept identification, leaving a gap between concept and implementation. This study aims to investigate the lack of urban resilience in the face of sudden weather disasters, with a focus on the inadequate capacity of urban systems to effectively govern such events. The Zhengzhou subway flooding accident on 20 July 2021, serves as a case study for this research, and the accident causation theories, such as the Swiss cheese model, Surry's accident model, and trajectory intersection theory are used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the accident's causes. Through this analysis, the paper identifies vulnerabilities in the natural, technical, and man-made systems of the urban system, and reveals deficiencies in four aspects of urban resilience: natural, technological, institutional, and organizational. Based on this analysis, the study proposes a resilient city governance framework that integrates the "Natural-Technical-Man-made" systems, offers relevant recommendations for urban resilience governance, and discusses potential challenges to urban resilience implementation.

Here, we use a coupled land-atmosphere global climate model and a glacier model to address these questions. Under a high-emission scenario, TP surface albedo darkening will increase local temperature by 0.24 K by the end of this century. This warming will strengthen the elevated heat pump of TP, increasing South Asian monsoon precipitation while exacerbating the current "South Flood-North Drought" pattern over East Asia. The albedo darkening-induced climate change also leads to an accompanying TP glacier volume loss of 6.9%, which further increases to 25.2% at the equilibrium, with a notable loss in western TP. Our findings emphasize the importance of land-surface change responses in projecting future water resource availability, with important implications for water management policies. Impacts of Tibetan Plateau darkening remain unclear. Here authors show that darkening under the RCP8.5 scenario will increase South Asian monsoon precipitation and the "South Flood-North Drought" pattern over East Asia, while lead to local glacier loss.

In particular, root system architecture (RSA) determines the extent of the region of the soil where water and nutrients can be gathered. As global climate change accelerates, it will be important to improve belowground plant parts, as well as above-ground ones, because roots are front-line organs in the response to abiotic stresses such as drought, flooding. and salinity stress. However, using conventional breeding based on phenotypic selection, it is difficult to select breeding lines possessing promising RSAs to adapted to abiotic stress because roots remain hidden underground. Therefore, new breeding strategies that do not require phenotypic selection are necessary. Recent advances in molecular biology and biotechnology can be applied to the design-oriented breeding of RSA without phenotypic selection. Here I summarize recent progress in RSA ideotypes as "design" and RSA-related gene resources as "materials" that will be needed in leveraging these technologies for the RSA breeding. I also highlight the future challenges to design-oriented breeding of RSA and explore solutions to these challenges.

For instance, arid and semi-arid environments experience a high level of uncertainty in rainfall, which results in unforeseen periods of droughts, or high-intensity rainfall, which generates severe floods, increasing the water insecurity and flood damage in these areas. Climate pattern variations are specifically critical to forecast conditions for flood hazard management. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are useful tools to forecast future climate change scenarios. However, the application of GCM in flood hazard management is particularly challenging, given that they operate under high uncertainty and coarse scale. In this context, a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map was generated by using a multi criteria index approach, based on defining the greater influence of seven factors related to flood generation: runoff coefficient, elevation, slope, distance from the drainage network, rainfall intensity, soil erosion and land use. In this paper, we utilized monthly data for the baseline period (1980-2004), and then the output of 8 GCMs for surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation were downscaled using a statistical model and evaluated in the baseline period. Consequently, the most suitable models were selected according to their average monthly performance. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was then used to develop a runoff coefficient map, using the downscaled outputs of the selected GCMs. Accordingly, a flood hazard model was developed at a large basin in the northeast of Iran for baseline and future periods (2040-2064) under RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. Having validated the generated flood map for the baseline period, the future maps were generated and compared. Results show the increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation; however, it was found that rainfall intensities are to be increased. This supports the final flood hazard map for the future climate conditions scenario with an increased relative hazard level. This was particularly observed in flat, and moderate sloped areas, compared to the model results with historic climate data.

Climate change can alter precipitation, driving fluctuations in lake water levels. Extreme fluctuations can cause flooding, water shortages, and changes in lake water quality and ecosystems, as well as affecting fisheries and tourism. Despite the need to predict future water-level rises, especially in the context of climate change, long-term hydrological studies are scarce. Here, we analyzed 93 years of data from 1928 to 2020 to identify changes in the relationship between water level and precipitation in Lake Yamanaka, Japan. We found that the six-day maximum rise in water level for the same six-day maximum precipitation was significantly greater in the later period than in the earlier period; the difference increased with increasing precipitation. Particularly large increases in precipitation were sometimes caused by a single event or by multiple events occurring in succession.

Disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change should include a holistic and multi-scale perspective, to address the challenges of sustainable urban development and the conservation of the cultural value of our cities. In this research, an integral multistakeholder methodological approach is presented for risk assessment, supported by a data-collection and analysis strategy and a multi-scale urban model based on CityGML. A method of sampling buildings is presented together with the necessary data analysis, in order to perform the analysis at city scale. The methodology is implemented in DonostiaSan Sebasti ' an (northern Spain), a city located alongside a river estuary on the coastline. A sample of 2262 buildings are analyzed with varied characteristics at risk of extreme precipitation and/or storm surges and sea-level rise. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the methodology at generating a unique risk index through a balance between the resources for data collection and the accuracy of the results, supported by a graphical 3D representation to facilitate results interpretation, and the subsequent evidence-based decision-making for prioritizing sustainable interventions.

In this context, this study explored the evolution characteristics of drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) and its impacts on total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) pollution, from 2020 to 2050, in the Luanhe river basin (LRB), based on the predicted meteorological data of the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) climate scenarios and simulated surface water quality data of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results show that DFAA occurred more frequently in summer, with an increasing trend from northwest to southeast of the LRB, basically concentrated in the downstream plain area, and the irrigation area. Meanwhile, most of the DFAA events were in light level. The incidence of TN pollution was much larger than the incidence of TP pollution and simultaneous occurrence of TN and TP pollution. The TN pollution was more serious than TP pollution in the basin. When DFAA occurred, TN pollution almost occurred simultaneously. Also, when TP pollution occurred, the TN pollution occurred simultaneously. These results could provide some references for the effects and adaptation-strategies study of extreme climate change and its influence on surface water quality.

J	Seastedt, H; Nadeau, K				Seastedt, Hana; Nadeau, Kari			Factors by which global warming worsens allergic disease	ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							MITIGATING CLIMATE-CHANGE; AIR-POLLUTION; HEALTH; ASTHMA; SENSITIZATION; EXPOSURE; MICROBIOME; DETERGENTS; IMPACT; AREAS	Increased use of fossil fuels has led to global warming with concomitant increases in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as wildfires and sand and dust storms. These changes have led to increases in air pollutants such as particulate matter and greenhouse gases. Global warming is also associated with increases in pollen season length and pollen concentration. Particulate matter, greenhouse gases, and pollen synergistically increase the incidence and severity of allergic diseases. Other indirect factors such as droughts, flooding, thunderstorms, heat waves, water pollution, human migration, deforestation, loss of green space, and decreasing biodiversity (including microbial diversity) also affect the incidence and severity of allergic disease. Global warming and extreme weather events are expected to increase in the coming decades, and further increases in allergic diseases are expected, exacerbating the already high health care burden associated with these diseases. There is an urgent need to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change to improve human health. Human health and planetary health are connected and the concept of One Health, which is an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals, and the environment needs to be emphasized. Clinicians are trusted members of the community, and they need to take a strong leadership role in educating patients on climate change and its adverse effects on human health. They also need to advocate for policy changes that decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase biodiversity and green space to enable a healthier and more sustainable future.(c) 2023 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

In the last decades, climate change and its related environmental disturbances have favored the appearance of disease outbreaks caused by plant pathogenic microorganisms. In this context, several root-inhabiting Phy-tophthora species have emerged as causal agents of "catastrophic tree mortality". A robust body of scientific literature supports the hypothesis for the convergence between Phytophthora and predisposing environmental conditions as warm temperatures, flooding, and drought to establish the optimal conditions for the pathogen proliferation and infection. Due to the climatic alterations and bad agricultural and silvicultural practices tree decline and mortality in extensive zones of forests localized at the Boreal region of America, Asia and Europe, and in Oceania have been observed. Because of global climate change trees have been forced to migrate towards new geographical sites, which in the presence of exotic Phytophthora species have favored the emergence of this pathogen and its outbreaks. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to establish international protocols to avoid pathogen propagation to new sites. In this review, we integrated and discussed state of the art information about the environmental traits and microbial factors that induce forest decline and subsequent tree mortality. Further research directions in the field of Phytophthora - plant interactions with special emphasis on the biochemical and molecular signals involved in pathogen virulence and host defense are suggested. Finally, strategies for disease prevention in forest management and conservation are discussed.

Since the dense population in Xiamen Bay, Fujian, China, it is highly valuable in understanding coastal flooding of it, but little studies involved this topic. In this study, we establish a high-resolution numerical model covering all coastal low-lying land in Xiamen Bay based on FVCOM. This model is then used to assess the flood risk in Xiamen Bay under TCs with 10-, 100-, and 1000-year pressures by applying a multi-tracks blend method. The results show that 126 km(2) of low-lying area can be flooded periodically by astronomical tides; and 388, 504, and 598 km(2) of low-lying area can be flooded under TCs with 10-, 100-, and 1000-year pressures, accompanied by increased average flood depths of 2.3, 2.8, and 3.4 m, respectively. By 2100 under SSP5-8.5, the well-protected Xiamen Island becomes impacted by TCs with 10-year pressure, and flood areas under TCs with 100-year pressure are estimated to be nearly equivalent to that under TCs with 1000-year pressure at the current climate. The most increased exposure area by climate change are artificial surfaces and agricultural areas, showing the potential higher flood disasters in future.

To investigate the effectiveness of the intelligent scheduling strategy in mitigating urban flooding, a new intelligent scheduling model (ISM) that couples the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for a simulation-optimization framework. The objectives of the ISM are to minimize the flooding volume, front-pool water level fluctuation, and operational cost. Synthetic rainfall events with different durations and return periods based on the Gumbel distribution and observed rainfall events are utilized to comprehensively assess the designed model's performance in the Dealim3 catchment, South Korea. The selected ISM-based scheduling strategies are assessed in accordance with climate change mitigation (i.e., reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and local adaptation strategies (i.e., improving drainage systems). The results indicate that these strategies generated by ISM lead to reductions in flooding, water level fluctuation, and operational costs. The maximum daily rainfall with a 100-year return period increased by 2.1% and 6.8% during 2025-2064 under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, compared with the historical period (1975-2014), thereby increasing the magnitude of urban flooding. The ISM may also significantly lower the flooding process at specific nodes. The ISM-based strategy outperforms climate change mitigation and other adaptation strategies. This study shows that the ISM-based strategy are very useful to deal with the impact of climate change on urban flooding.

The riverine sediment supply to the beaches of the Emilia-Romagna coast, a highly urbanized area with high economic and naturalistic value, has been heavily impacted by human activities throughout the catchment, reducing solid transport to the coast and increasing the threat of coastal erosion and flooding. Despite the introduction of safeguard policies in the early 1980s and the consequent stoppage of such activities, the expected return in solid transport has not yet been reflected at the coast. To better understand the various processes acting at the river basin scale, we utilized empirical mode decomposition to analyze the variability in different parameters (river discharge, rainfall, air temperature, and sea level) from the headwaters to the coast of the Reno and Lamone rivers over the last century. The anthropogenic footprint, linked to the large-scale dimming/brightening phenomenon, is visible in the long-term trends. Moreover, natural signals with variable periodicity are evident and partially correlated with two major climate modes (North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation). The coupled interactions among these processes, combined with the changes in land use and evapotranspiration during the last century, have resulted in the prolonged scarcity of river sediment supply and a long-term trend of erosion of the coastal area.

Thermogenic carbon of crustal sediments induced by intrusive magmatism throughout the LIPs is considered as the primary trigger for environmental catastrophe including mass extinction, as illustrated in the case of the Emeishan LIP in Southwest China. Here we evaluate the Emeishan LIP to address the causal link between carbon degassing and environmental crises during the end-Guadalupian of Middle Permian. An assessment of the carbon flux degassed from recycled oceanic crust in the Emeishan plume shows that recycled oceanic crust contributed significantly to the carbon flux. Using evidence from carbonate carbon isotopic records at the Gualupian-Lopingian (G-L) boundary stratotype at Penglaitan of South China, our study suggests that carbon degassed from massive recycled components in the Emeishan plume served as a major end-Guadalupian (Middle Permian) carbon isotope excursion. The model based on the Emeishan LIP also offers new insights into the important role of recycled carbon released from other LIPs in climatic change and mass extinctions, as in the cases of the end-Permian Siberian and end-Cretaceous Deccan Traps. Our work highlights that carbon released from subducted slabs is returned to the atmosphere via upwelling mantle plumes, which could drive global climatic change and mass extinction.

The ensemble stream-flow scenarios were simulated by the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) driven by (1) 1981-2012 Daymet meteorological observations and (2) 11 sets of downscaled global climate models (GCMs) during the 1966-2005 historical and 2011-2050 future periods. Surface inundation was simulated using a GPU-accelerated Two-dimensional Runoff Inundation Toolkit for Operational Needs (TRITON) hydrodynamic model. A total of 9 out of the 11 GCMs exhibit an increase in the mean ensemble flood inundation areas. Moreover, at the 1% annual exceedance probability level, the flood inundation frequency curves indicate a similar to 16 km(2) increase in floodplain area. The assessment also shows that even after flood-proofing, four of the substations could still be affected in the projected future period. The increase in floodplain area and substation vulnerability highlights the need to account for climate change in floodplain management. Overall, this study provides a proof-of-concept demonstration of how the computationally intensive hydrodynamic inundation modeling can be used to enhance flood frequency maps and vulnerability assessment under the changing climatic conditions.

However, SDMs are urgently needed for adapting forest management to climate change, as well as for conservation and restoration of riparian forest ecosystems. For such an operative use, standard large-scale bioclimatic models alone are too coarse and frequently exclude relevant predictors. In this study, we compare a bioclimatic continent-wide model and a regional model based on climate, soil, and river data for central to south-eastern Europe, targeting seven riparian foundation species-Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus angustifolia, F. excelsior, Populus nigra, Quercus robur, Ulmus laevis, and U. minor. The results emphasize the high importance of precise occurrence data and environmental predictors. Soil predictors were more important than bioclimatic variables, and river variables were partly of the same importance. In both models, five of the seven species were found to decrease in terms of future occurrence probability within the study area, whereas the results for two species were ambiguous. Nevertheless, both models predicted a dangerous loss of occurrence probability for economically and ecologically important tree species, likely leading to significant effects on forest composition and structure, as well as on provided ecosystem services.

J	Verlynde, N				Verlynde, Nicolas			Adaptation of low-lying coastal areas to the growing risk of flooding: risk perception survey in the Dunkirk urban community	HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU			French	Article						climate change; risk; perception; flood; adaptation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXPERIENCE; IMPACTS	The consequences of climate change threaten life on Earth. They will accentuate various risks for human societies, including the flood risk, which will be particularly amplified in low-lying coastal areas. It is fundamental to think about the adaptation strategies of these territories in order to reduce the vulnerability of populations to this risk. Flood risk perception studies provide a valuable contribution to the development of management policies in line with these issues. This article deals with a study of this type within the "communaute urbaine de Dunkerque". In the framework of a thesis, a large risk perception survey was conducted during the year 2016 in this densely populated low-lying coastal area historically affected by flooding. The survey was conducted according to a methodology at the crossroads of several disciplines: geography, sociology, psychosociology, economics and planning. The results highlight, among the population: (1) a dissonant perception of the flood risk and a low concern about it; (2) spatial representations of the risk very different from official representations; (3) the influence of the perception of the risk on the willingness to pay to protect oneself against it. In addition to providing theoretical and operational input for the cindynic sciences, the analysis carried out makes it possible to propose four adaptation levers to reduce the vulnerability of the inhabitants to flooding. These levers concern the awareness of the inhabitants, the modes of communication, the participation of individuals and the development of bonds of trust with the public authorities.

These contributions are projected to shift with climate change, particularly in the Japanese Alps where snow is expected to decrease, but rainfall events increase. The overarching aim of the study was to understand the key variables driving macroinvertebrate community composition in groundwater and snowmelt-fed streams (n = 6) in the Kamikochi region of the northern Japanese Alps (April-December 2017). Macroinvertebrate abundance, species richness, and diversity were not significantly different between the two stream types. Community structure, however, was different between groundwater and snowmelt-fed streams with macroinvertebrate taxa specialized for the environmental conditions present in each system. Temporal variation in the abundance, species richness, and diversity of macroinvertebrate communities was also significantly different between groundwater and snowmelt streams over the study period, with snowmelt streams exhibiting far higher levels of variation. Two snowmelt streams considered perennial proved to be intermittent with periodic drying of the streambed, but the macroinvertebrates in these systems rebounded rapidly after flows resumed with no reduction in taxonomic diversity. These same streams, nevertheless, showed a major reduction in diversity and abundance following periods of high flow, indicating floods rather than periodic drying was a major driver of community structure. This conclusion was also supported from functional analyses, which showed that the more variable snowmelt streams were characterized by taxa with resistant, rather than resilient, life-history traits. The findings demonstrate the potential for significant turnover in species composition with changing environmental conditions in Japanese alpine stream systems, with groundwater-fed streams potentially more resilient to future changes in comparison to snowmelt-fed streams.

Psychological and experiential factors affecting climate change perception: learnings from a transnational empirical study and implications for framing climate-related flood events	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						climate change; communications; environmental psychology; trust; skepticism; framing; emotion; youth	SCIENCE; RISK; ENGAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; POLITICS	Understanding the underlying values, beliefs and emotions that influence the public's perceptions and opinions on climate change (CC) is increasingly important, as CC is a complex and politicized phenomenon. Additionally, optimizing messaging for communicating CC and encouraging greater mitigation behavior can yield significant benefits to global stakeholders. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of informative, persuasive and empathic message frames about a major climate-related local flooding event through online surveys administered to 370 adults in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada and 360 adults in Queensland, Australia. Measures of trust in climate communicators and climate science, concern over CC effects, and belief that most recent floods are due to CC were assessed before and after message exposure, along with related values, beliefs and emotions. Willingness to support pro-environmental groups was assessed as a proxy measure of behavioural intent. Cumulative odds ordinal regression and multinomial regression were used to predict group membership (no support, passive support, active support). Political affiliation, trust and belief in CC, belief in anthropogenic CC, pro-environmental values, and, in some regressions, previous flood exposure, were significant predictors of activism support. Respondents who received the empathic message frame and had low to medium pro-environmental values were more likely to believe the link between flooding and CC compared to those who received the informative message frame. These results, including the finding that some elicited emotions predicted behavioral intent, provide insight into how to construct climate information for groups with varying beliefs, values and experiences, to reduce climate skepticism and encourage pro-environmental behavior.

The target region is the Chungju Basin in Korea, which is characterized by complex geographical features. The analysis focuses on runoff simulations driven by raw outputs and bias-corrected outputs from the HadGEM2-AO and RegCM4, which are used to generate national standard climate change scenarios throughout the Korean Peninsula. Statistical methods, such as linear scaling and quantile mapping, improve the performance in precipitation simulations and effectively correct the systematic biases seen with the climatological means of the HadGEM2-AO and RegCM4. Although there is no relevant difference between the bias-corrected HadGEM2-AO and RegCM4 in terms of long-term averaged climatology, the bias-corrected RegCM4 performs better in capturing the dominant mode of runoff variability and hydrological extremes (e.g., floods measured by 1-day maximum runoff and droughts measured by the standardized runoff index). Because the magnitude of the bias correction factor tends to influence the preservation of future change signals derived from raw and bias-corrected outputs, the HadGEM2-AO, which requires a large bias correction factor to compensate for poor performance, produces future changes in high flows with low coherence between the raw and bias-corrected projections.

The signature literary expression of this historic climate crisis occurred in Switzerland, where teenage Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein in the midst of the disastrous "Year without a Summer," 1816, a season of floods and food riots caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora thousands of miles away. This essay, combining climate science with historical and literary sources, reexamines the literary legend of that direful, stormy summer, which Mary Shelley spent on the shores of Lake Geneva with the poets Percy Shelley and Lord Byron, with a new and original emphasis on its climatic context. The writers huddled indoors and wrote ghost stories, while the cataclysmic weather and humanitarian emergency unfolding around them weaved its way into Mary Shelley's imagining of a tragic monster brought to life.

Due to the limitations of traditional structural engineering measurements, vulnerability measurement has become critical in disaster mitigation according to the IPCC and UNISDR. Currently, flood vulnerability studies focus on evaluating the present state of flood vulnerability at various spatial scales. Different levels of development progress and varying environmental factors result in variations in disaster capacity in urban and rural areas. Therefore, this study explores the temporal and spatial variations of vulnerability in urban and rural built environments by using spatial autocorrelation analysis and principal component analysis. Bivariate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) results show that particular areas maintain high or low vulnerability in both examined years: 2008 and 2018. The critical differences between HH and LL might be caused by different urban development statuses and insufficient emergency or recovery facilities.

For a reliable estimation of uncertainty, an appropriate stochastic weather generator is embedded into a Monte Carlo cycle capable of generating any large number of independent, equally probable, 100-year-long daily sequences of synthetic data with which a hydrological model is driven in order to obtain the hydrological responses to the meteorological data sequences. According to our results, a decrease of daily average runoff is likely to occur in the future in the Upper Tisza basin, especially in July and August. The occurrence of water levels below the critical low level is estimated to increase between July and October. Level-3 flood warnings are projected to be less frequent in the future; however, they will tend to be more severe than in the historical period.

Using temperature and precipitation data, this paper examines the differential effects climate change has on different land uses in the Luvuvhu river catchment in South Africa. The paper uses the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which were calculated from Landsat images, and the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) for a sample of years between 1980 and 2016 to assess how drought and flood frequency have affected the agricultural environment. The results indicate that the lowest SPI values were recorded in 1996/1997, 2001/2002 and 2014/2015, suggesting the occurrence of drought during these years, while the highest SPI values were recorded in 1997/1998, 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. The relationship between three-month SPI (SPI_3) and VCI was strongest in grassland, and subsistence farming areas with the correlation coefficients of 0.8166 (p = 0.0022) and -0.6172 (p = 0.0431), respectively, indicating that rainfall variability had a high negative impact on vegetation health in those land uses with shallow-rooted plants. The findings of this study are relevant to disaster management planning in South Africa, as well as development of farming response strategies for coping with climate hazards in the country.

The efficacy of riparian tree cover as a climate change adaptation tool is affected by hydromorphological alterations	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						channelization; climate change proofing; cold-water species; hydromorphology; riparian buffers; stream temperature management	WATER TEMPERATURE; STREAM TEMPERATURE; RIVER TEMPERATURE; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; HYPORHEIC EXCHANGE; THERMAL REGIMES; DAM OPERATIONS; HUMAN IMPACTS; SALMON; FLOW	Riparian tree cover has been widely proposed as a key climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy for stream temperature management. Riparian tree cover moderates stream temperature by intercepting solar radiation, a significant heat source in affected systems. However, many aspects of hydromorphological state can shape the realised temperature regime of a river and these elements may interact with riparian tree cover. This study investigated the thermal buffering effect of tree cover on rivers with varying degrees of hydromorphological alteration for example, modified channel morphology, substrate and floodplain connectivity. Results indicated that the effectiveness of tree cover as a stream temperature management tool can change across systems depending on the extent of hydromorphological alteration. Greater tree cover had a pronounced cooling effect on stream temperature in altered study sites, but temperatures were typically still lower in more natural (less disturbed) sites, irrespective of the extent of tree cover. This finding suggests a hydromorphological threshold at which the effectiveness of riparian tree cover as a temperature management tool diminishes. Climate proofing in some rivers may thus require provision of both riparian tree cover and functioning hydromorphological processes to replicate more natural stream temperature dynamics. This perspective also suggests that more pristine rivers will retain greater resistance to projected temperature disturbance associated with a warming climate because of their inherent thermal buffering capacity.

One main concern for the next century is a potential water scarcity triggered by a severe and persistent rainfall shortage. This is one of the climate-driven impacts studied within the EU funded project RESCCUE. To evaluate potential drought scenarios, the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) hydrological model reproduces the water contributions by month that have reached the reservoirs, regarding the accumulated rainfall over each sub-basin, representing the available historical-observed water levels. For future scenarios, we adjusted the input data set using climate projections of rainfall time series data of the project RESCCUE. Local outputs from 9 different climate models were applied to simulate river basins' responses to reservoirs' incoming water volume. Analyzing these results, we obtained average trends of the models for each scenario, hypothetical extreme values, and quantification for changes in water availability. Future water availability scenarios for Barcelona central water sources showed a mean decrease close to 11% in comparison with the period 1971-2015, considering the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) climate change scenario in the year 2100. This research forecasts a slight downward trend in water availability from rainfall contributions from the mid-21st century. This planned future behavior does not mean that the annual water contributions are getting lower than the current ones, but rather, identifies an escalation in the frequency of drought cycles.

Coastal Vulnerability Assessment: A Case Study of the Nigerian Coastline	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; global warming; coastal hazards; sea-level rise (SLR); coastal vulnerability index (CVI)	SEA-LEVEL-RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SHORELINE; IMPACTS; INSIGHT; TRENDS; INDIA	Coastal regions are one of the essential spots on the earth as they are hosts to various important ecosystems, natural resources and the increasing population. Based on their proximity to the seas, they are mainly affected by sea-level rise, which is one of the adverse effects of climate change. This has resulted in associated hazards, such as beach erosion, flooding, coastal inundation, habitat destruction, saltwater intrusion into ground water aquifers and ecosystem imbalance. This study quantifies and classifies the vulnerability of the Nigerian coastline to these threats using the analytical hierarchical approach. This involved calculating the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) employing physical and geomorphological variables, and socioeconomic indicators that characterized the coastline vulnerability. The Nigerian coast was divided into seventeen (17) segments based on geomorphic units. The different vulnerability variables were assigned ranks ranging from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest and 1 indicating the lowest vulnerabilities. The geomorphological and physical parameters include coastal slope, bathymetry, geomorphology, wave height, mean tidal range, shoreline change rate and relative sea-level rise, while the socioeconomic parameters include population, cultural heritage, land use/land cover and road network. The calculated CVI values (Saaty method) ranged from 11.25 to 41.66 with a median value of 23.60. Based on Gornitz approach, the calculated measures ranged between 3.51-4.77 and 3.08-5.00 for PVI and SoVI, respectively. However, the aggregated coastal vulnerability index computed using this approach ranged from 3.29 to 4.70. The results obtained from both approaches showed that 59-65% of the entire Nigerian coastline is under moderate to high vulnerability to sea-level rise. Data indicted how the coastal populations are highly vulnerable to both physical-geomorphological and socioeconomic stressors. Coastal vulnerability maps, highlighting the physical-geomorphological and socioeconomic vulnerability status of Nigerian coastline were also generated. The information from this study will assist coastal planners in identifying vulnerable segments in the study area and subsequently aid decisions that would mitigate the predicted impacts in the region.

Projection of 21st century irrigation water requirement across the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Aquifer decline; Agricultural water management; Climate change; Water conservation; Groundwater withdrawal	GULF-OF-MEXICO; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; CROP MANAGEMENT; WINTER-WHEAT; ELEVATED CO2; LAND-USE; IMPACTS; CHINA; AGRICULTURE	Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV) is the largest floodplain and one of the most productive agricultural regions in the United States. Irrigation is widely used in this region to improve crop production and resource use efficiency due to a mismatch between crop water requirements and precipitation timing and quantity during the growing season. In the recent decades, aquifer decline caused by groundwater withdrawals for irrigation has been recognized as a critical environmental issue threatening water security and agricultural sustainability in the LMAV. To improve agricultural water use efficiency and reduce groundwater withdrawals, it is pivotal to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of crop irrigation water requirements (IWR). In this study, we analyzed future climate changes over the LMAV cropland areas and estimated future IWR changes for major crops in the 21st century using two climate scenarios (i.e. RCP45 and RCP85) and two crop growth duration length (GDL) scenarios [i.e. Fixed GDL (GDL does not change with time) and Varied GDL (GDL changes with time)]. Results show that croplands in the LMAV would experience continuous warming, and either no significant change or a decreasing level of precipitation under the RCP45 and the RCP85. If keeping current cropland areas and cropping systems unchanged, average crop IWR by the end of the 21st century would increase by 4.2% under the RCP45 + Varied GDL scenario, 14.5% under the RCP45 + Fixed GDL scenario, 9.2% under the RCP85 + Varied GDL scenario, and 29.4% under the RCP85 + Fixed GDL scenario. The greatest increases would occur in the summer months. Aquifer levels in the LMAV, therefore, are expected to decline at an accelerated pace if no effective mitigation strategies are implemented. This study made the first attempt to reveal the spatially-explicit crop IWR and its future changes in the LMAV, which provides a scientific basis for developing management strategies that can enhance water use efficiency and improve agriculture sustainability.

The relative contributions of plant dispersal and ecosystem development, the main drivers that control the rate of primary succession, remain largely unknown, in spite of their central roles in community organization in general. Understanding the contribution of dispersal is especially critical because it casts light on our ability to manage succession resulting from climate change or anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we review the literature in order to understand when and where dispersal limits primary succession. Studies from many systems (tropical, temperate, boreal, arctic, alpine, floodplain forest, desert, mines, volcanic eruption and glacier forelands) show that dispersal limitation occurs consistently in the early stages of primary succession, suggesting that this is a general pattern. On the other hand, we found strong biases in study sites towards the Northern Hemisphere, temperate regions, volcanic eruptions and glacier forelands, which suggests that there are risks in drawing general conclusions about the importance of dispersal for primary succession for other biomes. Little is known about the contribution of dispersal to the later stages of primary succession. We present a recently developed method, multiscale chronosequence comparison that compares rates of succession in similar systems at relatively small and large spatial scales. Rapid succession at small scales compared to large scales suggests that seed dispersal influences succession over time periods of centuries and also limits the development of ecosystem functions such as vegetation cover and soil carbon accumulation. Synthesis: Dispersal limitation likely matters not only in the early stages but also in the late stages of primary succession by controlling the rate at which new species arrive. Both the accumulation of comparable case studies and novel approaches, such as multiscale chronosequence comparisons and factorial experiments, in contrasting biomes, are necessary to clarify the generality or context dependency of the role of dispersal in future primary successions undergoing changing climate.

Linking climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction: reconceptualizing flood risk governance in Mumbai	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Disaster risk reduction; climate change adaptation; flood risk governance; emergent groups; mumbai; local governance	LAND COVER CHANGE; EMERGENT GROUPS; RIVER-BASIN; VULNERABILITY; POLITICS; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; HAZARD; URBANIZATION	Climate-related hazards, urban development and changing vulnerability patterns compel cities across the world to deal with new and emerging forms of risk. Academic literature and recent international policy documents suggest potentials of conceptually and practically linking the fields of climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emphasize the need to mitigate climate-related risks at local level. However, there is limited knowledge on how this link is established at local levels and the role of ground-level actors and practices therein. Using the case of recurrent and disastrous floods, this paper discusses the significance of linking DRR and CCA in Mumbai. It analyses policies, plans, institutions and interventions related to DRR and CCA and uses interviews and a field study to assess flood risk governance at the level of municipal wards and neighbourhoods. The findings suggest that although flood risk governance has been significantly strengthened, three gaps exist: First, a lack of a comprehensive plan for Mumbai that anticipates future risks and vulnerabilities and integrates CCA and DRR down to local level. Second, a lack of an overarching and decentralized institutional framework across sectors and scales that recognizes the multiplicity of formal and informal actors. Third, the potential of civil society and informal actors for disaster risk management and adaptation planning has not been tapped into sufficiently. The paper argues that potential exists to reconceptualize flood risk governance in Mumbai by focusing on future risks and vulnerabilities and by recognizing the work of informal actors like emergent groups at local level.

However, these multiple, and often conflicting, objectives introduce complexity in managing dam operations. In addition, dam infrastructure has been evolving as complex systems-of-systems with multiple interacting components and subsystems, all susceptible to a wide range of uncertainties. Such complexities and uncertainties have triggered extensive research initiatives focused on dam systems and reservoir operational safety. Focusing on the latter, this paper meta-researches (conducts research-on-research) previously published studies to identify the critical research gaps and propose future research directions. In this respect, this paper first performs a quantitative analysis of the pertinent literature, using text mining and subsequent topic modeling, to identify and classify major and uncover latent topics in the field. Subsequently, qualitative analysis is conducted to critically review the identified topics, exploring the concepts, definitions, modeling tools, and major research trends. Specifically, the study identified seven topics: optimization models; climate change; flood risk; inflow forecasting; hydropower generation; water supply management; and risk-based assessment and management. The study also presents three main research gaps associated with the limitations in modeling concepts, modeling tools capabilities, and the lack of resilience-guided management of dam operational safety. Overall, this study presents a road map of the currently available dam and reservoir operational safety research and associated knowledge gaps, as well as potential future research directions to ensure the resilience of such critically important infrastructure, especially in the age of climate change.

Current knowledge regarding SLR and estuarine hydrodynamics is primarily focused on individual case studies, which provides limited guidance on how different estuary typologies will respond to SLR. To expand the current knowledge, this research used an idealised hydrodynamic approach to analyse the tidal range dynamics of 25 real-world estuaries with diverse shapes and boundary conditions, providing insights into estuarine response to SLR-induced tidal variations. Under present-day conditions, short length estuaries with wide entrances, deep waters, strong convergence, macro-tidal conditions, low values of roughness, and low upland river inflows are likely to experience amplified tidal range patterns; whereas lengthy estuaries with narrow entrances, shallow water depths, micro/meso-tidal conditions, high values of roughness, and high upland river inflows often exhibit a mix of dampened-amplified or fully dampened tidal range patterns. Under the effects of SLR, estuarine tidal range dynamics change depending on their present-day tidal range patterns. Where the present-day tidal range pattern is either dampening, a mix of dampening/amplification, or amplification, SLR increases (up to 61 %), moderately increases (up to 26 %), and slightly decreases/increases (up to 5 %) the tidal range of estuaries, respectively. Considering the relationship between an estuary's present-day tidal range pattern and its response to SLR, the presented approach may be useful in providing an initial assessment of SLR effects in estuaries worldwide. This approach may also help to identify sites most impacted by future SLR, and to direct decision-making towards evidence-based management approaches.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance of five CMIP5 GCMs (CanESM2, BNU-ESM, CNRM-CM5, MPI-ESM-LR and MPI-ESM-MR) on a regional scale in the West Flowing River Basins-2 (WFRB-2) in India to model the impact of CC and its scenario uncertainty using reliability ensemble average (REA) method. For quantifying the results, the upper, middle and lower regions of WFRB-2 are separately analysed. The MPIMR and MPILR GCM model shows highest reliability factor range (0.3-0.6) in predicting the annual mean and annual maximum rainfall for most of the grids in the region. The GCM-simulated runoff using VIC (variable infiltration capacity) model is evaluated using statistical parameters such as root mean square error (RMSE), percentage bias (Pbias) and standard deviation (Std). The annual mean (maximum) runoff obtained using REA ensemble shows least RMSE, Pbias and Std values, i.e. 21.08%, 9.10 mm and 8.9 mm (6%, 39.1 mm, 39.1 mm), respectively for the middle region, which demonstrates higher reliability of GCM outputs in the flood-prone regions of WFRB-2. Furthermore, the future projection of annual maximum rainfall/runoff shows an increase of 50 mm/15 mm in the near future (2011-2040) for lower and 20 mm/6 mm for middle regions, which may cause flooding activities in the lower and middle region of WFRB-2.

Building flood-resilient cities by promoting SUDS adoption: A multi-sector analysis of barriers and benefits in Bogot?, Colombia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Climate change; Flood resilience; Inductive-deductive approach; Interdisciplinary approach; Sustainable urban water management; Thematic analysis	URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE SYSTEM; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; POLICY	In light of rapid urbanization and climate change, managing urban flood risk by combining tradi-tional pipe-bound infrastructure with sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) has recently gained significant attention. SUDS provide a wide range of social, economic, and environmental advantages; nonetheless, there are perceptions, barriers, and benefits whose understanding is lacking, especially in the context of developing countries. To fill these gaps, a case study was con-ducted in the city of Bogota, Colombia's capital city, systematically investigating the visions of four key actors, i.e., the public sector, urban developers, a private non-profit organization, and community members of a flood-prone area. Thematic analysis supported by an induc-tive-deductive coding approach was employed to analyze data collected from in-depth semi -structured interviews and questionnaires. After identifying and categorizing 39 barriers in Bo-gota, technical and institutional/organizational barriers such as "operation and maintenance" and "unclear institutional responsibilities" prevailed over financial ones. The assessment of bene-fits yielded a total of 34 results and demonstrated the wide scope of SUDS strategies, ranging from "use of harvested water in secondary uses" to "promotion of environmental awareness" and "corporate image enhancement." Furthermore, there are direct relationships between barriers, benefits, and actors, strengthened by particular objectives, motivations, and needs. The findings of this study highlight the significance of interdisciplinary approaches to achieve comprehensive sustainable urban water planning and improved flood risk management. Further work on benefits quantification and participatory spatial-hydraulic modeling could foster SUDS interest, broaden-ing the debate beyond the technical realm.	[Ortega, A.

Yet, few studies have specifically analyzed the risk of hot and dry climate change-induced hazards, such as extreme heat and wildfires, on households living in manufactured housing. In this study, we first use national American Housing Survey data to provide background context on the adaptive capacity to these hazards among manufactured home occupants nationally. We then focus our primary analysis on California, where the prevalence of such hazards is growing substantially due to climate change. We compile a unique, census tract-level data set of occupied housing unit characteristics by tenure status, along with extreme heat and wildfire hazard measures. We also incorporate address-level locations of mobile home parks in the state. We use descriptive statistics, t-tests, and bivariate correlations to compare the exposure for households in manufactured housing with renter and owner households residing in other housing structure types. We find that households in manufactured housing face consistently higher exposure to heat and fire hazards across all exposure measures. Census tracts with higher proportions of households in manufactured housing are much more likely to be located in areas with greater historical and projected extreme heat hazards than households living in other lower-cost housing types or households in general. Households in manufactured housing are also the most likely of all housing types to be located in tracts affected by past wildfires and in tracts with high future wildfire risk. We conclude by providing recommendations for future research and policy consideration. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Given the high degree of intraspecific trait variability in plants, it has been hypothesized that genetic shifts within plant species yield a large potential to control the response of plant-microbe interactions to climate change. Here we examined if sea-level rise and plant genotype interact to affect soil microbial communities in an experimental coastal wetland system, using two known genotypes of the dominant salt-marsh grass Elymus athericus characterized by differences in their sensitivity to flooding stress - i.e., a tolerant genotype from low-marsh environments and an intolerant genotype from high-marsh environments. Plants were exposed to a large range of flooding frequencies in a factorial mesocosm experiment, and soil microbial activity parameters (exo-enzyme activity and litter breakdown) and microbial community structure were assessed. Plant genotype mediated the effect of flooding on soil microbial community structure and determined the presence of flooding effects on exo-enzyme activities and belowground litter breakdown. Larger variability in microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and litter breakdown in soils planted with the intolerant plant genotype supported our general hypothesis that effects of climate change on soil microbial activity and community structure can depend on plant intraspecific genetic variation. In conclusion, our data suggest that adaptive genetic variation in plants could suppress or facilitate the effects of sea-level rise on soil microbial communities. If this finding applies more generally to coastal wetlands, it yields important implications for our understanding of ecosystem-climate feedbacks in the coastal zone.

Ice Cover and Extreme Events Determine Dissolved Oxygen in a Placid Mountain Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						LTER; mountain lakes; high-frequency data; ice-in; mixing; trend analysis	LONG-TERM CHANGES; SURFACE-WATER TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESIDENCE TIME; TREND ANALYSIS; FRESH-WATER; SNOW DEPTH; STRATIFICATION; PHENOLOGY; VARIABILITY	A decrease in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) is a commonly seen effect of climate change. However, in oligotrophic Lake Tovel (Italy), a deep mountain lake, annual mean DO (% saturation) has increased from near anoxia to >20% in the bottom layer (35-39 m). We analyzed long-term patterns of DO (1937-2019) using different methods (correlation and trend analysis, identification of extreme events) to link DO to drivers and indices of mixing. While spring mixing remained temporally limited, later ice-in (5.1 days decade(-1)) and the positive relationship between ice-in and DO the following year evidenced autumn mixing as the main driver for hypolimnetic DO increase. Extreme meteorological events also replenished hypolimnetic DO. Using DO and conductivity (1995-2019), we identified 14 deep mixing events with hypolimnetic DO > 40%. Density-based indices (Schmidt stability, relative thermal resistance, Lake Number, and Wedderburn Number) only partially captured these events that were related to snowmelt, flooding, and cold spells during spring and autumn, with a carryover effect sometimes lasting >1 year. Recently, annual mean DO in the upper layer decreased beyond temperature-dependent solubility. This decrease was not comprehensively confirmed by statistical tests but was possibly linked to atmospheric stilling. We suggest that Lake Tovel's shift from meromixis to dimixis was driven by climate warming (i.e., increasing air temperature 0.6 degrees C decade(-1)) that delayed ice-in and increased autumn mixing. Our work underlines the vulnerability of mountain lakes and their different response to climate change with respect to more studied lowland lakes.

Co-designed Land-use Scenarios and their Implications for Storm Runoff and Streamflow in New England	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Land-use change; Ecosystem services; Storm runoff; Streamflow; Landscape scenarios; New England	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL EVALUATION; WATER YIELD; HYDROLOGY; FORESTS; IMPACT; COVER; TOPOGRAPHY; CATCHMENT; DURATION	Landscape and climate changes have the potential to create or exacerbate problems with stormwater management, high flows, and flooding. In New England, four plausible land-use scenarios were co-developed with stakeholders to give insight to the effects on ecosystem services of different trajectories of socio-economic connectedness and natural resource innovation. With respect to water, the service of greatest interest to New England stakeholders is the reduction of stormwater and flooding. To assess the effects of these land-use scenarios, we applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to two watersheds under two climates. Differences in land use had minimal effects on the water balance but did affect high flows and the contribution of storm runoff to streamflow. For most scenarios, the effect on high flows was small. For one scenario-envisioned to have global socio-economic connectedness and low levels of natural resource innovation-growth in impervious areas increased the annual maximum daily flow by 10%, similar to the 5-15% increase attributable to climate change. Under modest population growth, land-use decisions have little effect on storm runoff and high flows; however, for the two scenarios characterized by global socio-economic connectedness, differences in choices regarding land use and impervious area have a large impact on the potential for flooding. Results also indicate a potential interaction between climate and land use with a shift to more high flows resulting from heavy rains than from snowmelt. These results can help inform land use and development, especially when combined with assessments of effects on other ecosystem services.

Shifting Hydrological Processes in a Canadian Agroforested Catchment due to a Warmer and Wetter Climate	WATER			English	Article						cold regions hydrology; climate change; hydrological modelling; snowpack; snowmelt; river discharge; spring floods; agroforested catchment; Acadie River Catchment	CHANGE IMPACTS; SOUTHERN QUEBEC; REGIONAL CLIMATE; SNOWMELT RUNOFF; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; PERTURBED CLIMATE; CHANGING CLIMATE; HEADWATER BASIN	This study examines the hydrological sensitivity of an agroforested catchment to changes in temperature and precipitation. A physically based hydrological model was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to simulate the hydrological processes over 23 years in the Acadie River Catchment in southern Quebec. The observed air temperature and precipitation were perturbed linearly based on existing climate change projections, with warming of up to 8 degrees C and an increase in total precipitation up to 20%. The results show that warming causes a decrease in blowing snow transport and sublimation losses from blowing snow, canopy-intercepted snowfall and the snowpack. Decreasing blowing snow transport leads to reduced spatial variability in peak snow water equivalent (SWE) and a more synchronized snow cover depletion across the catchment. A 20% increase in precipitation is not sufficient to counteract the decline in annual peak SWE caused by a 1 degrees C warming. On the other hand, peak spring streamflow increases by 7% and occurs 20 days earlier with a 1 degrees C warming and a 20% increase in precipitation. However, when warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the catchment becomes more rainfall dominated and the peak flow and its timing follows the rainfall rather than snowmelt regime. Results from this study can be used for sustainable farming development and planning in regions with hydroclimatic characteristics similar to the Acadie River Catchment, where climate change may have a significant impact on the dominating hydrological processes.

Historical soil drainage mediates the response of soil greenhouse gas emissions to intense precipitation events	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Denitrification; Drainage; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide; Redox; Soil oxygen	NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; INORGANIC NITROGEN; IRON REDUCTION; REDOX FLUCTUATIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; IN-SITU; FOREST; DENITRIFICATION	Precipitation events are increasing in intensity in the Midwestern US due to climate change. This is resulting in flooding of poorly-drained upland soils, which can feed back on climate change by altering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The objective of this study was to determine if soil drainage history affects the response of soil GHG emissions to rain events. To do this, we measured N2O and CO2 fluxes from poorly-drained (PD) and well-drained (WD) soils in an agricultural field in Urbana, Illinois before and after large rain events. We also performed a lab experiment to separate effects of soil drainage history from contemporary effects of ponding. Finally, we utilized stable isotope techniques to measure gross N2O dynamics and to determine the contributions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers to net N2O fluxes. We found that ponding of WD soils led to pulses of net N2O efflux caused by stimulation of gross N2O production by denitrifiers. In contrast, PD soils had high net N2O effluxes only between large rain events, and gross N2O production was inhibited following ponding. Soil CO2 efflux was greater from PD soils under lab conditions, but autotrophic respiration obscured this trend in the field. Soil GHG emissions were a result of different contemporary ponding status as well as historical soil drainage, suggesting that historical soil redox regimes regulate soil GHG dynamics in response to precipitation. These soil drainage legacy effects are likely important in predicting soil GHG feedback effects on climate change.

Informed decisions regarding flood events induces propensity for insurances	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Insurance; Risk aversion; Climatic change; Financial decisions; Ignorance	RISK; DEMAND; PERCEPTION; WILLINGNESS; PREFERENCES; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; HOMEOWNERS; PSYCHOLOGY; MITIGATION	Approaching climate changes are expected to cause an increase in the frequency of very severe events (see, e.g., Global Risk Report, 2017, Czajkowski et al., 2013, Botzen et al., 2009), such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods that affect the well-being of millions of people all over the world. Therefore, interest has grown in risk management associated with climatic events from the perspective of the financial services consumer and from the actors that provide protection - the insurance companies. We conduct a survey of over 1000 lower middle-class heads of household in a country with an emerging economy (Brazil), including people living in high risk areas, to verify the intuition that there is a causal link between the existence of information and the willingness of individuals to acquire flood insurance. The results of the experiment reveal that supplying information regarding the probability and severity of flood events increases the demand for protective services. Furthermore, living in a high-risk flood area encourages the acceptance of higher insurance premiums. We also document a set of attitudes of the surveyed subjects towards flood risk, according to the region in which they reside and the availability of information about flood risk.

J	Qi, M; Huang, HB; Liu, L; Chen, X				Qi, Man; Huang, Huabing; Liu, Lin; Chen, Xi			An Integrated Approach for Urban Pluvial Flood Risk Assessment at Catchment Level	WATER			English	Article						urban pluvial flooding; flood exposure; social vulnerability; topographic control index	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; COASTAL COMMUNITIES; THO CITY; MANAGEMENT; URBANIZATION; MITIGATION; HAZARD	With the rapid development of urbanization and global climate change, urban pluvial floods have occurred more frequently in urban areas. Despite of the increasing urban pluvial flood risk, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of the physical and social influencing factors on the process. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper proposes a novel approach to calculate the comprehensive urban pluvial flooding risk index (PFRI) and investigates the interplay impacts from different components at catchment level. To be more specific, PFRI is determined by two components, Exposure Index (EI) and Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI). EI is evaluated based on two indicators, the depression-based Topographic Control Index (TCI) and impervious area ratio. SoVI is measured based on a set of demographic and socio-economic indicators. Our results demonstrated the spatial heterogeneity of urban pluvial flood exposure and social vulnerability, as well as the composite flooding risk across the study area. Our catchment-based urban pluvial flooding risk assessment method can provide a comprehensive understanding of urban flooding and promote the formulation of effective flood mitigation strategies from the catchment perspective.

This paper reports on the first Panta Rhei biennium 2013-2015, providing a comprehensive resource that describes the scope and direction of Panta Rhei. We bring together the knowledge of all the Panta Rhei working groups, to summarize the most pressing research questions and how the hydrological community is progressing towards those goals. We draw out interconnections between different strands of research, and reflect on the need to take a global view on hydrology in the current era of human impacts and environmental change. Finally, we look back to the six driving science questions identified at the outset of Panta Rhei, to quantify progress towards those aims.

A Comparative Case Study	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						livelihood vulnerability index; community governance; vulnerability; land-water dynamics; climate change; salinity intrusion; drainage congestion	COASTAL; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; LEVEL	Communities living in coastal regions are vulnerable to flooding, salinity intrusion, and natural hazards. This is aggravated by climate change. In order to reduce this vulnerability, governments have invested heavily in developing coastal infrastructures. One type of infrastructure development regards polders (i.e., pieces of land previously subject to permanent or temporal overflow that are now surrounded by embankments that prevent inundation). The impact of polderization on livelihood vulnerability is not straightforward and is therefore still poorly understood. In order to analyze such impacts, we present a comparative case study of four polders in Bangladesh that are characterized by varying societal circumstances, hydrological conditions, hydrological interventions, and different levels of community response to polderization. How does livelihood vulnerability vary temporally and spatially in polders, and what explains such variation? We use data collected via 162 surveys, 40 semi-structured interviews, and secondary research to analyze trends in the scores of the livelihood vulnerability index. Based on our analysis, we argue that after accounting for interactions amongst variables like hydrological conditions, hydrological interventions, community response, and other societal factors, livelihood vulnerability is lower in polders characterized by higher community involvement in using hydrological interventions to control the flow of saline water.

However, the traditional methods may result in overdesign in the water conservancy project since the series has non-stationary variations due to climate change and human activities. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new approach for frequency estimation of non-stationary time series of extreme values. This study used four kinds of mutation test methods (the linear trend correlation coefficient, Mann-Kendall test, sliding t-test, and Pettitt test) to identify the trend and mutation of the annual maximum flow series (1950-2006) of three hydrological stations in the Yiluo River Basin. Then we evaluated the performance of two types of design flood methods (the time series decomposition-synthesis method, the mixed distribution model) under the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydro-meteorological conditions. The results showed that (a) the design flood value obtained by the time series decomposition-synthesis method based on the series of the backward restore is larger than that obtained by the decomposition synthesis method based on the series of the forward restore; (b) when the return period is 100 years or less, the design flood value obtained by the mixed distribution model using the capacity ratio parameter estimation method is less than that obtained by the hybrid distribution model with simulated annealing parameter estimation method; and (c) both methods can overcome sequence inconsistency in design frequencies. This study provides insight into the frequency estimation of non-stationary time series of extreme values under the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydro-meteorological conditions.

However, there are various uncertainties and challenges associated with the impacts of displacement and attachments to place. In this context, it is useful to study past examples of relocation to understand how these challenges have been addressed. This paper draws on a case study relocation scheme which took place in Ireland following major flooding in 1954. This represented a radical and comprehensive approach to relocation which sought to address the root causes of vulnerability. The analysis shows that this comprehensive approach was made possible through a connection between managed retreat and land reform. The scheme also faced opposition linked to attachments to place and property. This led to compromises and a failure to fully address the effects of flooding on livelihoods but contributed to resilience through ensuring that family and community ties remained intact. The paper's distinctive contributions are its analysis of the requirements of transformative approaches to adaptation and relocation, its identification of challenges associated with place and property even in the context of such transformative approaches, and its adding of historical depth to contemporary debates on climate adaptation.

The region faces challenges from multiple non-climate stressors such as poverty, environmental and climate shocks, and inadequate infrastructure. Addressing these deprivations in ways that reduce vulnerability associated with a changing climate are critical for the communities that live here. This paper combines data on flood risks derived from a climate-hydrology model under two future scenarios of RCP 4.5 and 8.5, with socio-economic data from communities in the Gandak basin, to demonstrate how mainstreaming climate change impacts into decision-making for sanitation interventions can reduce socio-economic vulnerability to flooding. A Cost-effectiveness analysis of the alternative interventions for sanitation reveals that gains are substantially higher under an intervention that takes note of climatic events, both for the present and in the future. Substantial health costs and inconvenience losses that are particularly acute for women during floods can be averted by investing in climate-friendly options. Climate adaptation (SDG goal 13 on climate action) can be synergistic with the achievement of other SDGs (Goal 6 on sanitation, goal 3 on health and well-being, goal 5 on gender).

Preparedness and response measures need to concentrate on toxicological and infectious hazards, the potential impact on environmental health, and threat to human lives. The recognition of the danger of flood water after hurricanes is critical. Effective health management needs to consider the likelihood and specific risks of toxic agents present in waters contaminated by chemical spills, bio-toxins, waste, sewage, and water-borne pathogens. Despite significant progress in the ability to rapidly detect and test water for a wide range of chemicals and pathogens, there has been a lack of implementation to adapt toxicity measurements in the context of flash and hurricane-induced flooding. The aim of this review was to highlight the need to collect and analyze data on toxicity of flood waters to understand the risks and prepare vulnerable communities and first responders. It is proposed that new and routinely used technologies be employed during disaster response to rapidly assess toxicity and infectious disease threats, and subsequently take necessary remedial actions.

We suggest that the PARA framework, first developed for climate change adaptation planning in communities facing sea level rise, is also a useful framework for flood risk reduction and flood resilience. The paper reviews four case studies of Canadian flood disaster risk reduction, with each case chosen to represent one of the four PARA risk reduction options. The extensive network of dikes and pumping stations employed in British Columbia's Lower Mainland (Fraser River) is used in the paper as an example of a "protect" approach to flood risk reduction; Winnipeg, Manitoba's Basement Flood Relief Program is used to highlight the "accommodate" approach; zoning changes and land expropriation following Toronto, Ontario's 1954 Hurricane Hazel flood disaster are used to showcase the "retreat" approach; and, modern floodplain development planning approaches in Calgary, Alberta are used to highlight the "avoid" approach. Overall, this paper contends that the PARA framework can be an effective approach for comprehensive flood disaster risk reduction and flood resilience; however, contextual factors, including equity considerations, should guide its application in situ.

The municipality of Mangaratiba (Macroregion of Costa Verde, on the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro) follows the worldwide trend of population growth in the coastal zone, with large buildings and a very early local commerce in its surroundings. Their beaches are exposed to environmental impacts caused by the relative sea-level rise, which can be intensified mainly by the pressures of anthropic activities. A simulation of the relative sea-level rise in the city of Mangaratiba was carried out, emphasizing the flood areas from the marine transgression. Therefore, with the overlay of the flooded area with the land use map, it was possible to quantify the flood in each one of the classes. Afterwards, through a bibliographical survey and application of interaction and listings matrices, it was possible to evaluate the probable environmental impacts from the flood mentioned above. The result showed that an increase in the relative sea-level in the study area would have several consequences such as coastal erosion, flooding, damage to areas of urban occupation and to the dunes, which could directly affect the infrastructure, housing and local tourism.

Although the use of fill terraces for incision rate derivation is complicated due to their cyclical nature relative to strath terraces, they remain a relatively complete record of incision and deposition, thus allowing one to derive interpretations about both tectonics and climate. The Adriatic piedmont of the Apennines (central Italy) offers a well-preserved staircase of such terraces, caused by the cyclical alternation of fluvial aggradation and incision over the Middle and Late Pleistocene in response to a combination of low-rate tectonic uplift and climate changes. Although the staircase has been already widely described with examples from several valleys of the Adriatic Piedmont, its geochronological constraints are limited and must be enhanced to extract reliable climatic and tectonic signals from terrace deposits-especially for the older terrace levels. This research provides new Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) data on the terrace chronology in combination with new semi-automatically extracted data on the altimetric and along-valley terrace distributions, as well as the sedimentological characteristics of fill terraces within the Tesino River basin in the Marche piedmont zone of the Apennines. The semi-automatic extraction of the terrace tread allowed a preliminary level classification as a function of the terrace height above the modern channel thalweg. The results demonstrate that, within the slowly uplifting Adriatic piedmont of the Apennines, the main phases of fluvial aggradation occurred during cold and full-glacial conditions followed by river incision and floodplain-channel abandonment during warmer periods. This finding confirms previous results from the last fluvial aggradation-incision cycle (Late Pleistocene). The results also show that the same formation mechanism is valid for the older (Middle Pleistocene) terraces. Indeed, this study provides new geochronological constraints for the regional-scale paradigm of cyclical formation and development of Quaternary fill terrace staircases along this sector of the Apennines. The use of a dated fill terrace staircase allowed estimation of a Middle Pleistocene long-term bedrock incision rate ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 mm yr  1 in agreement with previous studies in the central-northern sector of the Adriatic Apennines. The resulting uplift rate supports the presence of differently uplifted blocks due to the fragmentation of the peri-Adriatic region caused by the activity of left-lateral faults.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of drought stress on the growth and physiological characteristics of Z. jujuba var. inermis based on the RCP 6.0 scenario. The experiment was performed in a soil-plant daylight system (SPDS) chamber under four conditions: Control-WW, Control-DS (Drought), RCP 6.0-WW (CO2 650 ppm, control + 3 degrees C), and RCP 6.0-DS. Although the net photosynthetic rate (A) was higher under RCP 6.0 than the control condition, Vcmax and Jmax, which indicate the photosynthetic capacity, were lower by 19.6% and 27.8%, respectively. Furthermore, in the RCP 6.0 group, the carbon fertilization effect tended to stimulate growth; thus, the total dry weight in RCP 6.0-WW was approximately 35% higher than that in Control-WW. When the drought treatment was included, A decreased by 57% in Control-DS compared to Control-WW, and in RCP 6.0-DS, A decreased by 73% compared to RCP 6.0-WW. Moreover, RCP-DS showed the lowest values of Vcmax, Jmax, PIabs, DFabs, and SFIabs, meaning that the photosynthetic capacity and vitality of the photosynthetic apparatus were diminished under combined climate change and drought stress. Furthermore, stomatal limitations (Ls) regulated photosynthesis in Control-DS, whereas in RCP 6.0-DS, non-stomatal limitations, in this case Vcmax, Jmax, PIabs, DFabs, and SFIabs, were observed. Despite a decrease in mesophyll conductance (gm), gm/gs remained relatively high. Furthermore, even with stomatal closure, gm was maintained at a relatively high level by utilizing the intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), demonstrating the plant's response to drought stress. Although there was an increase in the overall biomass, it was noted that water consumption increased under additional drought stress, showing that growth and physiological damage were aggravated. Therefore, it is essential to conduct experiments related to the growth and physiological characteristics of commercially valuable seedlings such as Jujube to identify the adverse effects of climate change alongside extreme weather. Further, active efforts with regard to plant management should be undertaken in addition to the implemented measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate change has the potential to change the severity and frequency of such events. Despite this, assessment of future fluvial flood risk typically gives little to no consideration to potential changes in the spatial structure of future events. To understand the significance of this gap, climate model simulations are coupled with a national hydrological model to identify event spatially coherent present and future flood events. A statistical Empirical Copula is used to generate a large number of unseen events and linked to a national flood risk simulation model. The research finds that including changes in the spatial structure of flood events materially increases projected changes in risk when compared to conventional approaches based on local uplifts alone; increasing the projected change in Expected Annual Damage across Great Britain by a factor of similar to 1.5. The event-based approach is also shown to provide new insights into the extreme distribution fluvial risk including single event damage, damage seasons, and damage years. The results suggest the 1-in-100-year winter flood may increase from 1.3b pound to 2.1b pound, and the 1-in-100 year single event damage may rise from 1.1b pound today to 1.7b pound by the 2080s given a 4 degrees C rise in Global Mean Surface Temperature (assuming current adaptation policies continue and no population growth). Consequently, the findings suggest a much greater emphasis is needed on spatial 'flood events' if future risk is to be understood and adaptation responses appropriately framed.

In this review, we therefore provide an overview of the current state of knowledge related to the impact of global warming on our precious groundwater resources. Groundwater warming in shallow aquifers is closely associated with increasing average land surface temperatures and has already reached + 1 K compared to pe-industrial times. Until the end of the twenty-first century, temperature increases in local groundwater of up to + 10 K are possible. Monitoring data, laboratory and field experiments all provide evidence that such temperature increases are sufficient to substantially modify groundwater quality through numerous and interlinked biogeochemical processes, which we have summarized in a conceptual overview. Warming impacts on groundwater are highly site-specific and spatially heterogeneous, which complicates their assessment and prediction. Locally, shallow unconfined and nutrient-rich floodplain aquifers are most susceptible to warming-induced changes. Importantly, processes affecting water quality are not only modified by a long-term rise in groundwater temperatures, but also in the short-term during weather extremes, which is of great relevance for riverbank filtration. At the regional scale, aquifers in cold regions impacted by permafrost thawing are especially vulnerable to warming. As the majority of temperature-sensitive processes affecting groundwater quality are not or only very slowly reversable, we pressingly require comprehensive mechanistic understanding before it is too late to develop suitable countermeasures and management strategies.

How does global warming contribute to disorders originating from an impaired epithelial barrier?	ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							CLIMATE-CHANGE; BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION; ALLERGIC DISEASES; AIR-POLLUTION; ASTHMA; TIGHT; GUT; HEALTH; CELLS; DETERGENTS	The epithelial barrier represents the point of contact between the host and the external environment. It is the first line of defense against external insults in the skin and in the gastrointestinal and upper and lower respiratory tracts. The steep increase in chronic disorders in recent decades, including allergies and autoimmune disorders, has prompted studies to investigate the immune mechanisms of their underlying pathogeneses, all of which point to a thought-provoking shared finding: disrupted epithelial barriers. Climate change with global warming has increased the frequency of unpredictable extreme weather events, such as wildfires, droughts, floods, and aberrant and longer pollination seasons, among many others. These increasingly frequent natural disasters can synergisti-cally damage the epithelial barrier integrity in the presence of environmental pollution. A disrupted epithelial bar-rier induces proinflammatory activation of epithelial cells and alarmin production, namely, epithelitis. The "opened" epithelial barrier facilitates the entry of the external exposome into and underneath the epithelium, trig-gering an expulsion response driven by inflammatory cells in the area and chronic inflammation. These changes are associated with microbial dysbiosis with colonizing opportunistic pathogens and decreased commensals. These cellular and molecular events are key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic inflammatory disorders. This review summarizes the impact of global warming on epithelial barrier functions in the context of allergic diseases. Further studies in the impact of climate change on the dysfunction of the epithelial barriers are warranted to improve our understanding of epithelial barrier-related diseases and raise awareness of the environmental insults that pose a threat to our health.(c) 2023 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

J	Dimitriadou, L; Zerefos, C				Dimitriadou, Lida; Zerefos, Christos			Heatwaves and Mortality in Spain and Greece: A Comparative Analysis	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						mortality; temperature; heatwaves; Spain; Greece	2003 HEAT-WAVE; NEW-YORK-CITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; SUMMER; IMPACT; FRANCE; MORBIDITY; DEATHS; HEALTH	Background: Heatwaves have become a public health emergency raising great public health concerns. Correspondingly, due to climate change, the increase in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods and hurricanes, is predicted through state-of-the-art models and robust statistical analyses. Since the Mediterranean basin is recognized as the most prominent global climate change hot spot, further scientific research on the future impacts of heatwaves on human mortality, as well as human health and well-being, in the Mediterranean region is critical. Methods: The aim of the present study is to compare the relationship between three different causes of mortality (i.e., cardiological, respiratory and cardiorespiratory) and temperature between two countries (Spain and Greece) and five cities (i.e., Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Attica and Thessaloniki). To compare the five cities under examination, a robust statistical methodological framework (i.e., Threshold Regression Analysis (TRA)) was applied so as to examine the critical value above which the mean temperature affects cardiological, respiratory and cardiorespiratory mortality. Results: Our results prove that the relationship between mortality and temperature is a nonlinear relationship shaping a U- or J-shaped curve, meaning that mortality is affected by temperature in a non-constant way, indicating that mortality increases during both low and high temperatures. Conclusions: By calculating different temperature thresholds for the five cities under examination, we show that different temperature thresholds are more accurate for different climatic conditions. Hence, climatic conditions should be taken into account when examining the impacts of temperature on human health.

As a long-term solution, urban and periurban forests have the potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change by providing ecosystem services such as removing air pollutants, mitigating the urban heat islands, storing carbon, regulating local climate, limiting the risk of flooding, reducing noise levels, and improving the physical and mental health of citizens and their welfare. To promote, conserve, and enhance the benefits offered by the periurban forests, it is needed to adequately describe the forest ecosystems state, and understand well their structure and functionality. The objective of this study was to investigate the structure, diversity, and health status of one of the main periurban forest in Bucharest. In 2015 and 2020, biophysical measurements (diameter at breast height, total height, wood quality, cenotic class) and assessments of forest health status were conducted in a permanent sample monitoring network (PSMN). This PSMN consists of 46 sample plots located in the periurban Stefanesti forest near Bucharest, Romania. The calculation included tree characteristics and stand volumes, while the tree species diversity was characterized using the Shannon (H) and Gini (G) indexes. Our study confirmed that higher diversity indexes of tree species and variability amongst the biometric characteristics at forest stand level sustain ecosystem resilience and adaptability to climate change, simultaneously bolstering their capacity to provide various ecosystem services. The gained insights are critical in helping forest managers, policymakers, and any stakeholders in the effort to evaluate and model the ecosystem services.

Debris-covered glacier systems and associated glacial lake outburst flood hazards: challenges and prospects	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Editorial Material							MOUNT EVEREST REGION; DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL; CHANGRI NUP GLACIER; MORAINE-DAMMED LAKE; MONT-BLANC MASSIF; SUPRAGLACIAL DEBRIS; ENERGY-BALANCE; IN-SITU; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ICE CLIFFS	Glaciers respond sensitively to climate variability and change, with associated impacts on meltwater production, sea-level rise and geomorphological hazards. There is a strong societal interest in understanding the current response of all types of glacier systems to climate change and how they will continue to evolve in the context of the whole glacierized landscape. In particular, understanding the current and future behaviour of debris-covered glaciers is a 'hot topic' in glaciological research because of concerns for water resources and glacier-related hazards. The state of these glaciers is closely related to various hazardous geomorphological processes which are relatively poorly understood. Understanding the implications of debris-covered glacier evolution requires a systems approach. This includes the interplay of various factors such as local geomorphology, ice ablation patterns, debris characteristics and glacier lake growth and development. Such a broader, contextualized understanding is prerequisite to identifying and monitoring the geohazards and hydrologic implications associated with changes in the debris-covered glacier system under future climate scenarios. This paper presents a comprehensive review of current knowledge of the debris-covered glacier landsystem. Specifically, we review state-of-the-art field-based and the remote sensing-based methods for monitoring debris-covered glacier characteristics and lakes and their evolution under future climate change. We advocate a holistic process-based framework for assessing hazards associated with moraine-dammed glacio-terminal lakes that are a projected end-member state for many debris-covered glaciers under a warming climate.

However, the effect of temperature increase on the emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) in different estuarine and coastal areas is still uncertain. In this study, we used laboratory incubation experiments to investigate increasing temperatures (12, 25, and 35 degrees C) and tidal effects on N2O fluxes in intertidal sediments from the East China coast (ECC). Overall, the ECC acts as a net source of atmospheric N2O and exhibited considerable spatial variability over three orders of magnitude (from -0.17 to 8.4 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). The warming promoted N2O emissions in most intertidal areas, while reducing N2O emissions at some sampling sites. In addition, the overall effect of flooding on N2O emissions changed from a positive to a negative effect with increasing temperature. By combining the sediment properties of all the sampling sites, we found that large differences in N2O emissions at the same amended floodwater nitrogen concentration were due to the quality and quantity of sediment organic matter. Sediment derived mainly from marine sources emitted more N2O than sediment derived from terrestrial sources. This suggests that the mangroves, salt marshes, and intertidal zones of estuaries have a mitigating effect on N2O emissions due to their elevated terrestrial organic matter inputs. This research improves our understanding of the impact of future global climatic changes on intertidal N2O fluxes, which can inform future studies and models and can be used to constrain intertidal N2O emissions.

Investments in blue-green infrastructure (BGI) are increasingly considered to address these issues. However, these should be cost-effective. In this study, the effectiveness of five different BGI strategies and one grey strategy are assessed for a peri-urban catchment area in Oslo (Grefsen) using a cost-benefit analysis. The strategies include (i) wadis; (ii) green roofs; (iii) raingardens, rain barrels and wadis; (iv) infiltration crates; (v) water squares, and (vi) a separate sewage system. Besides economic effectiveness, the study also aims to identify the proper protection level by comparing cost-benefit ratios and net benefits for 60-min rainfall events occurring once every 5, 20, and 100 years (M5, M20, and M100), concerning both the current situation and under future climate change (using the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5). The analyses revealed the highest BC ratios for wadis (12.0-17.3), separate sewage systems (7.7-15.1), and a combination of raingardens, rain barrels, and wadis (1.6-2.3). Strategies dimensioned for less frequent but more intensive rainfall events yielded higher BC ratios. Results for infiltration crates were difficult to interpret and were found to be very sensitive to input parameters. The other strategies implied a negative BC ratio. The study concludes that investments in BGI in Grefsen, Oslo, can be positively judged from a social-economic perspective and provide suitable information for water-related decision makers to decide upon the strategy selection and the appropriate flood protection level.

Fossil fuels phase and form transitions from solid (coal) to liquid (oil) occurred in centuries, liquid (oil) to natural gas in several decades and natural gas to shale in a few decades. Energy transition from molecular fossil fuels to atomic energy was driven by nuclear fission, atomic energy to photons by laser fusion, solar cells and artificial photosynthesis. Grand energy transition from wood to the wire was primarily interest and economy driven, unaware of the environmental consequences. Oil depletion, sustainability, climate change and environmental issues force the scientists to inspire the stakeholders for mandatory energy transition from molecular fossil fuels and atomic reactors to renewable energy sources. Oil depletion geared up renewable energy transition, the discovery of shale gases accomplished the solid to gas phase transition partly slowing down fast renewable energy transition policies. Evolution of extreme weather phenomenon in the form of heat waves, hurricanes, smog, famines and floods again forced the stakeholders to resume the renewable energy transition policies. Innovative technologies, smart grid, energy efficiency and conservation ideas have played their role well. Advances in solar, wind and wave energy technologies have rendered renewable, and alternative energy sources cost competitive with fossil fuels. When renewable energy becomes cheaper than coal and oil, the climate change deniers can have no excuse resist the renewable energy transition. Lexus nexus is nuclear fusion and artificial photosynthesis. This paper reviews past, present and possible nature inspired future energy transitions. (C) 2018 Karabuk University.

While climate change disturbs stream discharges and affects flood extremes, upstream dam development may intensify or mitigate such impacts. Therefore, this study provides a quantitative evaluation of long-term alterations in the flow regimes of the VGTB rivers from 1977 to 2020 resulting from the impacts of upstream anthropogenic developments. The datasets are divided into two periods, pre-2000 (1977-2000) and post-2000 (2001-2020), using different indices and analytical methods. The analyses show that since 2011, reservoir operations have reduced the maximum and high-flow discharges downstream in excess of climate change and land-use effects. However, due to the impact of water transfer by the Dak Mi 4 hydropower dam from the Vu Gia River to the Thu Bon River through a diversion channel, the minimum and low-flow discharges decreased in the pre-dam period and increased in the post-dam period.

Part of this uncertainty is because few regional-scale studies have analyzed changes in floods produced by different mechanisms. We identify six flood generating mechanisms (FGMs) based on prominent meteorological processes and moisture supply to the soil column in the Western U.S.; these include large-scale frontal storms (atmospheric and non-atmospheric rivers), monsoons, convective storms, snowmelt, and rain-on-snow. We assess trends in the frequency, magnitude, and timing of floods produced by different FGMs across 119 basins during 1960-2018. Overall, we find decreased frequency and magnitude of rain-on-snow-driven floods, increased frequency and magnitude of convective-storm-driven floods, and a temporal shift to earlier in the year for snowmelt-driven floods. The flood characteristics are generally stable for floods produced by other FGMs.	[Huang, Huilin; Fischella, Michael R.; Ban, Zhaoxin; Fayne, Jessica V.; Li, Dongyue; Cavanaugh, Kyle C.; Lettenmaier, Dennis P.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Liu, Yufei; Li, Dongyue; Lettenmaier, Dennis P.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA	University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles	Lettenmaier, DP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Lettenmaier, DP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.	dlettenm@ucla.edu	lettenmaier, dennis/T-3088-2017; Fayne, Jessica/HPG-2782-2023	Fayne, Jessica/0000-0003-2352-546X; Li, Dongyue/0000-0002-2566-7851; Liu, Yufei/0000-0002-5757-7332; Huang, Huilin/0000-0002-7328-6738; Ban, Zhaoxin/0000-0001-8776-1811; Fischella, Michael R./0000-0001-9006-5235	National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-2034835]	National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF))	We thank Matthew Cooper of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Kayden Haleakala of the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, UCLA for making available their pre-processed versions of the USGS GAGES-II data.

Estimating Option Values and Spillover Damages for Coastal Protection: Evidence from Oregon's Planning Goal 18	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS			English	Article						option value; irreversible loss; spillover effects; spatial externalities; private value of climate adaptation; erosion	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD HAZARDS; ADAPTATION; UNCERTAINTY; AMENITIES; INSURANCE; BENEFITS; EROSION	Estimating nonmarket benefits for erosion protection can help inform better decision making and policies for communities to adapt to climate change. We estimate private values for a coastal protection option in an empirical setting subject to irreversible loss from coastal erosion and a land-use policy that provides identifying variation in the parcel-level option to invest in protection. Using postmatching regressions and accounting for potential spillovers, we find evidence that the value of the erosion protection option is between 13% and 22% of land price for parcels vulnerable to coastal hazards, implying that owners of oceanfront parcels have a subjective annual probability that they will experience an irreversible loss absent the option to protect between 0.7% and 1.3%. We also find that, because of altered shoreline wave dynamics, a parcel with a private protection option generates a spillover effect on protection-ineligible neighbors, lowering the value of neighboring land by 8%.

The system, which comprises a set of numerical models, state-of-the-art methodologies and numerical databases, is prepared to provide a method for coastal practitioners, researchers and decision-makers to address coastal issues, such as erosion and flooding or to evaluate coastal defense structures. The system incorporates a method to transfer numerically generated, calibrated and validated wave series to the surf zone; to estimate the sediment littoral drift by means of up-to-date formulations; and to estimate the flooding level and impacts such as those produced by climate change. In this paper, these skills are detailed. The system, which is adaptable to any coastal region, was implemented for the Brazilian coast (SMC-Brasil). The implementation includes databases and methodological adaptations to local characteristics, a dissemination plan and the development of several study cases.

Changes in seasonal compound floods in Vietnam revealed by a time-varying dependence structure of extreme rainfall and high surge	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coastal compound flood; Climate change; Quantification framework; Rainfall extremes; Storm surge	CHI MINH CITY; NONSTATIONARY FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RISK; ADAPTATION; DRIVERS	Compound floods due to intense rainfall and storm surges in coastal areas have shown an increasing trend in some parts of the world, and many studies suggested a strong link with climate change. Yet, such link has not been fully explored and quantitively assessed. In this paper, we demonstrate the development and application of a nonstationary framework to determining different compound scenarios, where individual drivers and their interactions have altered under climate change. The framework has been applied to one of the most flood-prone areas: the Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam, to help analyze the present and future compound flood risks in both the dry and wet seasons driven by the joint effect from heavy inland rainfall and high skew surge. Over the period of 1980-2017, the two drivers are found to be significantly correlated in March and April, corresponding to the transition from dry-to-wet seasons. We also find that the commonly-used traditional multivariate statistical models underestimate the flood magnitudes for both the current (represented by 2020) and future (represented by 2050) scenarios, when compared with the results produced by the nonstationary methods. In addition, the results reveal that the dry season is expected to receive more floods triggered by the increased intensity and frequency of rainfall extremes, with the magnitude reaching a similar level to that of the wet season. This is in line with the climate projections under RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios although the duration of dry spells is expected to increase and the total annual rainfall to decrease in Vietnam. The simulated flood inundations indicate remarkable increases in flood magnitude and extension, especially at the locations identified as low risk by the stationary models.

The research presented in this paper focuses on developing a methodological framework to perform a cost-benefit-analysis of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies (i.e., protect, accommodate, or retreat options). The method is tested in pilot-site case-studies along the West African countries of Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, and Benin. The criterion used in the cost-benefit analysis is the Net Present Value (NPV) for the different risk management alternatives, according to different time horizons and dynamic adaptation pathways to 2100, discount rates and low-and high-cost estimates. Overall, the research makes evident that coastal protection investment costs ensuring the lowest residual risk (virtually zero risk) to 2100 are so high that they are unlikely to be paid back by avoided damages. Planned retreat (coastal setbacks and/or accommodation) allows to obtain most of the benefits (50%- 98%) at a fraction of the protection costs (2%-12%). Furthermore, the research provides strong evidence that, when coastal risks are dominated by frequent coastal floods (10-year return period), the cost recovery period for climate-proofing of buildings is low (a few decades) compared to protect or setback measures. Finally, the research illustrates that disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies cannot be examined in general, but that location specific analysis of both costs and benefits is required.

Data augmented participatory methods, such as geodesign, offer much promise in supporting strategic planning to make our cities and regions more resilient. In that context, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of geodesign practices in resilience planning, through a systematic review of the selected 487 studies available from various bibliographic databases. The results indicate that a total of 75 studies were connected to resilience thinking, with a focus on climate change, floods, and sea level rise risks. A significant cluster of those resilience-related studies worked, especially, on improving sustainability. A detailed analysis of 59 relevant geodesign case studies revealed a strong underlying emphasis on disaster risk reduction and management activities. This study also noticed two prominent approaches among the analysed case studies to future city scenario planning: computational (41 studies), and collaborative (18 studies). It is recommended that an explicit integration of these two approaches into the geodesign approach can assist future city resilience planning endeavours. Thus, future research should further investigate the utility of integrating data-driven modelling and simulation within a collaborative scenario planning process, the usability of digital tools such as planning support systems within a collaborative geodesign framework, and the value of the plan's performance evaluation during resilience decision-making. Another area for future work is increased community engagement in city resilience practices. The geodesign approach can provide a comprehensive framework for bringing communities, decision-makers, experts, and technologists together to help plan for more resilient city futures. Finally, while geodesign's explicit role in empirical resilience implementations has been found to be low in this systematic review study, there are significant opportunities to support evidence-based and collaborative city resilience planning and decision-making activities.

In the proposed framework, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and M5 Model tree are used for classification of precipitation (wet and dry days), whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is considered for training least square support vector machine (LSSVM), wavelet transform (WT) is used for decomposition of precipitation and temperature, LSSVM-WOA, LSSVM, K nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) are performed for downscaling precipitation and temperature, and discharge is simulated under present period (1972-2000), near future (2020-2040) and far future (2070-2100). Log normal distribution is used for flood frequency analysis. Furthermore, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and fuzzy method are employed for uncertainty analysis. Karun3 Basin, in southwest of Iran, is considered as a case study. Results indicated that MARS performed better than M5 model tree. In downscaling, ANN and LSSVM_WOA slightly outperformed other machine learning algorithms. Results of simulating the discharge showed superiority of LSSVM_WOA_WT algorithm (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.911). Results of flood frequency analysis revealed that 200-year discharge decreases for all scenarios, except CanESM2 RCP2.6 scenario, in the near future. In the near and far future periods, it is obvious from ANOVA uncertainty analysis that hydrological models are one of the most important sources of uncertainty. Based on the fuzzy uncertainty analysis, HadCM3 model has lower uncertainty in higher return periods (up to 60% lower than other models in 1000-year return period).

Owing to past emissions and climate system inertia, global climate change is predicted to continue for decades even if anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions were to stop immediately. In many regions, such as central Europe and the Mediterranean region, the temperature is likely to rise by 2-5 degrees C and annual precipitation is predicted to decrease. Expected heat and drought periods followed by floods, and unpredictable growing seasons, are predicted to have detrimental effects on agricultural production systems, causing immense economic losses and food supply problems. To mitigate the risks of climate change, agricultural innovations counteracting these effects need to be embraced and accelerated. To achieve maximum improvement, the required agricultural innovations should not focus only on crops but rather pursue a holistic approach including the entire ecosystem. Over millions of years, plants have evolved in close association with other organisms, particularly soil microbes that have shaped their evolution and contemporary ecology. Many studies have already highlighted beneficial interactions among plants and the communities of microorganisms with which they coexist. Questions arising from these discoveries are whether it will be possible to decipher a common molecular pattern and the underlying biochemical framework of interspecies communication, and whether such knowledge can be used to improve agricultural performance under environmental stress conditions. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of plant interactions with fungal endosymbionts found in extreme ecosystems. Special attention will be paid to the interaction of plants with the symbiotic root-colonizing endophytic fungus Serendipita indica, which has been developed as a model system for beneficial plant-fungus interactions.

Wave climate projections along the Indian coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; coastal vulnerability; dynamical projections; Indian coast; surface ocean waves; wave climate variability	VARIABILITY; ENSEMBLE; CMIP5	Future changes in wave climate will influence the marine ecosystem, coastal erosion, design of coastal defences, operation of near- and off-shore structures, and coastal zone management policies and may further add to the potential vulnerabilities of coastal regions to projected sea level rise. Many studies have reported changes in the global wave characteristics under climate change scenarios, but it is important to project future changes in local/regional wave climate for smooth implementation of policies and preventing severe coastal erosion and flooding. In this study the regional wave climate along the Indian coast for two time slices, 2011-2040 and 2041-2070, is reported using an ensemble of near-surface winds generated by four different CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs), under RCP4.5 scenario. Comparison of the wave climate for the two time slices shows an increase in wave heights and periods along much of the Indian coast, with the maximum wave heights increasing by more than 30% in some locations. An important finding is that at most locations along the east coast, wave periods are expected to increase by almost 20%, whereas along the west coast an increase of around 10% is expected. This will alter the distribution of wave energy at the shoreline through changes in wave refraction and diffraction, with potential implications for the performance and design of coastal structures and swash-aligned beaches. Furthermore, the computations show material changes in the directional distribution of waves. This is particularly important in determining the longshore transport of sediments and can lead to realignment of drift-aligned beaches, manifesting itself as erosion and/or siltation problems. This study is a preliminary contribution towards regional climate projections for the Indian Ocean region which are needed to plan and mitigate the impacts of future climate change.

This expectation is tied to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation, stating that the maximum water vapour content in the atmosphere increases by 6-7% per degree warming. Scaling rates for the dependency of hourly precipitation extremes on near-surface (dew point) temperature derived from day-to-day variability have been found to exceed this relation (super-CC). However, both the applicability of this approach in a long-term climate change context, and the physical realism of super-CC rates have been questioned. Here, we analyse three different climate change experiments with a convection-permitting model over Western Europe: simple uniform-warming, 11-year pseudo-global warming and 11-year global climate model driven. The uniform-warming experiment results in consistent increases to the intensity of hourly rainfall extremes of approximately 11% per degree for moderate to high extremes. The other two, more realistic, experiments show smaller increases-usually at or below the CC rate-for moderate extremes, mostly resulting from significant decreases to rainfall occurrence. However, changes to the most extreme events are broadly consistent with 1.5-2 times the CC rate (10-14% per degree), as predicted from the present-day scaling rate for the highest percentiles. This result has important implications for climate adaptation.

Thermal biology of aquatic insects in alpine lakes: Insights from diving beetles	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; Dytiscidae; glacial ponds; lower thermal limit; upper thermal limit	COLD TOLERANCE; FREEZING TOLERANCE; RANGE SIZE; TEMPERATURE; LARVAE; WINTER; CHIRONOMIDAE; ORTHOPTERA; COLEOPTERA; DROSOPHILA	High mountain areas are especially vulnerable to global warming, as they experience faster temperature changes than lowlands in a climate change context. Notably, increased temperatures and frequency of extreme flooding and droughts, and the consequent decrease in ice cover and water availability fluctuations, will induce important physical changes in alpine freshwater systems. Thus, assessing thermal limits and exploring overwintering strategies of aquatic alpine insects is pivotal to understanding how aquatic communities of high-mountain fresh waters will respond to climate change. However, knowledge on these topics is still scarce for aquatic alpine insects.Here, the thermal biology of adults of five diving beetle species from alpine lakes located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range (southern Iberia) was studied. Cold tolerance was measured estimating the supercooling point (SCP), lower lethal temperature (LLT), tolerance to ice enclosure and to submersion, whereas heat tolerance was assessed from the heat coma temperature and upper lethal temperature.All of the species survived ice enclosure for 3 h. Furthermore, three of the studied species had SCPs higher than their LLTs, suggesting that they could be freeze-tolerant. All species except Agabus nevadensis also were tolerant to submersion, which could be a key adaptation for overwintering underwater below the ice cover as adults, reducing risk from freezing conditions in the air. The species did not differ significantly in their upper thermal limits, which were similar to those of other dytiscids from lower altitudes.Overall, our results suggest that increasing temperatures is not expected to be the most important threat for the water beetle populations in Sierra Nevada, but rather the colonisation of alpine lakes by lowland dytiscids in a warmer climate scenario.

J	Yang, X; Huang, SC				Yang, Xue; Huang, Shaochun			Attribution assessment of hydrological trends and extremes to climate change for Northern high latitude catchments in Norway	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Counterfactual; Multi-model assessment; Extreme events attribution; Trend analysis	STREAMFLOW; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; FREQUENCY; IMPACT; FLOODS; COUNTRIES	The northern high latitudes have experienced the strongest warming in the world and substantial changes in streamflow and hydrological extremes. However, there have been limited attribution studies of changes in streamflow and hydrological extremes in this region. This study provides the first trend detection and attribution assessment on 33 hydrological variables for 50 Norwegian catchments in the period 1961-2019, using observed and simulated runoff data from four hydrological models driven by factual (observed) and counterfactual forcing data. Significant increasing trends are detected in observed annual, spring and winter runoff in most catchments and significant trends towards earlier spring floods are found in 40% of catchments. The four hydrological models show similarly good performance in terms of daily discharge in both calibration and validation periods, and they can reproduce 62% of the observed significant trends considering both trend direction and significance. The counterfactual forcing data were generated by the ATTRICI model, which removed all warming trends and most significant trends in precipitation in the factual time series. Ninety-four percent of the simulated significant trends driven by the factual forcing data are insignificant under counterfactual conditions, with trend slopes approaching zero. Thus, based on the model performance in trend reproduction and the difference of significant trends under factual and counterfactual conditions, we conclude that about 58% of the observed significant trends in Norwegian catchments can be attributed mainly to climate change. The comparisons of the historical extreme events under factual and counterfactual conditions show that more than 65% of floods and droughts in the 2010s could have been magnified by climate change.

Evaluation of adaptation measures to counteract rising groundwater levels in urban areas in response to climate change	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Groundwater flooding; Urban groundwater; Adaptation measures; Climate change; Denmark	WATER; TRANSIENT; RECHARGE; IMPACT; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; AFFORESTATION; INFILTRATION; CATCHMENTS; RESOURCES	For an increasing number of urban areas in Denmark and other countries with a temperate climate, large seasonal variations in precipitation, evaporation, and groundwater recharge cause problems with high groundwater levels during winter for private house owners, industry, public institutions, and infrastructure. Several factors contribute to the problem, e.g., an increase in winter precipitation, renovation of old leaky sewer pipes (previously acting as drain systems), and closure of groundwater abstraction for drinking water in urban areas in response to pollution. Four adaptation measures are compared with a detailed hydrological model for the town of Sunds, located in the western part of Denmark. Two 'grey', one 'green' and one 'blue' measure are evaluated. The grey solutions involve (1) installing drainage pipes (a third pipe) alongside the existing sewer pipes, and (2) lowering the water table by groundwater pumping from shallow wells, including storage of water in deeper aquifers for use in the drier summer; the green solution involves planting new forest in and around the town; and the blue solution is to establish a new ditch in the town. A climate model that projects more precipitation, especially in the winter, is used to evaluate the robustness of the different measures in a wetter climate for the northern European area. The hydrological modelling shows that the third pipe is the most effective climate-change adaptation of the four measures tested. The new ditch is an effective solution to lower the water table but with a more limited areal coverage.	[Rasmussen, Per; Kidmose, Jacob; Schneider, Raphael; Sonnenborg, Torben O.

Local topography influences critical periods of tidal inundation that govern distributions of mangrove species and dictates future distributions. This study surveyed ground surface elevations of the extensive mangroves of Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, integrating four survey technologies to solve issues of canopy blocking satellite reception, dense aerial roots limiting line-of-sight, and remoteness from surveyed datums. The island-wide average elevation of the mangrove seaward edge was -0.57 +/- 0.13 m relative to MSL, while the landward average elevation was 0.33 +/- 0.12 m relative to MSL. The overall mangrove elevation range was thus estimated to be 0.90 m. Mangrove species Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora apiculata and Sonneratia alba had large, overlapping elevation ranges, while Rhizophora stylosa occurred low in the tide frame. These species are likely to be less vulnerable to rising sea level given their greater range of elevation occurrence and presumably flooding tolerance, and hence have the highest adaptive capacity to rising sea level. Some landward edge species had very narrow elevation ranges, increasing their vulnerability to sea-level rise, with adjacent potential upland migration areas limited due to steep topography and human development. Pohnpei mangroves occupied 74% of the mean tidal range, similar to surveys elsewhere in the Pacific. This study demonstrates how more extensive understanding of the elevation distributions of intertidal species can contribute to sea-level rise vulnerability assessments, to allow prioritised climate change adaptation. However, more work is needed in standardizing approaches for global comparisons.

Karst aquifers were chosen due to their importance at the global level and widespread utilisation in potable water supply and irrigation, but also because of their hydrogeological complexity. The method was developed to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers, without considering the direct impact of variable climate factors, but considering the adaptive capacity of aquifers in response to expected climate extremes (floods and prolonged droughts). The procedure includes a subdivision of aquifer systems and an assessment of four main attributes: permeability, storativity, the discharge regime and the slope of each of the subdivided segments. CC-PESTO was tested in three study areas located in the highly developed karst of Montenegro and Serbia. In Mt. Durmitor (Montenegro), four out of 21 subunits were found to belong to the category of 'low vulnerability' and to have a good prospect for further development. Two subunits in the Babine and Bogovina study areas (Serbia) were defined as less vulnerable than others. The results obtained should help water managers and spatial planners to safeguard and reserve these areas as alternative or supplementary water sources that might be able to reduce the shock on groundwater-dependent ecosystems caused by expected extended droughts. The CC-PESTO method is flexible, and its application is possible in other karstic terrains such as platform or tropical karst. Indexation of the main attributes and their subcomponents could be adapted to local circumstances.

Here we present a scoping review, using PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols), examining the conditions that have led to the adoption of climate-resilient crops over the past 30 years in lower- and middle-income countries. The descriptive analysis performed on 202 papers shows that small-scale producers adopted climate-resilient crops and varieties to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, flooding and salinity. The most prevalent trait in our dataset was drought tolerance, followed by water-use efficiency. Our analysis found that the most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops were the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers' access to inputs-especially seeds and fertilizers-and socio-economic status of farming families. About 53% of studies reported that social differences such as sex, age, marital status and ethnicity affected the adoption of varieties or crops as climate change-adaptation strategies. On the basis of the collected evidence, this study presents a series of pathways and interventions that could contribute to higher adoption rates of climate-resilient crops and reduce dis-adoption. Climate-resilient crops are essential for farmers to adapt to climate change. This scoping review identifies extension services and outreach as the most important factors for their adoption by small-scale producers in low- and middle-income countries.

Testing the interactive effects of flooding and salinity on tidal marsh plant productivity	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						Wetland; Climate change; Sea-level rise; Carbon; Adaptation	SEA-LEVEL RISE; COASTAL WETLANDS; SALT MARSHES; SALTWATER INTRUSION; SEED-GERMINATION; STRESS; RESILIENCE; INUNDATION; TOLERANCE; ACCRETION	Tidal wetlands support plant communities that facilitate carbon storage, accrete soil, and provide habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change.. We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change. This may be especially true for estuaries that currently have prolonged freshwater phases like those in the Pacific Northwest.

The safe development paradox: An agent-based model for flood risk under climate change in the European Union	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Adaptation policy; Agent-based model; Extreme events; Flood risk; Levee effect; Safe development paradox	PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES; HURRICANE-KATRINA; POLICY CHANGE; BEHAVIOR; CONSEQUENCES; ADAPTATION; HOUSEHOLDS; REDUCTION; INSURANCE; DYNAMICS	With increasing flood risk due to climate change and socioeconomic trends, governments are under pressure to continue implementing flood protection measures, such as dikes, to reduce flood risk. However, research suggests that a sole focus on government-funded flood protection leads to an adverse increase in exposure as people and economic activities tend to concentrate in protected areas. Moreover, governmental flood protection can reduce the incentive for autonomous adaptation by local households, which paradoxically results in more severe consequences if an extreme flood event occurs. This phenomenon is often referred to as the 'safe development paradox' or 'levee effect' and is generally not accounted for in existing flood risk models used to assess developments in future flood risk under climate change. In this study we assess the impact of extreme flood events for the European Union using a large-scale agent-based model (ABM). We quantify how the safe development paradox affects (1) population growth and the increase in exposed property values, (2) the reduction in investments to flood-proof buildings as public protection increases, and (3) the increase in potential damage should a flood occur. For this analysis, we apply an ABM that integrates the dynamic behaviour of governments and residents into a large-scale flood risk assessment framework, in which we include estimates of changing population growth. We find that the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas. Moreover, we demonstrate how policy that stimulates the flood-proofing of buildings can largely counteract the effects of the safe development paradox.	[Haer, Toon; Botzen, W. J.

Our vulnerability study uses a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate climate change vulnerability of an urbanized coastal community that could serve as a model approach for communities worldwide, particularly in similar Mediterranean climates. We synthesize projected changes in climate, coastal erosion and flooding, watershed runoff and impacts to two important coastal ecosystems, sandy beaches and coastal salt marshes. Using downscaled climate models along with other regional models, we find that temperature, extreme heat events, and sea level are expected to increase in the future, along with more intense rainfall events, despite a negligible change in annual rainfall. Consequently, more droughts are expected but the magnitude of larger flood events will increase. Associated with the continuing rise of mean sea level, extreme coastal water levels will occur with increasingly greater magnitudes and frequency. Severe flooding will occur for both natural (wetlands, beaches) and built environments (airport, harbor, freeway, and residential areas). Adaptation actions can reduce the impact of rising sea level, which will cause losses of sandy beach zones and salt marsh habitats that support the highest biodiversity in these ecosystems, including regionally rare and endangered species, with substantial impacts occurring by 2050. Providing for inland transgression of coastal habitats, effective sediment management, reduced beach grooming and removal of shoreline armoring are adaptations that would help maintain coastal ecosystems and the beneficial services they provide.

Aside from their sea-level location, they are both characterized by large populations, valuable infrastructure and real estate, and economic dependence on tourism, as well as the availability of advanced scientific data and technological expertize. Yet their responses have been quite different. We examine the biophysical environments of the two cities, as well as their socio-economic features, administrative arrangements vulnerabilities, and responses to sea level rise and flooding. Our study uses a qualitative approach to illustrate how adaptation policies have emerged in these two coastal cities. Based on this information, we critically compare the different adaptive responses of Venice and Miami and suggest what each city may learn from the other, as well as offer lessons for other vulnerable coastal cities. In the two cases presented here it would seem that adaptation to SLR has not yet led to a reformulation of the problem or a structural transformation of the relevant institutions. Decision-makers must address the complex issue of rising seas with a combination of scientific knowledge, socio-economic expertize, and good governance. In this regard, the "hi-tech" approach of Venice has generated problems of its own (as did the flood control projects in South Florida over half a century ago), while the increasing public mobilization in Miami appears more promising. The importance of continued long-term adaptation measures is essential in both cities.

It unites characteristics of mountain ecosystems with those of wetlands, both of which are highly important in the context of global warming. It is considered the region with the highest global diversification rate on earth, capable of storing equally large amounts of soil organic carbon and vast quantities of water, forming wetlands within the paramo region, which are crucial for the sustainability of downslope Andean ecosystems and human settlements. These characteristics have attracted great scientific interest leading to an increase in publications, especially in the last decade. Nevertheless, the paramos diversity, difficult topology, latitudinal extension, location in developing countries, and the lack of historical data regarding the monitoring of soil characteristics, dynamics in hydrology, and climatic conditions still cause an important gap in knowledge necessary to estimate future climate change impacts, potential loss of ecosystem services and mitigation strategies. Substantial parts of its unique structure are seriously threatened to disappear before we discover all its secrets. Human intervention due to the upslope shift of agricultural activity, cattle farming, hunting, and wildfires have devastated large amounts of its landscapes. However, the biggest threat, global climate change, is still in its early phase of manifestation. In this context, the present review aims to summarize important characteristics of the Ecuadorian paramo with special emphasis on flooded and floodable areas, analyze what is known about principal threats and their future impact, and finally try to compare paramo research with northern wetlands to identify and discuss important knowledge gaps that remain to be filled.

The northeastern Mediterranean Sea (Aegean, Ionian, and Cretan Seas: AICS) consists of extended low-lying coastal zones exposed to coastal inundation due to seawater level increases. The variability of the Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) in the AICS has been evaluated with the use of satellite-derived observations from 1993 to 2021. The general SLA trend over the AICS domain was 3.6 mm/year, which is higher than that of the overall Mediterranean Sea. The coastal inundation variability along the AICS coastline, specifically in 20 characteristic study areas, was investigated based on the long-term satellite-derived sea level observations, high-resolution land elevation data, and numerical simulations, conducted with a coastal inundation (CoastFLOOD) model. The coastal zones were categorized based on the frequency of occurrence and percentage coverage of flooding incidents during the 29-year period, while the interannual trends and the seasonality of inundated littoral and inland areas also showed intense spatial variation. High flooding levels occurred at coastal areas of either extended low-lying areas and/or high sea level elevations. The coastal zones were categorized based on a heuristic Coastal Inundation Hazard Index (CIHI: 1-5 ranking) that was determined by the occurrence frequency of severe floods (temporal component) and their impact area (spatial component). Our study findings provide vital information about the coastal inundation conditions and the respective hazard level of the AICS, useful to support enhanced coastal zone management for the improvement of coastal protection and decisions about coastal hazards' mitigation.

One of climate change's most destructive calamities is flash flooding. On that caveat, this study tries to identify the zones most susceptible to flash floods by utilizing machine learning technique. Initially, a digital elevation model (DEM) has been utilized to delineate a basin located in the city of New Cairo, Egypt, where the flash floods occur frequently. Subsequentially, 12 flood causative factors were calculated and mapped via ArcMap. Furthermore, the depth of runoff was calculated via HEC-RAS and employed as a flood causative factor. Additionally, both flooded points and flood causative factors have been employed by utilizing the "GARP"* approach to produce the Flood Hazard Map (FHM). The state-of-art in this study is to predict the hazard degree of flash floods by utilizing the simulated runoff depth which has been used as flood causative factor in the selected machine learning technique. The FHM anticipated approximately 20% of the total area to have a very high hazard of floods, whereas, more than two-thirds of the study area has expected to have low and very low flood hazard. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic "ROC" approach has been applied to examine the FHM, which estimated the area under curve as 96.88%. Finally, decision-makers can utilize the generated map to better comprehend repercussion of flooding and make adequate preparations to alleviate this risk. *GARP: "Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction".

These emissions disrupt the natural balance of the global ecosystem and contribute to climate change. However, by investing in renewable energy, we can help mitigate these problems by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a more sustainable future. This research utilized a panel data model to explore the impact of carbon dioxide and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions on global investments in renewable energy. The study analyzed data from 63 countries over the period from 1990 to 2021. Firstly, the study established a relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and clean energy investments across all countries. The findings indicated that carbon dioxide had a positive effect on clean energy investments, while non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions had a negative impact on all three types of clean energy investments. However, the impact of flood damage as a representative of climate change on renewable energy investment was uncertain. Secondly, the study employed panel data with random effects to examine the relationship between countries with lower or higher average carbon dioxide emissions and their investments in solar, wind, and geothermal energy. The results revealed that non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions had a positive impact on investments only in wind power in less polluted countries. On the other hand, flood damage and carbon dioxide emissions were the primary deciding factors for investments in each type of clean energy in more polluted countries.

Reconstructions are based on the data of botanical, diatom, and palynological analyses and radiocarbon dating. The moisture content changed most significantly. Periods of prolonged droughts, which coincided with the weakening of the summer monsoon, were established. A long dry period continued from about 2900 up to 1360 yr BP. Dry conditions did not exclude floods caused by heavy rain caused by the passage of typhoons or deep cyclones. The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age were humid and characterized by increased cyclogenesis. There were short-term fluctuations in humidity: droughts about 530-460 yr BP ago, then conditions became more humid about 400 yr BP and especially about 330-260 yr BP ago. The age ranges of periods with different flood activity and paleo-fires were determined. Events were correlated with data on regional and global events. A different response of mountain and bog landscapes to short-period climatic changes has been established. The role of the Korean pine in forest vegetation changed significantly; its distribution is controlled by changes in the hydroclimatic conditions. The optimum environments for the development of Korean pine forests were 780-530 yr BP ago. The role of Korean pine decreased during dry phases and after fires. The most variable vegetation of the mares was during the Little Ice Age. Modern anthropogenic changes in landscapes are also recorded in the sections. The scale of floods has significantly increased under human impact.	[Razzhigaeva, N. G.; Makarova, T. R.; Grebennikova, T. A.; Lyashchevskaya, M. S.; Mokhova, L. M.; Ganzey, L. A.; Kudryavtseva, E.

The snow cover ratio (SCR) is one of the important indicators reflecting the climate and environmental changes on the TP. The daily remote sensing data of snow cover on the TP from 2003 to 2014 were used to study the spatiotemporal distribution of snow cover on the TP. This dataset is generated based on the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product. The snowmelt days were extracted using the moving average method. The results have shown that the average snowmelt day on the TP starts on the 103rd day and ends on the 223rd day of a year, and the snowmelt duration has a downward trend. Snow is mainly distributed in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains, Karakoram Mountains and Himalayas. The SCR in summer has a downward trend, while in autumn has a rising trend. This shows that the difference in SCR during the year has enlarged, increasing the risk of snowmelt floods. The SCR is highly correlated with temperature, but weakly correlated with precipitation. Using long-term snow cover remote sensing data, the distribution of glacier coverage on the TP can be roughly extracted, of which the glacier area accounts for about 1.1% of the total area of the TP. This study provides an important reference for understanding the spatiotemporal changes of snow cover in the TP. (C) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, changes in some ecologically important aspects of flow seasonality and variability are not well-represented by global climate models. We used a stress testing method and global sensitivity analysis to investigate whether interactions between five different, but plausible, change "dimensions" (hydroclimatic variables or relationships) led to worse ecological outcomes than individual changes. The five dimensions include changes in long-term average rainfall and temperature, low-frequency variability of rainfall, seasonality of rainfall, and the rainfall-runoff relationship. Our case study involved regulated and unregulated sections of the Goulburn River, Australia. We found that four different modeled ecological outcomes (condition of small bodied fish, large bodied fish, in-channel vegetation, and floodplain vegetation) are most sensitive to changes in long-term average rainfall. Sensitivity to changes in rainfall seasonality depends on river characteristics and appears to be heavily dampened by regulation and actively managed environmental water. Changes to the rainfall-runoff relationship (which may be triggered by long-term drying) were found to greatly influence ecological outcomes, but remain poorly understood. However, when considering the worst outcomes that are likely to present severe threats to ecological survival, all five dimensions were significant. These worst outcomes only manifest under certain combinations of changes with interactive effects. These joint interactions have implications for climate risk assessments that do not consider multiple dimensions of change, particularly those aimed at evaluating and mitigating severe threats or extinction probability.

J	Wilcox, S				Wilcox, Shelley			Does Brock's theory of migration justice adequately account for climate refugees?	ETHICS & GLOBAL POLITICS			English	Article						Refugees; climate change; Gillian Brock; environmentally displaced states		In Justice for People on the Move, Gillian Brock develops a promising, original account of migration justice. In her view, states have a robust (though conditional) right to self-determination, which includes a reasonably strong right to regulate migration. However, in order for these rights to be justified, three legitimacy requirements must be met. Most obviously, states must respect the human rights of their own citizens and the international state system itself must be legitimate. This latter condition also requires states to do their part in sustaining a justified state system, which includes helping to alleviate 'legitimacy gaps,' including significant human rights violations in other states. Brock uses this framework to address several pressing migration-related policy issues, including Muslim bans, the deportation of unauthorized migrants, temporary labour migration, and refugee protection. However, one topic is notably absent from her analysis: climate-related displacement. Some theorists insist that climate change migrants should not be considered refugees because they do not fit the standard definition of a refugee. In particular, climate migrants were displaced by droughts, floods, storms, or sea level rise rather than by war or persecution, and many are able to remain in their homes at present but will be forced to relocate at some point in the future. This paper explores the implications of Brock's theory of migration justice for climate migration. I suggest that although her approach to refugee protection may initially appear to exclude climate migrants, her understanding of the right to self-determination yields strong obligations to assist them. I take this to be a strength of her framework, which makes an important, albeit indirect, contribution to current debates on climate change migration.

Recent lake level declines have raised concerns over future climate change impacts, including the risk of no outflows if the Lake Malawi Outflow Threshold (LMOT) is passed. Addressing calls for model co-production, we iteratively engage stakeholders in data collection, and eliciting local system insights and management priorities, to inform the development of a Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model for the Lake Malawi Shire River Basin. We use a simple model setup and manual calibration to allow for data sparsity and limited documentation of historical management decisions. The model satisfactorily captures limited observed streamflow patterns of Lake Malawi tributaries and lake level variations for the period 1960-2009, however, small errors in lake level simulation significantly affect simulation of monthly outflows. The riparian countries, Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique contribute approximately 55%, 41% and 4% respectively to lake inflows (1960-2009 average). Forced with 29 bias-corrected global climate model projections (2021-2050) and assuming no change in current operating rules of key infrastructure, the WEAP model simulates wide-ranging changes. These include much higher lake levels that would cause downstream floods, and much lower lake levels, including 11 projections that fall below the LMOT. Both outcomes would have major implications for downstream hydropower and irrigation. Future water management plans require identification and evaluation of strategies that can address multi-year shifts in lake levels and the uncertainty inherent in future climate and hydrological model outputs.

J	Arevalo, E; Larrañaga, A; Bardonnet, A				Arevalo, Elorri; Larranaga, Aitor; Bardonnet, Agnes			Comparison of food availability and performances of first-feeding alevins through spring with the occurrence of a flood	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH			English	Article						flood; growth; invertebrates; Salmo trutta; survival; temperature	TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA; BROWN TROUT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; JUVENILE SALMONIDS; WATER TEMPERATURE; GROWTH-HORMONE; GLOBAL CHANGE; RIVER; SALAR	Climate change will increase the temperature of rivers and will lead to more extreme events, such as floods. Temperature increases and floods will likely alter the phenology of freshwater species differently and have the potential to significantly disturb prey-predator interactions. In spring, an increase in temperature triggers an increase in primary production and controls the timing of the emergence in brown trout (Salmo trutta L.). Hydrology regulates the abundance of invertebrates, which are the main food source for newborn alevins. As such, climate change may desynchronise the relationship between fish emergence and invertebrate production, resulting in a negative impact on the performance of newly emerged alevins. In the present study, we quantified the abundance of invertebrates and the performance (survival and growth) of newborn alevins in early spring (March) compared to late spring (April/May) in 8 enclosures in a semi-natural channel. In addition, we simulated a flood in 4 enclosures in late spring. Our results revealed that survival and growth of alevins in early spring were limited due to low invertebrate abundance. In late spring, there was a decrease in the survival of alevins placed in the flooded enclosures, likely due to the reduction of food availability. However, the growth of survivors increased, probably because of the increase in the abundance of Chironomidae after the flood and a reduced competition between congeners. Our results demonstrate that when emergence and flooding happen simultaneously, they can limit resources which will impact the survival and growth of young salmonids in running waters.

It is observed that climate change is likely to increase the intensity and the frequency of floods and river basins have become more vulnerable to fluvial flooding. In this study, the impact of climate change on fluvial flooding was analyzed over the Adyar sub-basin. This study applied statistically downscaled Global Climate Model (GCM) data in a CMIP5 dataset of IPCC Assessment Report 5 (AR5). Based on the performance to simulate the observed climate, four GCMs, namely, cesm1-cam5, mpi-esm-mr, ncarc-csm4, and bnu-esm, for RCP 4.5 were selected for projections of the future scenario. The Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves for the past and future scenarios were derived from the IMD-observed and GCM-projected rainfall data. Integrated flood modeling was performed with hydrologic (HEC-HMS) and hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models. Finally, in order to visualize the inundation areas according to the future climate projection, flood inundation maps were prepared geospatially using the ArcGIS software. For the 100-year return period, the results predict that the peak discharge for the future climate scenario would increase by 34.3%-91.9% as compared to the present climate scenario. Similarly, the future projections show an increase in the flooded area ranging from 12.6% to 26.4% based on GCMs. This simulation helps in understanding the flood risk over the Adyar sub-basin under the changing climate and the requirement for the regulation of developmental activities over the flood-prone areas.

J	Xue, ZY; Ullrich, P; Leung, LYR				Xue, Zeyu; Ullrich, Paul; Leung, Lai-Yung Ruby			Sensitivity of the pseudo-global warming method under flood conditions: a case study from the northeastern US	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; FUTURE; VARIABILITY; ENSEMBLE; STORMS	Intensified extreme precipitation and corresponding floods are the most relevant consequences of climate change over the northeastern US (NEUS). To evaluate the impacts of climate change or certain climate perturbations on future extreme weather events which are dynamically similar to historic analogs, the pseudo-global warming (PGW) method has been frequently employed; however, this method lacks precise definition and guidelines, thus limiting its application. More specifically, three key questions related to the application of the PGW method remain unanswered: at what spatial scale should climate perturbations be applied? Among the different meteorological variables available, which ones should be perturbed? And will PGW projections vary significantly when different perturbations are applied? To address these questions, we examine the sensitivity and robustness of conclusions drawn from the PGW method over the NEUS by conducting multiple PGW experiments with varied perturbation spatial scales and choice of perturbed meteorological variables. The results show that the projections of precipitation and other essential variables at the regional mean scale are consistent across the PGW simulations, with a relative difference of much less than 10 %; however, different perturbation modifications can cause significant displacements of the storm events being simulated. Several previously assumed advantages of modifying only the temperature at regional mean scale, such as the preservation of geostrophic balance, do not appear to hold. Also, for these experiments, we find the regional mean perturbation produces a positive precipitation bias because it ignores the land-ocean warming contrast, which is a robust regional response to global warming. Overall, PGW experiments with perturbations from temperature or the combination of temperature and wind at the grid point scale are both recommended, depending on the research questions. The first approach can isolate the spatially dependent thermodynamic impact, and the latter incorporates both the thermodynamic and dynamic impacts.

Characterising the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought and wet events in Australia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Spatiotemporal pathways; Climate change; Extreme precipitation events; Climate adaptation; Drought outlooks	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHTS; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT; BANKSIA PROTEACEAE; WATER AVAILABILITY; TRENDS; ATTRIBUTION; STREAMFLOW; RAINFALL	Global climate change has altered precipitation patterns and disrupted the characteristics of drought and rainfall events. Climate projections confirm that more frequent, intense, and extreme droughts and rainfall events will con-tinue. However, knowledge around how drought and wet events move dynamically through space and time is limited, especially in the southern hemisphere. Australia is the driest inhabited continent, renowned as the land of droughts and flooding rains, but recent climate-driven changes to the severity of wildfires and floods have garnered global at-tention. Here we used S-TRACK, a novel method for spatial drought tracking, to build pathways for past drought and wet events in Australia to examine their spatiotemporal dynamics. Characteristics such as duration, severity, and intensity were obtained from these pathways, and modified Mann-Kendall tests and Sen's slope were used to detect significant trends in characteristics over time. Drought conditions in southern Australia have intensified, particularly in the southwest of Australia and Tasmania, while the north of the country is experiencing longer, more severe, and more intense wet conditions. We also found that the location of drought and wet hotspots has clearly shifted in re-sponse to precipitation changes since the 1970's. Finally, pathways for the most extreme events show peak severity is reached in the middle to late stages of pathways, and that the largest drought and wet areas of a pathway have moved further west in recent times. The findings in this study provide the necessary knowledge to improve prepared-ness for extreme precipitation events as they become more common and to inform predictions for agricultural output or the extent of other climate events such as wildfires and flooding.

Previous studies seldom evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative options in reducing flood risk under the uncertainty of future extreme rainfall. Long-term planning to manage flood risk is further challenged by uncertainty in socioeconomic factors and contested stake-holder priorities. In this study, we conducted a knowledge co-creation process together with infrastructure experts, policy makers, and other stakeholders to develop an integrated framework for flexible testing of multiple flood-risk mitigation strategies under the condition of deep uncertainties. We implemented this framework to the reoccurrence scenarios in the 2050s of a record-breaking extreme rainfall event in central Shanghai. Three uncertain factors, including precipitation, urban rain island effect and the decrease of urban drainage capacity caused by land subsidence and sea level rise, are selected to build future extreme inundation scenarios in the case study. The risk-reduction performance and cost-effectiveness of all possible solutions are examined across different scenarios. The results show that drainage capacity decrease caused by sea-level rise and land subsidence will contribute the most to the rise of future inundation risk in central Shanghai. The combination of increased green area, improved drainage system, and the deep tunnel with a runoff absorbing capacity of 30% comes out to be the most favorable and robust solution which can reduce the future inundation risk by 85% (+/- 8%). This research indicates that to conduct a successful synthesized trade-off analysis of alternative flood control solutions under future deep uncertainty is bound to be a knowledge co-creation process of scientists, decision makers, field experts, and other stakeholders.

To date, the impact of flooding events on agriculture, particularly livestock, has been minimally investigated. For this reason, this study seeks to identify flood damage to livestock production, focusing in particular on dairy cattle farms. In fact, the herd is the main source of income for dairy farmers and the impact of flood on dairy farm can lead to several problems that can seriously undermine dairy cattle welfare and consequently the production outcome after a flood event. Therefore, this study identified and quantified the flood damage that may affect dairy herds, as reported in the literature. This study might help the development of a strategy able to assess direct damages to livestock welfare caused by flood events, provide advantages for farm management and contribute to farm resilience after a natural disaster. For the economic sectors, the need to address the challenges posed by natural disasters due to climate change is an outstanding issue. To date, according to the European Commission (2019), there is still a gap in the estimation of the costs of flood in all European countries and the direct impact that these floods have on agricultural activities. More specifically, the damage to livestock has been minimally studied. The aim of this study is is therefore to identify the flood damage that affects dairy cattle farms, focusing on the damage to herds caused by a flood event; in fact, poor welfare conditions of dairy cattle directly affect production and thus farm revenue. To accomplish the aim of this study, a framework was first developed to identify possible damage types. Then, scientific literature focusing on the identification of flood damage to dairy herds was reviewed, and to quantify this damage to herds, literature sources providing information on the magnitude of variation in the identified damage types were used. Thus, our results provide relevant information on the variables that should be taken into account when assessing of the direct damage affecting the overall welfare of a dairy herd after a flood event. This evidence could then contribute to the development of tools aimed at assessing damage to dairy cattle on flood-affected farms.

While the existing literature documents the adverse effects of uncertainty on macroeconomic and financial variables, the impact on the carbon trading risk remains unclear. This paper analyses the effects of EPU and GPU on the volatility and other risk levels in the carbon market using daily European Union Emissions Trading Scheme data (February 2, 2009 to 8/31/2022) and monthly data on the uncertainty indicators (2009M2-2022M8). The findings reveal that unstable policies and geopolitical tensions heighten carbon market risk since global un-certainty increases information asymmetry and risk premium and causes a delay in investment decisions. Future deliberation among the Cooperation of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should incorporate measures to mitigate global uncertainty while pushing for decarbonization and transition to clean technology.

Thus, the accurate quantification of streamflow variation is a core concern in water resources engineering. In this study, we evaluated the factors influencing streamflow and decomposed their effects in three large rivers: the Buk Han River (BHR), the Nam Han River (NHR), and the Lower Han River (LHB). The Pettit test was used to investigate breakpoints in conjunction with the climate elasticity approach and decomposition framework to quantify and decompose the effects of climate variability and anthropogenic activity. The abrupt breakpoints in the streamflow and precipitation data were detected in 1997 and 1995. Considering these breakpoints, we divided the time series into two periods: the baseline period and the post-baseline period. Climate elasticity approaches were used to quantify the effects of climate variability and anthropogenic activity during the baseline period, post-baseline period, and future periods (2031-2060 and 2071-2100) under the Representative Concentration Pathways' 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The results revealed that climate variability was the leading cause of alteration in the streamflow in the BHR and NHR, accounting for 76.52% to 80.51% of the total change, respectively. Meanwhile, the LHR remained more sensitive to anthropogenic activity, which accounted for 56.42% of the total variation in streamflow. Future climate change also showed an increase in precipitation and temperature in both scenarios, especially during the far-future period (2071-2100). This variation in the climatic factor was shown to affect the future streamflow by 22.14% to 27.32%. These findings can play a very important role in future planning for large river basins, considering the impacts of increasing anthropogenic activity and climate change to reduce the risks of hydrological hazards.

J	Jeffers, JM				Jeffers, James M.			Saving Cork City? Place attachment and conflicting framings of flood hazards	GEOFORUM			English	Article						Flood risk; Adaptation; Framing; Place attachment; Sense of place; Flooding	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION POLICY; RISK-MANAGEMENT; IRELAND; SENSE; DIVERGENCE; PERCEPTION; KNOWLEDGE	Conflicts in flood hazards decision-making and policy have important implications for both disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. This study uses a frame analysis to examine the disputed Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme in Cork, Ireland. This analysis reveals a multi-party and multi-perspective dispute that is more complex than the two sided conflict it may appear to be at first glance. However despite this diversity of views, many of the stakeholders involved share similar assumptions about flood risk and its management, reflecting the role of a dominant discourse in setting the boundaries of debate. Place attachment emerges as a key cross cutting theme, of importance to both opponents and proponents of the proposed scheme. Place attachment can act as either a barrier to transformative adaptation or as a motivator for action. While highlighting areas of disagreement between local stakeholders, conflicts such as the Cork dispute can also represent new opportunities to engage wider constituencies with hazards management and to bring new perspectives into the decision-making process. The emergence of place attachment as a cross cutting theme illustrates that using place as a boundary concept around which to centre the decision-making process may allow for the testing of new approaches to hazards management and climate change adaptation. These would incorporate both a wider range of stakeholders including those not directly impacted by hazards, and a broader range of issues, situating hazards management within a wider context.

This study first revised the reservoir operation scheme in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to improve its description of actual operation laws of reservoirs in the upper Yangtze River basin (UYRB). Then, we identified the reservoir-induced hydrological alteration through a hydrological index method driven by observed and simulated daily streamflow from 1960 to 2017. The results revealed the superiority of the revised reservoir algorithm in the SWAT model in simulating streamflow and floods at Cuntan and Yichang stations with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient and the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) coefficient improved from 0.01 to 0.08 and 0.01 to 0.05, respectively. Relative to the baseline period (1960-2002), the hydrological signatures in the impact period (2003-2017) changed substantially after 2003. Reservoirs induced a remarkable increase of 27.76% and 55.97% in streamflow from January to March, accompanied by a notable decrease of 6.95% and 20.92% in streamflow from September to October after 2003 at Cuntan and Yichang stations, respectively. Meanwhile, the annual streamflow range contracted, and the flow became more stable with a reduced variation in daily streamflow, extremely low flow spell duration, and extremely high flow spell duration. Consequently, our results improved the quantitative understanding of reservoir-induced alteration and informed the management and planning of reservoir construction in the UYRB under climate change.

However, institutional responses have had conflicted and complex relations with Indigenous peoples. There is a growing need for meaningful engagement with-and recognition of-the centrality of Indigenous peoples' perceptions and understanding of the changes they are experiencing to inform successful and effective place-based adaptation strategies. To fill this gap, this study focuses on the value-based perspectives and pragmatic decision-making of Shawi Indigenous men in the Peruvian Amazon. We are specifically interested in their perceptions of how their food system is changing, why it is changing, its consequences, and how/whether they are coping with and responding to this change. Our results highlight that Shawi men's agency and conscious envisioning of their future food system intersect with the effects of government policy. Shawi men perceive that the main driver of their food-system changes, i.e., less forest food, is self-driven population growth, leading to emotions of guilt and shame. During our study, they articulated a conscious belief that future generations must transition from forest-based to agricultural foods, emphasising education as central to this transition. Additionally, results suggest that the Peruvian government is indirectly promoting Shawi population growth through policies linking population size to improved service delivery, particularly education. Despite intentional Shawi moves to transition to agriculture, this results in a loss of men's cultural identity and has mental-health implications, creating new vulnerabilities due to increasing climatic extremes, such as flooding and higher temperatures.

As a result of this climate variability in the Sikkim Himalaya, a detailed study of the Gurudongmar lake complex (GLC) evolution and outburst susceptibility assessment is required. Glacial lake volume estimation and lake outburst susceptibility assessment were carried out to reveal different characteristics for all four lakes (GL-1, GL-2, GL-3, and GL-4) from the lake complex. Each of these lakes has a moderate to very high potential to outburst. As the dam of GL-1 provides no retention capacity, there is a very high potential of a combined effect with the sudden failure of the moraine-dams of GL-2 or GL-3 located upstream. Temporal analysis of GLC using optical remote sensing data and in-field investigations revealed a rapidly increasing total lake area by ~74 +/- 3%, with an expansion rate of +0.03 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1) between 1962 and 2018 due to climate change and ongoing glacier retreat. The overall lake area expansion rates are dependent on climate-driven factors, and constantly increasing average air temperature is responsible for the enlargement of the lake areas. Simultaneously, changes in GLC expansion velocity are driven by changes in the total amount of precipitation. The deficit in precipitation probably triggered the initial higher rate from 1962 to 1988 during the winter and spring seasons. The post-1990s positive anomaly in precipitation might have reduced the rate of the glacial lake area expansion considerably.

Eastern Iberian Peninsula coastal areas are well known for high intensity rainfalls known as DANA or "cold drop ". Extreme records in 24 h can exceed the annual average of the historical series. This phenomenon occurs normally in autumn due to convective storms generated by the existence of cold air in the upper layers of the atmosphere combined with warm winds coming from the Mediterranean Sea. In many coastal areas of the Eastern Iberian Peninsula, their flat topography, sometimes of a marsh nature, and the natural (e.g., dune ridges) and man-made (e.g., infrastructures) factors, result in devastating flooding events of great potential damage and risk for urban and rural areas. In this context, this paper presents the case study of the town of Oliva (Valencia, Spain) and how in a flooding event the flow tends to spread and accumulate along the flat coastal strip of this populated area, causing great potential damage. From that point, the paper discusses the particular issues that flood studies should consider in such flat and heavy rainy areas in terms of the hydrological and hydraulic models to be conducted to serve as the key tool of a correct risk assessment. This includes the correct statistical simulation of rainfalls, the hydrological model dependency on the return period and the correct geometry definition of all possible water barriers. An analysis of the disturbance that climatic change effects may introduce in future flooding events is also performed.</p>	[Eguibar, Miguel angel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Hydraul Engn & Environm, Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Porta-Garcia, Raimon] Interamer Dev Bank IADB, Rural Dev & Disaster Risk Management RND, Div Environm, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Sect CSD, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Torrijo, Francisco Javier] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Ctr PEGASO, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Torrijo, Francisco Javier] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Geol & Geotech Engn, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Garzon-Roca, Julio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Geol, Dept Geodynam GEODESPAL, Madrid 28040, Spain	Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Inter-American Development Bank; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Complutense University of Madrid	Eguibar, MA (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Hydraul Engn & Environm, Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia 46022, Spain.	meguibar@hma.upv.es; raimonpo@iadb.org; fratorec@trr.upv.es; julgarzo@ucm.es	Garzon-Roca, Julio/AAY-4749-2021; Torrijo, F.J./R-5184-2018	Garzon-Roca, Julio/0000-0003-4512-7067; Torrijo, F.J./0000-0001-6048-6792; Eguibar Galan, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-3404-2781					61	5	5	1	3	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4441		WATER-SUI	Water	NOV	2021	13	21							2975	10.3390/w13212975	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13212975			24	Environmental Sciences; Water Resources	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources	WX3FD		gold, Green Published			2024-04-22	WOS:000718485100001

To figure out such latent hydrological impacts of changing climate, more reliable hydrological simulations are imperative. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of climate change on hydrological regime in the Upper Yangtze River Basin based on four downscaled and bias-corrected Global Climate Model outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) driving three hydrological models. Two model evaluation approaches were applied: simple and comprehensive. The comprehensive approach was used to evaluate models in the historical period, optimizing objective function at four gauges, and hydrological models were weighted for impact assessment based on their performance. In such a way, projected streamflow time series are obtained under different emission scenarios. Results show that the annual average discharge is projected to increase by 4.1-10.5% under the RCP scenarios at the end of twenty-first century relative to the reference period (1970-1999). Moreover, the high flow is projected to increase and the low flow to decrease indicating a higher probability of flood and drought occurrence in the basin. The severity of floods and droughts may increase. In comparison with the simple one-site model evaluation approach, the comprehensive method reveals that the anticipated extreme flow events would be less severe, and annual mean discharge slightly lower. The projected results imply that application of the comprehensive model evaluation approach could narrow the simulated spreads of projections significantly, and might provide more credible results.

J	Sun, J; Li, YP; Wu, JS; Zhang, HY				Sun, Jie; Li, Yongping; Wu, Jiansen; Zhang, Hongyu			An Ensemble Climate-Hydrology Modeling System for Long-Term Streamflow Assessment in a Cold-Arid Watershed	WATER			English	Article						climate change; Kaidu watershed; SLURP; stepwise cluster; streamflow	KAIDU RIVER-BASIN; STEPWISE CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; CHANGE IMPACTS; RUNOFF; PREDICTION; REGION	Climate change can bring about substantial alternatives of temperature and precipitation in the spatial and temporal patterns. These alternatives would impact the hydrological cycle and cause flood or drought events. This study has developed an ensemble climate-hydrology modeling system (ECHMS) for long-term streamflow assessment under changing climate. ECHMS consists of multiple climate scenarios (two global climate models (GCMs) and four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) emission scenarios), a stepwise-cluster downscaling method and semi-distributed land use-based runoff process (SLURP) model. ECHMS is able to reflect the uncertainties in climate scenarios, tackle the complex relationships (e.g., nonlinear/linear, discrete/continuous) between climate predictors and predictions without functional assumption, and capture the combination of snowmelt- and rainfall-runoff process with a simplicity of operation. Then, the developed ECHMS is applied to Kaidu watershed for analyzing the changes of streamflow during the 21st century. Results show that by 2099, the temperature increment in Kaidu watershed is mainly contributed by the warming in winter and spring. The precipitation will increase obviously in spring and autumn and decrease in winter. Multi-year average streamflow would range from 105.6 to 113.8 m(3)/s across all scenarios during the 21st century with an overall increasing trend. The maximum average increasing rate is 2.43 m(3)/s per decade in October and the minimum is 0.26 m(3)/s per decade in January. Streamflow change in spring is more sensitive to climate change due to its complex runoff generation process. The obtained results can effectively identify future streamflow changing trends and help manage water resources for decision makers.

These effects mainly hit agricultural livelihood and livestock ending up in poverty. These irreversible damages are associated with high magnitude and frequency of floods, which are common in the South Asian countries. Similarly, Pakistan was hit hard by 2010 floods which were biggest in history as affecting over 20 million people and causing loss of over US$ 10.85 billion. The devastations were extended to rural poor communities of north-western part of Malakand division in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, which were studied in this research on deploying 500 questionnaires at household level. It was to evaluate the extend of damages to livelihood and economic status of locality. Furthermore, this study tried to analyse the rise in poverty level, compared to the situation before inundating event of 2010. The results of cross-tabulation and logistic regressions confirmed that 1% increase in floods led to 0.44%, 0.31% decrease in livelihood and economic status, respectively. It was also found 1% increase in flooding ended up in 1.947% increase in the poverty level at household level. Further, the loss of livelihood resulted in the economic losses due to damages to crops and livestock and caused rise in poverty. The poverty syndrome was coupled with loss of savings and borrowing of funds that further ruined the economic situation of the locality. Conclusively, the flooding was declared to have posed adverse impacts on sustainable livelihood provision and rise in poverty in the area as not yet addressed through any institutional/governmental intervention.

Although scholarship on maladaptation highlights the dangers of path dependency, the concept is under-applied for understanding the potential outcomes of development trajectories that result in what we call an adaptation-constrained space. By conducting case-study analysis based on secondary review, we trace implications of particular development trajectories, in urban and rural India. The first case examines how urbanization in Bangalore city has decreased the capacity to respond to concurrent risks of flooding and water scarcity while the second charts how agricultural policies in India have narrowed local capacity to deal with climatic and non-climatic uncertainties. Using a historical perspective, we identify triggers of change in local and regional development, which have led to an adaptation-constrained space. We find that both pathways display irreversible lock-ins and inherent trade-offs which entrench inequities (through differential capacity and agency to access resources and influence future development). We argue that such development pathways are potentially maladaptive. Whether they are expected to deal with climate impacts or to meet development goals, the fact that they constrain current and future adaptive capacity at multiple levels, is why we consider them maladaptive. As India undertakes large investments in development and climate change adaptation, this paper adds to the relatively low policy debate on how development trajectories, physically and socially, limit the possibilities for future adaptation. We propose that policy-makers and planners first acknowledge how development trajectories acquire dominance, and then begin empowering normative alternatives that open future adaptation options.

All parts of the world are affected directly or indirectly by this phenomenon. The rivers are drying up in some places and in other places, it is flooding. The global temperature is rising every year and the heat waves are taking many souls. The cloud of "extinction" is upon the majority of flora and fauna; even humans are prone to various fatal and life-shortening diseases from pollution. This is all caused by us. The so-called "development" by deforestation, releasing toxic chemicals into air and water, burning of fossil fuels in the name of industrialisation, and many others have made an irreversible cut in the heart of the environment. However, it is not too late; all of this could be healed back with the help of technology and our efforts together. As per the international climate reports, the average global temperature has increased by a little more than 1 & DEG;C since 1880s. The research is primarily focused on the use of machine learning and its algorithm to train a model that predicts the ice meltdown of a glacier, given the features using the Multivariate Linear Regression. The research strongly encourages the use of features by manipulating them to determine the feature with a major impact on the cause. The burning of coal and fossil fuels is the main source of pollution as per the study. The research focuses on the challenges to gather data that would be faced by the researchers and the requirement of the system for the development of the model. The study is aimed to spread awareness in society about the destruction we have caused and urges everyone to come forward and save the planet.

The resulting floods and landslides led to the loss of at least five lives, cut Vancouver off entirely from the rest of Canada by road and rail, and made this the costliest natural disaster in the province's history. Here we show that when characterised in terms of storm-averaged water vapour transport, the variable typically used to characterise the intensity of atmospheric rivers, westerly atmospheric river events of this magnitude are approximately one in ten year events in the current climate of this region, and that such events have been made at least 60% more likely by the effects of human-induced climate change. Characterised in terms of the associated two-day precipitation, the event is substantially more extreme, approximately a one in fifty to one in a hundred year event, and the probability of events at least this large has been increased by a best estimate of 45% by human-induced climate change. The effects of this precipitation on streamflow were exacerbated by already wet conditions preceding the event, and by rising temperatures during the event that led to significant snowmelt, which led to streamflow maxima exceeding estimated one in a hundred year events in several basins in the region. Based on a large ensemble of simulations with a hydrological model which integrates the effects of multiple climatic drivers, we find that the probability of such extreme streamflow events in October to December has been increased by human-induced climate change by a best estimate of 120-330%. Together these results demonstrate the substantial human influence on this compound extreme event, and help motivate efforts to increase resiliency in the face of more frequent events of this kind in the future.

Robust decision-making on adaptation in the coastal zone, based on reliable ocean-modelling tools, is therefore crucially contingent on accurate assessments of current and future storm surge hazards. This accuracy relies considerably on the quality of the wind forcing used in the ocean models. In this paper, we use a high-resolution, regional 3D ocean model (HBM) covering the North Sea and Baltic Sea to simulate extreme water levels during three extreme storm surge events with different dynamics and patterns, in order to assess their impacts along Denmark's coastlines, which are of varying levels of complexity. We demonstrate that the model is able to reproduce the observed extreme high-water levels accurately, indicating that the system is well suited for producing simulations of present and future projections of extreme storm surges with high resulting impacts and damage potentials. Additionally, we quantify the level at which acknowledged deficiencies in the otherwise most suitable atmospheric forcing data set influence the results of the storm surge simulations. We found that reducing the temporal resolution of the forcing data - that is, replacing two out of every six time stamps with linearly interpolated values - is preferable to using the original forcing data set when recurring noise is present in these time stamps. As a result, for given storm surge events, and depending on the stage reached in the storm's evolution, mean absolute errors can be reduced by 4.5 cm. This emphasizes the importance of considering such model fluctuations when coupling high-resolution atmosphere and ocean models.

Differential Mental Health Impact Six Months After Extensive River Flooding in Rural Australia: A Cross-Sectional Analysis Through an Equity Lens	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						natural disasters; mental health; inequality; indigenous populations; low income populations	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANXIETY DISORDERS; COMMUNITIES; DEPRESSION; DISASTER	Background: Northern New South Wales in Australia is a "hotspot" for natural disaster declarations with recent extensive flooding in early 2017. With limited knowledge about how climate change affects mental health and resilience, robust local assessments are required to better understand long-term impact, particularly in communities prone to extreme weather events. Methods: Six months post-flood, a cross-sectional survey of adults living in the region during the flood was conducted to quantify associations between flood impact and psychological morbidity (post-traumatic stress (PTSD), anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation) for different exposure scenarios, and respondent groups. We adopted a community-academic partnership approach and purposive recruitment to increase participation from marginalized groups. Results: Of 2,180 respondents, almost all (91%) were affected by some degree of flood-related exposure at an individual and community level (ranging from suburb damage to home or business inundated). Socio-economically marginalized respondents were more likely to have their homes inundated and to be displaced. Mental health risk was significantly elevated for respondents: whose home/business/farm was inundated [e.g., home inundation: PTSD adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 13.72 (99% CI 4.53-41.56)]; who reported multiple exposures [e.g., three exposures: PTSD AOR 6.43 (99% CI 2.11-19.60)]; and who were still displaced after 6 months [e.g., PTSD AOR 24.43 (99% CI 7.05-84.69)]. Conclusion: The 2017 flood had profound impact, particularly for respondents still displaced and for socio-economically marginalized groups. Our community-academic partnership approach builds community cohesion, informs targeted mental health disaster preparedness and response policies for different sectors of the community and longer-term interventions aimed at improving community adaptability to climate change.

The Chesapeake Bay (CB) region of the United States is experiencing one of the fastest rates of relative sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of the United States. This study uses a combination of space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) data sets, available National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) long-term tide gauge data, and SLR projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), AR6 WG1 to quantify the regional rate of relative SLR and future flooding hazards for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100. By the year 2100, the total inundated areas from SLR and subsidence are projected to be 454(316-549)-600(535-690) km(2) for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1-1.9 to 5-8.5, respectively, and 342(132-552)-627(526-735).... km(2) only from SLR. The effect of storm surges based on Hurricane Isabel can increase the inundated area to 849(832-867)-1,117(1,054-1,205) km(2) under different VLM and SLR scenarios. We suggest that accurate estimates of VLM rate, such as those obtained here, are essential to revise IPCC projections and obtain accurate maps of coastal flooding and inundation hazards. The results provided here inform policymakers when assessing hazards associated with global climate changes and local factors in CB, required for developing risk management and disaster resilience plans. Plain Language Summary The Chesapeake Bay (CB) region of the United States is experiencing one of the fastest rates of relative sea-level rise on the Atlantic coast of the United States. However, future projections of sea-level rise (SLR) used to assess coastal flooding hazards and exposure throughout the 21st century often lack an accurate estimate of changes in land elevation. This poses a significant challenge to present and future management efforts because vertical land motion (VLM) can cause underestimation/ overestimation of flooding risk to coastal communities. This work combines satellite data and in situ observations to measure VLM and assess 21st-century flooding hazards due to SLR, hurricane effect, and land elevation change in the CB. By the year 2100, the total inundated areas from SLR and subsidence are projected to be 454-600 km(2) for very low to very high greenhouse gas scenarios. The effect of storm surges associated with Hurricane Isabel can increase the inundated area to 849-1,117 km(2) under different SLR scenarios and VLM. The results provided here inform policymakers when assessing hazards associated with global climate changes and local factors.

Previous studies note that saltwater intrusion is a serious concern, and the intensity of saltwater intrusion is primarily driven by sea level rise, land subsidence, anthropogenic sediment starvation, and upstream hydro-infrastructure developments. However, these studies often rely on scenario-based approaches instead of an integrated approach to assess the possible impacts of saltwater intrusion. Using an integrated hydrodynamic-statistical-economic model, we investigate how and the extent to which these drivers may impact the saltwater intrusion. We also examine the costs and returns of two popular saltwater intrusion control policies, i.e., hard-engineering structural and soft-land use planning. When comparing the baseline scenarios, the findings indicate that anthropogenic forces lead to a four times greater saltwater intrusion intensity than the climate change-induced sea level rise. The results further reveal a 50 % or less chance that annual saltwater-affected areas would exceed 1.93 million ha for the baseline, but the likelihood is highly likely to be 100 % with a sea level rising of 22 cm. Under the combined effects of sea-level rise, land subsidence, and riverbed incision, our model shows that the probability of annual saltwater-affected areas staying above 2.30 million ha is almost equal to one. This finding implies that a large share of the current rice-planted areas of the Delta could be wiped out of production for at least one season a year. The findings show that a combination of hard and soft policies would be a more sustainable and cost-effective strategy to lower the intensity and risks of saltwater intrusion. Therefore, there is an urgent need for better coordination of governance and investments among regions within the Delta and counties in the whole Mekong River Basin.

Accelerating environmental flow implementation to bend the curve of global freshwater biodiversity loss	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS			English	Review; Early Access						environmental flows; implementation; critical enabling factors	RIVER SYSTEMS; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; ECOSYSTEMS; IMPACTS; SCIENCE	Environmental flows (e-flows) aim to mitigate the threat of altered hydrological regimes in river systems and connected waterbodies and are an important component of integrated strategies to address multiple threats to freshwater biodiversity. Expanding and accelerating implementation of e-flows can support river conservation and help to restore the biodiversity and resilience of hydrologically altered and water-stressed rivers and connected freshwater ecosystems. While there have been significant developments in e-flow science, assessment, and societal acceptance, implementation of e-flows within water resource management has been slower than required and geographically uneven. This review explores critical factors that enable successful e-flow implementation and biodiversity outcomes in particular, drawing on 13 case studies and the litera-ture. It presents e-flow implementation as an adaptive management cycle enabled by 10 factors: legislation and governance, financial and human resourcing, stakeholder engagement and co-production of knowledge, collaborative monitoring of eco-logical and social-economic outcomes, capacity training and research, exploration of trade-offs among water users, removing or retrofitting water infrastructure to facilitate e-flows and connectivity, and adaptation to climate change. Recognising that there may be barriers and limitations to the full and effective enablement of each factor, the authors have identified corre-sponding options and generalizable recommendations for actions to overcome prominent constraints, drawing on the case studies and wider literature. The urgency of addressing flow-related freshwater biodiversity loss demands collaborative net-works to train and empower a new generation of e-flow practitioners equipped with the latest tools and insights to lead adaptive environmental water management globally. Mainstreaming e-flows within conservation planning, integrated water resource management, river restoration strategies, and adaptations to climate change is imperative. The policy drivers and associated funding commitments of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework offer crucial opportunities to achieve the human benefits contributed by e-flows as nature-based solutions, such as flood risk management, floodplain fisheries restoration, and increased river resilience to climate change.

Advancing operational flood forecasting, early warning and risk management with new emerging science: Gaps, opportunities and barriers in Kenya	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						early warning; flood; forecast-based action; forecasting; impact based forecasting; inundation; Kenya	HEAVY RAINFALL; AFRICA; HAZARD; SYSTEMS; GLOFAS	Kenya and the wider East African region suffer from significant flood risk, as illustrated by major losses of lives, livelihoods and assets in the most recent years. This is likely to increase in future as exposure rises and rainfall intensifies under climate change. Accordingly, flood risk management is a priority action area in Kenya's national climate change adaptation planning. Here, we outline the opportunities and challenges to improve end-to-end flood early warning systems, considering the scientific, technical and institutional/governance dimensions. We demonstrate improvements in rainfall forecasts, river flow, inundation and baseline flood risk information. Notably, East Africa is a 'sweetspot' for rainfall predictability at sub-seasonal to seasonal timescales for extending forecast lead times beyond a few days and for ensemble flood forecasting. Further, we demonstrate coupled ensemble flow forecasting, new flood inundation simulation, vulnerability and exposure data to support Impact based Forecasting (IbF). We illustrate these advances in the case of fluvial and urban flooding and reflect on the potential for improved flood preparedness action. However, we note that, unlike for drought, there remains no national flood risk management framework in Kenya and there is need to enhance institutional capacities and arrangements to take full advantage of these scientific advances.

J	Eggert, AL; Löwe, R; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, K				Eggert, Anna Lea; Lowe, Roland; Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Karsten			Identifying barriers and potentials of integrated assessments of sustainable urban development and adaptation to rising sea levels	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Review						Sustainable urban development; Coastal adaptation; Indicators; Sustainable adaptation; Urban systems; Flood Vulnerability	FLOOD VULNERABILITY INDEX; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDICATORS; RESILIENCE; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; POLITICS; LESSONS; SCIENCE; AREAS	Current adaptation responses to sea-level rise tend to focus on protecting existing infrastructure resulting in unsustainable adaptation pathways. At the same time, urban development compromises a city's adaptive ca-pacity if the climate risk component is ignored. While fighting for the same space, these two domains are currently widely analyzed separately. This paper develops a framework for integrating sustainability assessments of sustainable urban development (SUD) and coastal adaptation to climate change (CACC). Through a systematic literature review, we collected more than 2,700 indicators for SUD and 1,800 indicators for CACC. The indicators occurring most frequently are extracted and structured into frameworks. The study highlights the differences and similarities between the two frameworks. We further identify complementary and conflicting objectives that can advance or inhibit the effective integration of SUD and CACC. CACC tends to focus on assessing specific adap-tation measures and their immediate impact on the city's vulnerability, ignoring wider impacts on socioeconomic systems. SUD considers the city and its functions as a whole but ignores vulnerability assessments across urban subsystems. We develop a combined framework for sustainability assessment that may serve as a basis for both qualitative and quantitative integrated studies under the paradigm of sustainable adaptation.

Accordingly, researchers are interested in exploring the nexus between GHG emissions and economic growth. This research study is motivated to explore the moderation of transportation competitiveness for economic growth and carbon emissions of transport sector in global perspective. The annual time series data for study variables are used for time period from 2008 to 2018 for 121 countries. The panel quantile regression (PQR) estimation technique is used for analysis of results. The study results validated inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for quantile group-1 and 2, while U-shaped EKC was validated for quantile group-3 and 4. The moderation of transport competitiveness significantly tends to achieve environmental sustainability for economic growth and carbon emissions of transport sector for quantile group-1 and 2. However, the moderation of transport competitiveness increases carbon emissions of transport sector in quantile group-4. The study results implicated that process of economic growth resulted in expansion of transport sector in quantile group-3 and 4 beyond sustainable level. The various policy recommendations are advocated to improve the quality of transport sector to mitigate carbon emissions.

However, land-use changes and extreme events are increasingly impacting these processes. In this Review, we describe SHP across scales and examine their links with soil properties, ecosystem processes and climate. Soil structure influences SHP such as infiltration, soil water redistribution and root water uptake on small scales. On local scales, SHP are driven by root water uptake, vegetation and groundwater dynamics. Regionally, SHP are impacted by extreme events such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and land-use change; however, antecedent and current SHP partially determine the broader effects of extreme events. Emerging technologies such as wireless and automated sensing, soil moisture observation through novel synthetic aperture radars satellites, big data analysis and machine learning approaches offer unique opportunities to advance soil hydrology. These advances, in tandem with the inclusion of more key soil types and properties in models, will be pivotal in predicting the role of SHP during global change. Soil hydrology impacts ecosystem functioning and is being altered by global change and anthropogenic activities. This Review discusses the drivers of soil hydrological processes, their feedbacks within the broader Earth and the emerging tools illuminating these linkages.

For now, only large-scale climate impact studies cover Ukraine territory, having low credibility for a specific catchment. This study aims to calculate future changes in river discharge, water flow components, and soil water within the Desna basin and evaluate vulnerability trends on this basis. The framework assembles the process-based SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model and eight high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) driven by RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The climate models are provided by the Euro-CORDEX initiative and based on three RCMs (RCA4, HIRHAM5, and RACMO22E) forced by five general circulation models (CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, IPSL-CM5A-MR, HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-LR). The results preferably show a moderate increase in the annual discharge till the end of the 21st century. The intra-annual changes of water balance components negatively affect the vegetation period because of higher dryness and temperature stress but reduce flood risk, diffuse pollution, and water erosion in the far future. In the river basin management plan, the highest attention should be paid to adaptive strategies in agriculture because of possible water deficit in the vegetation season under future climate scenarios.

The changing impacts were assessed using a large-ensemble rainfall dataset with a high resolution of 5 km (d4PDF) as input data for the rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model. Additionally, the prediction of time differences between the peak discharge in the Chitose River and peak water levels at the confluence point intersecting the Ishikari River were improved compared to the previous study. Results indicate that due to climatic changes, extreme river floods are expected to increase by 21-24% in the Ishikari River basin (IRB), while flood inundation is expected to be severe and higher in the CRB, with increases of 24.5, 46.5, and 13.8% for the inundation area, inundation volume, and peak inundation depth, respectively. Flood inundation is likely to occur in the CRB downstream area with a frequency of 90-100%. Additionally, the inundation duration is expected to increase by 5-10 h here. Moreover, the short time difference (0-10 h) is predicted to increase significantly in the CRB. This study provides useful information for policymakers to mitigate flood damage in vulnerable areas.

Beaver dam capacity of Canada's boreal plain in response to environmental change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CASTOR-CANADENSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATIONAL-PARK; HABITAT; DISTURBANCE; WETLANDS; STREAMS; WATER; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS	Environmental changes are altering the water cycle of Canada's boreal plain. Beaver dams are well known for increasing water storage and slowing flow through stream networks. For these reasons beavers are increasingly being included in climate change adaptation strategies. But, little work focuses on how environmental changes will affect dam building capacity along stream networks. Here we estimate the capacity of the stream network in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada to support beaver dams under changing environmental conditions using a modelling approach. We show that at capacity, the park's stream network can support 24,690 beaver dams and hold between 8.2 and 12.8 million m(3) of water in beaver ponds. Between 1991 and 2016 the park's vegetation composition shifted to less preferred beaver forage, which led to a 13% decrease in maximum dam capacity. We also found that dam capacity is sensitive to the size of regularly-occurring floods-doubling the 2-year flood reduces the park's dam capacity by 21%. The results show that the potential for beaver to offset some expected climatic-induced changes to the boreal water cycle is more complex than previously thought, as there is a feedback wherein dam capacity can be reduced by changing environmental conditions.

This study documents key findings from a large-scale survey of levels of concern and experience with significant losses of over 3300 aquaculture farmers in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Important climate-related risks included rapid changes in temperature, intense rainfall events, and floods. Farmers in Laos were less concerned with risks to profits than those in other countries. Farmers who had experienced significant losses from any climate-related source were more concerned with risks. Women and higher educated farmers perceived higher risks. Those with intensified production systems perceived lower risks and observed fewer climate changes. Perceptions of historical changes in risks and expectations for future risks were often strongly associated with each other and levels of concern, as well as experiences of losses, underlining that risk perception has multiple, inter-related dimensions. Geographical differences in risk perception were related to differences in both physical climate and social factors.

Despite extensive research on flood adaptation, there is a lack of consensus on ways to assess flood adaptive capacity. This research thus proposes an assessment framework of flood adaptive capacity of urban residents in flood-prone areas. The indicators are based on six components: economic resources, social capital, awareness and training, technology, infrastructure, and institutions and policies. The relevancy of the indicators was evaluated by experts in related fields, and a questionnaire was developed to collect data from a random sample of 230 households in 10 flood-prone municipalities in Thailand. Statistical analysis and structural equation modeling were subsequently performed to validate the components and indicators, and a flood-adaptability questionnaire was constructed. As a trial implementation, the questionnaire was applied to a target flood-prone municipality, Phetchaburi, to assess its adaptive capacity to flooding, expressed as flood adaptive capacity index. The adaptive capacity of Phetchaburi municipality to flooding was found to be high indicating the improvement in economic resources and infrastructure components. These findings reveal that the proposed framework is suitable for assessing the flood adaptive capacity of urban residents and useful for integrated flood risk assessment and management.

Scientific debates over global catastrophic flooding and the Earth's geologic age were resolved by the mid-nineteenth century, but subsequent nonscientific debates about the Earth's age and biological evolution spawned a distrust of science that hardened in the twentieth century. Disregard for science grew in the United States with abandonment of science-based policy by government and manipulation of public opinion by social media. Consequently, climate change denial was readily accepted by a preconditioned antiscience culture. Expansion of antiscience sentiment led to rejection of conventional news outlets and information verification in a "post-truth" era in which alternate realities are acceptable despite clear contradictions with observable facts. Critical reasoning and vetting of information are in decline, which leaves democracy vulnerable to manipulation. Reliable information is available but obscured by disinformation. Public scrutiny of information and demand for fact checking and reporting of sources are essential given growth of alternative media that have no checks on the verity of content. Academics should get involved in popular media to counter propaganda and to reconstruct a culture of critical reasoning by voters and science-based decisions by policymakers.	[James, L.

A reality check for the applicability of comprehensive climate risk assessment and management: Experiences from Peru, India and Austria	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate-related risk; Climate risk management; Case study; Adaptation; Transformation; Losses and damages	TRANSFORMATIONAL ADAPTATION; LIMITS; VULNERABILITY; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES	Climate-related risks are a major threat to humanity, affecting the lives and livelihoods of communities globally. Even with adaptation, climate change is projected to increase the severity of risks, leading to impacts and residual risks, also termed losses and damages. Frameworks and approaches using Climate Risk Management (CRM), an integration of Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change Adaptation, and sustainable development, are being devised to support the comprehensive management of increasing climate-related risks. Here we discuss to what extent comprehensive CRM has been implemented in three specific cases - in Peru, India and Austria. The approach is conceptually represented and evaluated using a CRM framework. The cases deal with risks associated with glacial lake outburst floods, sea level rise, tropical cyclones, salinization, riverine floods and agricultural droughts. Ultimately, we synthesise policy and research recommendations to help understand what is feasible for CRM approaches applied in practice. We find that successful CRM implementation in practice benefits from being flexible, and participatory from beginning to end, whilst considering compounding risks, and the spectrum of (just and equitable) incremental to transformational adaptation measures necessary for attending to current and projected future increases in climate-related risks.

Significant efforts have been performed to maintain the actual yield of crops, using traditional breeding and innovative molecular techniques to assist them. However, additional strategies are necessary to achieve the future food demand. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) technology, as well as its variants, have emerged as alternatives to transgenic plant breeding. This novelty has helped to accelerate the necessary modifications in major crops to confront the impact of abiotic stress on agriculture systems. This review summarizes the current advances in CRISPR/Cas applications in crops to deal with the main hostile soil conditions, such as drought, flooding and waterlogging, salinity, heavy metals, and nutrient deficiencies. In addition, the potential of extremophytes as a reservoir of new molecular mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerance, as well as their orthologue identification and edition in crops, is shown. Moreover, the future challenges and prospects related to CRISPR/Cas technology issues, legal regulations, and customer acceptance will be discussed.

In this Review, we summarize landscape changes in cold environments and provide a global inventory of increases in erosion and sediment yield driven by cryosphere degradation. Anthropogenic climate change, deglaciation, and thermokarst disturbances are causing increased sediment mobilization and transport processes in glacierized and periglacierized basins. With continuous cryosphere degradation, sediment transport will continue to increase until reaching a maximum (peak sediment). Thereafter, transport is likely to shift from a temperature-dependent regime toward a rainfall-dependent regime roughly between 2100-2200. The timing of the regime shift would be regulated by changes in meltwater, erosive rainfall and landscape erodibility, and complicated by geomorphic feedbacks and connectivity. Further progress in integrating multisource sediment observations, developing physics-based sediment-transport models, and enhancing interdisciplinary and international scientific collaboration is needed to predict sediment dynamics in a warming world. Anthropogenic warming is causing cryosphere degradation, which is increasing erosion and sediment transport. This Review describes changes in sediment fluxes and explains how peak sediment will be reached as a result of deglaciation and permafrost thaw.

In this study, the effects of climate change on the hydrological drought characteristics of the Gharasu basin, as one of the major sub-basins of the Karkheh river basin, are investigated. This river basin has experienced severe droughts, and floods, in recent years. The uncertainties in projected drought conditions are characterized based on a suite of 34 general circulation models (GCMs). Based on hydrological simulations over the historical period, 12 GCMs are selected to estimate projected runoff values and the corresponding streamflow drought index (SDI) in the future period. The 'run theory' is applied to evaluate the drought characteristics under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios. Results show that uncertainties of drought projection under RCP8.5 are higher than under RCP4.5, where among different drought characteristics, the maximum uncertainty is detected for drought severity and maximum drought duration. Moreover, the uncertainty of drought projection in wet periods is greater than that in dry periods.	[Ashrafi, S.

Underwaterwriting: from theory to empiricism in regional mortgage markets in the U.S<i>.</i>	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Climate adaptation; Sea level rise; Climate-risk; Mortgage market; Banking; Housing	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INVESTMENT	This article provides the theoretical foundation for the concept of "Underwaterwriting," which can be understood as various informational and institutional limitations related to environmental exposure and climate change impacts-specifically flooding and sea level rise inundation-shaping firm participation in mortgage markets. Underwaterwriting suggests that the unevenness of scientific knowledge and local soft information, as well as the institutional barriers for the utilization of that information, could result in determinations of risk that may not accurately reflect long-term asset performance or credit loss. These informational asymmetries may result in assignments of risk that reflect a degree of arbitrariness or inaccuracy that may operate to strand assets and shed or increase market share in ways that are inefficient and may otherwise lead to negative public externalities. Consistent with this theory, this article provides evidence that concentrated local lenders are transferring risk in high-risk coastal geographies in the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coasts (U.S.) through increased securitization of mortgages. These findings provide an impetus for supporting more robust analysis of climate-risk in light of forthcoming accounting rules that require an upfront accounting of forward-looking credit losses.

J	Savary, S				Savary, Serge		Global Plant Hlth Assessment Proje	A Global Assessment of the State of Plant Health	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article						biodiversity; climate change; food security; global population; plant diseases; sustainability	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HUMAN APPROPRIATION; FOOD SECURITY; CROP LOSSES; DISEASES; PATHOGENS; THREAT; RUST; FEED; POPULATION	The Global Plant Health Assessment (GPHA) is a collective, volunteer-based effort to assemble expert opinions on plant health and disease impacts on ecosystem services based on published scientific evidence. The GPHA considers a range of forest, agricultural, and urban systems worldwide. These are referred to as (Ecoregion x Plant System), i.e., selected case examples involving keystone plants in given parts of the world. The GPHA focuses on infectious plant diseases and plant pathogens, but encompasses the abiotic (e.g., temperature, drought, and floods) and other biotic (e.g., animal pests and humans) factors associated with plant health. Among the 33 (Ecoregion x Plant System) considered, 18 are assessed as in fair or poor health, and 20 as in declining health. Much of the observed state of plant health and its trends are driven by a combination of forces, including climate change, species invasions, and human management. Healthy plants ensure (i) provisioning (food, fiber, and material), (ii) regulation (climate, atmosphere, water, and soils), and (iii) cultural (recreation, inspiration, and spiritual) ecosystem services. All these roles that plants play are threatened by plant diseases. Nearly none of these three ecosystem services are assessed as improving. Results indicate that the poor state of plant health in sub-Saharan Africa gravely contributes to food insecurity and environmental degradation. Results further call for the need to improve crop health to ensure food security in the most populated parts of the world, such as in South Asia, where the poorest of the poor, the landless farmers, are at the greatest risk. The overview of results generated from this work identifies directions for future research to be championed by a new generation of scientists and revived public extension services. Breakthroughs from science are needed to (i) gather more data on plant health and its consequences, (ii) identify collective actions to manage plant systems, (iii) exploit the phytobiome diversity in breeding programs, (iv) breed for plant genotypes with resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses, and (v) design and implement plant systems involving the diversity required to ensure their adaptation to current and growing challenges, including climate change and pathogen invasions.

However, deep-water hyperpycnites can hardly be differentiated from intrabasinal turbidites since their control factors are not well understood. More detailed studies are needed to improve the knowledge of hyperpycnites. This study aims to identify and characterize hyperpycnites in the Shenhu slope and investigate their evolution in response to sea-level and climate changes using sediment gravity cores, combined with detailed grain size analysis, X-ray fluorescence scanning, X-ray computed tomography scanning, radiocarbon dating, and microscopic observations. Hyperpycnites and internal wave redistributed deposits were identified in core S19 since 42 cal ka BP. Internal wave redistributed deposits served as background deposit and dominated in the middle-late Holocene, while hyperpycnites dominated the Marine Isotope Stage 3 sequence form the early Holo-cene. The hyperpycnites facies S3 interbedded with S2L occurred during Marine Isotope Stage 3, facies L appeared in Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) strata, while facies S2L dominated the strata after LGM to the early Holocene. The facies distribution suggested that the strength and distribution of hyperpycnal flow were higher in warm and humid stages with low sea-level. Lower flood flows discharge in cold and dry stages limited the generation and extensional distance of hyperpycnal flows, although the sea-level was low in this stage. However, high sea-level combined with longshore and Surface waters in warm and humid stages, prevented the travel of hyperpycnal flows into deep basin. The study of hyperpycnites in the Shenhu slope reveals that the formation of deep-water hyperpycnites is influenced by a combination of factors, including sea-level fluctuations, climate change, and oceanographic processes. The amount of precipitation in the drainage basin determines the intensity and generation of hyperpycnal flows, while sea-level fluctuations affect their travel distance to the deep-water setting. Additionally, oceanographic processes such as longshore current can significantly alter hyperpycnal flows near the river mouth and shelf area, preventing them from reaching the deep basin. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Connelly, A; Snow, A; Carter, J; Lauwerijssen, R				Connelly, Angela; Snow, Andrew; Carter, Jeremy; Lauwerijssen, Rachel			What approaches exist to evaluate the effectiveness of UK-relevant natural flood management measures? A systematic map protocol	ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE			English	Article						Natural-based solutions; Effectiveness assessment; Flood risk; Climate change		Background Natural flood management (NFM) measures seek to protect, enhance, emulate, or restore the natural function of rivers as part of approaches to flood risk management (FRM). While there is agreement in both academic and practice/policy literature that NFM, in a general sense, should be part of a holistic FRM strategy to address current and future flood risk, the specifics of how to consistently implement NFM successfully in practice are less well known. This is particularly acute for practitioners in the UK given the nature of the UK's biophysical and socio-political context. There is a recognition that existing reviews of NFM effectiveness in the UK tend to focus on the natural science basis and it is unclear how studies account for climate change. Further, reviews tend to focus only on UK studies. This systematic map aims to highlight the way in which existing NFM studies, from different disciplinary backgrounds and across Europe, evaluate effectiveness, and the extent to which they account for climate change. This knowledge can help to make recommendations for future areas of research where the multiple issues around understanding effectiveness can be synthesised, and where climate change is systematically taken into account. Methods This systematic map protocol addresses the following question: what approaches exist to evaluate the effectiveness of UK-relevant natural flood management measures? The protocol details the methodology that will be used to conduct a systematic map of the range of peer-reviewed journal papers, policy documents, guidance, and other forms of grey literature which currently exist on NFM to give an overview on the way in which the effectiveness of NFM is conceived. The methods detail the search strategy employed for gathering items across the peer-reviewed academic literature and grey literature. Additionally, the methods outline how the reviewers will approach article screening, and the eligibility criteria to include/exclude articles. The methods section also details the steps taken to ensure consistency across all reviewers, the data coding strategy, and methods for presenting the final systematic map. Together, the methods employed will help to identify current knowledge gaps, and will enable recommendations to be made for future research.

We modeled this regime in the ARC-SWAT hydrological model forced with the latest gridded reanalysis ERA5 Land dataset, bias-corrected against a good quality reference dataset. The performance of the gridded dataset was cross-validated by comparing the model flow simulation against the observed flows. The ERA5 Land overall provided reasonably good estimates. The calibrated model on the daily time scale was able to provide excellent values of the employed statistical measures (NSE, KGE, PBIAS, RMSE and MAE). For a future climate change analysis, climate series was devised using two future projection scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using the best performing GCM (MIROC5_rlilp1) out of five investigated GCMs. The results of the climate change analysis reveal increment in the average temperature up to +3.73 degrees C and +5.62 degrees C for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, while the analysis of precipitation suggests an annual decrease up to -16% and -35% against RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, by the end of century. A future simulated flow analysis showed an increment of +0.25 % and decrease of -6.82% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Further analysis of climate suggests seasonal deflections especially in precipitation and flow regimes. A notable climb in flow quantities was observed during spring season (MAM) in spite of the major reduction in precipitation amounts for that season. This implicitly supports a high rate of glacial/snow melt especially in the spring season during that period. Frequent droughts and floods are also projected by examining flow durations at each interval of the 21st century.

J	Newson, M; Lewin, J; Raven, P				Newson, Malcolm; Lewin, John; Raven, Paul			River science and flood risk management policy in England	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Flood risk management; catchment-based approach; climate change; ecology; floods; hydromorphology; land use planning; natural processes; policy	FREQUENCY; RESTORATION; INFORMATION; MAINTENANCE; OUSE	We review the role of science in shaping river flood risk management policy in England, highlighting the relatively recent influence of fluvial geomorphology, river ecology, climate change and ecosystem services in evidence-based decision-making. These disciplines, together with an historical perspective, catchment-scale delivery, integrated land and water management planning, and adaptive management are crucial in managing future flood risk. A central tenet of previous land drainage policy was a professional (and public) mindset about flood 'prevention' solutions for river flooding. As a direct consequence, more than 8,500 km of rivers were 'improved' by mechanical dredging during the 1930s to 1980s; habitats were destroyed, but flooding continued. A more enlightened, long-term approach has since evolved in response to environmental imperatives and lessons learnt from several major floods during the last two 'flood-rich' decades. River science, local knowledge and land management incentives allow more natural processes to be restored in river catchments. The natural capital and ecosystem service benefits of river systems are now better understood and quantified, whereas the importance of sediment transport is fully recognised, with sources and sinks treated more holistically than in the past. Evaluating the outcomes of innovative runoff and river management techniques from both physical and socioeconomic perspectives will determine the success of a catchment-based approach. We highlight some of the uncertainties, nuances and assumptions associated with recent initiatives such as Natural Flood Management, Citizen Science and Flood Action Groups. Further integration between policy, strategic planning and local delivery is needed to anticipate and respond to climate and catchment land use changes. River science will play a crucial part in identifying the most effective way of improving flood management and in a way that helps to deliver the recovery of nature. It will inform adaptive management to cope with climate change.

J	Hemeda, S				Hemeda, Sayed			Geotechnical modelling of the climate change impact on world heritage properties in Alexandria, Egypt	HERITAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						Climate Change; World heritage properties; Catacombs of Kom El-Shoqafa; El-Shatbi Necropolis; Numerical Analysis; Mitigation Strategy	CHALLENGES	Alexandria is one of the Mediterranean UNESCO World Heritage sites at risk from coastal flooding and erosion due to sea-level rise. The city's position on the Mediterranean coast means it is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is one of UNESCO sites in Egypt at risk from flooding. All the archaeological sites in the northern coast of Egypt are also said to be at risk from coastal erosion. The flood risk in Alexandria is expected to reach a tipping point by 2050. This research presents the numerical analysis of geotechnical and structural damage mechanism of Catacombs of Kom El-Shoqafa and El-Shatbi Necropolis; the sites have the lowest topography in Alexandria induced by the sea level rise and heavy rain due to the Climate Change, based on Finite Element PLAXIS Code. The purpose of the study was to investigate the behavior fully-saturated soft rock/ hard soil subjected to ground water intrusions. The main objective of this study is to very accurately record and analyze geotechnical problems and induced structural failure mechanisms that have been observed and accounted for in field, experimental and Numerical studies. The land area is also vulnerable to coastal flooding. It is widely expected that the numerical analysis of such geotechnical problems will contribute to the preservation of cultural heritage. The present research presents an attempt and experimental study to design a PLAXIS 2D FE model to simulate hard soil/hard rock problems, distortion and stress analysis of the complex structure of the catacombs. Plastic modeling or Mohr-Coulomb model was used in advanced soils during various stages of numerical analysis. Results are recorded and discussed regarding stress and volumetric behavior of soil/rocks. Groundwater infiltration into pores or fissures of rock and soil has a great influence on the engineering mechanical properties of rocks and soils.

J	Mpofu, B				Mpofu, Buhle			Pursuing fullness of life through harmony with nature: Towards an African response to environmental destruction and climate change in Southern Africa	HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES			English	Article						care of creation; fullness of life; healing; restoration; nature; eco-theology; cultural landscapes	THEOLOGY; ECOLOGY	Like the rest of the developed world, African nations are now subject to consumerist tendencies of the global economic architecture and activities, which excessively exploit natural resources for profits and are at the centre of what this article describes as 'disharmony between nature and humanity'. The exploitative nature of consumerist tendencies requires healing and restoration as it leads towards unpredictable and destructive weather patterns in which the relationships between human activity and the environment have created patterns and feedback mechanisms that govern the presence, distribution and abundance of species assemblages. Disharmony is employed to describe the exploitative nature of consumerist tendencies that lead to unpredictable weather patterns. The consequences include climate change and natural disasters such as floods, drought and environmental pollution, which have been severely experienced in Southern Africa recently. This article provides a qualitative literature review on recent religious and ecumenical responses to climate change crisis and draws on the notions of `cultural landscapes' and `ecotheology' to highlight an exploitative relationship, which is characterised by disharmony in the relationship between humanity and nature. This illustration demonstrates how the concept of unity between `self and the entire Kosmos' in African worldview presents a potentially constructive African theology of ecology. Amongst other recommendations, the article proposed that in order for humanity to restore harmony and attain fullness of life - oikodome - with nature the notions of healing, reconciliation, liberation and restoration should be extended to human relations or interactions with nature and all of God's creation. Contribution: This article represents a contextual and systematic reflection on climate challenges facing the African context within a paradigm in which the intersection of philosophy, religious studies, social sciences, humanities and natural sciences generates an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary contested discourse.

To do this, land use changes over the next 20 years (2019-2040) were predicted from land use changes of the past 29 years (1990-2019) using the land change modeler (LCM) method. Future climate change was projected for the next 20 years (2020-2040) based on climate data from 1990 to 2015 using Lars-WG software and two scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Twelve factors that influence flooding and 262 locations of past floods were used to model the spatial pattern of flood susceptibility in the watershed. A random forest (RF) model and a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLMbayes) were used to predict areas susceptible to flooding. The results showed that elevation (21.55), distance from river (15.28), land use (11.1), slope (10.58), and rainfall (6.8) are the most important factors affecting flooding in this basin. The factors were modified according to land use changes and climate changes and the models were revised. The land use and climate forecasting in this region indicate that land use change, like decreased forest cover (77.19 km(2)) and reduced rangeland (218.83 km(2)) near rivers and downstream, can be expected and rainfall is projected to increase (under from both scenarios). These changes would result in increased probabilities of flooding in the downstream portion of the watershed and near the sea. The area-under-the-curve evaluation of the models indicates that the RF model more accurately predicted flood probability (0.91) than did the GLMbayes model (0.847).

Environmental hazards, rigid institutions, and transformative change: How drought affects the consideration of water and climate impacts in infrastructure management	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS			English	Article						Drought; Climate change; Institutional change; Adaptive governance; Environmental impact analysis; Infrastructure management	ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; PATH DEPENDENCE; POLICY; RISK; RESILIENCE; INFORMATION; EMERGENCE; CAPACITY; COVERAGE; SYSTEMS	Climate change necessitates major changes in infrastructure siting, design, and operations. Successful adaptation of infrastructure management requires overcoming thorny institutional challenges including path dependency and isomorphic pressures that inhibit major shifts in norms and practices. Hazards have been posited as a potential trigger for changing long-standing institutions because they can upend stable system states. However, research on the ability of hazards to shift norms and practices is still nascent and focuses on rapid-onset disasters like floods, hurricanes, or fires. This paper uses the 2012-2016 California drought to assess the potential for slow-onset hazards to lead to institutional change. We assess whether it yielded a shift in institutional norms, namely agency application of existing regulations toward enhanced socio-ecological resilience in the face of climate change. We focus on the environmental impact assessment process under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's process for licensing hydropower dams. Using computational text analysis of Environmental Impact Statements and participant observation of infrastructure licensing negotiations, we assess whether, over the years of the drought, agencies placed more emphasis on drought issues or climate resilience in analyzing infrastructure siting and design. In EIS documents, we observe a short-term spike in consideration of drought-related impacts and a longer-term increase in water security, suggesting some shifts in institutional practice; however, consideration of climate impacts decreased over the time period. In FERC licensing, there was no consideration of future climate impacts, despite managers' recognition that this posed a problem for projects' future operations. Although these results do not preclude the ability of slow-onset hazards to shift institutional norms, they suggest that doing so is challenging.

We selected the upper Ganga basin (UGB), the west-central Himalayan basin, to demonstrate how maximum cumulative storm and total rainfall received during monsoon control the extreme flow variability. In addition, the downscaled CMIP6 data sets were used for projections of extremes. The results suggest that historically Alaknanda basin receives a relatively higher magnitude of monsoon and storm rainfall than the other regions in the UGB, which manifested into significant extreme flow variability at the Alaknanda outlet. The extreme flows at the UGB outlet are projected to be more frequent under warming scenarios. The nonstationary flood frequency magnitudes are higher than those obtained from the stationary frequency method, implying a need for a review of return periods used in the designs of flood control structures in the region.

Urban flood models are numerical models that have the capability of representing the features of urban ecosystems and the mechanisms of flooding that impact them. They have the potential to play a critical role in flood risk assessment, operational response, and resilience planning, but existing models remain limited in their capability to represent integrated flooding processes in urban areas and provide the credible quantitative information needed to support risk assessment and resilience practice. Research to advance model development, facilitate intensive watershed monitoring for model parameterization and validation, and support collaboration between researchers and practitioners should be prioritized. This will represent a substantial, expensive effort, but will still be of great value as cities are faced with urgent challenges posed by climate change in coming decades.	[Rosenzweig, B.

J	Azad, MJ; Pritchard, B				Azad, Md Javed; Pritchard, Bill			Financial capital as a shaper of households' adaptive capabilities to flood risk in northern Bangladesh	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Sustainable livelihood approach; Financial capital; Capital interactions; Adaptive capacity; Flood; Climate change; Qualitative method	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVELIHOOD VULNERABILITY; RURAL BANGLADESH; ADAPTATION; IMPACT; MICROFINANCE; COMMUNITIES; RESILIENCE; MIGRATION; RESPONSES	This paper identifies access to financial capital as having a catalytic role in shaping households' adaptive ca-pabilities to flood threats in rural Bangladesh. Twenty village-level Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were convened in the highly flood-prone Sirajganj district in the north of the country. Village participants were asked to describe the major forms of adaptation to flooding. This process identified forty forms of adaptation which were then classified according to the five capitals framework of the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA). The narratives generated from the FGDs identified financial capital as having a catalytic role in shaping interactions with other forms of capital and ensuing adaptive capabilities to flood. Thematic coding of these results revealed five pathways in which financial capital shaped household adaptive capabilities. These insights into the importance of financial capital tell an important message about vulnerability and adaptive capability in an increasingly climate-stressed world. Focus group testimonies emphasise the lived realities of how wealth and income stratify the ability to adapt to increased flood threats, a major symptom of climate change in Bangladesh. This heightens the need for financial aspects of vulnerability to be foregrounded in adaptation policies.

Therefore, it is essential to enhance the resilience of our C.I to withstand such events in the present and future. Here, a review of current and projected impacts of climate change is conducted on extreme events and on possible implications on C.I is carried out, which suggests that such events can have a severe impact on C.Is. Also, two studies on the behaviour of precipitation extremes and temporal evolution of drought across India are carried out, taking into account the corresponding impacts on C.Is. It indicated that north-western, north-eastern westernmost regions and western Ghats are highly susceptible to floods and northern, central-eastern, western, and central regions are prone towards co-occurrence of floods and droughts. Also, a case study on Kharif paddy yield forecasting using different machine learning (ML) models is carried out, where the random forest was found to be the most suitable model for yield prediction. Finally, we put forward a robust framework for risk assessment and improving the resilience of C.Is based upon the principles of flexibility, diversity, and industrial ecology, incorporating both short-term and long-term impacts of climate risk.

These perceptions create incentives for politicians to adopt similar views. In this study, we explore the views of an intermediate group of stakeholders - public and professional managers who play a role in the process of designing disaster relief and prevention policies. Using a survey of professional stakeholders in Texas, we map their views on the causes and policy solutions for the damages following Hurricane Harvey (Summer 2017). Overall, we find that professional stakeholders hold fairly similar views to the public. Yet, they differ from citizens as they are less supportive of distributing direct payments, instead preferring to allocate funds towards long-term prevention solutions, and creating a regulatory environment to reduce the risks. Also, our results indicate that having personal experience of hazard events further enhance those views, and stakeholders in government positions prefer even less direct governmental involvement in disaster resilience. Our findings expand existing knowledge regarding individual perceptions and policy preferences facing natural hazards by discussing the views of professionals who play important roles in designing solutions to mitigate the growing risks from climate change.

This is particularly important because as populations age and new technologies come on the scene, much local knowledge is lost to newer generations. For this reason, we have systematically examined 90 societies from the ethnographic record to explore and document the strategies that people in the past have implemented in response to serious natural hazards. Our review reveals a rich diversity of coping mechanisms and contingency plans used by societies around the world in response to different hazards, particularly floods and droughts. We collect, classify, and compare different types of coping mechanisms, focusing on four major types: technological, subsistence, economic and religious. We find that most societies employ multiple types of coping mechanisms, although our data suggest that technological coping mechanisms are the most common coping mechanisms in response to fast-onset hazards, whereas religious coping mechanisms are the most common mechanism used in response to slow-onset hazards. We also find that religious and nonreligious coping strategies are not antithetical to each other. In fact, an increased number of religious coping mechanisms is associated with an increased number of "practical", nonreligious coping mechanisms.

In this Review, we examine evidence from observational, theoretical and modelling studies for the intensification of these rainfall extremes, the drivers and the impact on flash flooding. Both short-duration and long-duration (>1day) rainfall extremes are intensifying with warming at a rate consistent with the increase in atmospheric moisture (similar to 7%K-1), while in some regions, increases in short-duration extreme rainfall intensities are stronger than expected from moisture increases alone. These stronger local increases are related to feedbacks in convective clouds, but their exact role is uncertain because of the very small scales involved. Future extreme rainfall intensification is also modulated by changes to temperature stratification and large-scale atmospheric circulation. The latter remains a major source of uncertainty. Intensification of short-duration extremes has likely increased the incidence of flash flooding at local scales, and this can further compound with an increase in storm spatial footprint to considerably increase total event rainfall. These findings call for urgent climate change adaptation measures to manage increasing flood risks.

J	Liu, YH; Li, ZL				Liu, Yuhui; Li, Zhiling			Stalagmite flooding frequency record since the middle Little Ice Age from Central China	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Flooding frequency; Stalagmite; Growth rate; Little Ice Age; Central China		Comparison of the climate, especially extreme climate changes between the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the present, could provide important information for the predication of extreme climate change in the future. Based on a laminated stalagmite from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Central China, an annually resolved stalagmite record of growth rate has been produced dating from 1640 AD. An 11-year running variance sequence of the growth rate shows a positive correlation with a local historical flooding frequency record from 1640 to 1920 AD, suggesting that the stalagmite growth rate variance could be used as a local flooding frequency indicator. In the middle Yangtze catchment, the flooding frequency during the late LIA (1750-1900 AD) is much higher than during the middle LIA (1640-1750 AD) and the early twentieth century (1900-1920 AD). The discrepancy between the stalagmite growth rate variance and the flooding frequency after 1920s AD suggests that the scale of modern flooding is possibly larger than during the earlier periods. Spectral power analysis on growth rate variance of the stalagmite suggests that the flooding cycles around the middle Yangtze River catchment may relate to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The comparison between the stalagmite growth rate variance and reconstructed ENSO records further suggests a link between strong ENSO and high flooding frequency in the middle Yangtze catchment.

Adaptation to climate change must therefore be integrated into urban planning and coupled with sustainable urban development and conservation policies. To do so, a good understanding of the vulnerability of cities to these extreme events is necessary, lending special attention to the specifics of the different urban areas, such as historic city centres. In the present study, a vulnerability evaluation methodology is presented for cities against extreme rainfall and flooding, which follows a holistic and multi-stakeholder approach, integrating architectural, socio-economic, and cultural perspectives, that supports evidence-based decision-making for the sustainable development of the agents that intervene in the process. The MIVES method, based on a multiple criteria decision-analysis process and a CityGML-based data model are used for that purpose, with which a process for capturing, evaluating, and representing information in an objective, organized, and systematic way has been developed. These advantages are demonstrated through the application of that process to a case study in Donostia-San Sebastian (northern Spain), located on a river estuary in front of the sea, with a wide diversity of building styles.

The watershed vegetation and its carbon sequestration capacity have changed dramatically due to climate change and human activities in the last two decades. In this paper, the monthly and annual vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) of the Dongting Lake basin during 2000 to 2020 was firstly estimated using the improved Carnegie-Ames -Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Then the multi-year NPP change trend and its significance were analyzed based on Theil-Sen median and Mann-Kendall method. Subsequently, the Hurst index was used to simulate the vegetation NPP persistence in the study area. Finally, the driving mechanisms of vegetation NPP changes in the study area were explored using partial correlation coefficients and residual analysis. The results demonstrated that: 1) The annual average NPP in the basin showed a fluctuating and increasing trend from 273.54 to 718.30 g C/m2 center dot yr1 during 2000 to 2020, and except for autumn, all seasons (spring, summer, winter) and annual NPP series showed an upward trend. The spatial distribution of vegetation NPP is characterized by an asymmetrical horseshoe shape in general, with high values in the west, south and east parts, and low values in the Lake area; 2) During the study years, about 84.38 % of the basin area showed a significant and extremely significant increase of NPP; 3) The future trend of vegetation NPP in the basin shows that the area of decrease (22.79 %) is more than the area of increase (11.35 %). The Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration will generally show a continuous and extremely significant reduction trend, while parts of Dongting Lake will show a continuous and extremely significant increase trend; 4) The correlation between solar radiation and NPP is stronger than the other two meteorological factors (precipitation and temperature). Temperature has a significant inhibitory effect on NPP, solar radiation has a significant promoting effect on NPP, and the effect of precipitation on NPP was relatively complicated. The relative importance of meteorological factors on vegetation NPP was ranked as follows: solar radiation > precipitation > temperature. The impacts of both climate change and human activities on NPP changes showed great spatial variability, and the positive contributions (89.81 % for climate change and 82.87 % for human activities) were both greater than the negative contributions.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

While high latitudes suffer the greatest increase in incremental temperature, moderate latitudes are highly vulnerable due to their temperate/tropical rain storms and hurricanes that bring about extreme flooding events. We and others have shown that there is a link between the occurrence and severity of these climate events and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. In this review, we will discuss the data and consider interacting near and intermediate sequelae of worsening natural disasters-including food scarcity, disrupted or compromised built environments and infrastructure, and loss of communities with human migration. While certainly tackling these and other proximal mediators of adverse perinatal outcomes will benefit maternal and child health, a failure to meaningfully address the root causes of climate change and resultant environmental chemical exposures will be of little long-term benefit.

J	Pinter, N				Pinter, Nicholas			The lost history of managed retreat and community relocation in the United States	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Managed retreat; Community relocation; Climate change; Adaptation; Migration; Disaster mitigation; Disaster planning	RESETTLEMENT; MIGRATION	Managed retreat refers to the relocation of population or infrastructure to address sea-level rise, climate-driven flood risk, and other threats. One variety of managed retreats involves the wholesale relocation of communities. The focus of retreat and relocation projects is to make the retreating communities more resilient to future losses; add-on benefits may include environmental enhancement and broad potential social goals such as promoting equity. Facing spiraling flooding and other climate-change impacts, the United States has been planning and implementing new retreat projects, but without full awareness of past relocations. This study reviews more than 50 relevant community relocations in U.S. history. These endeavors represent millions of taxpayer dollars and enormous investment of personal effort, leadership, triumph, and frustration by residents. And these case studies represent real-world, context-specific expertise needed to guide future U.S. retreat and relocations efforts. This study reviews U.S. relocation history as a resource for scholars of managed retreat, disaster management professionals, and local stakeholders contemplating retreat.

Adapting to Rising Sea Levels: How Short-Term Responses Complement Long-Term Investment	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation; Cost&#8211; benefit analysis; Real options analysis	FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; REAL OPTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY	This paper presents a parsimonious model of a coastal locality's adaptation to rising sea levels and uses the model to examine cost-minimizing policies involving two complementary approaches. One involves irreversible investment in sea walls and similar infrastructure. The other involves activities, such as beach scraping, that only provide temporary protection. Costs are minimized by delaying investment until the present value of the benefits from avoided inundation costs exceeds upfront investment costs by a margin that is economically significant. The premium, which can exceed 50% of investment costs, is higher when the sea level is rising more quickly. The ability to temporarily boost defenses is used aggressively: spending on temporary improvements immediately before investment is several times larger than its value immediately afterwards. Temporary improvements are made even when the marginal cost of increasing the effectiveness of defenses this way is significantly greater than the equivalent annual cost of permanently increasing effectiveness by investment.

Urban flood hazard analysis in present and future climate after statistical downscaling: a case study in Ha Tinh city, Vietnam	URBAN WATER JOURNAL			English	Article						Urban flooding; statistical downscaling; climate change; Ha Tinh city -Vietnam		Vietnamese cities are highly vulnerable to urban flooding as a consequence of climate change and rapid urbanisation. In this study, current and future pluvial urban flood hazard was assessed for Ha Tinh city. Climate scenarios were obtained after statistical downscaling by applying a quantile-perturbation approach on ensembles of 170 global and 20 regional climate models. Flood impact analysis was based on the 1D-2D dual drainage modelling approach. Extreme daily rainfall intensities are projected to increase by 5 to 20%, whereas wet day frequency will decrease with some uncertainty. Larger changes in rainfall intensities were obtained for the finer scale climate models. Under the 95% upper limit scenario for future rainfall intensities (2071-2100), a 20-year intensity in the current climate would become a 2-year storm in the future and the flood extent is projected to increase by 30-40%. This indicates a need for climate adaptation measures and sustainable future urban planning.	[Le, T. T.

Considering the future scenarios, it is predicted that the number and severity of floods and flood disasters will increase. The annual precipitation concentration and the temporal trend of precipitation concentration of the Kizilirmak Basin in Turkey were investigated. In addition, evaluations were made in terms of public administration against climate change and possible disasters. Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) were used with precipitation records for the period 1976-2017 in the Kizilirmak Basin. The results show a moderate precipitation regime at Kizilirmak Basin. According to ITA results, no significant trends were found at the 0.05 significance level. However, insignificant negative trends and positive trends were detected for PCI. It should not be forgotten that there will be changes in the frequency and severity of disasters such as floods and droughts, in which regions with irregular precipitation regimes are determined in the future. Within the scope of the modern disaster management approach, it is necessary to make preparations for reducing risks and damages and to raise awareness about disasters.

An economy-wide assessment of different insurance systems in Europe under climate change	ECONOMIC SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Flood insurance; Flood risk; Public-private partnership; Public budget; Computable general equilibrium model	NATURAL DISASTER INSURANCE; FUTURE; RESILIENCE; REDUCTION; FRAMEWORK; RECOVERY; IMPACTS; LOSSES; POLICY; HAZARD	Anticipated increase in future river flood risk highlights the need for effective flood insurance, as it enables hedging against this risk. However, its design varies significantly across countries. This study contributes to the debate on designing flood insurance mechanisms from an economy-wide perspective, considering both socioeconomic and climate changes. We apply a multi-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for 2050 and find that, under current insurance market systems, flood risk causes regional GDP losses of up to -0.5%, societal welfare losses of up to -1%, and private and public consumption losses of up to -0.5% and -2.4%, respectively. These estimates are all relative to a scenario without flood risk. Our results indicate that flood risk intensifies pressure on public budgets. We find that insurance market reforms, including a higher degree of risk-sharing, mandatory purchase requirements, and public reinsurance, can alleviate adverse welfare effects and the burden on public budgets.

The situation is worsening because water flow in the river is highly uncertain, affected by rainfall in the mountains and by climate change, and influenced by the Koshi barrage, which is governed by the Koshi River Agreement, a bilateral river agreement with India. This study addresses how Koshi River governance contributes to the vulnerability of riverine communities in Nepal by drawing upon ideas about vulnerability and vulnerability mapping. A household survey and interviews were conducted in 2015 for a comparative study of people living on two river islands located upstream and downstream of the barrage. Findings remain relevant because of persistent governance challenges and growing climate change effects, escalating islanders' vulnerability to recurrent floods. The islanders' vulnerability was produced locally and also shaped by historical, social, economic, political, geographical, and ecological processes occurring at multiple scales. That insight highlights the need to study the broader political economy of hazard production to understand vulnerability in the context of governance.

J	Marks, D; Pulliat, G				Marks, Danny; Pulliat, Gwenn			Climate Governance in Southeast Asian small and mid-sized cities: undermining resilience and distributing risks unevenly	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Incomplete decentralization; secondary cities; urban climate resilience; mainland Southeast Asia; fragmented urban governance; urban political ecology	POLITICAL ECOLOGY; DECENTRALIZATION; WATER; ADAPTATION; PROMISES; MYANMAR; FLOODS	Secondary cities are home to most of the world's urban populations vulnerable to climate change, yet researchers and policymakers have devoted less attention to them than large and megacities. To help address this gap, this paper explores the relationship between incomplete decentralized governance, climate change, and urban resilience. It does through the case studies of secondary cities of Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Secondary cities are of importance because they are the fastest growing cities in the Global South but also because they have weaker capacity to address climate risks. Through these case studies, the paper draws comparisons between the different cases to look at the linkages between decentralization and urban resilience in secondary cities. Overall, it argues that climate governance, due to the retention of power and resources by central bureaucrats along with fragmented governance structures, and misaligned incentive structures which prioritize economic growth over climate protection have undermined resilience building and contributed to the uneven distribution of climate risks in these cities.

J	Visconti, G				Visconti, Giancarlo			After the Flood: Disasters, Ideological Voting and Electoral Choices in Chile	POLITICAL BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Ideological preferences; Electoral choices; Natural disasters; Natural experiments; Conjoint experiments	NATURAL DISASTERS; POLITICAL-PARTIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HURRICANE; BLAME; SUPPORT; WEATHER; TURNOUT; RAIN	Can natural disasters affect voters' electoral choices, and in particular, ideological voting? Even as climate change has increased concerns about the frequency and intensity of disasters, the effects of these negative events on voter behavior are not yet fully understood. Though ideological labels are known to be informative heuristics, the literature has thus far overlooked their role after natural hazards. Might affected citizens become more likely to select candidates with an ideology that can be associated with what victims need after a disaster? Answering this question is difficult since disaster damage can be correlated with multiple victims' unobserved characteristics. To address this challenge, I use a natural experiment created by the floods that occurred in Chile in 2015 to take advantage of random variation in citizens' exposure to a disaster. I then capture voters' electoral choices using a conjoint survey experiment. The findings show that material damage caused by this disaster increased the probability of voters selecting left-wing and independent candidates. Qualitative evidence from interviews helps to illuminate the causal mechanisms underlying these results.

Quantifying the importance of each of these mechanisms in regulating Brook Trout recruitment would be valuable to managers that are responsible for the conservation of this iconic species throughout its native range. We analyzed a time series of age-0 and adult Brook Trout density data collected from 10 streams in the Sinnemahoning Creek watershed, north-central Pennsylvania (2010-2019), using Bayesian hierarchical modeling to partition the density-dependent effects of adult density and the density-independent effects of elevated streamflow on Brook Trout recruitment. Multiple models were examined, and the top-ranked model showed that Brook Trout recruitment followed a Ricker stock-recruitment relationship, with annual recruitment negatively influenced by maximum streamflow during the spring season (March-April). This model will be useful in predicting future variation in Brook Trout recruitment under climate change scenarios in which the frequency and intensity of high-flow events are expected to increase.

Key factors driving this increase include climate change, the growing world population, anthropogenic activities and ecosystem degradation. One ecologically focused approach that has shown potential towards the mitigation of these hazard events is the concept of nature's contributions to people (or NCP), which focuses on enhancing the material and non-material benefits of an ecosystem to reduce hazard vulnerability and enhance overall human well-being. Soils, in particular, have been identified as a key ecosystem component that may offer critical hazard regulating functionality. Thus, this review investigates the modulating role of soils in the regulation of natural hazards and extreme events, with a focus on floods, droughts, landslides and sand/dust storms, within the context of NCP. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of soils in delivering Nature's Contributions to People'.	[Saco, P. M.; McDonough, K. R.; Rodriguez, J. F.; Sandi, S.

Here, we develop daily bias-corrected data of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution for South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka) and 18 river basins located in the Indian sub-continent. The bias-corrected dataset is developed using Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM) for the historic (1951-2014) and projected (2015-2100) climate for the four scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) using output from 13 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6). The bias-corrected dataset was evaluated against the observations for both mean and extremes of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures. Bias corrected projections from 13 CMIP6-GCMs project a warmer (3-5 degrees C) and wetter (13-30%) climate in South Asia in the 21(st) century. The bias-corrected projections from CMIP6-GCMs can be used for climate change impact assessment in South Asia and hydrologic impact assessment in the sub-continental river basins.

LeRoy			Investments under non-stationarity: economic evaluation of adaptation pathways	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Investment decisions about capital-intensive, long-lived infrastructure are challenging due to uncertainty about their future performance, particularly if the performance is sensitive to climate change. Such investments, like those made for water infrastructure, are rarely evaluated over their total operational lifetime, during which socio-economic and environmental changes can cause potential lock-ins and reduced options for future choices that lead to high costs to transfer to other options. We propose an economic evaluation framework to explore adaptation pathways, or sequences of strategic investments options, that can be implemented if needed due to changing conditions. A novel feature is the inclusion of "transfer costs" associated with a switch to alternative pathways to allow adaptive decision-making and to minimize the cost of adjustment over time. Implementing a pathway-driven approach represents a break with most institutional decision-making processes and can significantly improve decision-making under uncertainty compared to the conventional single-investment perspective. We present a case study on flood risk management in the Netherlands to show the long-term socio-economic consequences of short-term decisions by going beyond the project cycle horizon.

This environment presents an important sedimentary archive reflecting past human behaviour in interactions with climate change. Two sedimentary sections recorded in the alluvial zone of Svratka River (Moravia) with a buried soil dated to the time span between the Neolithic and Late Bronze Age, and comprising one paleo-catena, were investigated using a multiproxy approach. The buried paleo-catena presents evidence of long-term (ancient) soil development, and the use of the site for human settlement and farming ca. 4500 BC until 1000 BC. Buried soil horizons indicate (climate) stability, which according to archaeological evidence lasted for at least 3500 years, until at least 1000 BC. The architecture and the lithology of the river floodplain changes approximately 0 AD. Anthropogenic settlement activity was not detected at the site in the subsequent period, and this is very likely to be associated with increased sedimentation rates and less optimal conditions for human settlement.

Observed Changes in the Frequency, Intensity, and Spatial Patterns of Nine Natural Hazards in the United States from 2000 to 2019	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate; natural hazards; resilience; time series	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; SOCIAL MEDIA; IMPACTS; HURRICANES; BOSTON; STORMS	There is increasing evidence from across the globe that climate change results in changes in the frequency, location, and impact of natural hazards. Much of this evidence is conceptual, inferential, or simply assumed. To provide objective support to confirm these hypotheses, we constructed county-level time-series datasets (2000-2019) for nine natural hazards for the entire United States. Hazards considered for this study included hurricanes, tropical storms, landslides, wildfires, earthquakes, drought, inland flooding, coastal flooding, and tornadoes. Geospatial analysis techniques were used to calculate the percentage (range: 0-100) of land area in each county exposed to each natural hazard for all the years that hazard data were available. The best available data were acquired from publicly accessible sources. Cumulative distribution functions were calculated for each hazard in five-year intervals to test for statistically significant changes in distribution patterns across the five-year time periods using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. There were significant changes in hurricanes, tropical storms, and drought over the two decades; changes in tornadoes, landslides, and wildfires were not significant in terms of frequency, likely due to the site-specific nature of their occurrences. The intensity and spatial distribution and an emerging hot spot and spatial trend analyses and an emerging hot spot and spatial trend analyses were also completed (except for flooding events and earthquakes due to insufficient data). All datasets provide empirical support for earlier inferences concerning the connections between the hazards and climate change. Analyses showed apparent changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, tropical storms, and drought-related to climate change factors. Internal and coastal flooding also demonstrated these connections, although the length of the dataset did not permit significant testing but shows significant hot spots and trending locations. Tornadoes, landslides, and wildfires showed significant hot spots and trending locations, but the specific locational nature of the data did not show significant changes in frequency. Earthquakes showed no significant changes over the time period.	[Summers, J. K.; Lamper, A.; McMillion, C.; Harwell, L.

Here we used four global climate models to project future precipitation that drives hydrological modeling of future 30-year daily runoff in a large international river basin, the Lancang-Mekong River Basin (LMRB). We applied four probability distribution functions to fit the flood peak and maximum 3day flood volume series at four major hydrologic stations. The copula function was used to establish the joint distribution between extreme precipitation and flood peak to estimate the impact of precipitation change on floods. Results show that annual maximum 30-day precipitation (AM30D) and flood peak at Pakse station are highly correlated. Future basin-averaged AM30D is projected to increase under most climate scenarios, although AM30D varies widely in spatial distribution. The extreme values of AM30D (e.g., AM1D and AM3D) in the future (2021-2050) are larger than those in historical period (1981-2004). The temporal distribution of future AM30D is more uneven, showing the "bimodal" distribution. For the Yun Jinghong station, large uncertainty is estimated in change of direction of annual maximum flood peak and maximum 3-day flood volume. As for the other three stations, they are all projected to have larger flood risks in spite of different magnitudes. The larger the return period, the larger the increase, the greater the impact of climate change. The change of basin-averaged AM30D precipitation in the future will lead to the increase of flood peak at Pakse station via the bivariate frequency analysis. From the perspective of water conservancy project safety, considering the "adverse principle", flood control design according to the design results derived from the joint distribution of two variables between AM30D and flood peak can reduce the risk of flood disaster. This study can provide scientific reference and basis for flood control and disaster reduction and water resources cooperation policy development in LMRB.

Hydrological impacts of climate change on small ungauged catchments - results from a global climate model-regional climate model-hydrologic model chain	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							GCM BIAS CORRECTIONS; WATER-RESOURCES; CHANGE PROJECTIONS; EURO-CORDEX; FLOOD RISK; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTIES; SIMULATIONS; SCENARIOS; FREQUENCY	Climate change is one of the greatest threats currently facing the world's environment. In Norway, a change in climate will strongly affect the pattern, frequency, and magnitudes of stream flows. However, it is challenging to quantify to what extent the change will affect the flow patterns and floods from small rural catchments due to the unavailability or inadequacy of hydro-meteorological data for the calibration of hydrological models and due to the tailoring of methods to a small-scale level. To provide meaningful climate impact studies at the level of small catchments, it is therefore beneficial to use high-spatial- and high-temporal-resolution climate projections as input to a high-resolution hydrological model. In this study, we used such a model chain to assess the impacts of climate change on the flow patterns and frequency of floods in small ungauged rural catchments in western Norway. We used a new high-resolution regional climate projection, with improved performance regarding the precipitation distribution, and a regionalized hydrological model (distance distribution dynamics) between a reference period (1981-2011) and a future period (2070-2100). The flow-duration curves for all study catchments show more wet periods in the future than during the reference period. The results also show that in the future period, the mean annual flow increases by 16 % to 33 %. The mean annual maximum floods increase by 29 % to 38 %, and floods of 2- to 200-year return periods increase by 16 % to 43 %. The results are based on the RCP8.5 scenario from a single climate model simulation tailored to the Bergen region in western Norway, and the results should be interpreted in this context. The results should therefore be seen in consideration of other scenarios for the region to address the uncertainty. Nevertheless, the study increases our knowledge and understanding of the hydrological impacts of climate change on small catchments in the Bergen area in the western part of Norway.

Understanding how frequent these deadly catastrophes are creates many uncertainties, especially in areas where disaster records are scarce or have short timeframes. It is, however, very important from a preparedness and civil protection standpoint to assess the frequency of such high-mortality events, especially considering the threat of climate change. This work develops a high-mortality flood event database using multiple international sources, covering a relatively long time window (1882-2021), exploring the deadliest floods in the Eastern Mediterranean region, and examining their seasonal distribution, their temporal evolution, and their basic spatial patterns. The study identifies 132 flash flood events (causing >= 10 fatalities) with a return period of only 1.56 years. Additionally, higher-magnitude events (>85th percentile) were found to be less common but still not very rare (return period = 9.1 years). The number of events shows an increase in recent decades, while seasonal and spatial patterns were identified as well. Overall, the findings provide a foundation for understanding how common catastrophic flood events are in the region, are beneficial for policymakers and relevant professionals, and are an important stepping stone towards a complete understanding of how extreme floods have changed in the last century or will change in the near future.

Projected Climate Changes of CMIP5 models in La Cruz, Guanacaste, Costa Rica	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL			Spanish	Article						climate change; hydrometeorological impacts; temperature; precipitation; Central American Dry Corridor; La Cruz; Costa Rica	VARIABILITY; WATER; SALINAS; EVENTS	Introduction: La Cruz is located in northwestern Costa Rica, and it is characterized by a dry tropical climate with a well-defined dry season. This municipality has reported many impacts of hydrometeorological events during the last 45 years, mostly associated with wet events such as floods that affected roads, housing, and crops; as well as some droughts that have impacted the population and their livelihoods. Objective: The objective of this article is to provide information regarding possible future climate changes during the 21st century associated with a pessimistic emission scenario in the municipality of La Cruz in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Methods: We used DesInventar database to identify the hydrometeorological impacts in La Cruz and classified them by month. Downscaled simulations from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) were used to simulate past and future changes (1979-2099) in temperature and precipitation. In addition, a hydrological model was used to calculate runoff projections from meteorological data. Results: Floods, and housing, roads and agricultural damages are the most recurrent impacts. In addition, some human deaths are reported during this time. Results show that a drier and warmer future will be characteristic of the climate in La Cruz in the 21st century, especially after 2040. Runoff is also expected to be reduced significantly following the meteorological trends. Conclusions: It is expected that higher aridity will be present in the future, affecting human and environmental systems.

However, past sustainability assessment studies do not consider how the performance of infrastructure will be affected by a changing climate. The goal of this research is to investigate the impacts of flooding in a unified assessment of the resilience and sustainability of pavement. A case study of concrete pavement was evaluated for scenarios with and without flooding. The AASHTOWare Pavement ME design program was used to simulate the structural performance of typical jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) designs for collector roads in Canada. Predicted performance was used in the resilience and sustainability assessment under scenarios with and without flooding. The damage ratio and cost of damage were assessed to quantify the resilience of concrete pavement to floods. Life cycle costs and environmental impacts were compared across a climate change scenario with consideration of maintenance and rehabilitation activities. Results reveal that a typical Ontario JPCP design with structural slab thickness < 200 mm is less resilient than the Manitoba design for collector roads, but the 25 mm slab thickness difference in Manitoba design can lead to 50% change in damage ratio and damage cost. When estimating the social cost associated with greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, the additional environmental impact resulting from flooding for the Ontario road is almost seven times that of the Manitoba road. However, the life cycle economic cost and environmental impact do not yield an overall benefit with increased slab thickness.

A qualitative comparative analysis of flood-related political unrest	JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH			English	Article						development; environment; peace; protest; security; violence	NATURAL DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL-CONFLICT; CIVIL-WAR; VIOLENCE; RISK; SET; QCA; INCOMPATIBILITIES; TRIGGERS	Disasters triggered by natural hazards will increase in the future due to climate change, population growth, and more valuable assets located in vulnerable areas. The impacts of disasters on political conflict have been the subject of broad academic and public debates. Existing research has paid little attention to the links between climate change, disasters, and small-scale conflicts, such as protests or riots. Floods are particularly relevant in this context as they are the most frequent and most costly contemporary disasters. However, they remain understudied compared to other disasters, specifically, droughts and storms. We address these gaps by focusing on flood-related political unrest between 2015 and 2018 in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Drawing on data from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) and Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED), we find that flood-related political unrest occurs within two months after 24% of the 92 large flooding events recorded in our sample. Subsequently, a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) shows that the simultaneous presence of a large population, a democratic regime, and either the exclusion of ethnic groups from political power or a heavy impact of the flood is an important scope condition for the onset of flood-related political unrest. This indicates that disaster-conflict links are by no means deterministic. Rather, they are contingent on complex interactions between multiple contextual factors.

Modelling impact of future climate and land use land cover on flood vulnerability for policy support - Hyderabad, India	WATER POLICY			English	Article						Climate change; Flood zoning; HEC-RAS; Land use land cover; Rainfall; SWMM	DECISION-MAKING; RUNOFF; WATER; MANAGEMENT; CITY	The study analyses the impact of climate change and land use land cover (LULC) on runoff of Hyderabad city, India for the years 1995, 2005, 2016 and 2031. Flood vulnerability was evaluated for extreme historic and future rainfall events. Maximum daily rainfalls of 132, 181 and 165 mm that occurred in the decades of 1990-2000, 2001-2010 and 2011-2016 were considered for historic rainfall-runoff modelling. Complementarily in climate change, maximum daily rainfall of 266 mm predicted during 2020-2040 by Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory-Coupled Model 3 (GFDL-CM3) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6, was analysed for rainfall-runoff scenario in 2031. LULC was assessed from historic maps and the master plan of the city. Peak runoff was modelled in Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for corresponding daily rainfall and LULC. The floodplain of the river Musi was modelled in Hydrological Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS). Results showed that changing rainfall and LULC increased peak runoff by three times, and flood depth in the river increased by 22% from 1995 to 2031. In 2016 and 2031, 48 and 51% of the city was highly vulnerable. Five detention basins were proposed to combat increasing runoff, due to which highly vulnerable areas reduced by 8% in 2016 and 9% in 2031.

Slackwater Sediments Record the Increase in Sub-daily Rain Flood due to Climate Change in a European Mediterranean Catchment	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Short-rain flood; Satellite imagery; Flood monitoring; Paleohydrology; Climate change; Guadalquivir basin	MODEL	In this work we propose an original method to determine the magnitude of the discharge, the intensity of the precipitation and the duration of short-rain floods in small torrential basins (< 2000 km(2)), extending our earlier approach for long-rain floods in larger basins (Water 2016, 8, 526; Remote Sens. 2017, 9, 727). The studied areas are located in ungauged catchments with high erosion rates where torrents deposit slackwater sediments near the outlet of the basins. Such deposits and erosive morphologies allow us to analyse sub-daily extreme hydrological events by combining standard techniques in paleohydrology, the kinematic wave method and remote-sensed paleostage indicators. The formulation was correctly verified in extreme events through reliable gauge measurements and a high-resolution distributed hydrological model showing the accuracy of our calculations (10% <= relative error <= 22%). In catchments of the European Mediterranean region where the frequency and magnitude of short-rain floods are increasing (e.g. the Guadalquivir Basin), the main hydrological variables can thus be quantified post-event using the proposed approach. The outputs may serve to construct a new database for this kind of events complementary to the existing daily database for long-rain floods (> 24 h). The need is evident for safety designs of civil infrastructures and flood risk mitigation strategies in the current climate change scenario.	[Moral-Erencia, J.

The catchment runoff volume was simulated using Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The runoff simulations were carried out for historic and future extreme rainfall event(s). Future rainfall events were simulated under climate change scenarios using Global Climate Model(GCM), GFDL-CM3 of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5(CMIP5). Nonlinear regression-based statistical downscaling was used to obtain rainfall at regional scale for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5. It was found that RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 predicted a future extreme rainfall of 693mm, 431mm, 282mm and 564mm for the years 2088, 2098, 2040 and 2068, respectively. SWMM resultsindicated that the future extreme rainfall in Hyderabad can result in increased runoff volumes causing flooding. The existing SWN was capable of handling RCP 6.0 with 82% runoff. However, it was inadequate to convey runoff from RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Modelling results suggest that the conveyance capacity of storm drains can be increased by 25-30% by desilting major drains and outlets.	[Vemula, Swathi; Raju, K. Srinivasa; Veena, S. Sai; Kumar, A.

Accounting for Economic Factors in Socio-Hydrology: Optimization under Uncertainty and Climate Change	WATER			English	Article						river flooding; extreme events; generalized extreme value distribution; non-stationarity; optimization under uncertainty	FLOODS	This paper reframes the socio-hydrology analysis as an optimization problem. To achieve this, we first develop a valuation scheme to estimate net benefits of development in a flood plain, consisting of benefits obtained from land and housing, less the costs of flood management and flood damage. Then we look for an optimal safety factor for the levee heightening strategy within the 'Technosociety' scenario for a given time series of future flood events. This is further extended to finding an optimal strategy in the case of uncertainty concerning flood timings and intensities. We suggest an approach for both stationary and non-stationary evolution of flood dynamics and examine how the levee heightening strategy is affected by the magnitude of climate change. We find that the preferred management option depends strongly on the value of the land services the area provides.

J	Griffith, IL				Griffith, Ivelaw Lloyd			Oil and climate change in small states	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						petro power; climate change; Guyana-Suriname Basin; environmental security; wet neighbourhoods; sea-level rise; floods; small states		This article challenges Daniel Yergin's proposition that climate mobilization, and not energy security, is the main driver of contemporary international engagement. I examine the realities of Guyana and Suriname, two small states in the Guyana-Suriname Basin (GSB) that give equal weight to energy security and climate issues. The two have oil reserves that together comprise more than 16 billion barrels. Guyana and Suriname are also in Wet Neighbourhoods with massive rainforests, and due to global warming, the Guyana capital is forecast to be fully or partially submerged by 2030. The article argues that GSB leaders must use some of their countries' oil revenues to craft an Environmental Security Investment Plan, noting that although rising sea levels might only minimally affect offshore drilling, they will disrupt habitation and societal normalcy, and the oil wealth would be of little benefit to the people if appropriate mitigation is not undertaken urgently.

As climate change threatens livestock systems in various ways, here we assess how regional livestock could be exposed to cumulated climate-related stressors in the future. Using the world's largest multi-model climate impacts simulations database ISIMIP, we find that a large part of West Africa will experience at least 5-6 cumulated multiple climate stressors before the 2030s, including amplified severe heat stress conditions and flood risks. Consequently, about 30% of the current total regional livestock could be exposed to these cumulated stressors, with sheep and goat as the most affected species. This paper brings new quantifications that may help policy makers to prioritize decisions that could prepare local populations to face multiple climate-related impacts.

Increasing land sealing, loss of retention areas and local infiltration of precipitation are seen as reasons for this development. Furthermore, groundwater resources are subject to climate change, which is locally perceptible by variable groundwater recharge through extreme precipitation events or snow melt. In this paper, a modelling study is employed to analyse the sensitivity of a local, near-surface groundwater aquifer with regard to physiographical, climatic and anthropogenic developments. It is shown that an uncontrolled interaction with surface waters can significantly affect the groundwater balance, for example if the groundwater/surface water exchange rate is altered by hydraulic measures (e.g. drainage systems, barrier walls) or by natural phenomena such as flooding events. This study aims to assess multiple influences on alpine groundwater management and to evaluate their role for potential future developments.

Identifying critical climate conditions for use in scenario-neutral climate impact assessments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Climate change impact assessment; Scenario-neutral; Bottom-up		Scenario-neutral climate impact assessments are being used increasingly to assess water resource system responses to possible climate changes. The purpose of such assessments is to identify system sensitivity to a range of plausible climate conditions, often including an evaluation of the joint effect of multiple climate stressors. Given the large number of climate variables and associated statistics (averages, seasonality, intermittency, extremes, etc.) that could plausibly change and impact on system performance, it is essential that scenario-neutral assessments focus on those to which the system is most sensitive. A generic approach to identifying these 'critical' climate conditions is presented and tested on the Lake Como reservoir in Northern Italy considering two system objectives: irrigation deficit and flood reliability. Results indicate that different climate conditions are critical for the two objectives, and that the choice of which climate conditions to include has a significant effect on the climate impact assessment outcome.

Many studies have recommended managed aquifer recharge (MAR) to improve groundwater quality and enhance water security. However, MAR appropriateness and feasibility in Qatar remain unexplored. This study establishes key MAR development indicators in Qatar considering current technical and socioeconomic factors. Results show that coupling the rainwater harvesting (RWH) and aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is the optimum scenario for aquifer management and sustainability. In addition to resources augmentation, RWH will contribute to flash flood prevention, which adversely affects the environment. In contrast, the in-channel modification and spreading methods can reduce up to 80% of the water available for recharge. Further work includes considering climate change impacts and uncertainty in MAR design for karst aquifers. A recovery rate up to 25% might be recorded in ASR karstic heterogeneous sites.

The quantification of climate change impacts on surface water availability is critical for agriculture production and flood management. The current study focuses on the projected streamflow variations in the transboundary Mangla Dam watershed. Precipitation and temperature changes combined with future water assessment in the watershed are projected by applying multiple downscaling techniques for three periods (2021-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099). Streamflows are simulated by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the outputs of five global circulation models (GCMs) and their ensembles under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Spatial and temporal changes in defined future flow indexes, such as base streamflow, average flow, and high streamflow have been investigated in this study. Results depicted an overall increase in average annual flows under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 up until 2099. The maximum values of low flow, median flow, and high flows under RCP 4.5 were found to be 55.96 m(3)/s, 856.94 m(3)/s, and 7506.2 m(3)/s and under RCP 8.5, 63.29 m(3)/s, 945.26 m(3)/s, 7569.8 m(3)/s, respectively, for these ensembles GCMs till 2099. Under RCP 4.5, the maximum increases in maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), precipitation (Pr), and average annual streamflow were estimated as 5.3 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, 128.4%, and 155.52%, respectively, up until 2099. In the case of RCP 8.5, the maximum increase in these hydro-metrological variables was up to 8.9 degrees C, 8.2 degrees C, 180.3%, and 181.56%, respectively, up until 2099. The increases in Tmax, Tmin, and Pr using ensemble GCMs under RCP 4.5 were found to be 1.95 degrees C, 1.68 degrees C and 93.28% (2021-2039), 1.84 degrees C, 1.34 degrees C, and 75.88%(2040-2069), 1.57 degrees C, 1.27 degrees C and 72.7% (2070-2099), respectively. Under RCP 8.5, the projected increases in Tmax, Tmin, and Pr using ensemble GCMs were found as 2.26 degrees C, 2.23 degrees C and 78.65% (2021-2039), 2.73 degrees C, 2.53 degrees C, and 83.79% (2040-2069), 2.80 degrees C, 2.63 degrees C and 67.89% (2070-2099), respectively. Three seasons (spring, winter, and autumn) showed a remarkable increase in streamflow, while the summer season showed a decrease in inflows. Based on modeling results, it is expected that the Mangla Watershed will experience more frequent extreme flow events in the future, due to climate change. These results indicate that the study of climate change's impact on the water resources under a suitable downscaling technique is imperative for proper planning and management of the water resources.

Several recent studies find that current and projected SLR is associated with relatively lower property values. We contribute to this growing body of research with a case study of O'ahu, Hawai'i, which is famed for its beaches as well as valuable coastal real estate. We leverage a dataset that unpacks multiple types of SLR exposure and coastal parcel attributes. We apply property transaction data for the island of O'ahu through 2019 to investigate the effect of current and expected SLR exposure on residential property prices. We find that exposed properties have already experienced declines in transaction prices, at 9 to 14%, attributed to expectations of exposure to chronic inundation (as opposed to seasonal flooding). The price declines are mainly for multi-dwelling homes as opposed to single family homes. The market response of residential properties to SLR has important implications for coastal management strategies, in particular the viability and timing of programs for retreat.

Resilience and Disaster Recovery Tool Suite for Evaluating Resilient Infrastructure Return on Investment with a Robust Decision-Making Metamodeling Approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article						planning and analysis; decision making; sustainability and resilience; natural hazards and extreme weather events; climate change; vulnerability and resilience assessment		There is a growing interest in enhancing the resilience of the transportation network in the face of hazards such as storms, flooding, and climate change impacts. Transportation agencies and planning organizations need tools to assess potential resilience-focused infrastructure projects and to support infrastructure project justifications. In support of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, we developed the open-source, publicly available Resilience and Disaster Recovery (RDR) Tool Suite to evaluate resilient infrastructure return on investment. This tool suite is based on robust decision-making concepts that enable scenario analysis and decision making under uncertainty. The RDR Tool Suite leverages widely used travel demand modeling as well as benefit-cost analysis, breakeven analysis, and benefit-cost analysis under uncertainty to accommodate a range of data availability. The tool suite also includes an Exposure Analysis Tool to assist with assigning hazard severity to the transportation network. This paper provides an overview of the newly released RDR Tool Suite and its utility for transportation planning.	[Lewis, Kristin C. C.; Badgley, Jonathan; Flynn, Dan F.

The results indicated that GM (1, 1) model was applicable to the prediction of groundwater quality. The prediction performance showed that the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) for pH and temperature were less than 10%, indicating that it had a highly accurate prediction. The MAPEs for conductivity, chloride, and total dissolved solids were between 10 and 20%, indicating that it had a good prediction. The MAPEs for ammonia, sulfate, total hardness, total organic carbon, iron, and manganese were between 20 and 50%, indicating that it had a reasonable prediction. But it had an inaccurate prediction for total alkalinity. Through the study, it is possible to develop an early warning tool for reducing the risk of water shortage during flood and drought due to climate change in the basin.

The regional floodplain evaluation matrix (RegioFEM), a method to support a future-oriented flood risk management at a regional scale, was applied in a section of the Raab River in Austria. The developed method uses several parameters assessing the consequences of changes in the study area, which lead to changes in flood risk. Settlement development, planned flood protection measures and the likely increase of flood runoff due to climatic changes are considered. Parameters include hydrological (e.g., peak reduction), hydraulic (inundation area), spatial (affected buildings) and monetary (damage potential) ones. The results of the application of the RegioFEM were presented at a regional expert workshop, conducted to gain feedback about the possibilities and limitations of implementing the method into practice. Considering future changes and evaluating their impacts on flood risk can provide stakeholders and decision makers valuable information for sustainable flood risk management.

To this end, a qualitative methodology was adopted, based on symbolic interactionism which followed procedures of analysis of grounded theory. 33 interviews were conducted using the criteria of a theoretical sampling. The findings highlight the significant role of previous experience with coastal flooding risk, habituation to the risk, and the emotional bond with the place as determinants of risk perception. Similarly, mistrust in government institutions regarding their role in managing this risk has emerged as a relevant factor, as they are considered ineffective, co-opted, negligent and corrupt. When there is a strongly perceived risk, together with a significant degree of rootedness in the place and a lack of planning for action in the event of the materialization of this threat, this mistrust appears to increase feelings of hopelessness and impotence to cope with coastal flooding risk.

We estimate that the Milam glacier has receded by 1565.4 +/- 20.6 m (31.9 +/- 0.4 m a(-1)) over the period 1968-2017, while lower recession rate (21.1 +/- 1.7 m a(-1) ) was observed between 2001 and 2017. The Milam glacier lost 2.27 +/- 0.06 km(2) of its area from 1968 to 2017 due to recession. Two tributary glaciers detached from the main trunk between 1990 and 2017, which indicates glacier thinning and melting. The glacier recession also resulted in deformation of moraine ridges on either sides in lower ablation zone of Milam glacier, which is caused due to the removal of basal ice support caused by glacier melting.

In the present study, vulnerability assessment was carried out in nine floodplain wetlands from three districts of West Bengal using stakeholder perception and ecological conditions. In absence of long-term time series data on ecology and fisheries of wetlands, stakeholder perception study was carried out to assess the vulnerability status to climate change. Phased interviews were conducted using structured questionnaires to study the stakeholder perception on climatic variability and changes in ecology and fisheries of wetlands over the past 15 years. Climate data used for climate trend analysis was procured from Indian Meteorological Department. Ecological parameters were studied from the wetlands seasonally from January 2018 to December 2018. Analysis of climatic variables for last three decades revealed a warming trend and decreasing rainfall in the study area. The temperature anomaly ranged from + 0.07 to + 0.31 degrees C while rainfall anomaly ranged from - 61.41 to - 372.62 mm. Respondents showed high level of consensus (75.3%) on climate change awareness. The respondents were aware of the fact that climate anomaly affects ecology and fisheries of wetlands in most of the cases with consensus ranging from 67.8 to 94.7%. The studied wetlands showed 2 to 81.28% reduction in depth, 21.52-61.29% reduction in species diversity, and 30-95% macrophyte infestation. The stakeholder perception-based vulnerability scores ranged from 18 to 31 and indicated 6 out of 9 wetlands (66.6%) as highly vulnerable and the rest as moderately vulnerable. The ecological vulnerability scores ranged from 17 to 21 and indicated 5 out of 9 wetlands (55.6%) as highly vulnerable and 4 wetlands in the moderately vulnerable range. Although both the approaches used in the present study categorized the studied wetlands as moderately to highly vulnerable, the category of some of the wetlands varied in both the approaches. This suggests that utilizing a single approach may not give precise vulnerability status of an ecosystem. Use of combined approaches for construction of a composite vulnerability index covering different aspects impacted by climate change might present a better picture of the vulnerability status and aid in formulation of effective mitigation/management plan.

A Systematic Review of How Multiple Stressors From an Extreme Event Drove Ecosystem-Wide Loss of Resilience in an Iconic Seagrass Community	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Review						extreme climate events; marine heatwaves; seagrass; resilience; multiple stressors; resistance; recovery	OLIVE SEA-SNAKE; SHARK BAY; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMPHIBOLIS-ANTARCTICA; TIGER SHARKS; HABITAT USE; HERVEY-BAY; DUGONGS; TEMPERATURE	y A central question in contemporary ecology is how climate change will alter ecosystem structure and function across scales of space and time. Climate change has been shown to alter ecological patterns from individuals to ecosystems, often with negative implications for ecosystem functions and services. Furthermore, as climate change fuels more frequent and severe extreme climate events (ECEs) like marine heatwaves (MHWs), such acute events become increasingly important drivers of rapid ecosystem change. However, our understanding of ECE impacts is hampered by limited collection of broad scale in situ data where such events occur. In 2011, a MHW known as the Ningaloo Nino bathed the west coast of Australia in waters up to 4 degrees C warmer than normal summer temperatures for almost 2 months over 1000s of kilometers of coastline. We revisit published and unpublished data on the effects of the Ningaloo Nino in the seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Western Australia (24.6-26.6 degrees S), at the transition zone between temperate and tropical seagrasses. Therein we focus on resilience, including resistance to and recovery from disturbance across local, regional and ecosystem-wide spatial scales and over the past 8 years. Thermal effects on temperate seagrass health were severe and exacerbated by simultaneous reduced light conditions associated with sediment inputs from record floods in the south-eastern embayment and from increased detrital loads and sediment destabilization. Initial extensive defoliation of Amphibolis antarctica, the dominant seagrass, was followed by rhizome death that occurred in 60-80% of the bay's meadows, equating to decline of over 1,000 km(2) of meadows. This loss, driven by direct abiotic forcing, has persisted, while indirect biotic effects (e.g., dominant seagrass loss) have allowed colonization of some areas by small fast-growing tropical@species (e.g., Halodule uninervis). Those biotic effects also impacted multiple consumer populations including turtles and dugongs, with implications for species dynamics, food web structure, and ecosystem recovery. We show multiple stressors can combine to evoke extreme ecological responses by pushing ecosystems beyond their tolerance. Finally, both direct abiotic and indirect biotic effects need to be explicitly considered when attempting to understand and predict how ECEs will alter marine ecosystem dynamics.

Through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, the study focuses on evaluating the uncertainty introduced by key model input parameter, namely the roughness coefficient, runoff coefficient, and precipitation intensity. Notably, the precipitation intensity incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty, including RCP scenario, climate model, and probability distribution function. To analyze the uncertainties, a surrogate hydrodynamic/hydrologic model based on a physical 2D model is employed.The findings of this study challenge the traditional use of deterministic flood maps and climate factors, highlighting the necessity of employing probabilistic approaches for the development of accurate and secure flood maps. Moreover, the research findings indicate that the primary source of uncertainty in precipitation is the selection of the probability distribution, followed by the choice of climate model, and to a lesser extent, the specific RCP scenario.

Tradeoffs between beach nourishment and managed retreat: Insights from dynamic programming for climate adaptation decisions	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Managed retreat; Beach nourishment; Dynamic programming; Coastal management; Climate change adaptation; Sea level rise	SEA-LEVEL RISE; COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; COASTAL EROSION; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; ROBUST; POLICY; STRATEGIES; PATHWAYS; DISASTER; BEHAVIOR	Coastlines are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion, and flooding, all predicted to worsen as climate change continues. Models are needed that incorporate dynamic processes within coupled economic and physical systems for decision-makers, including when to retreat from hazardous areas. This paper presents a coupled geo-economic model of beach width and property value with exogenous sea level rise. Discrete dynamic programming identifies optimal beach nourishment and managed retreat strategies. As a new contribution, we treat expected damages as costs, which demonstrates that increased damage offsets some benefits of development along hazardous coastlines. The model identifies managed retreat as preferable to beach nourishment when damages exceed a threshold. Regret associated with retreat depends on sea level rise damages and the timeframe of analysis. Considering dynamic complexity of coastal systems, as this model does, may produce climate adaptation plans that better address community needs and reduce risk over timescales of interest.

Although tropical floodplains remain relatively conserved and ecologically functional compared to those at higher latitudes, they face accelerated hydropower development, climate change, and deforestation. Alterations to the flood pulse could act synergistically with other drivers of change to promote profound ecological state change at a large spatial scale. State change occurs when an ecosystem reaches a critical threshold or tipping point, which leads to an alternative qualitative state for the ecosystem. Visualizing an alternative state for Amazonian floodplains is not straightforward. Yet, it is critical to recognize that changes to the flood pulse could push tropical floodplain ecosystems over a tipping point with cascading adverse effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We characterize the Amazonian flood pulse regime, summarize evidence of flood pulse change, assess potential ecological repercussions, and provide a monitoring framework for tracking flood pulse change and detecting biotic responses.

Tidal flood area mapping in the face of climate change scenarios: case study in a tropical estuary in the Brazilian semi-arid region	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; COASTAL; EXTREMES	Previous studies on tidal flood mapping are mostly through continental- and/or global-scale approaches. Moreover, the few works on local-scale perception are concentrated in Europe, Asia, and North America. Here, we present a case study approaching a tidal flood risk mapping application in the face of climate change scenarios in a region with a strong environmental and social appeal. The study site is an estuarine cut in the Brazilian semi-arid region, covering part of two state conservation units, which has been suffering severe consequences from tidal flooding in recent years. In this case study, we used high-geodetic-precision data (lidar DEM), together with robust tidal return period statistics and data from current sea level rise scenarios. We found that approximately 327.60 km(2) of the estuary is under tidal flood risk and in need of mitigation measures. This case study can serve as a basis for future management actions, as well as a model for applying risk mapping in other coastal areas.

J	Tran, TA				Thong Anh Tran			Learning as an everyday adaptation practice in the rural Vietnamese Mekong Delta	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Editorial Material						Adaptation; floods; learning; rural livelihoods; Vietnamese Mekong Delta	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; FARMERS	The everyday adaptation practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta are characterized by the well-defined nuance of human-nature interactions under the compounding impacts of climate change, localized dyke development policies, and upstream hydropower dynamics. This gives rise to a so-called 'learn-to-adapt' approach that has been widely practised by the rural societies. This viewpoint argues that learning constitutes a key form of adaptation that enables rural farmers to bring together pools of adaptive knowledge in resolving shared problems. It particularly illustrates the significance of communicative and reflective learning practices that enable farmers to communicate and exchange experimental and experiential knowledge. These everyday practices enable farmers to make informed decisions in mobilizing necessary resources and capacity to accommodate changing conditions and secure their livelihoods at stake. The viewpoint particularly highlights how the everyday adaptation practices allow farmers to develop a variety of innovative production models which contribute to not only enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity but also advancing rural development policies.

There is the need to study the trend and statistics for better planning, preparation and adaptation. In this study, the statistical and temporal variation of climatic indices Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was computed for eighteen (18) stations covering four climatic zones (Sahel, Midland, Guinea Savannah and Coastal) of tropical Nigeria. Precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature from 1980 to 2010 obtained from the archives of the Nigerian Meteorological Services were used to compute both the SPI and SPEI indices at 1-, 3- 6- and 12-month timescales. The temporal variation of drought indices showed that droughts were more prominent at 6- and 12-month timescales. SPI and SPEI were found to be better correlated at longer timescales than short timescales. Predominant small, positive and significant trend across the region suggest an increasing trend due to climate change.

The three hydrological models were able to capture the flow dynamics accurately in both calibration and validation periods. The mean daily maximum (minimum) temperature of UBN are projected to increase by about 1.35 degrees C-2.38 degrees C (1.72 degrees C-2.74 degrees C) under the RCP4.5 climate scenario and 2.22 degrees C-4.47 degrees C (2.5 degrees C-5.1 degrees C) under RCP8.5 climate scenario in future periods with reference to 1976-2005 as the base period. However, changes projected for the mean annual precipitation vary widely, ranging from -10.3% to 19.4%. The projected increase in evapotranspiration and increase or decrease in precipitation will result in a projected increase or decrease in streamflow of UBN. Overall, the median of mean annual streamflow of UBN is projected to decrease by 7.6% within a range of -19.7% to +17.7% in the 2050s and by 12.7% within a range of -26.8% to +31.6% in the 2080s. The ensemble mean of annual maxima (minima) of high return periods are projected by the three hydrologic models to be larger (smaller) in the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. On the whole, uncertainties due to the structure of hydrologic models, especially for low flow projections, are likely larger than uncertainties from GCMs and climate change scenarios.

FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						climate change; climate-growth relationships; dendroecology; groundwater-fed forests; growth response; Rhine Valley	FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RING GROWTH; RESPONSES; DENDROCHRONOLOGY; VEGETATION; DECLINE; SIGNALS; IMPACTS; MORTALITY	In future, groundwater dependent ecosystems are likely to face increasing stress from direct and indirect effects of climate change. European floodplain forests already experience lower groundwater tables caused by river regulations and water extraction. Yet, the effects of more frequent and prolonged dry and hot periods in combination with groundwater extraction on floodplain forests are not well-understood. Here, we conducted a dendroecological study in floodplain forests dominated by pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), a widespread forest type in Europe. Since drought-related precipitation deficits are increasingly less compensated by available groundwater, we hypothesized that groundwater extraction would increase climate sensitivity of growth. Moreover, we expected that younger trees that established under the condition of lowered groundwater tables would be less sensitive to droughts in contrast to older trees that might not be able to adapt to abrupt changes in groundwater levels. In three regions in the Upper Rhine Valley of Germany, we analyzed retrospectively tree-ring growth in Q. robur stands where (a) water extraction had dramatically lowered groundwater levels and trees presumably lost direct access to it, or (b) trees have not been affected by water extraction. In addition, (c) nearby sessile oak (Q. petraea) stands at upland sites were analyzed to isolate the climate signal for each study region from a groundwater signal. In total, we analyzed ring-width chronologies from 18 forest stands and investigated their relationship with climate. Radial growth of oak trees was strongly correlated with summer drought (SPEI, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index). Their sensitivity to summer drought increased significantly following the onset of groundwater extraction (88-49 years ago). However, sensitivity of oaks to summer drought at sites with groundwater contact remained relatively stable over time. Oaks at sites without water extraction took advantage of favorable growing conditions. Our results show that access to groundwater can buffer negative effects of summer drought on tree growth. Therefore, in the face of the ongoing climate change and more frequent occurrence of extreme drought events, we recommend that groundwater extraction from floodplain forests should be reduced rather than increased to maintain tree vitality in the long term.

In addition, this study was intended to explore ways for quantifying flood vulnerability and mitigating the impact of data uncertainty on flood vulnerability through multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The MCDM method was applied as a representative method to quantify flood vulnerability, which considers regional priorities. This study used the weighted summation method, TOPSIS, and VIKOR to calculate all CFVs for medium-sized cities. Furthermore, fuzzy- and grey-TOPSIS were included to account for the uncertainty inherent in the MCDM methods, such as the usage of average values and varying weighting values for all CFV indicators across stakeholders. This study incorporated expert surveys and the entropy approach to derive subjective and objective weights for all conceivable indicators. As a result, we looked at the proposed grey-TOPSIS technique, which can minimize the uncertainty. Finally, grey-TOPSIS can notably provide robust and sustainable prioritizing since it actively reflects the views of multiple stakeholders and takes uncertainty in the data into account.

Ectomycorrhiza resilience and recovery to extreme flood events in <i>Tuber aestivum</i> and <i>Quercus robur</i>	MYCORRHIZA			English	Article						Flooding; Climate change; Soil saturation; Quercus robur (oak); Tuber aestivum (summer truffle); Mycorrhiza	DIVERSITY; SPORES; IMPACT; TIME; RISK	Very little is known about the impact of flooding and ground saturation on ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcM) and increasing flood events are expected with predicted climate change. To explore this, seedlings inoculated with the EcM species Tuber aestivum were exposed to a range of flood durations. Oak seedlings inoculated with T. aestivum were submerged for between 7 and 65 days. After a minimum of 114-day recovery, seedling growth measurements were recorded, and root systems were destructively sampled to measure the number of existing mycorrhizae in different zones. Number of mycorrhizae did not display correlation with seedling growth measurements. Seven days of submersion resulted in a significant reduction in mycorrhizae numbers and numbers reduced most drastically in the upper zones. Increases in duration of submersion further impacted mycorrhizae numbers in the lowest soil zone only. T. aestivum mycorrhizae can survive flood durations of at least 65 days. After flooding, mycorrhizae occur in higher numbers in the lowest soil zone, suggesting a mix of resilience and recovery. The results will aid in furthering our understanding of EcM but also may aid in conservation initiatives as well as providing insight for those whose livelihoods revolve around the collection of EcM fruiting bodies or cropping of the plant partners.

IMPACTS OF NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS LOADS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES ON THE QUALITY OF SURFACE WATER BODIES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE - CASE STUDY IN POLAND	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						water bodies; nutrients; mining areas; atmospheric deposition; agriculture	RIVER	Climate change has the influence on the occurrence of phenomena such as extreme precipitation, flooding or prolonged rainless periods. The changes in precipitation characteristics have an impact on the nutrient cycle, especially in urban areas. The changes in water management on post mining areas could potentially deepen the problem. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of phosphorus and nitrogen loads from point and dispersed sources onto the water quality of analysed rivers in Poland. The proportion of nutrient loads discharged from different sources was calculated based on the available database, and the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in river waters were analyzed by analytical methods. The results showed that the investment in the water treatment sector is not enough to achieve good status of surface water bodies. The dispersed sources influenced much more the quality of water rivers. The atmospheric deposition is a significant source of nitrogen and may be caused by the progressive changes in the climate. The extreme precipitation increase nitrogen flushed from agricultural systems and will pose greater risks to environmental stability of water. More sophisticated monitoring system of nutrients discharging form different sources may be an opportunity to reduce the pollution in rivers.

There is strong evidence of increasing flood hazards in many regions around the world. The choice of methods and assumptions used in flood hazard estimates can impact the design of risk management strategies. In this study, we characterize the expected flood hazards conditioned on the uncertain model structures, model parameters, and prior distributions of the parameters. We construct a Bayesian framework for river stage return level estimation using a nonstationary statistical model that relies exclusively on the Indian Ocean Dipole Index. We show that ignoring uncertainties can lead to biased estimation of expected flood hazards. We find that the considered model parametric uncertainty is more influential than model structures and model priors. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty in extreme flood stage estimates, and are of practical use for informing water infrastructure designs in a changing climate.

While empirical findings in this literature are mixed, we know less about how climate changes increase the risks for conflicts between countries. This article studies climate variability using the issue approach to world politics. We examine whether climate variability influences the onset and militarization of interstate diplomatic conflicts and whether these effects are similar across issues that involve sovereignty claims for land (territory) or water (maritime, river). We focus on two theoretical mechanisms: scarcity (abundance) and uncertainty. We measure these concepts empirically through climate deviation (e.g. droughts/floods, heat waves/cold spells) and climate volatility (greater short-term variance in precipitation/temperature). Analyses of issue claims in the Western Hemisphere and Europe (1901-2001) show that greater deviations and volatility in climate conditions increase risks for new diplomatic conflicts and militarization of ongoing issues and that climate change acts as a trigger for revisionist states.

High-resolution, state-of-the-art pluvial flood models are urgently needed to inform climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures but are generally not empirically tested because of the rarity of local high-intensity precipitation events and the lack of monitoring capabilities. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) collected by professionals, non-professionals and citizens and made available on the internet can be used to monitor the dynamic extent of a pluvial flood during and after an extreme rain event but is sometimes considered to be unreliable. In this paper, we explore the general utility of VGI to evaluate the performance of pluvial flood models and gain new insights to improve these models. As background for our research, we use the capital city of Budapest, which recently suffered three heavy rainfall events in just five years (2015, 2017 and 2020). For each pluvial flood event, we collected photographic evidence from different online media sources and estimated the associated water depths at various locations in the city from the image context. These were compared with the results of a 2D pluvial flood model that has been shown to provide comparable results to other state-of-the-art inundation models and is easily transferred to other urban areas due to its reliance on open data sources. We introduce a general methodology for comparing VGI with model data by probing different spatial resolutions. Our findings highlight untapped potential and fundamental challenges in using VGI for model evaluation. It is proposed that VGI may become an essential tool and improve the confidence in model-based risk assessments for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.

Knowledge coproduction on the impact of decisions for waterbird habitat in a changing climate	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; climate adaptation; decision support; land use change; participatory modeling; scenario planning; water supply; wetland restoration	BIODIVERSITY; SCENARIOS; DILEMMAS; SCIENCE	Scientists, resource managers, and decision makers increasingly use knowledge coproduction to guide the stewardship of future landscapes under climate change. This process was applied in the California Central Valley (USA) to solve complex conservation problems, where managed wetlands and croplands are flooded between fall and spring to support some of the largest concentrations of shorebirds and waterfowl in the world. We coproduced scenario narratives, spatially explicit flooded waterbird habitat models, data products, and new knowledge about climate adaptation potential. We documented our coproduction process, and using the coproduced models, we determined when and where management actions make a difference and when climate overrides these actions. The outcomes of this process provide lessons learned on how to cocreate usable information and how to increase climate adaptive capacity in a highly managed landscape. Actions to restore wetlands and prioritize their water supply created habitat outcomes resilient to climate change impacts particularly in March, when habitat was most limited; land protection combined with management can increase the ecosystem's resilience to climate change; and uptake and use of this information was influenced by the roles of different stakeholders, rapidly changing water policies, discrepancies in decision-making time frames, and immediate crises of extreme drought. Although a broad stakeholder group contributed knowledge to scenario narratives and model development, to coproduce usable information, data products were tailored to a small set of decision contexts, leading to fewer stakeholder participants over time. A boundary organization convened stakeholders across a large landscape, and early adopters helped build legitimacy. Yet, broadscale use of climate adaptation knowledge depends on state and local policies, engagement with decision makers that have legislative and budgetary authority, and the capacity to fit data products to specific decision needs.

Understanding the effects of climate change (CC) and human activities (HAs) on hydrological process is important for regional water resources management and water security. However, a comprehensive assessment of the effects of CC and HAs on runoff dynamics at different time scales in the Chengbi River Basin is still lacking. To address these needs, we used Budyko Mezentsev-Choudhurdy-Yang and Slope change ratio of accumulative quantity methods to assess the contribution of the changing environment to annual and intra-annual runoff changes in the Chengbi River Basin. The results indicated that annual runoff time series was divided into the base phase Ta (1980-1996) and the change phase Tb (1997-2019). Compared to the natural status in Ta, the relative contributions of CC and HAs to the runoff increase in Tb were 154.86% and-54.86%. In addition, the shift in intra-annual runoff occurred in 2007 and was mainly caused by HAs, with a contribution rate of 76.22%. The increase in annual runoff in Tb could be attributed to the positive contribution of rainfall. Changes in rainfall and reservoir construction altered the original state of intra-annual runoff. Furthermore, the high degree of heterogeneity in the surface karst zone increased the runoff coefficient. The spatial unsaturation of the subsurface water-bearing media and rainfall patterns caused a significant lag effect in the response of surface runoff to rainfall. This study can help re-searchers and policy makers to better understand the response of karst runoff to changing environment and provide insights for future water resources management and flood control measures.

Thus, how the floods induced by intense hurricanes respond to these potential changes is of great concern. This study investigates the future warmer climate impacts on hurricane-induced extreme rainfall, and-more importantly-the subsequent compound flooding at the watershed scale (from an event-based analysis perspective). To this goal, a modeling framework is designed based on the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), the Two-Dimensional fvand the Regional Community Earth System Model (R-CESM). The framework was applied to Hurricane Harvey (2017) at the Clear Creek watershed (a coastal watershed in the southern Houston) as a case study. The results show that the projected maximum rainfall totals over the watershed would be exacerbated by 17.7 % and 49.7 % in the 2050s and 2090s (respectively) under Repre-sentative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). This means a 16.1 % increase in Harvey rainfall over the watershed per degree Celsius increase in Mean Surface Temperature over the Gulf of Mexico region (18 degrees -31 degrees N, 77 degrees -98 degrees W). Meanwhile, the increases in maximum inundation extent would be 11.0 % (2050s) and 19.5 % (2090s). Furthermore, considerable increases in maximum inundation depth and duration in regions along the middle and downstream of Clear Creek (and also those around Clear Lake) are expected. The projected SLR will have little effect on the maximum inundation depth and extent if storm surge changes are not taken into account; meanwhile, it will influence the inundation duration at downstream locations. This modeling framework can be also applied at other coastal watersheds to evaluate the projected climate change impacts on the compound flooding induced by extreme climate events.

A global perspective on tropical montane rivers	SCIENCE			English	Review							CLIMATE-CHANGE; WESTERN-GHATS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; ANDES; FLOW; TEMPERATURE; MOUNTAINS; EVOLUTION	Tropical montane rivers (TMR) are born in tropical mountains, descend through montane forests, and feed major rivers. floodplains, and oceans. They are characterized by rapid temperature dines and varied flow disturbance regimes, both of which promote habitat heterogeneity, high biological diversity and endemism, and distinct organisms' life-history adaptations. Production, transport, and processing of sediments, nutrients, and carbon are key ecosystem processes connecting high-elevation streams with lowland floodplains, in turn influencing soil fertility and biotic productivity downstream.TMR provide key ecosystem services to hundreds of millions of people in tropical nations. In light of existing human-induced disturbances, including climate change, TMR can be used as natural model systems to examine the effects of rapid changes in abiotic drivers and their influence on biodiversity and ecosystem function.

Here we call for a causal inference framework to advance the science and management of the effect of any forest or its removal on flood severity and frequency. The causes of floods are multiple and chancy and, hence, can only be investigated via a probabilistic approach. We use the stochastic hydrology literature to infer a blueprint framework which could guide future research on the understanding and prediction of the effects of forests on floods in environments where rain is the dominant form of precipitation. Drawing parallels from other disciplines, we show that the introduction of probability in forest hydrology could stimulate a gestalt switch in the science of forests and floods. In light of increasing flood risk caused by climate change, this probabilistic framework can help policymakers develop robust forest and water management plans based on a defensible and clear understanding of floods.

Against the backdrop of the recent devastating floods in the Kwazulu-Natal province of South Africa, this paper explores psychotraumatology of natural disasters. In particular, we explore the impact of internal migration in South Africa, as well as apartheid spatial planning and inequality on the consequences of the flooding. We also focus on the psychotraumatology resulting from flooding, in general, and in particular on the victims of the flooding in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. We conclude that the psychopathological consequences of such natural disasters are ignored even though they seriously affect the people concerned. The development of specific trainings for psychologists in psychotraumatology and the care of victims should be a priority in the future. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

A bias-adjustment method for extreme precipitation intensity is proposed that preserves the scaling equation for different accumulation levels from hourly to daily, using intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) modeling. A validation is performed within a pseudo-reality setting, based on hourly precipitation from 28 regional climate model projections of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble over Belgium. The scaling-based adjustment methods improve upon previous methods, an optimal method is identified, and, analytical quantile mapping methods must be avoided due to three identified problems. The ensemble mean of the adjusted extreme precipitation intensity obeys the above-mentioned scale-invariance property, which is consistent with observed extreme intensities. We thus show that IDF modeling provides added value in the context of bias-adjustment, and, that the particular IDF model proposed balances well between accuracy and the preservation of desired properties such as scale invariance and consistency among rainfall durations.

Digital twin technologies can provide decisionmakers with effective tools to rapidly evaluate city resilience under projected floods. However, the development of city digital twins for flood predictions is challenging due to the time-consuming, uncertain processes of developing, calibrating, and coupling physics-based hydrologic and hydraulic models. In this study, a flood prediction methodology (FPM) that integrates synchronization analysis and deep-learning is developed to directly simulate the complex relationships between rainfall and flood characteristics, bypassing the computationally expensive hydrologic-hydraulic models, with the City of Calgary being used for demonstration. The developed FPM presents the core of data-driven digital twins that, with real-time sensor data, can rapidly provide early warnings before flood realization, as well as information about vulnerable areas-enabling city resilience planning considering different climate change scenarios.

Given the importance of soils for the functioning of ecosystems and development and improvement of bio-economic conditions, the risk and rate of soil erosion was assessed using the RUSLE model in Iran's Lorestan province before and after a period of major floods in late 2018 and early 2019. Furthermore, soil erosion was calculated for current and future conditions based on the Global Soil Erosion Modeling Database (GloSEM). Through the analysis of rainfall events, as the most important agent of soil erosion, the average R-factors for the period before and after flooding were 58.87 and 157.6 MJ mm ha(- 1) h(- 1) y(- 1), respectively. The results showed that agricultural development and land use change are the main causes of land degradation in the southern and central parts of the study area. The impact of floods was also significant since our evaluations showed that soil erosion increased from 4.12 t ha(- 1) yr(- 1) before the floods to 10.93 t ha(- 1) yr(- 1) afterwards. Field surveys using 64 ground control points determined that erodibility varies from 0.17 to 0.49% in the study area. Orchards, farms, rangelands, and forests with moderate or low vegetation cover were the most vulnerable land uses to soil erosion. The results of GloSEM modeling revealed that climate change is the main cause of change in the rate of soil erosion. The results also established that when the combined effects of land use change and climate change are taken into account, soil erosion has increased under SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP8.5 scenarios, so that about 80% of the region has experienced moderate to very high erosion. Therefore, both natural factors (e.g. climate change) and human factors (e.g. agricultural development, population growth, and overgrazing) are among the drivers of soil erosion in the study area.

Multi-century tree-ring anatomical evidence reveals increasing frequency and magnitude of spring discharge and floods in eastern boreal Canada	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article						Climate change; Atmospheric circulation; Dendrohydrology; Earlywood vessels; Fraxinus nigra; Lake Duparquet	GREAT-LAKES REGION; NORTHERN QUEBEC; FRAXINUS-NIGRA; EARLYWOOD VESSELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BLACK ASH; PALEOFLOOD HYDROLOGY; FIRE FREQUENCY; ICE-AGE; RIVER	In eastern boreal Canada, variability in river discharge is poorly understood at the multi-century scale due to short instrumental records. In recent decades, increased magnitude and frequency of spring floods have raised concerns about the potential effects of climate change on flood risk. Unlike tree-ring width, flood rings have a demonstrated dendrochronological utility for reconstructing high discharge in boreal environments. In this study, twelve chronologies of earlywood vessel cross-sectional area (a new hydrological proxy) and ring width were developed from riparian Fraxinus nigra trees periodically flooded in spring. These chronologies were used as predictors of Harricana River spring discharge, which was reconstructed for the period 1771?2016. The reconstruction captured 69% of the variance over a 102-year calibration period. The reconstruction indicates that the magnitude and frequency of spring high discharge has increased since the end of the Little Ice Age (1850?1870 CE) and since 1950. The change from a multi-decadal frequency in the late 19th century to a decadal and then interannual frequency in the late 20th century is associated with an increase in snow cover over much of central-eastern Canada. The association between the reconstructed spring discharge and spring atmospheric circulation indices NINO3.4, AMO, NAO may also have changed in these periods and further work is needed to assess the stability of these associations. The correlation between reconstructed and instrumental spring discharge at the regional scale, as well as the shared features in reconstructed discharge and other paleorecords from subarctic Que?bec suggest a common hydrological signal across the study area and for the early 20th to 21st centuries. The unprecedently low and high spring discharge in recent decades compared to the historical natural variability of the last 250 years also suggests that the increase in flood frequency and magnitude originates from climate change.

The presence of snow and ice results in heat balance changes and other land surface feedbacks that have implications for patterns of mountain glacier retreat and the dynamics of mountain geomorphic systems. This study considers the sensitivity of the mountain cryosphere (snow, ice, permafrost) to global climate change, and the implications of this sensitivity analysis for evaluating mountain surface stability, geomorphic change, and the generation of mountain geohazards. Consideration of these issues is informed by evidence from case studies reported in the literature and by field observations of mountain system dynamics worldwide. Results show that 'sensitivity' to climate forcing has been interpreted and defined in different ways in mountain snow, ice, and permafrost systems, with respect to properties such as albedo, mass balance or rapidity of system change. There are also significant spatial differences in sensitivity between different mountain blocks for snow, ice and permafrost, and these regions are therefore likely to follow different trajectories of geomorphic change in response to climate forcing, related to their physiographic properties and the extent of cryospheric coverage. Within glaciated mountains in particular, the relative timing of different geomorphic events, and the interplay between slope, glacier front, and proglacial sediment sources and environments, may vary depending on glacier size, geomorphic setting, and microclimate. By contrast, responses to permafrost warming (increased surface instability and mass movements) and changes in snow patterns (avalanche risk, floods) may have quite different spatial and temporal patterns and influenced by different environmental controls. An integrated evolutionary model for mountain system development under a changing cryosphere is proposed, highlighting the critical role of energy balance as a forcing factor that then triggers downstream mountain system responses. This suggests that different elements of mountain systems exhibit different sensitivities, and furthermore that these sensitivities change over time and space through the period of anthropogenic global warming and paraglacial relaxation.

J	Zhang, LP; Zhou, P				Zhang, L. P.; Zhou, P.			Reassessment of global climate risk: non-compensatory or compensatory?	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						Composite indicator; Climate risk; Normalization; Non-compensatory	COMPOSITE INDICATORS; CHANGE IMPACTS; FLOOD RISK; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK; MANAGEMENT; INDEX; METHODOLOGIES; BENEFIT	Evidence shows the global climate will continue to change over this century and beyond. A clear understanding of the climate change risk is suggested to be the foundation of the human adaptation. The plausible climate risk index reported by Germanwatch may be criticized as the fully compensatory assumption among underlying indicators, and the risk performance of each country in absolute terms cannot be assessed as the information on indicator level lost. We formulate an enhanced non-compensatory assessment scheme to reassess country's risk performance under climate change by means of penalizing underlying indicators that fail to satisfy certain criteria. Based on the new scheme, we can genuinely restrict the compensability among underlying indicators and provide informative decision aiding. A case study is performed to illustrate the effectiveness of our analysis by constructing a new climate risk index for 119 countries in terms of death toll, deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, absolute losses in PPP and losses per GDP unit.

Climate models CMCC-CMS, HadGEM-AO2, and MIROC5 were used to predict future climate and streamflow for three future periods: near-future (2020-2050), mid-future (2050-2080), and far-future (2080-2100) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The future projection shows an increase in mean annual temperature from 0.08 to 4.3 degrees C by CMCC-CMS, from 0.13 to 4.4 degrees C by HadGEM-AO2, and-0.07 to 4.2 degrees C MIROC5 models. Similarly, the annual precipitation is projected to fluctuate from 13.3 to 62.5% by CMCC-CMS, from-12.4 to 26.1% by HadGEM-AO2, and from 6.9 to 49% by the MIROC5 model. The 3S River Basin expects an increasing trend in streamflow in the Srepok and Sesan Rivers, while the Sekong is projected to have reduced streamflow.

Subsequently, the relationship between climate change and climate hazards was analyzed in this study. The secondary data analyzed included historical precipitation (1983-2017), flood and landslide events records, and Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model (RCM):A1B, A2 and B2 scenarios. By comparing the historical precipitation data with the RCM scenarios, the results showed that the precipitation was correlated with A1B scenario (r= 0.695). The relationship between climate change and hazards was identified to be a positive correlation. The historical daily precipitation (1983-2017) showed a positive correlation withflood and landslide events (r= 0.530, r = 0.797, respectively). As for prediction of climate hazards, the RCM AIR, A2 and B2 scenarios showed correlations with flood event: r= 0.648, 0.384 and 0.417, respectively. Similar results were obtained for landslide and the RCMA1B, A2 and B2 scenario: r = 0.498, 0.751 and 0.654, respectively. Precipitation simulation by PRECIS RCM indicated increased levels of precipitation in the Cameron High lands for the 2018 - 2069. Commensurate with this, great possibility of increasingly serious consequential hazards such as flood and landslide events are expected.

Here, we review the principal soil quality indicators (SQIs) to evaluate the sustainability of different grassland management practices globally. We discuss the importance of SQI assessment and the Soil Quality Minimum Dataset (MDS) specifically in the context of grasslands. We then review two potential solutions, the first of which is adopting grazing management, whereby sustainable grazing management plans (GMPs) offer great potential. The other solution is the development and adoption of novel grassland species, which may improve either drought resistance or infiltration rates, erosion and flooding. Sustainable grassland soil management can promote ecosystem service delivery and improve the resilience of the entire grassland ecosystem to anthropogenic change.

The future of cricket in an age of climate crisis	SPORT IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Climate change; social futures; extreme weather; politics; activism		This article responds to the recent call made in Sport in Society for scholarship that examines the social and political tensions of the age through cricket. Cricket is shown to be an international sport that emphasises the material, political and symbolic realities of the global climate crisis. Drawing on the concept of social futures, we argue that cricket is a significant site for the staging and perception of climate risks for worldwide audiences, and that a constellation of sporting, political, media and environmental actors are working to establish and communicate a new normative consensus about the game's role in averting the worst impacts of climate change. As the evidence presented suggests, the urgency of these efforts is underpinned by the sport's particular susceptibility to extreme heat, drought, rain and flooding, now and into the future.

The analysis of trends and other changes in the distribution of these phenomena uses the extreme value theory. This study proposes the use of the Weibull distribution for the evaluation of extreme events in precipitation. A correct assessment of probabilities of extreme precipitation events and their changes is important for stakeholders, particularly in agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, and insurance. This paper provides a simple approach in showing the trends in extreme precipitation in the western part of Mexico. The methodology has an additional virtue as it enables the calculation of probabilities of change in extreme events. With this, it is feasible to develop new methodologies for better understanding of climate change.

We simulate the temporally variable flood-water depth and inundation area under four designed rainfall patterns in the typical tropical rainforest city of Hue, Vietnam. The four rainfall types are R1 (peak at fifth hour), R2 (peak at 20th hour), R3 (peak at first hour), and R4 (peak at 13th hour). Results show that temporal rainfall pattern R4 with peak rainfall in the middle of the total period yielded the maximum water depth of 1.88 m. R3, with peak rainfall in the first hour, yields the shallowest maximum water depth and the largest inundation extent. When the water depth for R3 is 0.1-0.2 m, the inundated area caused by R3 is 3-4 times that of the other three patterns. Analysis of urban flood inundation in Hue provides a management tool to facilitate flood risk management in the context of extreme rainfall.

Theorizing the resilience district: Design-based decision making for coastal climate change adaptation	JOURNAL OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						Climate change; coastal flooding; risk; resilience districts		Today, coastal cities face mounting pressures to plan for increased exposure to chronic flooding, and ultimately significant sea level rise. The required investments in urban adaptation are inherently expensive, uncertain and long-term. These factors pose significant challenges for both effective choice and collective action. This paper argues that metropolitan 'resilience districts' offer the appropriate decision-making unit (DMU) to analyze, plan and implement resilience strategies. The working concept of 'resilience districts' for urban areas vulnerable to coastal flooding was first coined by a design team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spurred by a case study on the New Jersey Meadowlands from the 'Rebuild By Design' (RBD) competition. Cities have since begun using this term for their own resilience policies, failing to recognize the original intentions of its meaning. This analysis details a resilience districting strategy for the Greater Boston Metropolitan Area. The research culminates with a generalizable urban planning and design framework for protecting critical infrastructure, 'thickening' regional soft systems and transferring density to less vulnerable areas. The overall theme emphasizes landscape as a critical public safety service.

This is an example of a compound event in which two concurrent or consecutive events lead to extreme societal impacts. Compound and cascading hazards are becoming increasingly important and have notable impacts on threatened communities across the world. Wildfire followed by an intense precipitation event can result in a large flood under which the combined impacts of hazard drivers are much more intense than those from individual drivers. Here, we first quantify the change in exposure of natural gas infrastructure to individual hazards, wildfire and floods in the future relative to past. We, then quantify the compound hazards as coincidence likelihood of intense rain over burned areas and analyze the spatial patterns across the State of California, USA. Our results show that not only the exposure of natural gas infrastructure to individual hazards would be higher, the likelihood of compound hazards is expected to increase substantially in a warming climate.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change adaptation; Infrastructure; Monitoring and evaluation; Septic tank; Pit latrine	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYGIENE INTERVENTIONS; DRINKING-WATER; VULNERABILITY; DIARRHEA; SYSTEMS	The Solomon Islands, like other small island developing states in the Pacific, face significant challenges from a changing climate, and from increasing extreme weather events, while also lagging behind the rest of the world in terms of drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) services. In order to support planning for the implementation of national WaSH strategies and policies, this study contextualizes representative urban and rural baselines for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 ("by 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation"). We highlight specific threats to the current sanitation services under extreme weather events such as flooding and drought, both of which are commonly observed in the country, and provide suggestions for structural improvements to sanitation facilities to increase resiliency.

This paper looks at the most important activities from a tourism perspective and considers the likelihood of impacts by climate change based on an extended literature review. It also examines current trends in tourism demand and concludes with both general and activity-specific adaptation and mitigation measures. The data collection and review process covered the relevant peer reviewed and grey literature. This comprehensive process was based on, and was open to, contributions by the full scientific community of relevant Austrian researchers and experts. The compilation process of the report followed quality standards such as the involvement of international partners as review editors within the review process. For many activities, climate change will lead to a prolongation of the season, which is an advantage for destinations focusing on hiking, biking, swimming, water sports, air sports and golf. However, it can be shown that climate-induced phenomena will have a strong impact on many of these activities, such as climbing and alpine touring, fishing, golf, and water and air sports. Here, the impacts may even lead to a change of destination or activity. Adaptation opportunities are rather limited in these cases. For other activities, adaptation measures can be applied to maintain the existing tourism offer. Irrigation can be increased in the case of golf courses, the construction of pools is feasible to compensate for deteriorated lakes, and destroyed trails and other hiking infrastructure, such as alpine hazard protection, could be reconstructed. However, all these measures are cost-intensive and may have a negative influence on the overall holiday experience. An early warning system via media (based on heat, thunderstorms and heavy rain) would be important to enable adaptation measures for companies and guests. Management implications: The discussion over different adaptation strategies is of great importance for tourism management. The paper presents four major strategies: center dot Adaptation of the natural conditions: In this case, vulnerability can be reduced by improving the natural conditions, e.g. saving water by redesigning golf courses to improve fish habitats. center dot Technical adaptation of the infrastructure: Technical solutions such as irrigation, artificial pools, artificial canoe routes or the reconstruction of trails maintain the important tourism functions. center dot Technical adaptation of the equipment: the goal is an improvement of the equipment in order to continue the activity (e.g. type of boat, type of hang glider). center dot Awareness raising, information and early warning systems: For many activities, an early warning system would be helpful to avoid risky situations due to flooding, rockfall, thunder storms or extreme heat.

However, most of previously proposed methods to determine the effects of these factors have only been developed under the assumption of stationarity. Therefore, to overcome the existing research gap, an innovative method was proposed in this study to analyze and distinguish the effects of climate variability and human activities on extreme streamflow based on the non-stationarity theory. Accordingly, a rainfall-runoff model was developed using long-term hydrological data in the watersheds of Southeast China, which cover > 75,000 km(2). The model proposed in this study showed an acceptable performance, as indicated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and percent bias (PBIAS). The NSE, KGE, and |PBIAS| were 0.67-0.75, 0.57-0.74, and 1.22-16.79 during the calibration periods, respectively. And the NSE, KGE, and |PBIAS| were 0.69-0.77, 0.65-0.76, and 0.98-17.51 during the calibration periods, respectively. The trends of the extreme streamflow were analyzed for these watersheds at different time scales. The streamflow extremes at short time scales were found to be more sensitive to changing environment than those at longer time scales. The major factor controlling streamflow extremes at short time scales was human activities and climate change may be the dominant factor influencing streamflow extremes at long time scales. The findings of this study could provide useful insights into water management under global change conditions.

What Does Autonomous Adaptation to Climate Change Have to Teach Public Policy and Planning About Avoiding the Risks of Maladaptation in Bangladesh?	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Review						adaptation mainstreaming; livelihoods; land use; rural landscapes; sustainability; natural resource management; public policy	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CHANGE VULNERABILITY; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; IMPACTS; COMMUNITIES; AREAS; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; SYLHET	Climate vulnerability represents a highly complex public policy challenge for government due to its interaction with diverse social, political, economic, and ecological factors across scale. The policy challenge is further exacerbated when rural livelihood opportunities depend on multiple land use practices within shared social-ecological systems and adaptation actions related to one practice affects the others. In such cases, it becomes likely that national and regional-level adaptation plans will result in maladaptive trajectories if local context and properties are not carefully considered. This review highlights the importance of this issue to public policy using the case of climate change adaptation planning in Bangladesh to highlight how national and regional-level planned adaptation processes could bene fit from paying closer attention to the autonomous adaptation processes occurring at local levels. Focussing on the northeastern floodplain region, an area dominated by wetland ecosystems, high climate vulnerability, and diverse and complex land use practices, we examine some of the community-level adaptation actions that are being undertaken in response to climate change and contrast these with national-level adaptation planning strategies and actions. We then analyze how the planned adaptation actions taken by government may actually end up being maladaptive, either by shifting or rebounding vulnerability. We conclude that government adaptation planning would bene fit from a greater focus on learning and scrutinizing the autonomous adaptation of communities to climate stress before making significant resource allocation decisions.

J	Koperski, P				Koperski, Pawel			Hydrological Instability of Ponds Reduces Functional Diversity of Freshwater Molluscs in Protected Wetlands	WETLANDS			English	Article						Gastropoda; Bivalvia; Biodiversity; Climate changes; Drought	HABITAT; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; FLOODPLAIN; TEMPORARY; SIZE; MALACOFAUNA; DISTURBANCE; RICHNESS; BODIES	Different facets of biodiversity of freshwater molluscs were compared in 21 small ponds located in the wetland area around Lake Luknajno (Nature Reserve protected by Ramsar Convention, UNESCO Biosphere Reserve). The ponds examined between 2010 and 2019 differed in their susceptibility to periodical drying out. In addition, the hydrological stability of many of them was significantly reduced in 2015-19 as a result of climatic changes (decrease in precipitation, shortening of the snow cover period, increase in the average temperature during the growing season, increase in the frequency of heat waves). The functional diversity of molluscs decreased linearly and monotonically with the increase in the frequency and intensity of drying up of ponds, so it can be treated as a good indicator of their hydrological instability. Other facets of biological diversity - taxonomic and phylogenetic - were unimodally related to differences in stability. Along time, species resistant to desiccation being specialized inhabitants of temporary water bodies clearly increase their percentage, and the share of species less resistant decreases.

The trend strengths, stability, and magnitude are calculated for ten indices of temperature and eight indices of precipitation. The results show that trends of extreme temperature indices are significant, but extreme precipitation indices are insignificant. Through the extreme temperature indices, the cold indices of extreme temperature decrease steadily and the warm indices of extreme temperature rise steadily, indicating that the trends of temperature rising in the basin are obvious and stable. In addition, indices of the extreme precipitation indicate that the consecutive dry days (CDD) decrease, the heavy precipitation days (R20) and the consecutive wet days (CWD) increase, and the annual total precipitation (PRCPTOT) increases steadily. The results have certain scientific value for climate change and a series of impacts brought by climate change in the Daqing River Basin.

However, existing data sets of lacustrine calving are limited to summer seasons and to alpine glaciers. Here, we use an integrated time-lapse and structure-from-motion approach to generate the first continuous year-round volumetric record of calving processes at a lacustrine ice sheet margin. We identify two distinct calving regimes that are associated with melt-undercutting and lake ice cover. We also find that calving rates respond rapidly to sudden lake drainage. Given that lake temperature, lake ice cover, and sudden lake drainages are controlled by air temperature and ice-margin thinning, we suggest that climate change, manifested in lengthening summer seasons, will accelerate rates of mass loss and terminus recession at lacustrine ice-margins in Greenland.

Case study of the cascading effects on critical infrastructure in Torbay coastal/pluvial flooding with climate change and 3D visualisation	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Hydroinformatics (HIC)	2018	Palermo, ITALY			cellular-automaton; climate; coastal; critical-infrastructure; hazard; pluvial	HAZARD; URBAN; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK	Critical infrastructures (CIs) are commonly designed, built and maintained based on rigorous standards in order to withstand the climate and weather-related pressures. However, shifts in climate characteristics may result in increases of the magnitude and frequency of potential risks, or expose specific CI to new or increased risks not previously considered. As vital components of the normal functioning of modern societies, their resilience encompasses the operational elements, their structural integrity and the capacity to maximise business output under climate stressors. In this work, we apply an integrated and participatory methodological approach to assess the risk and enhance the resilience of interconnected CIs to urban flooding under climate change. The proposed methodology has been applied to an extended case study in Torbay to extend previous works, which seeks to protect coastal communities from future events through using the proposed methodology to justify future investment in coastal defences, as a part of the validation of EU-CIRCLE projects developed methodologies.

J	Ashofteh, PS; Dougaheh, MP				Ashofteh, Parisa-Sadat; Dougaheh, Manizheh Pourali			Ranking the optimal combination of low-impact urban development systems under climate change with the TODIM multi-criteria decision-making method	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change; Entropy-Shannon weighting method; Low-impact development strategies; MOHHO optimization algorithm; TODIM multi-criteria decision making method; Urban runoff management	MANAGEMENT; RUNOFF	One of the strategies to manage and reduce the problems caused by floods is to use different Low-Impact Development (LID) systems. Due to the existence of different types of LID systems, it is difficult to choose the best combination of them. The purpose of this research is to rank different LID systems and choose the best combination or arrangement of them under climate change using TODIM multi-criteria decision making method, which has not been done so far, in the northernmost of Tehran city (Iran), which also includes part of Tehran municipality districts 1 and 3 and it is adjacent to Tehran municipality district 6. Previously by the authors, surface runoff in the near future (2030-2047) and far future (2048-2065) under three scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6), (RCP4.5), and (RCP8.5) with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was simulated (Dougaheh et al., 2023). Next the LID systems, including Vegetative Swale, bio-retention cell, infiltration trench and permeable pavement, are optimized with Multi-Objective Harris Hawks Optimization (MOHHO) algorithm. Then, using the Pareto Fronts obtained from the optimization algorithm, seven combinations of different LID systems were extracted as final alternatives. Then, the objective functions of the optimization algorithm, including the minimization of the volume of outflow runoff of the basin and the minimization of the cost of construction and maintenance of LID, are determined as problem criteria and weighted by the Entropy-Shannon method. The results show that the volume of urban runoff with the use of LID systems, in all future time periods under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, will decrease by an average of 54% compared to the baseline time period, and the maximum percentage of volume reduction of the flood is related to the baseline period. In the future research, taking into account the qualitative parameters, the performance of the urban runoff collection system can be evaluated qualitatively in addition to quantitatively.

Research on the interactions between past climate change, oasis evolution, and human activities may provide an important historical frame of reference for evaluating current and future societal responses to global climate changes. Here, we use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon (C-14) dating of a sedimentary sequence, combined with analyses of various environmental proxies, to reconstruct the environmental evolution of the Baiyang River Basin, northwest China, during the middle to late Holocene. Additionally, we use a compilation of radiocarbon-dated archaeological sites from the Bronze Age to the historical period to construct a timeline of human activity in the study area. The results show that a flourishing oasis environments were concentrated during the periods of 4.14-2.41 ka BP and after 1.68 ka BP, which corresponded to increases in human settlements during the Bronze Age and after the Tang Dynasty, respectively. By contrast, increased environmental instability during 5.71-4.14 ka BP and 2.41-1.68 ka BP may have hindered human settlement in this area, and the C-14 dates show that human activity in the Baiyang River Basin was reduced during those periods. A comparison with regional paleoclimatic records revealed that the evolution of oases was closely related to changes in temperature and precipitation. Higher temperatures in the middle Holocene (similar to 6-4 ka) caused increases in glacier meltwater production and river discharge, which resulted in a more hydrogenic environment in the downstream oases. Increased humidity in the area during the late Holocene resulted in the re-emergence of oases and therefore of human settlements. Our findings highlight the important relationship between human settlement and land surface processes. We suggest that future warming may cause increased meltwater production and extreme precipitation events, which could adversely impact human societies in arid regions due to more frequent flooding in the downstream oases.

J	Yoshida, S; Kashima, S; Okazaki, Y; Matsumoto, M				Yoshida, Shuhei; Kashima, Saori; Okazaki, Yuji; Matsumoto, Masatoshi			Effects of 2018 Japan floods on healthcare costs and service utilization in Japan: a retrospective cohort study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Climate change; Natural disaster; Healthcare cost; Healthcare service utilization	HEAVY RAIN EVENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER; EXPENDITURES	BackgroundFloods and torrential rains are natural disasters caused by climate change. Unfortunately, such events are more frequent and are increasingly severe in recent times. The 2018 Japan Floods in western Japan were one of the largest such disasters. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the 2018 Japan Floods on healthcare costs and service utilization.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included all patients whose receipts accrued between July 2017 and June 2019 in Hiroshima, Okayama, and Ehime prefectures using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to investigate yearly healthcare costs during the pre-and post-disaster periods, quarterly high-cost patients (top 10%), and service utilization (outpatient care, inpatient care, and dispensing pharmacy) during the post-disaster period. After the GEEs, we estimated the average marginal effects as the attributable disaster effect.ResultsThe total number of participants was 5,534,276. Victims accounted for 0.65% of the total number of participants (n = 36,032). Although there was no significant difference in pre-disaster healthcare costs (p = 0.63), post-disaster costs were $3,382 (95% CI: 3,254-3,510) for victims and $3,027 (95% CI: 3,015-3,038) for non-victims (p < 0.001). The highest risk difference among high-cost patients was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6-1.1) in the fourth quarter. In contrast, the highest risk difference of service utilization was in the first quarter (outpatient care: 7.0% (95% CI: 6.7-7.4), inpatient care: 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.5), and dispensing pharmacy: 5.9% (95% CI: 5.5-6.4)).ConclusionVictims of the 2018 Japan Floods had higher medical costs and used more healthcare services than non-victims. In addition, the risk of higher medical costs was highest at the end of the observation period. It is necessary to estimate the increase in healthcare costs according to the disaster scale and plan for appropriate post-disaster healthcare service delivery.

The ability to withstand the adverse effects of climate change depends on their livelihood resilience. The relationship between natural resource dependence and livelihood resilience of Indigenous forest households in the Amazon region is still poorly understood. We used a case study approach to identify factors contributing to the livelihood resilience and vulnerability of 45 households in the Communal Land of Origin Tacana I area in the Bolivian Amazon. Household income data were collected before (2013) and after (2015) an extreme weather event. We combined a theoretical resilience framework with a practical indexing method to calculate the factors contributing to livelihood resilience and vulnerability. Additionally, conditions, regulatory and policy frameworks shaping vulnerability and resilience at the local level were reviewed. Our results show that income activity choice influences households' livelihood resilience and vulnerability. Regarding natural resources, a low vulnerability was linked to selling game and fish or pursuing a wage livelihood strategy, while high resilience was related to hunting and cattle. Our results underline the importance of social networks and capital for low cash-income households to provide support. National development policies prioritize economic growth based on strengthening the energy, agro-livestock sector and boosting oil and mining sectors with industrialization. Some of these priorities may threaten the resilience and increase the vulnerability of Indigenous forest-dependent peoples and their subsistence livelihoods. External pressure on forest resources, including fish, requires a holistic focus on livelihood resilience in national adaptation strategies. Anchoring sustainable natural resources management and monitoring strategies at all policy and operative levels is crucial to the livelihood resilience of forest-dependent (Tacana) households and forest ecosystem health. Risk management approaches need to be developed inclusively and have an integrated socio-ecological focus to avoid adverse spill-over effects.

Thermal Suitability of the Los Angeles River for Cold Water Resident and Migrating Fish Under Physical Restoration Alternatives	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						river temperature; environmental flows; mechanistic modeling; multilayer linear regression; restoration; Los Angeles River; fish migration; climate change	TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; STREAM TEMPERATURE; RAINBOW-TROUT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; LAND-USE; MODEL; STEELHEAD; DYNAMICS; INDICATORS	Anthropogenic development has adversely affected river habitat and species diversity in urban rivers, and existing habitats are jeopardized by future uncertainties in water resources management and climate. The Los Angeles River (LAR), for example, is a highly modified system that has been mostly channelized for flood control purposes, has altered hydrologic and hydraulic conditions, and is thermally altered (warmed), which severely limits the habitat suitability for cold water fish species. Efforts are currently underway to provide suitable environmental flows and improve channel hydraulic conditions, such as depth and velocity, for adult fish migration from the Pacific Ocean to upstream spawning areas. However, the thermal responses of restoration alternatives for resident and migrating cold water fish have not been fully investigated. Using a mechanistic model, we simulated the LAR's water temperature under baseline conditions and future alternative restoration scenarios for migration of the native, anadromous steelhead trout in Southern California and the historically resident Santa Ana sucker. We considered three scenarios: 1) increasing roughness of the low-flow channel, 2) increasing the depth and width of the low-flow channel, and 3) allowing subsurface inflow to the river at a soft bottom reach in the LA downtown area. Our analysis indicates that the maximum weekly average temperature (MaxWAT) in the baseline condition was 28.9 degrees C, suggesting that the current river temperatures would act as a limiting factor during the steelhead migration season and habitat for Santa Ana sucker. The MaxWAT dropped about 3%-28 degrees C after applying all the considered scenarios at the study site, which is 3 degrees C higher than the determined steelhead survival threshold. Our simulations suggest that without consideration of thermal restoration, restoring hydraulic conditions may be insufficient to support cold water fish migration or year-round resident native fish populations, particularly with potential river temperature increases due to climate change.

We modeled the potential impact of increased stream temperatures on four anadromous salmonid populations in the Chehalis River Basin (spring-run and fall-run Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, coho salmon O. kisutch, and steelhead O. mykiss), as well as the potential for floodplain reconnection and stream shade restoration to offset the effects of future temperature increases. In the Chehalis River Basin, peak summer stream temperatures are predicted to increase by as much as 3 degrees C by late-century, but restoration actions can locally decrease temperatures by as much as 6 degrees C. On average, however, basin-wide average stream temperatures are expected to increase because most reaches have low temperature reduction potential for either restoration action relative to climate change. Results from the life cycle models indicated that, without restoration actions, increased summer temperatures are likely to produce significant declines in spawner abundance by late-century for coho (-29%), steelhead (-34%), and spring-run Chinook salmon (-95%), and smaller decreases for fall-run Chinook salmon (-17%). Restoration actions reduced these declines in all cases, although model results suggest that temperature restoration alone may not fully mitigate effects of future temperature increases. Notably, floodplain reconnection provided a greater benefit than riparian restoration for steelhead and both Chinook salmon populations, but riparian restoration provided a greater benefit for coho. This pattern emerged because coho salmon tend to spawn and rear in smaller streams where shade restoration has a larger effect on stream temperature, whereas Chinook and steelhead tend to occupy larger rivers where temperatures are more influenced by floodplain connectivity. Spring-run Chinook salmon are the only population for which peak temperatures affect adult prespawn survival in addition to rearing survival, making them the most sensitive species to increasing stream temperatures.

Consequently, coastal properties, infrastructure, and livelihoods are threatened. It has become apparent that adaptation at the household and community level is necessary to offset the adverse impacts of coastal hazards. The community needs to be made aware of the risks, acquire knowledge about adaptation options, and be empowered to take their own actions. Public perception and preference are therefore crucial for design and implementation of effective planning for climate change. Thus, this study assesses households' perception, adaptation measures and empirically estimates willingness to pay and preference for planned adaptation measures to guide policy instruments through public engagement. In Malaysia, ten highly vulnerable coastal areas in the Selangor coast were surveyed at the household level (n 1/4 1016) through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Regarding households' perception and adaptation methods, most of the households in the highly exposed areas perceived less risk of inundation and sea-level rise threat and adopted less proactive adaptation and limited risk reduction be-haviours during the extreme event. The study found that 66.9% of households were willing to pay for planned adaptation measures despite the limited income capabilities and in favour of moderate adaptation (23.9%). The binomial and ordinal regression results indicated that the probability of willingness to pay for planned adaptation measures significantly increases with age, prior exposure to coastal hazards, awareness, risk perception, community participation, being affected by property damage and loss of income due to extreme events. With increased monthly household income and access to telecommunication services, households will probably pay higher for better adaptation measures. A significant amount of perceived yearly adaptation benefits in the coastal districts revealed the economic value of extensive (22,969.50 MYR/5462.43 USD), moderate (21,853.20 MYR/5196.96 USD) and minimal adaptation measures (8022.90 MYR/1907.94 USD) that can be utilised to incentivise coastal adaptation plans. The findings suggest policies to incorporate social values to reduce vulnerability, enhance community resilience, and contribute to the knowledge gap of adaptation research in the coastal areas.

Using upper thermal limits of <i>Lampsilis bracteata</i> (Texas fatmucket) from the North Llano and San Saba rivers, Texas to inform water management practices in the Edwards Plateau	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						climate change; environmental flow; freshwater mussels; hydrology; thermal tolerance; Unionidae	CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; TEMPERATURE; MUSSELS; RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEMS; STRESS; MODEL; CONSERVATION; TOLERANCES	Overexploitation of freshwater resources coupled with climate change can affect the flow and temperature regimes in rivers, which can be catastrophic for aquatic biota. The San Saba and Llano rivers, located in central Texas, are experiencing low flows and stream dewatering owing to over-allocation. Both systems harbour imperilled species, including Lampsilis bracteata, Texas fatmucket, which has been proposed for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. It is suspected that elevated water temperatures are a contributing factor in its decline. The upper thermal tolerances of glochidia and juvenile life stages were evaluated within each river. Mussels were acclimated to 27 degrees C and tested across a range of temperatures (30-39 degrees C) in 24 h (glochidia) and 96 h (juveniles) laboratory tests. The resulting tolerances were related to in situ water temperature and discharge using a uniform continuous above-threshold analysis. In the Llano, the 24 h LT50 (lethal temperature resulting in 50% mortality) was 31.8 degrees C (95% CI 31.5-32.1 degrees C), whereas the 96 h LT50 was 32.4 degrees C (95% CI 32.1-32.7 degrees C). In the San Saba, the 24 h LT50 was 34.7 degrees C (95% CI 34.5-35.0 degrees C), whereas the 96 h LT50 was 32.5 degrees C (95% CI 32.2-32.9 degrees C). LT50 thresholds were not exceeded for L. bracteata within the San Saba, but LT05 (lethal temperature resulting in 5% mortality) thresholds were exceeded. Water temperature loggers were lost in the Llano River as a result of a large flood; however, samples reported by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality show that the LT05 and LT50 for both glochidia and juveniles were exceeded. Findings from this study indicate that thermal tolerances of L. bracteata vary by population and that low flows may be contributing to its decline. Our approach is non-species and region specific, which means that the methods presented should help managers and conservationists evaluate whether reduced water quantity and elevated temperatures are exerting impacts on aquatic species within their region.

In order to adapt to climate change, precise and robust projections of flood events are required of a magnitude (or rarity) relevant to engineering design and water resources planning. However, due to the complexity of catchment-specific processes which influence flood response, many studies disagree on the direction and magnitude of the projected change: some studies project increases in flood magnitude, even above projected increases in rainfall maxima, while other studies project decreases. Using a combination of continentally downscaled rainfall projections for Australia and rainfall-runoff models locally calibrated to rare floods using a novel objective function, we show that projected changes in flooding do not follow projected changes in extreme rainfall, with changes in flooding depending on region, runoff mechanism, and event severity. Decreases in frequent flooding up to the 1 in 5 annual exceedance probability are projected across the continent, with in-creases only projected for frequent flooding in some tropical regions, diverging from the projected increases in rainfall maxima across a majority of the continent. For rare events of annual exceedance probability 1 in 50, the flood magnitude is projected to increase across the northern and eastern coasts by the end of the century - commensurate with the median projected increase of 20% in rainfall maxima. However, decreases in both rainfall maxima and flooding are still projected for south-western Australia, even for the rarest events. The regional coherence of our results suggests the patterns in the projected changes may be applicable to other tropical, temperate, and arid regions around the world.

Soil quality regeneration by grass-clover leys in arable rotations compared to permanent grassland: Effects on wheat yield and resilience to drought and flooding	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Sustainable agriculture; Regenerative agriculture; Soil hydrology; Climate change resilience; Soil organic matter; Earthworm population recovery	ORGANIC-CARBON; CROP ROTATIONS; WATERLOGGING TOLERANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WINTER-WHEAT; LOAM SOIL; TERM; EARTHWORM; ENGLAND; SEQUESTRATION	Intensive arable cropping depletes soil organic carbon and earthworms, leading to loss of macropores, and impaired hydrological functioning, constraining crop yields and exacerbating impacts of droughts and floods that are increasing with climate change. Grass and legume mixes traditionally grown in arable rotations (leys), are widely considered to regenerate soil functions, but there is surprisingly limited evidence of their effects on soil properties, resilience to rainfall extremes, and crop yields. Using topsoil monoliths taken from four intensively cropped arable fields, 19 month-old grass-clover ley strips in these fields, and from 3 adjacent permanent grasslands, effects on soil properties, and wheat yield in response to four-weeks of flood, drought, or ambient rain, during the stem elongation period were evaluated. Compared to arable soil, leys increased earthworm numbers, infiltration rates, macropore flow and saturated hydraulic conductivity, and reduced compaction (bulk density) resulting in improved wheat yields by 42-95 % under flood and ambient conditions. The leys showed incomplete recovery compared to permanent grassland soil, with modest gains in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, water-holding capacity, and grain yield under drought, that were not significantly different (P > 0.05) to the arable controls. Overall, grass-clover leys regenerate earthworm populations and reverse structural degradation of intensively cultivated arable soil, facilitating adoption of no-tillage cropping to break out of the cycle of tillage-driven soil degradation. The substantial improvements in hydrological functioning by leys will help to deliver reduced flood and water pollution risks, potentially justifying payments for these ecosystem services, especially as over longer periods, leys increase soil carbon sequestration.

The Lam Phra Phloeng (LPP) dams were built for flood protection and irrigation. However, they have experienced reservoir sedimentation, and the capacity of the reservoir has decreased. The surrounding soil surface was easily eroded and transported by heavy rainfall and surface runoff to streams and eventually into the reservoir. Understanding this soil erosion and sedimentation is necessary for preventing further decline of reservoir capacity and water management. This research aims to estimate long-term average annual soil erosion and predict sediment yield in the reservoir due to climate change. The methodology is determined soil loss parameters and sediment yield using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) with the Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR). The USLE and SDR methods differed from field data, with an average absolute error of 4.0%. The Global Climatic Model, Institute Pierre Simon Laplace-Climate Model version 5A (IPSL-CM5A-MR), with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, was downscaled and analyzed to forecast future rainfall in the watershed. The high intensity of rainfall contributed to higher soil erosion, in RCP 8.5. Interestingly, the high and very high-risk areas increased, but the moderate risk area declined, indicating that the moderate risk area should be a priority in land management. However, the heavy rainfall and high slope gradient led to a slight increase in the soil erosion in some areas because the land covers were evergreen and deciduous forest. The prediction of sediment yield was positively correlated with the intensity of rainfall in the central part of the watershed, because the rainfall and runoff led the sediment to the river and streams, indicating that the land cover should be managed to prevent capacity decline.

The purpose of this study is to quantify the trends over Bangladesh for the period 1981-2010 using the extreme temperature and precipitation indices developed by the CCI/ WCRP/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. We used precipitation and temperature data from 26 meteorological stations, calculated trends in the indices using Sen's slope estimator, and tested significance using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test. For the temperature indices, we found an overall increasing warming trend. Average annual maximum and minimum temperatures increased by 0.3 and 0.4 degrees C decade(-1) respectively. A faster rise of both maximum and minimum temperature was found compared with previous studies. The frequency of warm days increased by 12 days decade(-1). The frequency of warm (cold) nights increased (decreased) by 7 (11) days decade(-1). The overall warming was accelerated at the end of the climatic period (2001-2010). Precipitation indices showed an overall decreasing trend, in contrast to other studies in this region. Trends in consecutive dry days (CDD) indicated a drying tendency at a rate of 10 days decade(-1). A decreasing rate of about 84 mm decade(-1) was observed in annual average total precipitation. Except for CDD, most of the precipitation trends were statistically not significant and spatially incoherent. Statistically significant change was observed in extreme temperature events, with a strong and consistent spatial pattern. Our results pave the way for further investigations into future changes using results from climate simulations.	[Khan, Md. Jamal Uddin; Islam, A. K. M.

The ratio of the storage and discharge capacities of the subsystems determines the performance. The performance of the urban water system may deteriorate as a result of the change in the ratio of storage to discharge capacity due to aging, urbanisation and climate change. We developed the graph-based weakest link method (GBWLM) to analyse urban drainage systems. Flow path analysis from graph theory is applied instead of hydrodynamic model simulations to reduce the computational effort. This makes it practically feasible to analyse urban drainage systems with multi-decade rainfall series. We used the GBWLM to analyse the effect of urban water system aging and/or climate scenarios on flood extent and frequency. The case study shows that the results of the hydrodynamic models and the GBWLM are similar. The rainfall intensities of storm events are expected to increase by approximately 20% in the Netherlands due to climate change. For the case study, such an increase in load has little impact on the flood frequency and extent caused by gully pots and surface water. However, it could lead to a 50% increase in the storm sewer flood frequency and an increase in the extent of flooding.

However, the data acquisition with a high spatial and temporal resolution for a local scale is still a challenge considering that sea-level rise projections are usually represented by global scales. This contribution uses locally acquired topographic data for a flood-prone simu-lation (2100), presents a flood depth-damage function, and points out several obstacles for sea-level rise simu-lations. The input data is based on GNSS and RPAS surveys. The results showed multimedia videos and maps containing the optimistic, intermediate, and pessimistic scenarios for 2100. In the pessimistic scenario (0.80 m elevation), 45% of the vegetation and 67% of the islet would flood. The results showed the importance and barriers for flood-prone simulations. It is still necessary to advance in developing new methods able to combine multiple parameters, particularly for local and regional scales highlighting high spatial data-set to properly represent local impacts.

Sub-Saharan African countries will be particularly exposed to these types of shock due to their socioeconomic conditions and geographical conformation. This study investigates the impact of two contemporaneous covariant sudden shocks (i.e., drought and price oil shock) and the possible coping strategies through a static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Kenya. The results suggest that a mitigation policy as public transfers is an effective mitigation tool for drought effects, improving welfare and GDP in the short run. However, adopting public transfers during an oil crisis may have regressive effects on population income and welfare. Because the mitigation effectiveness is strongly affected by the complex interaction of combined shocks, the public authorities should pay attention to policy implementation. These findings call for a new scheme of transfer allocation where rural and low-income household quantiles should receive more attention by postdrought mitigation policy, being that they are more vulnerable to external shocks.

Nonstructural measures such as flood early warning systems play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts; however, these require a proper understanding of flood drivers. The drivers of floods in the Indian river basins have not been examined for the observed and projected future climate. Here using a novel framework, we examine antecedent moisture conditions and precipitation characteristics before high flow events. We estimate the probability of occurrence of flood drivers and their association with peak flood magnitude under the observed and projected future climate in Indian river basins. Multiday precipitation, a proxy to heavy precipitation on wet soil conditions, was found as the predominant flood driver in the observed and projected future climate. We show that multiday precipitation is more prominent driver than extreme soil moisture conditions in larger rivers basins while extreme precipitation drives floods in smaller river basins. The frequency of major drivers of floods is projected to rise in the future, which may pose a greater risk to agriculture and infrastructure under the warming climate.	[Nanditha, J.

Effects of flow regulation and drought on geomorphology and floodplain habitat along the Colorado River in Canyonlands National Park, Utah	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change; dams; drought; floodplain habitat; geomorphology; river regulation	GREEN RIVER; DOWNSTREAM; DAM	Streamflow regulation compounded by regional drought has resulted in up to 22% reduction in channel width, changes in channel planform, expansion of riparian vegetation, and alterations to floodplain habitat on the Colorado River in Meander Canyon, Utah. Although some changes in channel width occurred between the 1940s and 1980s, coinciding with major phases of upstream water development, larger decreases in channel width occurred between 1993 and 2006 during periods of exceptionally low annual floods. These findings illustrate that low runoff associated with regional drought and climate change may cause changes in river channel form that accelerate and compound the effects of upstream water development. Declining peak flows have also resulted in disconnection between the wetted channel and floodplains, where inundated back-levee depressions provide habitat used by two species of threatened and endangered native fish. Despite this disconnection, some back-levee depressions on the floodplain continue to be inundated by similar to 1.5-year recurrence floods via connections created by tributary mouths, floodplain outflow channels, and levee breaches excavated by resident beaver. These changes are shown by analysis of aerial images, high-resolution bathymetric and topographic measurements, and 2-dimensional streamflow modeling.

Do forests provide watershed services for farmers in the humid tropics? Evidence from the Brazilian Amazon	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Forest Watershed Services; Resilience; Deforestation; Smallholders; Brazilian Amazon	LAND-USE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DRY-SEASON; DEFORESTATION; HYDROLOGY; INTENSIFICATION; MITIGATION; PROTECTION; CATCHMENTS	Forests are a key component of hydrological cycles, and thus deforestation is likely to affect the availability and quality of water for downstream agricultural production. However, in humid tropical regions where water is relatively abundant and the terrain is relatively flat, it is unclear whether these changes in ecosystem services matter to local farmers. We test whether the extent of forest in upstream drainage areas affects downstream farm production in an agricultural colonization zone in the Brazilian Amazon. We first estimate panel models of the output of milk, which is the primary farm product in our study region. We then test for effects on pasture stocking and cow productivity as possible pathways for the effect of upstream forests on milk output. Estimation results suggest that upstream forest increases the productivity of properties with small drainage areas. The effects are strongest when water is either scarce (dry season of drought years) or excessive (rainy season of flood years). The contribution of Amazonian forests to the resilience of the local farm economy is likely to become more important as rainfall becomes more variable due to regional and global climate change.

The advantages and limitations of Earth Observation technology in characterizing the effects of climate variations on coastal environments are also presented. The role of the constellations of satellite sensors for Earth Observation, collecting helpful information on the Earth's system and its temporal changes, is emphasized. For some key technologies, the principal characteristics of the processing chains adopted to obtain from the collected raw data added-value products are summarized. Emphasis is put on studying various disaster risks that affect coastal and megacity areas, where heterogeneous and interlinked hazard conditions can severely affect the population.

We include 54 studies and examine the health impacts of extreme weather events and how these were determined. We find that these events impact health directly by causing mortality, injury and disease and through indirect pathways by impacting livelihoods, access to healthcare, coping strategies and adaptive capacity. Drawing on the social determinants of health framework to frame our analysis, we find that health impacts are determined by multiple intersecting factors, relating to individual circumstances, material conditions, health status, and political and socio-economic context. Consequently, vulnerability varies between and within informal settlements. Overall, we show that responding to and minimising these health impacts requires an intersectional approach to understand and address these contextual root causes of vulnerability.

While these impacts are well documented, changes in TC precipitation extremes- the proximate cause of such inland flooding-have been more difficult to detect. Here, we present a latewood tree-ring-based record of seasonal (June 1 through October 15) TC precipitation sums (sigma TCP) from the region in North America that receives the most sigma TCP: coastal North and South Carolina. Our 319-y-long sigma TCP reconstruction reveals that sigma TCP extremes (>0.95 quantile) have increased by 2 to 4 mm/decade since 1700 CE, with most of the increase occurring in the last 60 y. Consistent with the hypothesis that TCs are moving slower under anthropogenic climate change, we show that seasonal sigma TCP along the US East Coast are positively related to seasonal average TC duration and TC translation speed.

Low signal-to-noise associated with such events makes trend detection nearly impossible using conventional methods. We use a regional aggregation approach to boost this signal-to-noise, showing that such storms have increased in frequency over much of the conterminous United States since 1950, a period characterized by widespread hydrologic infrastructure development. Most of these increases can be attributed to secular climate change rather than climate variability, and we demonstrate potentially serious implications for the reliability of existing and planned hydrologic infrastructure and analyses. Though trends in rainfall extremes have not yet translated into observable increases in flood risks, these results nonetheless point to the need for prompt updating of hydrologic design standards, taking into consideration recent changes in extreme rainfall properties.

Research on climate change and vulnerability to natural hazards has made significant progress over the last decades. Most of the research has been devoted to improving the quality of climate information and hazard data, including exposure to specific phenomena, such as flooding or sea-level rise. Less attention has been given to the assessment of vulnerability and embedded social, economic and histor-ical conditions that foster vulnerability of societies. A number of global vulnerability assessments based on indicators have been developed over the past years. Yet an essential question remains how to validate those assessments at the global scale. This paper examines different options to validate global vulnerability assessments in terms of their internal and external validity, focusing on two global vulnerability indicator systems used in the WorldRiskIndex and the INFORM index. The paper reviews these global index systems as best practices and at the same time presents new analysis and global results that show linkages between the level of vulnerability and disaster outcomes. Both the review and new analysis support each other and help to communicate the validity and the uncertainty of vulnerability assessments. Next to statistical validation methods, we discuss the importance of the appropriate link between indicators, data and the indicandum. We found that mortality per hazard event from floods, drought and storms is 15 times higher for countries ranked as highly vulnerable compared to those classified as low vulnerable. These findings highlight the different starting points of countries in their move towards climate resilient development. Priority should be given not just to those regions that are likely to face more severe climate hazards in the future but also to those confronted with high vulnerability already.

Global warming is now affecting the thermal and hydrological regimes of rivers, compounding the threat and complicating conservation planning. To inform management under a non-stationary climate, we must improve our understanding of how flow and thermal regimes interact to affect the population dynamics of riverine biota. We used long-term growth biochronologies, spanning 34 years and 400,000 km(2), to model the growth dynamics of a long-lived, apex predator (Murray cod) as a function of factors extrinsic (river discharge; air temperature; sub-catchment) and intrinsic (age; individual) to the population. Annual growth of Murray cod showed significant, curvilinear, life-stage-specific responses to an interaction between annual discharge and temperature. Growth of early juveniles (age 1+ and 2+ years) exhibited a unimodal relationship with annual discharge, peaking near median annual discharge. Growth of late juveniles (3+ to 5+) and adults (>5+) increased with annual discharge, with the rate of increase being particularly high in adults, whose growth peaked during years with flooding. Years with very low annual discharge, as experienced during drought and under high abstraction, suppress growth rates of all Murray cod life-stages. Unimodal relationships between growth and annual temperature were evident across all life stages. Contrary to expectations of the Temperature Size Rule, the annual air temperature at which maximum growth occurred increased with age. The stage-specific response of Murray cod to annual discharge indicates that no single magnitude of annual discharge is optimal for cod populations, adding further weight to the case for maintaining and/or restoring flow variability in riverine ecosystems. With respect to climate change impacts, on balance our results indicate that the primary mechanism by which climate change threatens Murray cod growth is through alteration of river flows, not through warming annual mean temperatures per se.

A review of methods to account for impacts of nonstationary climate data on extreme rainfalls for design rainfall estimation in South Africa	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Review						extreme rainfalls; design rainfall and flood estimation; climate change; non-stationarity; global circulation models	PROBABLE MAXIMUM PRECIPITATION; PEAKS-OVER-THRESHOLD; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; RIVER-BASIN; FLOOD; MODEL; STATIONARITY; INTENSITIES; TRENDS; FUTURE	Frequency analysis of extreme rainfall and flood events are used to determine design rainfalls and design floods which are needed to design hydraulic structures such as dams, spillways and culverts. Standard methods for frequency analysis of extreme events are based on the assumption of a stationary climate. However, this assumption in rainfall and flood frequency analysis is being challenged with growing evidence of climate change. As a consequence of a changing climate, the frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall events are reported to have increased in parts of South Africa, and these and other changes in extreme rainfall occurrences are expected to continue into the future. The possible non-stationarity in climate resulting in changes in rainfall may impact on the accuracy of the estimation of extreme rainfall quantities and design rainfall estimations. This may have significant consequences for the design of new hydraulic infrastructure, as well as for the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Hence, methods that account for non-stationary data, such as caused by climate change, need to be developed. This may be achieved by using data from downscaled global circulation models in order to identify non-stationary climate variables which affect rainfall, and which can then be incorporated into extreme value analysis of a non-stationary data series.

The Kabul River Basin, a sub-basin of the Indus River system shared by Pakistan and Afghanistan, is no exception. High level of sensitivity of its flow to temperature makes it imperative to analyse climate change impacts on the flow regime of this important river for efficient water resources management on both sides of the border. The snowmelt runoff model integrated with remote sensing snow cover product MODIS was selected to simulate daily discharges. Future projections were generated for two selected time slices, 2011-2030 (near future) and 2031-2050 (far future), based on output of an ensemble of four GCMs' RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. Analysis shows a significant temperature increase under both scenarios in the near and far future at a high-altitude region of the basin which mostly receives snowfall that is also found increasing over time. Consequently, it causes a change in the flow regime and more frequent and heavier flooding events, thus calling for a joint strategy of the two riparian countries to mitigate the anticipated impacts in the basin for safety of people and overall prosperity.

The hydrological model was calibrated using three approaches: calibration at the outlets of major river basins, regionalization through calibration of smaller scale catchments with unique catchment characteristics, and building a model ensemble by sampling model parameters from the regionalized model. The large-scale patterns of the change signals projected by all model variants were found to be similar for the different indicators. Catchment scale differences were observed between the projections of the model calibrated for the major river basins and the other two model variants. The distributions of the median change signals projected by the ensemble model were found to be similar to the distributions of the change signals projected by the regionalized model for all hydrological indicators. The study highlights that the spatial detail to which model calibration is performed can highly influence the catchment scale detail in the projection of climate change impact on hydrological indicators, with an absolute difference in the projections of the locally calibrated model and the model calibrated for the major river basins ranging between 0 and 55% for mean annual discharge, while it has little effect on the large-scale pattern of the projection.

Mapping of Climate Change in the Bottom Waters of the Subarctic Atlantic during in situ Observations	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						North Atlantic; bottom currents; temperature; spatial and temporal variability; climatic changes	NORTHERN NORTH-ATLANTIC; CIRCULATION	The results of continuous year-long in situ observations of the circulation of currents and temperatures in the bottom Arctic regions of the energy-active zone of the Iceland Basin are presented. Data were obtained at flooded buoy stations at a section of 59.5 degrees N at depths of about 50 m from the bottom during 2016-2017. The intra-annual variability of bottom currents and temperature was investigated. It was shown that during the entire period there was monotonous stationary movement of water at all stations, as well as an increase in temperature in bottom waters entering the basin, as well as in those leaving. At the same time, the annual temperature growth rate of the outlet stream was 1.5 times higher than the temperature increase of the inlet stream.	[Ambrosimov, A. K.; Klyuvitkin, A.

Incorporating the impact of climate change and urbanization on the flood, this study constructed a new TC-induced flood model on western Shenzhen embedded with a unique statistical approach. Based on extensive historical data and machine learning techniques, the temporal characteristics and changes of flooding were revealed. The results reveal an increase in the frequency of TC-induced floods between 1964-2022, especially after the 1990s, which is attributed to a decrease in the distance of the location of the maximum intensity of TCs (observed within an 800 km range of the study area) relative to the land, averaging a reduction of 11.4 km per decade. This shift towards land is likely due to changes in the locations of TC genesis. Furthermore, the 'rainfall sea level' threshold for western Shenzhen was accordingly derived from the results of modelling, which would enable decision-makers to quickly assess TC-induced flood risks. The study's proposed methods offer alternative approaches for predicting TC-induced floods in regions where the gathering of hydro-meteorological data is challenging or where economic and technological resources are limited.

Here we find non-monotonic changes in river flows for seven major rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau at the warming levels of 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C based on an observation-constrained hydrological model. The annual mean streamflow for seven rivers at 1.5 degrees C warming level decreases by 0.1-3.2% relative to the present-day climate condition, and increases by 1.5-12% at 3.0 degrees C warming level. The shifting river flows for the Yellow, Yangtze, Brahmaputra, and Ganges are mostly influenced by projected increases in rainfall, but those for the Mekong, Salween, and Indus are dictated by the relative changes in rainfall, snowmelt and glacier melt. Reduced river flows in a moderately warmed climate threaten water security in riparian countries, while elevated flood risks are expected with further temperature increases over the Tibetan Plateau. This study discovered non-monotonic variations in river flows for seven rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau at warming levels of 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C, which then resulted in different consequences for riparian countries	[Cui, Tong; Li, Yukun; Nan, Yi; Li, Kunbiao; Tudaji, Mahmut; Hu, Hongchang; Long, Di; Ni, Guangheng; Tian, Fuqiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yang, Long] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Yang, Long] Nanjing Univ, Frontiers Sci Ctr Crit Earth Mat Cycling, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Shahid, Muhammad; Mubeen, Ammara] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Lahore 54890, Pakistan; [Mubeen, Ammara] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Islamabad, Pakistan; [He, Zhihua] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Yong, Bin] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hui] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Global Change Studies, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ,Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Chao] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chunhong] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China	Tsinghua University; Nanjing University; Nanjing University; University of Engineering & Technology Lahore; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; University of Saskatchewan; Hohai University; Tsinghua University; East China Normal University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research	Tian, FQ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.	tianfq@tsinghua.edu.cn	Shahid, Muhammad/I-6227-2018; Lee, Yukun/HGA-0270-2022; bin, yong/GLS-8007-2022; Tian, Fuqiang/M-9958-2013; Mubeen, Ammara/AAS-8630-2021; Lu, Hui/H-4349-2011; Long, Di/N-8049-2013; Yang, Long/G-3263-2013	Shahid, Muhammad/0000-0003-0771-4498; Tian, Fuqiang/0000-0001-9414-7019; Lu, Hui/0000-0003-1640-239X; Long, Di/0000-0001-9033-5039; Yang, Long/0000-0002-1872-0175; Nan, Yi/0000-0001-5117-1473; He, Zhihua/0000-0002-0183-693X; Cui, Tong/0000-0003-0239-4392					65	17	21	52	128	NATURE PORTFOLIO	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY		2041-1723		NAT COMMUN	Nat.

Although there is evidence of rapid worldwide growth of glacial lakes, changes in frequency and magnitude of glacier lake outbursts under climatic changes are not yet understood. This study proposes and discusses a method framework for regional-scale mapping of glacial lakes and area change detection using large time-series of optical satellite images and the cloud processing tool Google Earth Engine in a semi-automatic way. The methods are presented for two temporal scales, from the 2-week Landsat revisit period to annual resolution. The proposed methods show how constructing an annual composite of pixel values such as minimum or maximum values can help to overcome typical problems associated with water mapping from optical satellite data such as clouds, or terrain and cloud shadows. For annual-resolution glacial lake mapping, our method set only involves two different band ratios based on multispectral satellite images. The study demonstrates how the proposed method framework can be applied to detect rapid lake area changes and to produce a complete regional-scale glacial lake inventory, using the Greater Caucasus as example.

Responses of most of the observed parameters to eCO(2) with biochar application in rhizosphere soil were significantly higher. The carbon (C) sequestration potential was found higher in the biochar applied plot under eCO(2) with 0.59 Mg C sequestered ha(-1). The same recorded the highest biomass yield and grain yield which is 12.8 and 30.8% higher than the control. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) recognized soil dehydrogenase, beta - glucosidase, SOC, FA, Substrate Induced Respiration (SIR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and counts of heterotrophs as key drivers of variability. The current study thus provides some dependable biological indicators to assess the paddy ecosystems, vis-a-vis anticipatory climate change.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Editorial Material						large river basin; flood pulse; hydropower operation; climatic changes	RESERVOIR OPERATION; MEKONG; IMPACT; BASIN	Recent hydropower development in the Mekong River has triggered a lot of discussion about its impact on flood dynamics along the river, as well as in one of the world's most productive lake-floodplain systems-the Tonle Sap Lake. A recent article by Wang et al (2020 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 0940a1) in this journal conclude that changes in precipitation have played a much larger role than the operation of hydropower dams, contradicting existing research. However, we argue that by using an annual mean discharge and inundation area Wang et al (2020 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 0940a1) ignore the fundamentals of the system: the difference between dry season water level and peak water level, and thus the extent of the flooded area, which is the key function of the flood pulse. Further, by using annual mean discharge authors are not able to capture the actual operation of hydropower dams, and thus their impacts. Hydropower dams consume very little water through evaporation, but shift the flow regime from wet to dry season. We show here that when taking into account the characteristics of the system, and analysing changes from anthropogenic impacts on low and high flows separately, dams play a central role in recent changes in the flood characteristics of the Mekong.

The possibility of involving the general public to DRM implementation is, currently, a frequently discussed topic. In particular, population preparedness for the involvement of the public is questionable and, therefore, the understanding of the conditions that facilitate public preparedness for disasters is decisive. This article presents the results of research that investigates the factors affecting (1) the objective preparedness of the population, as well as (2) the subjective perception of our preparedness for disasters. The statistical analysis discovered that both sides of the public's preparedness depended especially on their experience with disasters, the awareness of the possible risks and appropriate procedures to solve situations, and the economic potential of the households. The results emphasize the need to support the process of increasing the awareness of risks and the possible preventive procedures that can be carried out before disasters by the public, including the more economically vulnerable groups. In this area, the collaboration of the responsible authorities and general public is very desirable. Therefore, our study and its results can serve as a support for creating the DRM policies and sustainable development.

The risk perception and attitude of farm households are crucial factors that influence farm productivity, investment and management decisions at this level. A well-designed questionnaire was used to interview 720 farm households from six districts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. A binary logit model was used to determine the main factors that affect the choice of adaptation strategies of the farm household. The findings revealed that crop diversification, changing crop varieties, altering the crop calendar, varying the fertilizer used, mulching and farm insurance were the main adaptation strategies followed by farm households. The results of the binary logit model revealed that age, education, farm size, household size, credit accessibility, annual income and the perception on the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall had significant influence on the selection of the adaption strategies. The findings of this study can provide guidance, policy recommendations and reference for future researchers.

Real-Time, Smart Rainwater Storage Systems: Potential Solution to Mitigate Urban Flooding	WATER			English	Article						smart rainwater tanks; real-time control; urban flooding; simulation-optimization; genetic algorithms	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OPTIMIZATION; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; INFRASTRUCTURE; ADAPTATION; PEAKS	Urban water systems are being stressed due to the effects of urbanization and climate change. Although household rainwater tanks are primarily used for water supply purposes, they also have the potential to provide flood benefits. However, this potential is limited for critical storms, as they become ineffective once their capacity is exceeded. This limitation can be overcome by controlling tanks as systems during rainfall events, as this can offset the timing of outflow peaks from different tanks. In this paper, the effectiveness of such systems is tested for two tank sizes under a wide range of design rainfall conditions for three Australian cities with different climates. Results show that a generic relationship exists between the ratio of tank:runoff volume and percentage peak flow reduction, irrespective of location and storm characteristics. Smart tank systems are able to reduce peak system outflows by between 35% and 85% for corresponding ranges in tank:runoff volumes of 0.15-0.8. This corresponds to a relative performance improvement on the order of 35% to 50% compared with smart tanks that are not operated in real-time. These results highlight the potential for using household rainwater tanks for mitigating urban flooding, even for extreme events.

Hoi An Ancient Town, one of the world's cultural heritage sites in Vietnam, is facing inundation risks from increasing extreme flood events due to anthropogenic and natural processes. This study combines Geospatial Information System (GIS), remote sensing data, and landscape ecology metrics to assess the flood risk of Hoi An City. The analysis includes (1) classification of land-use/land-cover (LULC) using Sentinel-2 data; (2) computation of a flood risk index using hazard characteristics, physical and demographic exposures, and physical and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, together with adaptive capacity and spatial metrics, and the Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to determine the weight of each index and ranking; and (3) determination of flood risks for the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Hoi An City and the surrounding areas. By comparing model outputs with historical flood locations (N = 330), the study finds that >75% of past floods occurred at high or very high-risk areas forecasted by the model. Results from the model verified by true flood incidents show that the inundation hotspots are concentrated in the city's heritage sites, where human and climate changes have impacted landscape structure. The flood inundation risk mapping obtained from the synthesis analysis, encompasses hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, offering holistic knowledge to help reduce and manage flood risks at Hoi An World Heritage Sites. This method can be applicable to other sites with similar characteristics.

In the past, most of the assessment studies on the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems stayed in static qualitative research, lacking predictability, and the qualitative and quantitative relationship was not objective enough. In this study, the "Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence" model and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change vulnerability definition were used to analyze the main impact of sea level rise caused by climate change on coastal wetland ecosystem in Minjiang River Estuary. The results show that: (1) With the increase of time and carbon emission, the area of high vulnerability and the higher vulnerability increased continuously, and the area of low vulnerability and the lower vulnerability decreased. (2) The eastern and northeastern part of the Culu Island in the Minjiang River Estuary of Fujian Province and the eastern coastal wetland of Meihua Town in Changle District are areas with high vulnerability risk. The area of high vulnerability area of coastal wetland under high emission scenario is wider than that under low emission scenario. (3) Under different sea level rise scenarios, elevation has the greatest impact on the vulnerability of coastal wetlands, and slope has less impact. The impact of sea level rise caused by climate change on the coastal wetland ecosystem in the Minjiang River Estuary is mainly manifested in the sea level rise, which changes the habitat elevation and daily flooding time of coastal wetlands, and then affects the survival and distribution of coastal wetland ecosystems.

Consequently, interest in estimating the probable maximum precipitation (PMP) has been burgeoning. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends two types of methods for calculating the PMP: hydrometeorological and statistical methods. This study proposes a modified Hershfield's nomograph method and assesses the changes in PMP values based on the two representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios in South Korea. To achieve the intended objective, five techniques were employed to compute statistical PMPs (SPMPs). Moreover, the most suitable statistical method was selected by comparing the calculated SPMP with the hydrometeorological PMP (HPMP), by applying statistical criteria. Accordingly, SPMPs from the five methods were compared with the HPMPs for the historical period of 2020 and the future period of 2100 for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The results confirmed that the SPMPs from the modified Hershfield's nomograph showed the smallest MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), and RMSE (root mean square error), which are the best results compared with the HPMP with an average SPMP/HPMP ratio of 0.988 for the 2020 historical period. In addition, Hershfield's method with varying KM exhibits the worst results for both RCP scenarios, with SPMP/HPMP ratios of 0.377 for RCP4.5 and 0.304 for RCP8.5, respectively. On the contrary, the modified Hershfield's nomograph was the most appropriate method for estimating the future SPMPs: the average ratios were 0.878 and 0.726 for the 2100 future period under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, in South Korea.

Detecting precipitation trend using a multiscale approach based on quantile regression over a Mediterranean area	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Mann&#8211; Kendall test; Mediterranean area; precipitation trend; quantile regression; sub&#8208; hourly extremes	EXTREME PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEASONAL RAINFALL; COEFFICIENT; TEMPERATURE; INDEXES; SERIES; TESTS	One of the most relevant and debated topics related to the effects of the climate change is whether intense rainfall events have become more frequent over the last decades. It is a crucial aspect, since an increase in the magnitude and frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall events could result in a dramatic growth of floods and, in turn, human lives losses and economic damages. Because of its central position in the Mediterranean area, Sicily has been often screened with the aim to capture some trends in precipitation, potentially related to climate change. While Mann-Kendall test has been largely used for the rainfall trend detection, in this work a different procedure is considered. Precipitation trends are here investigated by processing the whole rainfall time-series, provided by the regional agency SIAS at a 10-min resolution, through the quantile regression method by aggregating precipitation across a wide spectrum of durations and considering different quantiles. Results show that many rain gauges are characterized by an increasing trend in sub-hourly precipitation intensity, especially at the highest quantiles, thus suggesting that, from 2002 to 2019, sub-hourly events have become more intense in most of the island. Moreover, by analysing some spatial patterns, it has been revealed that the south and the east of Sicily are more interested in significant increasing rainfall trends, especially at the 10-min duration. Finally, the comparison between the two procedures revealed a stronger reliability of the quantile regression in the trend analysis detection, mainly due to the possibility of investigating the temporal variation of the tails of precipitation distribution.

This paper focuses on the detection of recent changes in annual temperature and precipitation extremes over the 1961-2018 period based on observational data, discussing their spatial distribution and dependencies (on altitude, latitude and longitude). Trend analysis was applied on a set of 16 indices selected from the core indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The results show a significant warming trend, well reflected by the strong decline of frost days and icing days and a significant increase in absolute maximum temperatures, summer days and warm spell duration. Trends in precipitation extremes are more various, suggesting a climate drying trend, apparently stronger in the areas with a fast rise of maximum temperatures (evidence of coupled warming-drying climate change signal) and an increasing frequency of heavy precipitation events and resulted water amounts, in the areas affected by summer convection intensification. Except TNn with trends slopes revealing a winter nighttime amplification with elevation, high elevations (at above 2000 m) show only slight changes in temperature and precipitation extremes compared to the lower areas, explaining the general lack of elevation dependency of trends. Longitude explains 48 to 54% of trends in heavy precipitation indices. Changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation (e.g. intensification of westerly circulation, increasing frequency of blocking conditions), cloudiness and summer convection have been identified among the main factors influencing trend behaviour and their spatial distribution.

J	da Silva, LBL; Alencar, MH; de Almeida, AT				Leal da Silva, Lucas Borges; Alencar, Marcelo Hazin; de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira			Multidimensional flood risk management under climate changes: Bibliometric analysis, trends and strategic guidelines for decision-making in urban dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Review						Systematic literature review; Climate change; Flood risk management; Decision-making; Urban area	FUZZY MULTICRITERIA APPROACH; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; INDEX; RESILIENCE; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSEQUENCES; SUITABILITY; PROTECTION	The inevitability of more frequent and more extensive floods, phenomena that display one aspect of the inherent variability of Nature, has been increasingly accepted by managers and policymakers. Climate changes due to global warming add considerable complexity to dealing with flooding, since increases in average temperature alter the patterns and intensity of precipitation. Thus, adverse events arising from natural hazards have tended to become even more frequent and their impacts more severe. Consequently, urban centers face a huge challenge and statistics already show the urgent need for all levels of government to review the adequacy of their plans for anticipating and combating extreme events. Therefore, this paper undertakes a systematic review of the literature, using well-founded and established search strategies, in order to determine the state-of-the-art as presented in 52 peer-reviewed articles strategically selected from two main sources of scientific data. Cross-matching important research metrics from these papers has enabled two axes of discussion to be detailed in this article: a bibliometric analysis and a content analysis. Among many findings, those that stand out are the lack of a formal methodology for climate modeling and the use and sharing of GIS tools, these being key-factors for developing new ways of visualizing risk. Finally, some guidelines for decision-making are put forward in order to share insights and to provide DMs, scholars, experts, stakeholders, and other professionals with an overall background of managerial aspects when engaging on applying flood risk management in urban areas.

The damages, covered by the Governments of Canada and the U.S., were estimated to C$90M. This natural disaster motivated the study of mitigation measures to prevent such disasters from reoccurring. When evaluating flood risks, long-term evolving climate change should be taken into account to adopt mitigation measures that will remain relevant in the future. To assess the impacts of climate change on flood risks of the LCRR basin, three bias-corrected multi-resolution ensembles of climate projections for two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios were used to force a state-of-the-art, high-resolution, distributed hydrological model. The analysis of the hydrological simulations indicates that the 20-year return period flood (corresponding to a medium flood) should decrease between 8% and 35% for the end of the 21st Century (2070-2099) time horizon and for the high-emission scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. The reduction in flood risks is explained by a decrease in snow accumulation and an increase in evapotranspiration expected with the future warming of the region. Nevertheless, due to the large climate inter-annual variability, short-term flood probabilities should remain similar to those experienced in the recent past.

The impact of climate change on flow conditions and wetland ecosystems in the Lower Biebrza River (Poland)	PEERJ			English	Article						SWAT; Climate change; Trend analysis; The Biebrza river	NONSTATIONARY APPROACH; SEASONAL APPROACH; WATER; MANAGEMENT; FLOODPLAIN; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; RESTORATION; TEMPERATURE; PROJECTIONS	Water plays a key role in the functioning of wetlands and a shortage or contamination of it leads to changes in habitat conditions and degradation of ecosystems. This article scrutinizes the impact of climate change on the hydrological characteristics of floods (maximum flow, duration, volume) in the River Biebrza wetlands (North-East Poland). We analysed the trends in duration and volume of flood and maximum discharges in the historical period 1970-2000 and predicted these for the future periods 2020-2050 and 2070-2100, respectively. Next we assessed the impact on the wetland ecosystems. The basis of our assessments consists of statistical analyses of hydrographs and calculations by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrological model and considering nine bias-corrected climate models. The results indicate that both volume and duration of winter floods will keep increasing continuously under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5. The reduction in peak annual floods is expected to decline slightly in both scenarios. On the other hand, the analysis of trends in mean and standard deviation revealed negligible tendencies in the datasets for summer and winter hydrological seasons within the three time frames analysed (1970-2000; 2020-2050; 2070-2100). We foresee several future implications for the floodplain ecosystems. Shifts in transversal ecosystem zonation parallel to the river will likely take place with more highly productive flood tolerant vegetation types. Nutrient availability and algal blooms during spring inundations will likely increase. Slowdown of organic matter turnover later in summer will lead to a higher peat accumulation rate. Logistical problems with summer mowing and removal of bushes in winter may enhance shrub encroachment.

One option is to strengthen existing sea walls to maintain current land uses; however, scientists, policy-makers and conservationists increasingly see the benefits of managed realignment, which is a nature-based coastal adaptation that involves the conversion of reclaimed farmland back to wetlands, allowing periodic local flooding in designated areas to reduce the risk of flooding downstream. We interviewed 16 local organisations, landowners and farmers and held workshops with 109 citizens living the Inner Forth estuary in eastern Scotland, to examine how managed realignment is supported by stakeholder attitudes and their engagement. Most of the farmers we interviewed prefer strengthened sea walls, to maintain their livelihoods and agricultural heritage. Citizens and local organisations were mainly supportive of managed realignment, because it provided wildlife and flood regulation benefits. However, we identified several barriers that could present obstacles to implementing managed realignment, for example, uncertainty whether it would support their principles of economic and rational decision-making. Our findings suggest that the local capacity to cope with rising sea levels is limited by lack of engagement with all relevant stakeholder groups, the limited scope of existing stakeholder partnerships and poor short-term funding prospects of landscape partnerships that would facilitate collaboration and discussion. We suggest that including citizens, landowners, farmers and industries would strengthen existing stakeholder deliberation and collaboration, and support the Inner Forth's transition towards a more sustainable future shoreline.

Classical flood estimation methods applied for deriving such estimates focus on peak discharge and neglect other important flood characteristics such as flood volume and the interdependence among different flood characteristics. Furthermore, they do not account for potential nonstationarities in hydrological time series due to climate change. The consideration of both the interdependence between peak discharge and flood volume and its nonstationarity might help us derive more reliable flood estimates. A few studies have looked at changes in the general dependence of peak discharge and flood volume for small sets of catchments and explored ways of modeling such changes. However, spatial analyses of trends in this dependence or in their climatological drivers have not been carried out. The aim of this study was to help close this knowledge gap by first quantifying trends in the general dependence between peak discharge and flood volume as described by Kendall's tau on a spatially comprehensive data set of 307 catchments in Switzerland. Second, potential climatological drivers for changes in the dependence between peak discharge and flood volume were identified. Our results show that the dependence between peak discharge and flood volume and its trends are spatially heterogeneous. This pattern cannot be explained by one driver only but by an interplay of changes in precipitation, snowmelt, and soil moisture. Both the trends and the links between drivers and trends depend on the climate model chain considered and are therefore uncertain.

The city of Lisbon flooded and there was considerable damage to buildings. The description of the storm and its aftermath is by far the longest description of weather for medieval Portugal. The aim here is to set this storm within the context of the late medieval crisis, placing it alongside the warfare, plague, papal schism, siege and hunger also described by Lopes, and exploring it in relation to research on late medieval climate change. Lopes's chronicles are major sources for crisis in medieval Portugal, but this storm has not previously been considered within that context.

Snow cover dominates the mountainous areas in winter. Therefore, the river discharge increases significantly in spring, when the snow melts gradually and is accompanied by rain this season. This study aims to evaluate the snow parameters such as snow cover, monthly average snow cover, and snowmelt from early winter to late summer 2020 by using the Terra satellite, MODIS sensor, and the FLDAS model to estimate the amount of water equivalent to snowmelt in the Google Earth Engine system for Kan basin in Tehran province. The hydrological model HEC-HMS was used for assessing the effect of snow parameters on the amount of Kan River discharge in this study. The land use map was extracted by using the image of the Sentinel-2 satellite to acquire more accuracy in this study. Finally, Sentinel-1 radar images were used to evaluate the effect of flood on the area and monitor the changes.

The two-speed coastal climate adaptation economy in Australia	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Coastal adaptation; Vulnerability; Coastal retreat	CHANGE RISK; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; PRIVATE; VULNERABILITY; BARRIERS	There is increasing global concern that climate adaptation efforts are falling behind the increasing risks associated with climate change. A number of reviews have identified this general issue in multiple nations and jurisdictions. In Australia, it is argued here that adaptation of the coastal built environment is operating at two speeds: the two-speed adaptation economy. Large civil assets and facilities in Australia now mostly have adaptation plans and strategies in place; although progress in actual on-the-ground implementation is variable in some cases. By contrast, adaptation of coastal communities and settlements continues at a very slow pace with very few specific adaptation measures being implemented that were not already being implemented as business as usual for flood or erosion management. The reasons for these differences in adaptation progress is investigated here. A key outcome of the thinking presented here is the reinforcement of the result that adaptation of coastal communities is not a challenge of relocating buildings, but rather a challenge of incentivising and supporting communities to act.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the current alerting systems for hot and cold weather used in England to notify the health and social care sector of upcoming extreme weather events. We consider the views of stakeholders on the current system and explore their perspectives on the proposal to move towards an impact-based system. The paper concludes that while the current system is an effective tool, stakeholders feel they need to draw on additional material to assist with the development of an appropriate response. We also highlight that many stakeholders are concerned about the potential for creating alert fatigue due to a lack of clarity of the geographical area impact of some of the alerts. Consequently, there was a high level of support from stakeholders for the move towards an impact-focused system.

The effects of rising sea levels endanger several nations, including Indonesia, and it potentially affects the coastal population and natural environment. Quantification is needed to determine the degree of vulnerability experienced by a coast since measuring vulnerability is a fundamental phase towards effective risk reduction. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to identify how vulnerable the coastal zone of Bali Province by develop a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) of areas exposed to the sea-level rise on regional scales using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. This study was conducted in Bali Province, Indonesia, which has a beach length of similar to 640 km, and six parameters were considered in the creation to measure the degree of coastal vulnerability by CVI: geomorphology, shoreline change rate, coastal elevation, sea-level change rate, tidal range, and significant wave height. The different vulnerability parameters were assigned ranks ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the lowest and 5 indicating the highest vulnerabilities. The study revealed that about 138 km (22%) of the mapped shoreline is classified as being at very high vulnerability and 164 km (26%) of shoreline is at high vulnerability. Of remaining shoreline, 168 km (26%) and 169 km (26%) are at moderate and low risk of coastal vulnerability, respectively. This study outcomes can provide an updated vulnerability map and valuable information for the Bali Province coast, aimed at increasing awareness among decision-makers and related stakeholders for development in mitigation and adaptation strategies. Additionally, the result may be utilized as basic data to build and implement appropriate coastal zone management.

Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) represent an opportunity to align environmental and resilience goals, at a time of strained budgets in a global context and when short-term needs may run counter to long-term goals. In Europe, NbS fit the mandates of major EU environmental and climate change policies by restoring biodiversity and enhancing climate-resilience and carbon sequestration. Previous studies have compiled scientific evidence about hydro-meteorological hazards for the use of NbS. However, their implementation at scale is still lacking. As the knowledge and experience with NbS for adaptation to natural hazards and climate change increases, it becomes more important to draw lessons learned and insights for replicating and scaling up NbS, especially in coastal areas where their implementation is still limited compared to other environments. This study analyzed NbS case studies across European coastal and estuarine areas to draw key lessons, understand better the current status of implementation, and identify key challenges and gaps. From a total of 59 NbS case studies associated with flooding, erosion and biodiversity loss, results show an increase in NbS implementation since 1990s, but most rapidly between 2005 and 2015. Most of the case studies are hybrid solutions employing wetlands, predominantly located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands. Funding of NbS is largely from public sources, and rarely come from a single or a private source. Three-quarters of the case studies reported monitoring activities, but more than half did not disclose quantitative results related to effectiveness against flooding and/or erosion. The need to improve coastal defenses was indicated as the main motivation for NbS implementation over traditional structures, while sustainability was the most mentioned additional reason. Although a variety of co-benefits and lessons learned was identified, clearer descriptions and enhanced details of such information are required. There is a need for tools and strategies to expand knowledge sharing of lessons learned to enable further replication of successful cases in other areas.	[Moraes, Roberta P.

J	Peng, L; Li, ZH				Peng, Lu; Li, Zhihui			Ensemble Flood Risk Assessment in the Yangtze River Economic Belt under CMIP6 SSP-RCP Scenarios	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						flood risk; climate change; SSP-RCP scenarios; Yangtze River Economic Belt	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER; BASIN; POPULATION; URBANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION	The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is an important part of China's "two screens and three belts " strategic ecological security barrier, and the urban agglomeration along the YREB is the core of its economic development. However, it has suffered the most from frequent and severe flood disasters that were affected by torrential rains, urbanization, and human activities, with climate change intensifying the potential occurrence of flood disasters in this area. Based on the CMIP6 climate data, this study constructed a flood risk assessment index system and assessed the temporal and spatial changes of the flood risk in the YREB during 2020-2050 under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) scenarios, including SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585. From the perspective of temporal change, the results showed that at the grid level, the area of middle-low risk (0.55 < R & LE; 0.65) accounted for 60% of the total area of the YREB and area of high-risk (R > 0.85) fluctuated first and then decreased under the four scenarios, with the area of high-risk being largest in the future under the SSP585 scenario. Specifically, at the city level, around half of the cities in the YREB had faced high flood risk and the risk showed an increasing trend during 2020-2050 under the SSP370 scenario. From the perspective of spatial change, the flood risk of the YREB presented a spatial pattern of low in the west and high in the east, with high risk mainly concentrated in the cities in the lower reaches of the YREB and also Chongqing and Sichuan. Compared with SSP126 and SSP245 scenarios, it showed that high-risk areas were larger under high emission scenarios SSP370 and SSP585, which were mostly concentrated in middle and lower reaches of the YREB and the cities of Chongqing and Chengdu during 2020-2050. Especially, flood risk showed an increasing trend in the middle and lower reaches of the YREB during 2020-2050, and the regions with high vulnerability would have greater socio-economic losses. The finding would provide scientific support for resilience improvement, risk reduction and management, and formulating policies to achieve green and sustainable development in the YREB.

J	Patel, SK; Mathew, B; Nanda, A; Pati, S; Nayak, H				Patel, Sangram Kishor; Mathew, Bincy; Nanda, Ankit; Pati, Sanghamitra; Nayak, Hiralal			A review on extreme weather events and livelihood in Odisha, India	MAUSAM			English	Review						Climate change; Extreme weather events; Natural disasters; Livelihood; Resilience; Odisha; India	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SECURITY	Over the years extreme weather events have been catastrophic and continue to have overwhelming impacts globally, mainly due to climate change. However, the impacts of extreme weather events have been uneven and devastating in developing countries largely because of lack of resources, weak adaptive capacity and large dependency on climate sensitive livelihoods. Odisha on the eastern coast of India is one of the most disaster-prone states in India with a regular prevalence of extreme events like cyclones, droughts, floods and Heat waves. The state's livelihood is mainly based on weather patterns directly (farming, fisheries) or indirectly (non-farm wage labour, dairy farming) are at stake due to the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events. However, there are very limited studies available which describe the situation, impacts and resilience of extreme weather events in the context of livelihood in the state. The present study is an attempt in this direction to review and examine the impact of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclone, flood, drought and Heat wave) on the livelihood of the population in Odisha. In addition, the study examines the resilience shown by the people and the program and policy adopted by the government on the extreme weather events in the state. The study findings highlight that extreme weather events have affected populations at large, caused substantial economic losses and exerted a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable social groups such as sharecroppers, small and marginal farmers, backward communities, landless labourers, wage labourers, rickshaw pullers and vendors as the nature of work in which they are engaged is susceptible to the effects of extreme weather events. Heat waves, droughts, floods and cyclones are the important extreme weather events that hamper the livelihoods in Odisha. Frequent occurrence of events has caused a blow to the livelihood resilience of the poor and marginalized people. While immediate coping mechanisms at the local level do provide some relief to the people, but the ability of people to adapt to these disasters is severely affected by the increased frequency of these disasters and there is a dire need to focus towards more sustainable and long-term livelihood solutions.

The local and national government and professionals, including disaster manage-ment scientists, climate change researchers, and meteorologists, are at the forefront of examining and tackling the issues of urban cyclones. Therefore, the study attempts to assess the vulnerability of urban slum households in India's first smart city Bhubaneswar due to cyclonic events. Primary data have been collected by using a structured questionnaire from two slums, namely "Phd Sahi" and "Kedar Palli" with a sample size of 200 households. The vulnerability is assessed in the context of five elements: social, economic, physical, institutional, and awareness, and their respective yardsticks have been chosen through previous literature and based on the condition of the slum. The study has developed five individual vulnerability indices considering 38 vulnera-bility indicators mentioned above with a multidimensional vulnerability index. Results show that the slum population is more vulnerable to cyclones based on economic, physical, and awareness vulnerability while less vulnerable in terms of social and institutional. Therefore, the paper ad-vocates some policy suggestions that the state planning should aim at achieving overall economic, physical with infrastructural development to ensure the safety of these marginalized urban communities under participatory slum up-gradation program. Both state and central government should work together to frame policies that will lead to more awareness among the poor slum population, which can, on the other hand, reduce the disaster risks of a cyclone.

Currently, the overall surface water quality is grossly polluted, mainly due to the direct discharge of wastewater from the urban areas to the Sutlej River directly or through stream networks. Escherichia coli concentrations vary under extreme weather events like floods and droughts and socioeconomic circumstances like urbanization, population growth, and treatment options. This paper assesses the future E. coli load and concentrations using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) along with scenarios based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). E. coli concentrations according to a more polluted scenario disclose a near and mid future increase by 108% and 173%, and far future increases up to 251% compared to the reference period (baseline) concentrations. The E. coli concentration is reduced by - 54%, - 68%, and - 81% for all the projected time steps compared to the baseline concentrations. While highly improved sewerage and manure management options are adapted, the concentration is further reduced by - 96%, - 101%, and - 105%, respectively, compared to the baseline. Our modeling and scenario matrix study shows that reducing microbiological concentrations in the surface water is possible. Still, it requires rigorous sanitation and treatment options, and socioeconomic variables play an essential role besides climate change to determine the microbiological concentration of water resources and be included in future studies whenever water quality and health risks are considered.

Extreme storm events have increased the need for the preparation required to face the challenges of climate change. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy impacted 13 wastewater treatment facilities in New York City alone, causing millions of dollars in damage. Sandy was only a tropical storm, with a wind speed of 22.35 ms(-1) (50 mi/h), when it made landfall in New York; however, it caused havoc because it combined with other local cascading events. The storm damage was caused by cascading synergistic events, including storm surge, sea level rise, and rain, rather than a singular decisive event of factor. The disaster left behind by Superstorm Sandy alone magnifies the dire need to understand the damage scenarios and consequences, and to identify resiliency plans and mitigation strategies that take into account a multitude of parameters that contributed to the intensified and devastating impacts. This work formulated the critical factors into a new concept introduced here as total water level (TWL). Using hydrodynamic models, the flood depths and elevations were calculated for various return periods and hurricane categories for coastal and riverine flooding, considering TWL to demonstrate the role of cascading events. The results show the compound effect of extreme storm events as hurricane surge combines forces with sea level rise and rainfall events; it translated into an additional 2.74-4.26 m of flooding in two studied locations.

Daily time series of precipitation, temperature and monthly potential evapotranspiration were generated by combining monthly observations, daily reanalysis data and projected changes in the five CMIP5 GCMs also selected in the ISI-MIP fast track project. These series were then used to drive the HBV hydrological model and the CaMa-Flood hydrodynamic model to simulate river discharge and flood inundation. Our results indicate that return periods of 1 in 100-year floods in the late twentieth century (Q100-20C) are likely to decrease with warming. At 1.5 degrees C warming, 47%, 66%, 27%, 65%, 62% and 92% of the major basin areas in Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana and India respectively experience a decrease in the return period of Q100-20C, increasing to 54%, 81%, 28%, 82%, 86% and 96% with 4 degrees C warming. The decrease in return periods leads to increased number of people exposed to flood risks, particularly with 4 degrees C warming, where exposure in the major river basin areas in the six countries increases significantly, ranging from a doubling (China) to more than 50-fold (Egypt). Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C would avoid much of these increased risks, resulting in increases ranging from 12 to 1266% for the 6 countries.

Water resilience mapping of Chennai, India using analytical hierarchy process	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Water resilience; GIS; Remote sensing; Multi-criteria decision analysis; AHP	MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; FLOOD-HAZARD AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FUZZY-AHP; GIS; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; IMPACT; SCALE	Background The urban water system is the worst hit in global climate change. Water resilience is the system's ability to retaliate and recover from various water-related disruptions. The present study aims to delineate the water resilience zones in Chennai city, Tamil Nadu, India, by effectively integrating the geographic information system, remote sensing, and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Methods The methodology incorporated 15 vital factors. A multi-criteria decision analysis technique was adopted to assign a weight to each parameter using the AHP. A pairwise decision matrix was constructed, parameter's relative importance and the consistency ratio were established. Integration of all maps by weighted overlay analysis technique depicted water resilience intensities of five different classes. Results Very low, low and moderate water resilience areas accounted for more than three-fourth of the study area. Area Under Curve score (80.12%) depicted the accuracy of the developed model. Sensitivity analysis determined the significance of the parameters in the delineation. The logical structural approach can be employed in other parts of India or elsewhere with modifications. Conclusion This study is novel in its approach by holistically analyzing water resilience by integrating disruptions related to flood, drought and the city's water infrastructure system's adequacy and efficiency. Researchers and planners can effectively use the study results to ensure resilience as a new perspective on effective water resource management and climate change mitigation. It becomes a decision aid mechanism identifying where the system is vulnerable to potential water-related risks for employing resilience measures.

Synthesis of Indicators, Datasets, and Frameworks Available to Establish Resilience and Adaptation Indicators: Case Study of Chesapeake Bay Region, USA	CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS			English	Article						Climate change; Adaptation; Resilience; Framework; Indicators; Decision support	SEA-LEVEL RISE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRECIPITATION EVENTS; CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS; BLUE-CRAB; MARYLAND; IMPACTS; SCIENCE; PHYTOPLANKTON; HEALTH	Adaptation planning and evaluation is challenging because adaptation is occurring on complex systems that are not completely understood. Though assessment is more straightforward for single projects, the larger question often asked is whether multiple adaptation actions, developed by different actors and for different purposes, are making a region more resilient. One way to comprehensively assess adaptation is through indicators-a promising decision support tool because they can be designed to efficiently and comprehensively summarize system behavior even if significant uncertainty exists. In practice, choosing indicators requires navigating a rich and often contradictory information landscape of peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed documents and data products, largely produced for other purposes. In this paper, we review the available information applicable to resilience indicators for the Chesapeake Bay region of the USA. To provide consistency across such diverse projects and information sources, we develop a resilience framework through literature and stakeholder engagement that provides a consistent definition of objectives and frame for evaluation. Using systematic search methods, we identified 283 relevant documents, which were then qualitatively assessed for climate change and resilience themes. Predominant themes emerge around key regional impacts-sea level rise, water quality, flooding, and aquatic ecosystems-as well as magnitude of, exposure to, and impacts of climate hazards. Notably, relatively little information was found for designing indicators for coping and adaptive capacity and adaptation responses. This result highlights that even for well-known problems in the Chesapeake Bay region, much work remains in translating the existing information landscape into actionable indicators.

J	Hu, KK; Ailihazi, W; Danierhan, S				Hu, Keke; Ailihazi, Wuerken; Danierhan, Sulitan			Ecological Base Flow Characteristics of Typical Rivers on the North Slope of Kunlun Mountains under Climate Change	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; north slope of the Kunlun Mountain; ecological base flow; Tennant method; Support objectives	ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; WATER; FUTURE	Under climate change, river ecological base flow becomes particularly critical for the health and stability of inland river ecosystems in arid regions. Taking three typical seasonal inland rivers, including the Kriya River, the Niya River, and the Qarqan River, all on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, as research objects, meteorological data from 1958 to 2019 and hydrological data from 1978 to 2014 were selected to analyze the characteristics of ecological base flow under climate change. The results show that in the past 60 years, the temperature in the Kriya River, Niya River, and Qarqan River basins has warmed at rates of 0.235 degrees C center dot(10a)(-1), 0.223 degrees C center dot(10a)(-1), and 0.177 degrees C center dot(10a)(-1), respectively, while the precipitation has increased at the rates of 0.88 mm center dot(10a)(-1), 3.90 mm center dot(10a)(-1), and 7.92 mm center dot(10a)(-1) The Tennant method was determined as the best algorithm for ecological base flow of inland rivers in arid regions. The interannual maximum values of ecological base flow all occurred in 2010, with three rivers increasing by 5.098 m(3) center dot s(-1), 2.416 m(3) center dot s(-1), and 11.343 m(3) center dot s(-1) respectively, and the regional average increasing by 6.286 m(3) center dot s(-1). The maximum ecological base flow within the year is in July, and the minimum value is in January, with a high proportion of the flood season. The monthly ecological base flow of rivers has a strong correlation with the monthly temperature and precipitation, with the strongest correlation in the Qarqan River basin and the correlation coefficients of 0.876 and 0.917. We propose ecological base flow guarantee objectives for the three rivers during the dry season, and clarify that the flood season is the key point of ecological base flow guarantee. The guarantee objectives are 0.974 m(3) center dot s(-1), 0.154 m(3) center dot s(-1), and 2.167 m(3) center dot s(-1), for the three rivers, respectively. Our research results can provide scientific reference for the management and regulation of water resources and ecological protection of the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains.

J	Costa, Y; Martins, I; de Carvalho, GC; Barros, F				Costa, Yuri; Martins, Irene; de Carvalho, Gilson Correia; Barros, Francisco			Trends of sea-level rise effects on estuaries and estimates of future saline intrusion	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Saline intrusion; Climate change; Coastal management; Ecological impacts; Mangroves	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SALTWATER INTRUSION; TRANSPORT PROCESSES; BENTHIC MACROFAUNA; WATER-INTRUSION; PACIFIC COAST; RIVER ESTUARY; MEKONG RIVER; IMPACT; ADAPTATION	One of the effects associated with climate change is sea-level rise (SLR). Initial IPCC reports predicted that sea levels would rise by 60 cm by 2100. However, the most recent IPCC report (AR6) already considers, due to our failure to control greenhouse gas emissions, that this increase should reach 1 m or even 2 m by 2100. Satellite altimetry studies have also shown that this effect is uneven across the globe. Thus, some regions will experience the SLR effects first. On the local scale, transitional environments such as estuaries will be the first to experience such effects (e.g., flooding, saline intrusion and erosion). Studies that deal with the prediction of such effects in estuaries are diffuse in the literature and represent a precious source of information for decision-makers. Thus, the aim of this study was to carry out a synthesis of the predictions made about the effects of SLR on estuarine systems. A systematic literature review was performed. From the recovered studies, a qualitative synthesis of the global distribution and the predicted SLR effects on estuaries was carried out. The quantitative synthesis for saline intrusion was performed using data from SLR and river discharge. Additionally, a case study was proposed with the application of the multiple regression model to predict saline intrusion in a real estuary. The results showed that most of the studies were carried out in the northern hemisphere and, in areas identified as vulnerable to SLR, which are potentially already experiencing some SLR effects. Most of them dealt with saline intrusion in the estuary using predictive hydrodynamic numerical models. The results of the quantitative synthesis showed that these studies predict a direct relationship between saline intrusion and SLR and the inverse with the river discharge. Results also reveal that discharge reduction due to future drought scenarios could be a very important factor for the saline intrusion increase. Ecological studies used a predictive approach and laboratory experiments and mainly dealt with the flooding and salinity increase effects. The incorporation of hydrodynamic models to ecological models and simulations that assess the effects of human interventions to mitigate the SLR impacts on estuaries are recommended. In this study we review the main environmental impacts associated with climate change in estuaries and discuss limitations and the use of tools that can be applied in building estuary governance and management strategies.

W.; Seow, Wei Jie			Climate change and population health in Singapore: a systematic review	LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC			English	Review							AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE	Gaseous emissions have contributed to global warming, an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events and poorer air quality. The associated health impacts have been well reported in temperate regions. In Singapore, key climate change adaptation measures and activities include coastal and flood protection, and mitigating heat impacts. We systematically reviewed studies examining climate variability and air quality with population health in Singapore, a tropical city-state in South-East Asia (SEA), with the aim to identify evidence gaps for policymakers. We included 14 studies with respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular outcomes, foodborne disease and dengue. Absolute humidity (3 studies) and rainfall (2 studies) were positively associated with adverse health. Extreme heat (2 studies) was inversely associated with adverse health. The effects of mean ambient temperature and relative humidity on adverse health were inconsistent. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone were positively associated with adverse health. Climate variability and air quality may have disease-specific, differing directions of effect in Singapore. Additional high quality studies are required to strengthen the evidence for policymaking. Research on effective climate action advocacy and adaptation measures for community activities should be strengthened.

J	Clinch, M				Clinch, Megan			Environmental stewardship in austere times: nurturing sustainable socio-ecological relations	CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Planetary health; environmental stewardship; austerity localism; care; permaculture	HEALTH IMPACTS; CARE	Like many communities, the people who live alongside the Calder River and its catchment in Yorkshire, UK, are having to face the health and other consequences of climate change, and catastrophic flooding is becoming a frequent event. Through the concept of planetary health, it is claimed the protection of natural and human systems could be achieved, in part, through the stewardship of common pool resources by the communities that know and depend on them. This paper explores, ethnographically, the challenges of enacting stewardship in the context of austerity. It shows how the socially reproductive capacity required for stewardship is limited in the context of austerity, which impinges the wellbeing and agency of stewards and the sustainability of their stewardship work. Building on theories of care, it is suggested that by aligning stewardship work with the ethical principles of permaculture - care for the earth, care for people, and fair share - forms of agency and action capable of addressing the many challenges wrought by austerity and climate change could be enabled.

Local governments around the world are using various strategies to address sea level rise and coastal flooding. Most of these responses are reactive, developed in an ad hoc manner following a specific event, but there is an increasing recognition of the need for more comprehensive and proactive approaches. Research into the topic reflects practice, with numerous studies of particular locations or strategies providing information in a piecemeal manner lacking in comprehensive evaluations. This paper addresses this gap through a systematic literature review that identifies coastal flooding and sea level rise adaptation practices and evaluates their comparative advantages and disadvantages. The findings identify a major knowledge gap in comparative costs and benefits of alternative adaptation strategies and indicate that coastal climate adaptation needs to be tailored to local characteristics and use a combination of different structural and non-structural measures to be effective.

This paper uses game theory in conjunction with discounting to explore strategies by which governments might encourage pre-disaster relocation by residents living in areas at high risk of flooding due to sea-level rise. We find that offering a subsidy (e.g., a partial buyout) can be effective if government has a significantly lower discount rate than residents. We also present extensions to our model, exploring the use of a fixed annual benefit after relocation (instead of a one-time subsidy), and hyperbolic instead of standard exponential discounting. Numerical sensitivity analysis elucidates many important factors affecting the timing of anticipatory relocation, since for example relocating too soon may be costly to both residents and government if flooding risk is increasing only gradually. This conceptual model also provides a foundation for future studies that quantify the model with more realistic parameter values (e.g., realistic estimates of flooding probabilities), and alternative behavioral models of resident decision making.

We integrate quantitative risk analysis (RA) and economic impact analysis (EIA) into a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and costs of infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction (MR & R) strategies. Moving beyond this, the framework explicitly incorporates the bidirectional feedback/impact between asset management (in normal situations) and risk management (against extreme conditions). To illustrate the application, the framework is applied to a case study on the roadway transportation system of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), considering flood risk and the impact of future sea level rise. The case study demonstrates quantitative measures of the agency and user cost, risk, and other economic and environmental impacts under different MR & R, coastal flood and sea level rise scenarios. The framework supports high-level decision-making that transportation agencies face such as project prioritization, resilience planning, and capital planning. It can be generalized to analyze different types of infrastructure and natural hazards.

Aspects of global change, including CO2 enrichment, climate change, land use alteration, and shifts in aboveground biodiversity all have the potential to affect soil biodiversity, as well as the ecosystem-level processes that they regulate. While there is a growing body of scientific literature recognising and addressing community and ecosystem response to multiple, interacting elements of global change, soil biodiversity and soil systems are still relatively underrepresented in this literature. Yet, at the same time, soils play a major role in global carbon budgets, and therefore hold the key to understanding future climate scenarios. This special issue highlighted the current knowledge of how soil biodiversity responds to pertinent global change factors, and the ecosystem-level consequences of those changes. We received empirical and theoretical studies on land use change, nitrogen deposition, warming, elevated CO2 atmospheric concentration as well as drought and flood. Based on the contributions included, we discuss responses of global change in different soil taxonomic groups, and identify next steps.

This robust fingerprint of climate change is of particular concern, resulting in heavy rainfall and devastating floods. Often this intensification is explained as a consequence of the Clausius-Clapeyron law in a warmer world, under constant relative humidity. Here, based on an ensemble of CMIP5 global climate models and high-resolution regional climate simulations, we take the example of Southwest Asia, where extreme storms will intensify beyond the Clausius- Clapeyron scaling, and propose an additional novel mechanism for this region: the unique increase in atmospheric relative humidity over the Arabian Sea and associated deep northward penetration of moisture. This increase in humidity is dictated by changes in circulation over the Indian Ocean. Our proposed mechanism is consistent with the recent, most extreme storm ever observed in the region. Our findings advance a new understanding of natural climate variability in this region, with substantial implications for climate change adaptation of the region's critical infrastructure.

This research presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on urban stormwater management optimization from 2004 to 2023, with the aim of understanding how the field has responded to these escalating challenges. Aiming to map the evolution and current state of the field, this study employed a methodical approach, using CiteSpace to analyze publication trends, authorship patterns, and geographical distributions, as well as keyword and citation dynamics. The findings reveal a marked increase in research activity after 2014, with significant contributions observed between 2019 and 2022. Key research themes identified include low-impact development, green infrastructure, and stormwater management, with a notable shift towards hybrid grey-green infrastructure solutions that combine traditional and ecological elements. The prevalence of terms such as 'best management practices' and 'Green Roofs' in recent publications indicates a growing emphasis on practical, case-study-based research, particularly in green infrastructure technologies like bioretention cells. These insights underscore the field's movement towards pragmatic, multi-objective optimization frameworks with tangible applications, guiding future research directions in this increasingly complex domain.

Oriented by a "cascading disaster health inequities" approach, we examine anxiety and depression after a cold-weather disaster using survey data (n = 790) collected in eight Texas metropolitan statistical areas following Winter Storm Uri (2021). 14.9% of respondents experienced anxiety (GAD-2) and 15.1% experienced depression (PHQ-2) six months after the event. In multivariable models, disability status and having more adverse event experiences during the storm increased odds of depression and anxiety. Minority racial/ethnic status was associated with greater odds of depression, but not anxiety. Those who were Black and disabled, Hispanic and disabled, disabled and Uri impacted, Black and Uri impacted or Hispanic and Uri impacted faced increased odds of depression compared to the applicable "doubly privileged" reference category. Those who were Hispanic and disabled or disabled and Uri impacted experienced elevated odds of anxiety compared to the applicable "doubly privileged" reference category. Results demonstrate the utility of a "cascading disasters mental health inequities" approach for illuminating how social factors intersect with disaster experiences to shape disparate risks.

J	Stanley, M; Hotard, A; Pilgreen, D; Meyer, M				Stanley, Michelle; Hotard, Abbey; Pilgreen, Daniel; Meyer, Michelle			Critical Review of National Flood Policy Outcomes	JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT			English	Review						flood; federal disaster assistance; hazard mitigation; disaster recovery; social equity; social vulnerability	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HOUSING RECOVERY; UNITED-STATES; DISASTERS; IMPACTS; RELOCATION; JUSTICE; PROGRAM; HAZARD	Populations are increasingly exposed to natural hazards due to expanding development and climate change. This exposure is exacerbated by sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors limiting resources for disaster mitigation and recovery. Federal disaster assistance is crucial for communities in the wake of catastrophic events by supplementing local resources. However, recent research suggests that federal disaster assistance may exacerbate existing inequality across social groups. The most pervasive and costliest disaster in the United States is flooding. The federal government maintains multiple programs supporting flood mitigation and recovery, yet a comprehensive understanding of how these programs may foster inequitable outcomes is lacking. This paper uses a systematic review of federal flood policy literature over the last decade to fill this gap and identify patterns that may contribute to inequitable outcomes. Results suggest that despite over 100 flood-related disasters occurring over the past decade, the effectiveness of flood policies across social groups is relatively unstudied. And when studied, federal policies themselves do not explicitly lead to inequitable outcomes. Instead, we conclude that policies prioritize equality over equity and do not overcome systematic oppressive and racist decision-making. These findings further the understanding that social vulnerability to natural hazards is a complex and contextual issue.

This systematic review explores extreme events and their effect on gender-based violence (GBV) experienced by women, girls, and sexual and gender minorities. We searched ten databases until February, 2022. Grey literature was searched using the websites of key organisations working on GBV and Google. Quantitative studies were described narratively, whereas qualitative studies underwent thematic analysis. We identified 26 381 manuscripts. 41 studies were included exploring several types of extreme events (ie, storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires) and GBV (eg, sexual violence and harassment, physical violence, witch killing, early or forced marriage, and emotional violence). Studies were predominantly cross-sectional. Although most qualitative studies were of reasonable quality, most quantitative studies were of poor quality. Only one study included sexual and gender minorities. Most studies showed an increase in one or several GBV forms during or after extreme events, often related to economic instability, food insecurity; mental stress, disrupted infrastructure, increased exposure to men, tradition, and exacerbated gender inequality. These findings could have important implications for sexual-transfonnative and gender-transformative interventions, policies, and implementation. High-quality evidence from large, ethnographically diverse cohorts is essential to explore the effects and driving factors of GBV during and after extreme events.

J	Song, J; Li, WF				Song, Jing; Li, Weifeng			Linkage Between the Environment and Individual Resilience to Urban Flooding: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						individual resilience; human behavior; environmental cognition; urban flooding; hierarchical linear model (HLM)	CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; PLACE; INDICATORS; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; CITIES; SENSE	Resilience is widely accepted as the capacities implemented to manage climate change. Exploring how individual resilience can be enhanced to better prepare residents for natural disasters, such as urban flooding, is therefore necessary. Environmental cognitions that provide psychological and physiological benefits to people by adding motivation to interact with the place are factors influencing people's resilience-oriented behaviors but have largely been ignored in existing research. As such, this study establishes a framework for the concept of individual resilience to urban flooding. Gongming, a sub-district of Shenzhen, China, is considered the case area wherein individual resilience and its environmental determinants are evaluated. Through hierarchical linear modeling, the environmental determinants of individual resilience at the individual and community levels are identified. At the individual level, the main factors are a few green spaces, low quality of the built environment, mutual distrust and lack of well-being perceived by residents. At the community level, the results suggest that the social environment, particularly its gatedness, is pivotal to individual resilience. This study offers an approach for analyzing factors that limit individual resilience from the environmental perspective, thereby providing a basis for formulating corresponding policy recommendations to effectively improve resilience through urban planning.

However, the future MC climate is largely unknown, in particular the ENSO-rainfall teleconnection. ENSO induces a zonal dipole pattern of rainfall variability across the Indo-Pacific Ocean, that is, positive variability in the tropical Pacific and negative variability toward the MC. Here, new CMIP6 models robustly project that, for both land and sea rainfall, the negative ENSO teleconnection over the MC (drier during El Nino and wetter during La Nina) could intensify significantly under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 (SSP585) warming scenario. A strengthened teleconnection may cause enhanced droughts and flooding, leading to agricultural impacts and altering rainfall predictability over the region. Models also project that both the Indo-Pacific rainfall center and the zero crossing of dipole-like rainfall variability shift eastward; these adjustments are more notable during boreal summer than during winter. All these projections are robustly supported by the model agreement and scale up with the warming trend.

J	Mishra, AK				Mishra, Anoop Kumar			On the linkage between changes in cloud cover and precipitation extremes over Central India	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS			English	Article						Climate change; Flood; Drought; Cloud cover; Convection; Precipitation	HEAVY RAINFALL; ANALYSIS TMPA; TRENDS; TRMM; PRODUCTS; MAXIMUM	In this study, linkage between changing characteristics of precipitation extremes and cloud covers over Central India is explored during summer monsoon period using Satellite data (1998-2015). This is a first attempt to relate the changes in cloud cover to the changes in precipitation extremes. Non-rainy cirrus clouds are excluded from this study. Results show that heavy rainfall ( >= 60 mm/day) is associated with cold cloud tops (Tb <= 5.220 K) while moderate rainfall ( < 60 mm/day and >= 20 mm) occurs mostly with middle clouds (Tb > 220 K and <= 245K). Low level clouds (Tb > 245 K) are responsible for light rainfall ( < 20 mm/day). Increases in top 20%, 10%, 5% and 1% heavy precipitation relate well with the increases in very deep convective, deep convective and convective cloud cover. Among these relations, increase in top 5% heavy precipitation relates best with increase in very deep convective cloud cover. Decrease in bottom 30% low precipitation relates with decrease in low level cloud cover. The results reported in this study fit into the framework of how weather extremes respond to climate change.

Changes in precipitation patterns and large areas of impervious surfaces in urban environments are increasing the sensitivity of these systems to runoff production. At the same time, projected global sea-level rise may further increase the frequency of compound flooding due to simultaneous storm surge, sea-level rise and pluvial runoff that cause vast socio-economic and ecological impacts to coastal cities. In this context, over the last decade, the role of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) has been recognised to support climate change adaptation by addressing ideas of multi-functionality, non -linearity and heterogeneity in urban design. Thus, increasing awareness about NBS benefits increases the willingness to accept these solutions. However, empirical evidence of NBS effectiveness at the urban catchment scale is still subject to debate. This study develops a spatial biophysical-economic framework that allows for the integrated assessment of NBS flood risk mitigation impacts, costs and benefits in the face of climate change, combining the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, benefit transfer methods and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Specifically, the InVEST Urban Flood Risk Mitigation model was used to assess the biophysical impacts of NBS on urban pluvial flood risk, benefit-transfer methods were used to evaluate the economic implications of such solutions, and GIS was used to integrate and map biophysical impacts and economic implications. For the case of the coastal lagoon city of Aveiro (Portugal), NBS scenarios of green roofs and bioswales under current and future climate conditions were assessed. The main findings of this study show that green roofs scenarios would save 32 % of the flood damages to buildings and infrastructures every year, while bioswales help save only 0.1 %. Moreover, green roofs implementation provides larger benefits in the future climate scenario (representative concentration pathway - RCP - 4.5). The findings confirm the extent to which knowledge on NBS benefits and costs is partial and uncertain, thus requiring constant progress through biophysical-economic assessment to support an evolutive decision making process in climate adaptation planning.

The area where the eastern margin of the Asian westerly jet area meets the low-altitude area of the transition zone (which has a temperate continental monsoon climate) is delicate and sensitive to climate change. An urgent issue is to determine the climate change pattern of this area in the past. On the basis of core samples of four tree species in four typical regions of this joint area, we built a standardized chronological table according to tree-ring width and reconstructed the cumulative precipitation from March to August series in the above area in the past 203-343 years. Since the reconstructed results corresponded well to climate events and drought and flooding periods in historical records, the reconstructed model was stable and reliable. The results were as follows: The precipitation in the study area from east to the west in the growth season has changed dramatically, and the period has gradually shortened. In the 19th century, there was a wet period in the high-latitude area. From the 19th century to the 1950s, the entire study area experienced a significant dry period that lasted for 20-45 years; the starting time of the dry period was gradually delayed from the west to the middle, and the wet period gradually grew shorter at an increasing rate. In the past half-century, this area experienced a significant drought period, and the drying rate was higher in the west and east regions than in the central region. In the past two centuries, the precipitation varied significantly in the study area, and the wet period played a dominant role, growing gradually shorter. The middle and west regions of the Asian westerly jet area and the high-latitude regions of the transition zone all experienced significant wetting or drying processes in the first half of the 19th century, and since then, all areas experienced significant drying processes under the influence of global warming, which may be intensified by the westerly circulation.

Mapping storm spatial profiles for flood impact assessments	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Spatial quantile mapping; Extreme rainfall; Urban flood; High-resolution rainfall; Climate change	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONVECTIVE RAINFALL; WEATHER GENERATOR; EXTREME STORMS; MODEL; RISK; TEMPERATURES; VARIABILITY; INTENSITY; FRAMEWORK	Synthetic design storms are often used to plan new drainage systems or assess flood impacts on infrastructure. To simulate extreme rainfall events under climate change, design storms can be modified to match a different return frequency of extreme rainfall events as well as a modified temporal distribution of rainfall intensities. However, the same magnitude of change to the rainfall intensities is often applied in space. Several hydrological applications are limited by this. Climate change impacts on urban pluvial floods, for example, require the use of 2D design storms (rainfall fields) at sub-kilometer and sub-hourly scales. Recent kilometer scale climate models, also known as convection-permitting climate models (CPM), provide rainfall outputs at a high spatial resolution, although rainfall simulations are still restricted to a limited number of climate scenarios and time periods. We nevertheless explored the potential use of rainfall data obtained from these models for hydrological flood impact studies by introducing a method of spatial quantile mapping (SQM). To demonstrate the new methodology, we extracted high-resolution rainfall simulations from a CPM for four domains representing different urban areas in Switzerland. Extreme storms that are plausible under the present climate conditions were simulated with a 2D stochastic rainfall model. Based on the CPM-informed stochastically generated rainfall fields, we modified the design storms to fit the future climate scenario using three different methods: the SQM, a uniform quantile mapping, and a uniform adjustment based on a rainfall-temperature relationship. Throughout all storms, the temporal distribution of rainfall was the same. Using a flood model, we assessed the impact of different rainfall adjustment methods on urban flooding. Significant differences were found in the flood water depths and areas between the three methods. In general, the SQM method results in a higher flood impact than the storms that were modified otherwise. The results suggest that spatial storm profiles may need to be re-adjusted when assessing flood impacts.

In order to support integrated coastal zone management and advance the basic source-pathway-receptor-consequence" approach focused on traditional receptors (e.g., population, infrastructure, and economy), a novel risk framework is proposed able to evaluate potential risks of loss or degradation of ecosystem services (ESs) due to projected extreme sea level scenarios in the Italian coast. Three risk scenarios for the reference period (1969-2010) and future time frame up to 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are developed by integrating extreme water-level projections related to changing climate conditions, with vulnerability information about the topography, distance from coastlines, and presence of artificial protections. A risk assessment is then performed considering the potential effects of the spatial-temporal variability of inundations and land use on the supply level and spatial distribution of ESs. The results of the analysis are summarized into a spatially explicit risk index, useful to rank coastal areas more prone to ESs losses or degradation due to coastal inundation at the national scale. Overall, the Northern Adriatic coast is scored at high risk of ESs loss or degradation in the future scenario. Other small coastal strips with medium risk scores are the Eastern Puglia coast, Western Sardinia, and Tuscany's coast. The ESs Coastal Risk Index provides an easy-to-understand screening assessment that could support the prioritization of areas for coastal adaptation at the national scale. Moreover, this index allows the direct evaluation of the public value of ecosystems and supports more effective territorial planning and environmental management decisions. In particular, it could support the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based approaches (e.g., ecological engineering and green infrastructures) to mitigate the risks of climate change and extreme events while protecting ecosystems and biodiversity.

Edaphic stress interactions: Important yet poorly understood drivers of plant production in future climates	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						Edaphic stress; Climate change; Soil fertility; Crop breeding	ROOT CORTICAL AERENCHYMA; ENHANCES NITROGEN ACQUISITION; PHOSPHORUS ACQUISITION; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; WATER ACQUISITION; BRANCHING DENSITY; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; SOIL PENETRATION; SUGAR MAPLE	Most terrestrial plants experience multiple edaphic (i.e. soil-related) stresses concurrently. Interactions among edaphic stresses may be characterized by dominance of one stress over others, neutral interactions whose effects are additive, mitigating interactions in which the effects of multiple stresses are less than additive, potentiating interactions in which the effects of multiple stresses are greater than additive, and dynamic equilibria in which plant responses seek to minimize all stresses concurrently. Existing theoretical paradigms, notably the Law of the Minimum and the Multiple Limitation Hypothesis, do not adequately account for interactions of edaphic stresses. Reduced growth resulting from edaphic stress is itself an important modulator of stress interactions by reducing resource demand as well as reducing soil resource capture. Root adaptations to one edaphic stress may either mitigate or potentiate other edaphic stresses, as evidenced by the examples of root architectural tradeoffs for water and P capture, in contrast to root architectural synergies for water and nitrate capture. In high-input agroecosystems, edaphic stress complexes of global importance include mechanical impedance/poor soil structure/drought stress, and salinity/drought stress. In low-input agroecosystems, globally important edaphic stress complexes include drought and low soil P availability, as well as the acid soil complex, characterized by toxicity of Al and possibly Mn, combined with low availability of P, K, Ca, and Mg. Global climate change is likely to exacerbate edaphic stress, by increasing the severity and frequency of drought and flooding, accelerating soil degradation, and altering plant phenology. Many of the edaphic stresses exacerbated by global climate change have potentiating interactions with each other, which is likely to make them more harmful than anticipated from their direct effects. Edaphic stresses linked to climate change are likely to have severe impacts in developing nations, which generally have more problematic soils and more limited management options than developed nations. The potential benefits of CO2 fertilization for plants in future climates may be mitigated by edaphic stress. Edaphic stress interactions are a challenge for crop breeding programs, because resistance to edaphic stress is generally quantitative and may display fitness tradeoffs with other edaphic stresses. Germplasm evaluation in farmer's conditions, ideotype breeding, and deployment of root phenotypes with utility for multiple edaphic stresses, such as long, dense root hairs, and root cortical aerenchyma, would be helpful in this context. Interactions among edaphic stresses are key drivers of plant growth in the majority of global soils. Improved understanding of edaphic stress interactions is needed to develop the more resilient, stress tolerant crops and cropping systems that are urgently needed in global agriculture.

This study aimed to develop a framework for assessing Vietnam's water security based on the following key aspects: (i) the availability of water resources; (ii) the current status of water exploitation and use; (iii) the current status of waste water and water pollution; (iv) water resource management organization; and (v) water-related disasters, including floods, droughts, subsidence, coastal erosion, landslides, ecological imbalance, and diseases related to water resources. In particular, the challenges of transboundary water resources and the food-energy-water nexus were investigated. We reviewed the assessment frameworks that have recently been developed outside Vietnam or regions with similar climates and analyzed the characteristics of downstream and rapid-growth countries such as Vietnam using a number of key water resource indicators, both qualitative and quantitative. From these processes, we developed an assessment framework and provided a perspective on water security. The results of this study showed that the challenge of transboundary water resources, the impact of climate change, the pressure on socioeconomic development, and the water-energy-food nexus are core issues that need to be addressed from the perspective of water security in Vietnam. This case study may be helpful for downstream and developing countries.

However, compared to the densely populated lowland floodplains, the upland channel morphodynamics of free-flowing rivers in a complex high-elevation alluvial setting have received less attention. In this study, we quantitatively investigated channel morphodynamics and associated frozen bank migration in the upper Yarlung Tsangpo River in the Himalayan headwater basin from the 1980s to the 2010s. By combining remote sensing analysis with field investigations, we found mean migration rates of 244 gravel-bed river bends ranging from 1.63 m/yr in the 1980s to 2.76 m/yr in the 2010s, with a maximum rate of 18.61 m/yr. The highest migration rates were associated with bends that had a width-normalised curvature radius between 3.0 and 5.0 and a sinuosity between 1.2 and 1.5. A-69% increase in river-bend migration and 30% more frequent bend cutoffs coincided nicely with the rapid expansion of glacial lakes due to a-1 degrees C increase in mean annual air temperature over the past four decades. Positive correlations were observed between channel migration rate and temperature, mean glacial lake area, and runoff. These results highlight the importance of the unique channel morphodynamics and the intense lateral movements of upland rivers. The close link between these dynamics and climate change suggests that a warmer world may significantly influence bank erosion and associated ecosystem processes of upland alluvial systems, which are essential for comprehending frozen channel dynamics and developing strategies for habitat protection in uplands worldwide.

A multi-criteria assessment of climate change impacts on urban sustainability in Dammam Metropolitan Area, Saudi Arabia	AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Carbon emissions; Climate change impacts; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation approaches	GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; FLOOD VULNERABILITY; WATER SCARCITY; CITIES; EMISSIONS; RISK; DISASTERS; HEALTH; WASTE; MODEL	Climate change (CC) is increasingly causing precarious and pervasive disruption to lives, livelihoods, and the environment. The Global South countries are vulnerable to CC impacts due to rapid urbanization, poverty, low resilience, and poor governance. While some countries have implemented measures to mitigate CC impacts, many strive to do so. Saudi Arabia is among the Global South countries with high per capita energy use and carbon emission. However, there is a dearth of studies that assess the impacts of CC for better mitigation efforts and decision-making. The present study is an effort to attend to this research need. This article uses experts-based survey (n = 12) to assess the impacts of CC on the Dammam Metropolitan Area using an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The findings indicate that the highest ranked CC impacts based on priority weights are sea-level rise then coastal flooding, trailed by the threat to public health and low agricultural productivity. However, groundwater depletion and urban heat islands were deemed having the least impacts. Also, the experts ranked green infrastructure and sustainable transportation as more effective than green buildings in mitigating CC impacts in the study area. The study recommends that green infrastructure (GI), sustainable transportation (ST), and sustainable urban form (SUF) are more appropriate mitigation measures to CC impacts in Saudi Arabia and similar geographical regions. Because CC impacts on humans and the environment are widespread, mitigation and adaptation efforts can assist in lowering their adverse effects and promoting environmental sustainability.

Response of the Lake Ecosystem of the Lesser Kuril Ridge to Paleoclimatic and Seismic Events	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS			English	Article						paleolake; diatoms; climate change; paleotsunami; floods; cyclogenesis; El Nino; Younger Dryas; Holocene; Kuril Islands	SOUTHERN OKINAWA TROUGH; NORTH-WESTERN PACIFIC; ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; CRUSTAL MOVEMENTS; HIGH-RESOLUTION; LATE QUATERNARY; ITURUP ISLAND; OKHOTSK SEA	In this paper we restore moisture changes since the Younger Dryas based on the study of diatom flora in sediments of the Zelenyi coastal paleolake, the Lesser Kuril Ridge. The section includes numerous interlayers of tephra, the sources of which were located on the islands of Kunashir and Hokkaido, and interlayers of tsunamigenic sands, which made it possible to determine the impact of catastrophic events on changes in the ecological situation. The stages of the development of the lake are identified and its evolution is analyzed during short-period climatic rhythms. The reservoir had its maximal depth at the beginning of the Holocene, and planktonic forms predominated among diatoms. Three phases when the lake turned into a lagoon were established, and the erosion of the barrier form most likely caused this during large tsunamis associated with earthquakes. Except for these cases, the main factor leading to the change in lacustrine-marsh environments was climate change. We identified relatively dry periods and wet periods associated with an increase in the intensity of cyclogenesis in the South Kurils region. We correlated with high-resolution paleoclimatic records from archives for the Southern Kuriles; the most striking events were compared with data for Sakhalin and the continent. Changes in moisture on the islands and the margin of the mainland in the Middle-Late Holocene were established to be in antiphase in most cases, except for the cooling of 2800-2500 BP and the Little Ice Age. The connection of regional climatic changes with anomalies in the ocean and atmosphere of the Asia-Pacific region is shown.	[Razzhigaeva, N. G.; Grebennikova, T. A.; Ganzey, L.

A model based on socioeconomic and environmental indicators was used to assess and categorize vulnerability to ERE at the municipal level, in Sinaloa, a coastal state of northwest Mexico. Coastal vulnerability was assessed based on a system of indicators, integrated into five criteria within two higher categories: response capacity (Economic conditions, Social development, and Living standards), and severity (Geographic exposure and Risk intensifiers). From a preliminary set of 25 indicators, three of them were selected by criterion using the Delphi method, and their values were later standardized from 0 (low) to 1 (high) on a vulnerability scale. Both criteria and indicators were weighted following an analytical hierarchical process (AHP), resulting in the main determinants of vulnerability being Geographic exposure (0.43) and Economic conditions (0.34). This first approach to a vulnerability assessment using standardized values showed that Guasave (to the north) and Escuinapa (to the south) are the most vulnerable municipalities, scoring >9.0 (with 15 being the maximum score). In contrast, Culiacan and San Ignacio, both central municipalities, ranked as the least vulnerable (<5.5). A further analysis using the integral vulnerability index (IVI) corroborated Guasave (3.73) and Escuinapa (3.15) as the most vulnerable, discarding latitudinal changes as a possible promotor of vulnerability. Although the coastal population was the main determinant of vulnerability (median = 0.57), other indicators associated with severity as well as response capacity were responsible for the increase in IVI scores. This study highlights the need for an integrated vulnerability analysis to support public policies and the decision-making process to protect coastal communities from environmental climate change.

This study aimed at exploring the difference in farmers' perceptions of CC impacts on crop production and variation in adaptation measures across the Ganges' Tidal Floodplain (GTF) region. To unlock the local level context-specific nature of adaptation, the study area covered two distinct zones of the GTF: interior zone, surrounded by the Sundarbans mangrove forest, and exterior zone being more exposed to the Bay of Bengal. An analysis of the differences in empirical climate parameter trends and farmers' adaptations to adjust to these changes in the two sample study areas (one from each zone) was conducted. In the exterior zone (Patuakhali), delayed monsoon and increasing intensity of post-monsoon rainfall coupled with poor water drainage resulted in delayed winter vegetable production and late harvest of rainy season rice (aman), eventually leading to a loss of winter rice season (boro). Rainfall in the interior zone (Satkhira) was found erratic and unevenly distributed causing unexpected loss of harvest. Farmers in both areas reported a high impact of CC on crop production. Farmers reported optimisation of fertiliser and pesticide use and planting date adjustment as the most practiced adaptations in both areas. Other preferred adaptation options were rice-fish farming in Satkhira and growing of high-value cash crops in Patuakhali. In terms of weighted average index scoring, Satkhira farmers on average had medium adaptation scores, while most of Patuakhali farmers had medium to low adaptation scores. Living in the same agroecological zone, the difference in farmers' perceptions, climate variability, and adaptation practices call for context- and location-specific adaptation planning and policy.

Dry climates of southern Africa have, over the years, experienced an increase in the frequency of tropical cyclone induced floods. However, understanding the key factors that influence susceptibility to floods has remained largely unexplored in these dry climates. Therefore, this study sought to model flood hazards and determine key factors that significantly explain the probability of flood occurrence in the southern parts of Beitbridge District, Zimbabwe. To achieve these objectives, logistic regression was used to predict spatial variations in flood hazards following cyclone Dineo in 2017. Before spatial prediction of flood hazard, environmental variables were tested for multicollinearity using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Only two environmental variables, i.e., elevation and rainfall, were not significantly correlated and were thus used in the subsequent flood hazard modelling. Results demonstrate that two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicted spatial variations in flood hazard in the southern parts of the Beitbridge District with relatively high accuracy defined by the area under the curve (AUC = 0.98). In addition, results indicate that similar to 56 % of the study area is regarded as highly susceptible to floods. Given the projected increase in extreme events such as intense rainfall as a result of climate change, floods will be expected to correspondingly increase in these semi-arid regions. Results presented in this study underscore the importance of geospatial techniques in flood-hazard modelling, which is the key input in sustainable land-use planning. It can thus be concluded that spatial analytical techniques play a key role in flood early warning systems aimed at supporting and building resilient communities in the face of climate change-induced floods.

J	Dutta, R; Maity, R				Dutta, Riya; Maity, Rajib			Time-varying network-based approach for capturing hydrological extremes under climate change with application on drought	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrologic Extremes; Climate Change; Droughts; Time-varying approach; Bayesian Networks (BNs)	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODEL; SELECTION; CHALLENGES; FRAMEWORK; INFERENCE; IMPACTS	Hydrologic extremes often lead to droughts and floods that adversely affect the socio-economic development. Change in the characteristics and causes of hydrologic extremes due to climate variability and climate change poses a challenge for its reliable prediction. We propose a time-varying approach to capture such temporal changes, often gradual, in hydrologic extremes through temporal networks (a series of network structures). Graphical Modelling (GM) based networks are developed through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to deal with the complexity between the causal variables and extreme events. A demonstration of the proposed time-varying approach is shown for 1-month and 3-month ahead hydrological drought prediction in terms of Standardized Streamflow Anomaly Index (SSAI), at basin scale, that has notably changed in the recent years in terms of its frequency and severity. The frequency and severity of below-normal flow events has increased, particularly during the monsoon season (high flow months). We hypothesize that time-varying cause-effect relationship is important to capture such gradual change in the characteristics of hydrologic extremes. The results indicate that SSAI values for the low flow months are strongly associated with streamflow whereas for the high flow months the dominant predictors are rainfall, precipitable water and relative humidity. Furthermore, the cause-effect relationship between hydroclimatic variables and extreme events needs to be updated every 2 years for high flow and 3 years for low flow months. The proposed model very well captures the above and below-normal flow events and can be used as a remedial measure to handle similar cases through a proper assessment of time-varying cause-effect relationship between hydroclimatic variables and extreme events.

Transmission of West Nile and five other temperate mosquito-borne viruses peaks at temperatures between 23°C and 26°C	ELIFE			English	Article							ROSS-RIVER-VIRUS; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; RIFT-VALLEY FEVER; CULEX-TARSALIS DIPTERA; VECTOR COMPETENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-TEMPERATURE; EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; EXTRINSIC INCUBATION; FLOODWATER MOSQUITO	The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector-pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefascsiatus, Cx. tarsalis, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23-26 degrees C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24 degrees C, matching model-predicted optima (24-25 degrees C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations.

We aimed to prepare a flood susceptibility map of Kathmandu metropolitan city (KMC) and identify the most flood-susceptible local administrative unit using a multi-criteria decision analysis model, including the analytical hierarchical process and weighted linear combination in geographic information system. Six flood hazard criteria-slope, elevation, drainage density, rainfall, land use and cover, and distance from river-were proposed to produce a flood susceptibility map. Among them, distance from river was the most significant criterion followed by rainfall and land use and land cover. The results showed that a large proportion (56%) of KMC is in moderate flood potential zone, while 32% and 11% proportions of KMC are in high and low flood potential zones, respectively. Wards 4 and 14 of KMC are the highest and lowest flood prone zones, respectively. The accuracy of the obtained map by multicriteria decision model is 81.2%, which was validated through observation of the significant flood events and flood location. These findings are useful for flood risk mitigation and logical allocation of programme budget to the local units. The procedures applied in this study are helpful for hydrologists, urban planners, policymakers, and professionals in hydrology.

Legume crops are of particular importance to food security, supplying dietary protein for humans both directly and in their use for feed and forage. Other than the rhizobia associated with legumes, soil microbes, in particular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), can mitigate the effects of biotic and abiotic stresses, offering an important complementary measure to protect crop yields. This review presents current knowledge on AMF, highlights their beneficial role, and explores the potential for application of AMF in mitigating abiotic and biotic challenges for tropical legumes. Due to the relatively little study on tropical legume species compared to their temperate growing counterparts, much further research is needed to determine how similar AMF-plant interactions are in tropical legumes, which AMF species are optimal for agricultural deployment and especially to identify anaerobic AMF species that could be used to mitigate flood stress in tropical legume crop farming. These opportunities for research also require international cooperation and support, to realize the promise of tropical legume crops to contribute to future food security.

The current research is an empirical regional assessment of the human health effects of summer heat extremes in the Romania-Bulgarian Danube floodplain Calafat-Vidin-Turnu Magurele-Nikopol (CV-TMN) sector. The external biophysical and socioeconomic factors that shape the vulnerability are supported by the climate approach. The research relies on processing meteorological data from the most representative climate stations in the study area based on which some indicators-significant for measuring the impact on human health-were computed (e.g., number of extremely hot days, number of tropical days, number of tropical nights) and integrated into a composite summer heat extremes index (SHEI). To assess HHV to summer heat extremes, the vulnerability framework was completed by the internal socioeconomic factors revealed by the characteristics of the population living in urban and rural settlements in terms of demographic, health provisions, and quality of indoor living spaces. Finally, the authors computed the index of human health vulnerability to summer heat extremes (HHVI) as the Hull Score at the level of territorial local administrative units.

Major Climate risks and Adaptation Strategies of Smallholder Farmers in Coastal Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Gender; Climate change adaptation; Climate risks; Smallholder farmers; Multivariate probit model	AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; PRODUCTIVITY; GENDER; RESPONSES; ETHIOPIA; ADOPTION; POVERTY; TRENDS	Rural households in South Asia's coastal deltas face numerous livelihood challenges, including risks posed by climatic variability and extreme weather events. This study examines major climate risks, farmers' adaptation strategies, and the factors affecting the choice of those strategies using data collected from 630 households in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. Farmers identified cyclones, excessive rain and flooding, and salinity as direct climate risks. Increased crop diseases/pests and livestock diseases were perceived as indirect risks resulting from climatic variability. Farmers used multiple adaptation strategies against those risks such as modifications in farm management, use of savings and borrowing funds from family and neighbors, and periodically reducing household food consumption. Off-farm employment and seeking assistance from governmental as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also common adaptation strategies. The results show that male-headed households are more likely to change farming practices and reduce consumption compared with female-headed households that conversely tended to take assistance from NGOs as an adaptation strategy. Ownership of land and livestock, as well as farmers' prior exposure to climate change and educational training, also had a significant effect on the choice of adaptation strategy. Therefore, development interventions and policies that aimed at improving resource endowment and training to farmers on climatic risks and their adaptation strategies can help minimize the impact of climatic risks.

In this article, expressions for the exceedance probabilities of wet vs. dry conditions were constructed on the basis of the copula joint distribution function. The flood season, non-flood season, and annual precipitation data from the Jvxian and Rizhao stations of the Shuhe to Futuan Water Transfer Project (SFWTP) were used for the analysis of synchronous and asynchronous exceedance probabilities. The computed results demonstrate that synchronous exceedance probabilities were greater than asynchronous exceedance probabilities via the analysis of the flood season, non-flood season, and annual precipitation, and the favorable probability is largest during the flood season. In order to maximize the SFWTP benefit, it is essential to increase urban water supply in the non-flood season, and transport water in the flood season to Rizhao reservoir. To further analyze the impacts of climate change on exceedance probability, the precipitation data were divided into two sub-periods by Pettitt test. In last sub-period, favorable probabilities increased with the decrease of synchronous exceedance probability in all timescales, which suggests that there are positive impacts of climate change on the exceedance probabilities.

This study explores future overarching climate trends of eight of Canada's ecozones containing managed forests. For the 2071 to 2100 period, climate projections indicate a warming trend of up to an additional 5.5 degrees C and an overall increase in annual precipitation. Future trends suggest marked contrast between coastal and interior forests and polarization between western and eastern forests. Warmer temperatures, accumulating degree-days above 5 degrees C and frost-free days suggest longer and drier growing seasons and greater risk of drought particularly in moisture-limited areas such as montane cordillera, taiga shield and boreal shield ecozones. Warmer temperatures and rising precipitation combined with less snow suggest shorter and wetter future winters. This indicates greater risk of rain-on-snow and freeze-thaw events, flooding and landslides particularly in coastal ecozones. We discuss how these projections are likely to result in shifts in dominant species and abundance, which when coupled with the cumulative effects of future disturbances, is likely to alter future forest dynamics and impact harvestable wood volumes for Canada's forestry industry.

For local decision-makers, storm water management is essential for urban planning and development. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop a numerical model for the sewerage network of the central catchment area of Algiers since it has experienced frequent overflows during the winter season. For this purpose, to model the sewerage networks, the model was built by coupling ArcGIS with MIKE URBAN 'MOUSE'. Its calibration and validation were performed using real-time measurements with a time step of 15 min. The model was evaluated by several statistical indicators, such as the coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). The model results showed acceptable model performance, with a NSE superior to 0.50, R-2 of approximately 0.63, RMSE of 7%, and PBIAS of 10% during the validation of the model. The performance parameters prove the reliability of the developed model. The employed model can be applied in other regions and could be helpful for policymakers and managers to improve flood mitigation measures based on the model prediction of the sewerage network.

The frequency and intensity of extremes and other associated events are continuously increasing due to climate change and global warming. The accurate prediction, characterization, and attribution of atmospheric extreme events is, therefore, a key research field in which many groups are currently working by applying different methodologies and computational tools. Machine learning and deep learning methods have arisen in the last years as powerful techniques to tackle many of the problems related to atmospheric extreme events. This paper reviews machine learning and deep learning approaches applied to the analysis, characterization, prediction, and attribution of the most important atmospheric extremes. A summary of the most used machine learning and deep learning techniques in this area, and a comprehensive critical review of literature related to ML in EEs, are provided. The critical literature review has been extended to extreme events related to rainfall and floods, heatwaves and extreme temperatures, droughts, severe weather events and fog, and low-visibility episodes. A case study focused on the analysis of extreme atmospheric temperature prediction with ML and DL techniques is also presented in the paper. Conclusions, perspectives, and outlooks on the field are finally drawn.

Such events can lead to amplifying consequences for the exposed communities located at different elevations. In this study, we present a stylized application of stochastic dynamic programming for local adaptation decision-making for a small alpine community exposed to debris flows and floods. We assume that local decision-makers and planners aim at maximizing specific objectives by choosing from a feasible set of adaptation measures and under given constraints on these actions. Our results show that stochastic dynamic programming is a promising tool to address the underlying problem faced by local planners when evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation measures. Furthermore, stochastic dynamic programming has some advantages compared to deterministic approaches which assume full knowledge of the system of interest in a world dominated by randomness. We provide an estimation of a best option and an appropriate metric to benchmark adaptation effectiveness for long time horizons. We show how multiple constraints, risk preferences, time horizons and decision periods all influence the decision-making and the overall success of adaptation responses over time.

Drawing on Protection Motivation Theory, this study offers insight into the factors influencing residents' intention to implement indi-vidual GI practices by homeowners along the Texas Gulf Coast. The GI practices examined included the potential installation of (1) green roofs, (2) rain barrels, (3) rain gardens, (4) permeable pavement, and (5) tree protection and planting. Our findings revealed that homeowners expressed little interest in adopting GI practices owing to the lack of information, absence of incentives, and guidance on how to implement GI practices. Moreover, the findings from our modeling confirmed that perceptions of the effectiveness and cost of GI had the strongest influence on respondents' intention to implement GI. Other significant indicators such as threat appraisal, reliance on public flood protection, perceived co-benefits, age, and the number of children varied with specific GI practices. These findings provide valuable information for city policymakers and planners in coastal regions concerning the promotion and development of GI that can meet the needs of their residents, provide the impetus for implementation, and in turn, contribute to community resilience.

This manuscript analyses the abrupt shift in these time series and their changing pattern using historical data sets. The Pettitt test and the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test were used to evaluate the time series' homogeneity. The Concentration Index, Precipitation Concentration Index and Seasonality Index were employed to analyse the spatial variability of daily, monthly and seasonal rainfall patterns over the Aghanashini River watershed. Furthermore, the temporal trend in the rainfall, streamflow, and temperature time series was investigated using Mann-Kendall (MK) and the graphical Innovative-Sen (IS) test. Clear evidence of climate change impact on the rainfall and streamflow pattern was recognized, as there is an upward shift in the maximum temperature time series and a downward shift in the rainfall and streamflow time series after 2001. The rainfall indices showed that the watershed has fewer percentage of rainy days and stronger rainfall seasonality, indicating a possible risk of flash floods in the downstream of the watershed. Additionally, the results of the MK and IS trend tests paralleled each other and provided support for the findings emphasized by rainfall indices.

To determine the current status, focus and trends in mountain flood research, in this study, we visualize the number of publications and citations, the countries and institutions engaged in research, co-citations and key literature, keyword categories and research areas, using keyword timeline analysis and burst detection based on the bibliometric software CiteSpace and VOSviewer and the Web of Sciences core collection database. The results show that the total number of publications and citations in the mountain flood field has experienced rapid growth to date. The United States, China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland are the main countries driving the development of the field. The field is of great interest within multiple disciplinary categories and is characterized by multiple research hotspots, multiple research objectives, and cross-fertilization of multiple disciplinary categories. Analysis of the keyword timeline network and highlighted words show that disaster risk evaluation based on remote-sensing technology, the alpine region of the Himalayas, the response mechanisms of heavy rainfall to mountain floods, and the construction of hydrological models, will be research hotspots in the future.

In the northern Gulf, these impacts are exacerbated due to a confluence of socioeconomic issues, making it harder to plan for and adapt to changing conditions. To break through barriers to action, education of coastal residents and youth about future impacts must be undertaken. We worked with a team of researchers and educators to develop a four-module curriculum addressing sea-level rise impacts and community solutions. Module content was informed using the most recent advancements in coastal and estuarine research by collaborating with researchers active in those fields. The curriculum was launched to educators through professional development workshops and tested in classrooms to adaptively incorporate feedback into the final product. The process to collaborate with educators and researchers led to the successful development of a useable and useful curriculum. Students engaged in the curriculum indicated doing more sustainable actions and demonstrated knowledge gains. Educators who participated in trainings and/or testing the curriculum indicated they were more confident teaching SLR-related concepts and also demonstrated knowledge gains. The curriculum can be used widely, and the process can be replicated for other curriculum development in different regions.

An Approach from the Geography Discipline in the Context of Climate Change	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						floods; teaching; education; Social Sciences; Geography	EDUCATION; POLICY	The aims of this research, based on a case study (trainee teachers of Primary degree and Secondary Education-MAES of the University of Valencia, Spain), are to analyse the students' memories and perceptions of their training about floods; to examine the interest in teaching these contents in Social Science and/or Geography classes; and to analyse their proposals to improve teacher training. Methodologically, a questionnaire was distributed among 204 future teachers. The results indicate that the majority, in both groups, (degree and MAES) consider themselves to have a medium level of preparedness to teach these contents to schoolchildren (value of 3): 47.0% of the degree students and 47.4% of the MAES students. In both groups, the majority (89.2% degree; 57.9% MAES) indicate that they had not received training in the university or if they had, it had been insufficient. The study reveals that both those who have received training and those who have not believe themselves to have a similar level of preparedness. As the results of this study show, there is still a lot of ground to be covered in the field of education so that it may become an essential tool to generate a society that is more resilient to climate change.

This paper presents a framework to maximize the effectiveness of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for flood risk reduction and thermal comfort enhancement. The framework involves an assessment of hazards with the use of models and field measurements. It also detects suitable implementation sites for NBS and quantifies their effectiveness for thermal comfort enhancement and flood risk reduction. The framework was applied in a densely urbanized study area, for which different small-scale urban NBS and their potential locations for implementation were assessed. The overall results show that the most effective performance in terms of flood mitigation and thermal comfort enhancement is likely achieved by applying a range of different measures at different locations. Therefore, the work presented here shows the potential of the framework to achieve an effective combination of measures and their locations, which was demonstrated on the case of the Sukhumvit area in Bangkok (Thailand). This can be particularly suitable for assessing and planning flood mitigation measures in combination with heat stress reduction.

Pluvial Flooding in Utrecht: On Its Way to a Flood-Proof City	WATER			English	Article						citizen engagement; flood risk governance; governance capacity; climate adaptation	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; LOCAL-GOVERNMENTS; RISK PERCEPTIONS; GREEN ROOFS; GOVERNANCE; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; CITIES	Downpours are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change. Cities are particularly susceptible to flooding from downpours because of their large share of impervious surfaces. Minimising pluvial flood risk requires all involved stakeholders to collaborate and overcome various barriers. Although an increase in citizen engagement in climate adaptation is generally preferred, experiences with inclusive decision-making are often limited. The aim of this paper is to obtain a deeper understanding of how the capacity to govern pluvial flood risk can be developed through citizen engagement. We scrutinised the capacity of local actors to govern pluvial flood risk in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. For the analysis of Utrecht's problem-solving capacity, the Governance Capacity Framework provided a consistent assessment of the key governance components. The results indicate that Utrecht's capacity to govern pluvial flooding is relatively well-developed. Collaboration between public authorities is advanced, sufficient financial resources are available, and smart monitoring enables high levels of evaluation and learning. However, citizen awareness and engagement in policy making is rather low. Accordingly, citizens' willingness to pay for flood adaptation is limited. Stimulating flood risk awareness by combining financial incentives with more advanced arrangements for active citizen engagement is key for Utrecht and other cities.

Urban Drainage Network Rehabilitation Considering Storm Tank Installation and Pipe Substitution	WATER			English	Article						drainage network; climate change; rehabilitation; optimization; SWMM	EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; WATER; OPTIMIZATION; EFFICIENCY; LOCATIONS; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	The drainage networks of our cities are currently experiencing a growing increase in runoff flows, caused mainly by the waterproofing of the soil and the effects of climate change. Consequently, networks originally designed correctly must endure floods with frequencies much higher than those considered in the design phase. The solution of such a problem is to improve the network. There are several ways to rehabilitate a network: conduit substitution as a former method or current methods such as storm tank installation or combined use of conduit substitution and storm tank installation. To find an optimal solution, deterministic or heuristic optimization methods are used. In this paper, a methodology for the rehabilitation of these drainage networks based on the combined use of the installation of storm tanks and the substitution of some conduits of the system is presented. For this, a cost-optimization method and a pseudo-genetic heuristic algorithm, whose efficiency has been validated in other fields, are applied. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model for hydraulic analysis of drainage and sanitation networks is used. The methodology has been applied to a sector of the drainage network of the city of Bogota in Colombia, showing how the combined use of storm tanks and conduits leads to lower cost rehabilitation solutions.

J	Pahl-Wostl, C				Pahl-Wostl, Claudia			The role of governance modes and meta-governance in the transformation towards sustainable water governance	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Water governance system; Governance mode; Meta-governance	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; FLOOD RISK; POLICY; CHINA; MANAGEMENT; INSIGHTS; POLITICS; MARKETS; PERSPECTIVE; TRANSITION	For several decades, water policy reform and the design of governance systems were dominated by simplistic panaceas. This was accompanied by changing preferences for specific types of policy instruments and modes of steering. Such dominance has given way to a more nuanced understanding of requirements for sustainable and integrated water governance capable of addressing the challenges of global and climate change. This paper focusses on the role of governance modes and on meta-governance. Governance mode refers to a certain logic and form through which governance can be realized. The paper uses the distinction between bureaucratic hierarchies, networks and markets to denote different modes of governance. It argues that hybrid governance systems with synergistic interplay between these different governance modes are essential for dealing with, complex water management challenges. Furthermore, it argues that the development of such governance systems requires a combination of purposeful design and self-organization. An exploratory comparative analysis of water governance in Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, China and South Africa illustrates the validity and relevance of the conceptual considerations. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for meta-governance as a reflexive process of societal learning to develop, evaluate and adapt governance approaches with the purpose of addressing complex societal challenge.

Highly publicized flooding events ravaged the province's water-front communities in 2017 and 2019, with dire health and economic impacts. A recognized com-ponent of integrated flood risk management is the adoption of adaptive behaviors that reduce the vulnerability of exposed households to flooding. A previous study established an index of pre-flood adaptation based on 15 behaviors, using responses of 1951 participants residing within or less than 150 m from officially designated high flood risk zones. 325 of these respondents were successfully recontacted in 2019 for a follow-up survey on their adaptive behaviors, constituting the longitudinal sample used in this study. The new database tracks changes in pre-flood adapta-tion of Quebecers over a span of 4 years and seeks to establish experiential, socio-demographic, and psychosocial variables that predict the preventive behavior adoption rates four years on. Re-sults suggest that there has been no significant increase in the level of adaptive behavior between 2015 and 2019, though households that have experienced a flood or a flood alert in the past are more likely to adapt than those who have not. Furthermore, the most important measures re-ported in 2015 for predicting adoption of behaviors four years on are income, the experience of a flood, and the belief that one lives in a flood-prone zone. Finally, a second stepwise regression in-dicates that a change in flood experience, an increase in perception of the severity of flood im-pacts on one's residence, and adaptation in 2015 are the strongest predictors of adaptation in 2019.

The three physical factors governing the projected aggravation of inundation damage in a coastal basin (i.e., sea-level rise (SLR), direct runoff (DR) and tropical cyclones (TCs)) were defined and considered in the modeling both individually and in combination. With the application of a coupled hydrodynamic-hydrologic model, the inundation extent during the storm event under both current and year 2100 climate conditions was evaluated, and the impact of each factor on the inundation risk was identified. The intercomparison among the results revealed that SLR was the most influential single flooding driver aggravating the future inundation risk, and TC intensification was two-thirds as influential as SLR. However, DR was predicted to make a nearly negligible contribution and to have a minimal impact despite its significant projected increase in the future. Apart from the contributions of these three factors to aggravating the inundation level, the ways in which they affected the inundation risk were quite distinct. Additionally, the result considering both SLR and TC intensification demonstrated that nonlinear interactions between these factors can occur and further amplify the inundation damage. Finally, it was revealed that, depending on the level of the climate change projection, future storms with intensified rainfall and TC properties are likely to cause the maximum projected inundation damage in the study area to increase by up to 28.7% in inundation extent and by 236.6% in inundation volume relative to the current conditions without altering the spatial pattern of the inundation depth distribution.

User-driven solutions are urgently required for sustainable management and protection of monumental complexes and related collections exposed to changes of extreme climate. With this purpose, maps of risk-prone areas in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin have been produced by an accurate selection and analysis of climate variables (daily minimum and maximum temperature-Tn and Tx, daily cumulated precipitation-RR) and climate-extreme indices (R20mm, R95pTOT, Rx5 day, CCD, Tx90p) defined by Expert Team on Climate Change Detection Indices (ETCCDI). Maps are available to users via an interactive Web GIS (Geographic Information System) tool, which provides evaluations based on historical observations (high-resolution gridded data set of daily climate over Europe-E-OBS, 25 km) and climate projections (regional climate models-RCM, similar to 12 km) for the near and far future, under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The tool aims to support public authorities and private organizations in the decision making process to safeguard at-risk cultural heritage. In this paper, maps of risk-prone areas of heavy rain in Central Europe (by using R20mm index) are presented and discussed as example of the outputs achievable by using the Web GIS tool. The results show that major future variations are always foreseen for the 30-year period 2071-2100 under the pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5). In general, the coastal area of the Adriatic Sea, the Northern Italy, and the Alps are foreseen to experience the highest variations in Central Europe.

Previous researches used datasets neglecting either good temporal or good spatial resolution, PERSIANN-CCSCDR, ERA5, and SM2RAIN-ASCAT are some of the projects aiming to remedy these limitations. This study's goal is to evaluate the accuracy of the PERSIANN-CCS-CDR, ERA5, and SM2RAIN-ASCAT at a monthly scale and their suitability for drought assessment in a Moroccan semiarid watershed. Several statistical indices were computed, the drought SPI was calculated using PERSIANN-CCS-CDR estimates, ERA5 products, and observed records as an input in the SPI formula using the Gamma distribution to simulate drought from 1983 to 2017. The preliminary comparison and evaluation results of PERSIANN-CCS-CDR estimates and ERA5 datasets showed good CC on a basin scale for monthly precipitation, with a slight underestimation of the observed precipitation showed by the PBIAS. The NSE scored 0.41 for PERSIANN-CCS-CDR and 0.72 for ERA5. The results for SM2RAIN-ASCAT show no match with the observed precipitation data. At the basin scale, the SPI3 correlation coefficients between the PERSIANN-CCS-CDR monthly estimates and observed gauge rainfall data were greater than 0.67, and the RMSE was closer to 0, outperforming ERA5 in the SPI3 evaluation.

Under climate change, it is possible that these effects will increase in frequency and severity. Currently, there is only a broad understanding of the types and mechanisms of these impacts. This work studied Medicane Ianos (September 2020) and its effects on the Ionian Islands, in Greece, by developing a database of distinct impact elements based on field surveys and public records. Through this archive, the study explored the range of Ianos' impacts to develop a systematic categorization. Results showed different types of effects induced on the natural and the built environment that can be grouped into 3 categories and 39 sub-categories in inland and coastal areas, indicating an extensive diversity of impacts, ranging from flooding and geomorphic effects to damages in various facilities, vehicles and infrastructure. The systematic description of the typology of Medicanes' effects presented in this study is a contribution to a better understanding of their consequences as means to improve our ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from them, a necessary stepping stone in improving the overall preparedness of both the general public and relevant authorities.

Compact cities, conceived to create more robust, effective, and sustainable environments, are under pressure to increase their resilience by co-producing adaptive strategies mainly focused on the urban public space. However, public space design tends to face environmental challenges without sufficiently exploring their intersection with social issues (citizens living conditions and vulnerability) and political structures (governance). This contribution delves into how urban public space interventions are (not) moving towards achieving urban resilience in an integrated way instead of sectoral. A triple-loop approach has been developed and tested in ten urban public spaces in European compact cities in the last 25 years. The results report how most projects reinforce the social dimension by promoting citizen well-being through new quality standards in public spaces, excluding some citizenry's vulnerable segments (immigrants, women, and disabled). The political dimension reinforces hard adaptation measures to manage water resources, although increasing attention is put on nature-based solutions, and most projects ensure participation processes. Finally, the environmental dimension is the most transversal by increasing land conversion, ensuring flooding mitigation, and enhancing adaptive capacity.

There has been a dearth of research on community resilience to urban floods, especially among transient communities, and therefore there is a need to conduct further empirical studies to improve our understanding, and to identify appropriate interventions. Thus, this work combines two existing resilience assessment frameworks to address these issues in three different types of transient community, namely an urban village, commercial housing, and apartments, all located in Wuhan, China. An analytic hierarchy process-back propagation neural network (AHP-BP) model was developed to estimate the community resilience within these three transient communities. The effects of changes in the prioritization of key resilience indicators under different environmental, economic, and social factors was analyzed across the three communities. The results demonstrate that the ranking of the indicators reflects the connection between disaster resilience and the evaluation units of diverse transient communities. These aspects show the differences in the disaster resilience of different types of transient communities. The proposed method can help decision makers in identifying the areas that are lagging behind, and those that need to be prioritized when allocating limited and/or stretched resources.

J	Chadwick, AJ; Lamb, MP; Ganti, V				Chadwick, Austin J.; Lamb, Michael P.; Ganti, Vamsi			Accelerated river avulsion frequency on lowland deltas due to sea-level rise	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						sea-level rise; river deltas; river avulsion	CHANNEL NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE; STRATIGRAPHY; PROGRADATION; AUTORETREAT; CONUNDRUM; DISCHARGE; SYSTEMS; STATE	Sea-level rise, subsidence, and reduced fluvial sediment supply are causing river deltas to drown worldwide, affecting ecosystems and billions of people. Abrupt changes in river course, called avulsions, naturally nourish sinking land with sediment; however, they also create catastrophic flood hazards. Existing observations and models conflict on whether the occurrence of avulsions will change due to relative sea-level rise, hampering the ability to forecast delta response to global climate change. Here, we combined theory, numerical modeling, and field observations to develop a mechanistic framework to predict avulsion frequency on deltas with multiple self-formed lobes that scale with backwater hydrodynamics. Results show that avulsion frequency is controlled by the competition between relative sea-level rise and sediment supply that drives lobe progradation. We find that most large deltas are experiencing sufficiently low progradation rates such that relative sea-level rise enhances aggradation rates-accelerating avulsion frequency and associated hazards compared to preindustrial conditions. Some deltas may face even greater risk; if relative sea-level rise significantly outpaces sediment supply, then avulsion frequency is maximized, delta plains drown, and avulsion locations shift inland, posing new hazards to upstream communities. Results indicate that managed deltas can support more frequent engineered avulsions to recover sinking land; however, there is a threshold beyond which coastal land will be lost, and mitigation efforts should shift upstream.

These responses are, in part, modulated by political relationships under cultural norms that dominate the institutional and collective decisions of public and private actors. The legacy of these decisions, which are often associated with investment in hard and soft infrastructure, has lasting consequences that influence current and future vulnerabilities. Making those decisions visible, and tractable is, therefore, an urgent research and political challenge in vulnerability assessments. In this work, we present a modeling framework to explore scenarios of institutional decision-making and socio-political processes and the resultant effects on spatial patterns of vulnerability. The approach entails using multi-criteria decision analysis, agent-based models, and geographic information simulation. The approach allows for the exploration of uncertainties, spatial patterns, thresholds, and the sensitivities of vulnerability outcomes to different policy scenarios. Here, we present the operationalization of the framework through an intentionally simplified model example of the governance of water in Mexico City. We discuss results from this example as part of a larger effort to empirically implement the framework to explore sociohydrological risk patterns and trade-offs of vulnerability in real urban landscapes.

This ignores other risk components, exposure and vulnerability, of which a major contributor is urbanization. We develop simplified analyses that can be applied to other PICs. By dividing climate risks into hazard and exposure components we determine how urbanization contributed to present-day risks and then predict how growing climate change hazards may increase future risk, using the Republic of Palau as a case study. Results show that urbanization was responsible for 94% of the buildings exposed to coastal flooding today. Projected sea level rise, 30.2 cm by 2050, only increased exposure of today's buildings by 0.5%. In both present and future scenarios exposure resultant from urbanization was more significant than sea level rise. Our water scarcity index showed urbanization caused 3 of the 7 recorded water shortages from 1980-2018. From 2041-2079, analysis of projected rainfall showed mean reductions between 1.6-16.6% and increased variance between 0.3-3.4%. This led to three times as many water shortages under present population levels. In historical and future scenarios exposure from increased population was just as significant in causing water shortages as rainfall variation. These findings suggest that urban management is an important tool to lower exposure to coastal flooding and water shortage and we recommend that decision makers prioritize urbanization within climate risk policy in Pacific Island Countries.

Geotechnics, energy and climate change: the 56th Rankine Lecture	GEOTECHNIQUE			English	Article						footings/foundations; landslides; piles & piling	DISPLACEMENT-PILE BEHAVIOR; LEG PLATFORM FOUNDATIONS; FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; SHAFT CAPACITY; LOADING EXPERIMENTS; IN-SITU; SOIL; DRIVEN; SAND; PERFORMANCE	Geotechnical engineering has matured sufficiently to contribute to resolving some of society's grand challenges. The 56th Rankine Lecture considered one of the most pressing global problems: maintaining vital energy supplies while also recognising, mitigating and reducing the climate consequences of fossil fuel consumption. This written version reports geotechnical research relating to these wide-ranging issues, considering paired topics within its three main parts and illustrating these with specific practical examples. Part 1 focuses on supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, considering advances in understanding and designing the driven piles that support most continental shelf platforms, before moving to the large underwater landslides that can affect deeper water developments. Part 2 describes investigations into the geotechnical impact of climate change in a permafrost region and a peatland study that contributes to alleviating flood risks exacerbated by climate change. Part 3 outlines research that is improving the economics of renewable offshore wind energy for multi-pile and monopile supported turbines. Integrating geology and rigorous analysis with advanced laboratory and field experiments is shown to be essential to resolving the complex geotechnical problems considered, as is careful full-scale checking and monitoring. Close cooperation with co-workers from industry and academia was central to the studies described and the contributions of many collaborators are emphasised. The concluding section identifies examples of significant questions from each of the six topic areas that remain to be resolved fully.

Constraints to the capacity of smallholder farming households to adapt to climate change in South and Southeast Asia	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Bangladesh; Cambodia; community; focus group discussions; India; Lao PDR; rural livelihood analysis; self-assessment; smallholder farmers	POLICY DEVELOPMENT; ANDHRA-PRADESH; VULNERABILITY; LEVEL; AGRICULTURE; RESILIENCE; FARMERS; IMPACTS	Rural households in developing countries face a range of pressures to secure their livelihoods. Households feel the effects of changing rainfall patterns, droughts, cyclones, floods and increased temperatures, and draw on a wide range of resources to adapt but some households are better equipped than others. We explore the extent to which smallholder rural households might be able to adapt to the processes of increased climate variability or climate change through assessing their adaptive capacity using elements of the rural livelihoods framework. We involved almost 600 participants in discussions and interviews in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR to explore the factors that condition their ability to adapt. We identified 36 key indicators of adaptive capacity, half were specifically related to climate change or climate variability, with others recognized as important in terms of overall livelihoods. "Experience", "health" and "labour" (Human capital), "access to market" and "farmer networks/groups" (Social capital) were considered strongly enabling of adaptation, whereas "lack of training" (Human capital) and "soil quality/condition" (Natural capital) constrained adaptation. It takes time for households to recover from climatic events, but, households with better access to diverse resources, and a more balanced livelihood portfolio were better able to cope. Mechanisms to support adaptation involved supporting farmer groups, novel information networks, better access to markets and value chains, land ownership, improved financial and economic management, and credit options.

Agricultural producers are likely to be adversely affected by changes in higher mean temperatures, more frequent extreme climatic events, and an increase in inter-annual weather variability, with implications for established management practices. While probabilities of future change in key climatic variables become more refined, significant uncertainties remain, complicating efforts at adaptation action on the ground. Adaptation pathways planning allows stakeholders to consider a range of possible futures, identify and evaluate adaptation options, and sequence them over time. The aim is to have a robust plan that is flexible enough to deliver desired outcomes regardless of how the future unfolds. We developed and applied a pathways approach to support regional adaptation planning in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, a premier food- and wine-producing region, where changing land use, competition for freshwater, and climate change, are presenting challenges to agricultural producers and rural communities. Working with a range of stakeholders from local government, community and the region's diverse agricultural sectors, comparative case study analysis in two catchments is used to identify values relating to productive landscapes, likely impacts of climate change and potential adaptation options at the local level. Actions for key areas of decision making were evaluated and sequenced over time, providing the basis for a regional adaptation pathway. The results highlight the complex interaction between climatic and non-climatic drivers of change at the local and regional scale, and the need to closely consider trade-offs and synergies in any adaptations. With adaptation rapidly emerging as a priority for policy-making and practice, the results can help inform and empower stakeholders to implement actions towards climate adapted futures, and demonstrate the utility of pathways approaches for local- and regional planning.

We used the Mann-Kendall's test to detect trends and the Sen's slope estimator to calculate trend magnitudes. The findings show that more than 70% out of 513 test cases have shown increasing signals, and 32% of the tests were globally field significant at 0.05 level. Increasing change in low-flow magnitudes and decreasing change in low-flow frequency that exceeded 80 percentile (Qmin80p) were more prevalent than the others. Global field significant increasing changes were observed for 40% out of 228 test cases for low-flow amounts, while Qmin80p has shown decreasing trend at 46 out of 57 stations, and 26 of these were statistically significant. The general tendency is towards upward change, but there were some stations that showed field significant decreasing trends for high-flow indicators. General trend signals (upward or downward) and stations with significant changes did not show any spatial pattern. There were even adjacent gauging stations within the same river basin or adjacent river basins that showed statistically significant opposite trends for some test cases. The complex spatial pattern of trend signals is partly attributable to the very complex topographic, climatic, and land cover variations in the country that are well documented in previous studies. Also, the observed trends are difficult to fully explain in terms of climate change or land cover conversion. Generally, the results of this study contradict with previous studies that reported no significant trends in streamflow variables over Ethiopia. The study has important implications for climate change adaptation planning, water-related disaster risk management, and water sector development activities in the country.

The Ria de Aveiro lagoon, located on the northwest coast of Portugal, is not an exception to these threats, especially considering the low topography of its margins which has led to several flood events in the past. The growing concerns with these regions stem from the mean sea level (MSL) rise induced by climate changes as well as the amplification of the impacts of storm surge events, which are predicted to increase in the future due to higher mean sea levels. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the influence of MSL rise on the inundation of Ria de Aveiro habitats and to assess the changes in inundation patterns resulting from frequent storm surges (2-year return period) from the present to the future, assessing their ecological and socioeconomic impacts. For this, a numerical model (Delft3D), previously calibrated and validated, was used to simulate the lagoon hydrodynamics under different scenarios combining MSL rise and frequent storm surge events. The numerical results demonstrated that MSL rise can change the vertical zonation and threaten the local habitats. Many areas of the lagoon may change from supratidal/intertidal to intertidal/subtidal, with relevant consequences for local species. The increase in MSL expected for the end of the century could make the lagoon more vulnerable to the effect of frequent storm surges, harming mostly agricultural areas, causing great losses for this sector and for many communities who depend on it. These extreme events can also affect artificialized areas and, in some cases, endanger lives.

J	Liang, C; Zhang, RC; Zeng, J; Shen, ZJ				Liang, Chen; Zhang, Ruo-Chen; Zeng, Jian; Shen, Zhong-Jian			A land-use decision approach integrating thermal regulation, stormwater management, and economic benefits based on urbanization stage identification	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Urban heat island; Urban storm flood; Multi-objective optimization; Urbanization identification; Land-use decision	URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; RISK-ASSESSMENT; USE SCENARIOS; PATTERN; SIMULATION; RUNOFF	Driven by global climate change and urbanization, urban heat island (UHI) and urban storm flood (USF) have become the most frequent and influential hazards in recent decades. Land-use optimization can effectively cope with these hazards. However, the trade-offs between multi-hazard mitigation and economic development impose many limitations in practice. Furthermore, current region-based optimization methods no longer meet the precise management demand, and both subdivision and spatial heterogeneity identification have the potential for wider applicability. Hence, a systematic integration of climate adaptation and urban construction through land-use planning is urgently required. This paper proposes a new land-use decision approach for improving climate adaptability of urbanization. This approach involves multi-objective optimization, spatial subdivision, and urbanization stage identification, which enable the simultaneous achievement of environmental and economic benefits. Taking Xiamen as case study, the results showed that excessive pursuit of land economic output (LEO) limits the chance of mitigating UHI and USF. Improving the LEO per unit area of construction land could disrupt the link between land exploitation and the increasing side effects of climate hazards. Future urbanization hotspots in Xiamen will likely emerge at the urban fringe in Tong'an District and Xiang'an District. Within each developing unit, the upper limit of construction land was 81.06 hm(2) and the green space was recommended to be 7.29-21.94 hm(2). Construction land and bare land contributed most to UHI and USF, while forest and grassland were highly efficient in heat and runoff mitigation. The developed approach proved to be effective and practica-ble, especially for reducing the impacts of extreme UHI and USF. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main purpose of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation indices over Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, between the near (2021-2050) and intermediate (2051-2080) future periods with respect to the baseline period (1980-2009). The historical extreme indices were calculated through observed daily rainfall data at 11 selected meteorological stations across the study area. The future extreme indices were projected based on a stochastic weather generator, the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), which incorporates climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) ensemble. Eight extreme precipitation indices, such as the consecutive dry days (CDDs), consecutive wet days (CWDs), number of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm), number of extremely heavy precipitation days (R25mm), maximum 1 d precipitation amount (RX1day), maximum 5 d precipitation amount (RX5day), very wet days (R95p), and simple daily intensity index (SDII) were selected to evaluate the multi-model ensemble mean changes of extreme indices in terms of intensity, duration, and frequency. The statistical significance, stability, and averaged magnitude of trends in these changes, thereby, were computed by the Mann-Kendall statistical techniques and Sen's estimator, and applied to each extreme index. The results indicated a general increasing trend in most extreme indices for the future periods. In comparison with the near future period (2021-2050), the extreme intensity and frequency indices in the intermediate future period (2051-2080) present more statistically significant trends and higher growing rates. Furthermore, an increase in most extreme indices mainly occurs in some parts of the central and southern regions, while a decrease in those indices is often projected in the north of the study area.

Previous works seldomly focused on bivariate flood quantiles under climate change at a national scale, and fewer flooding projections quantified the estimation uncertainty sourced from sample size limitation. This study systematically investigates the changes in bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume with incorporation of sampling uncertainty for 151 catchments over China, with climate trajectories projected by a set of multi-model ensemble under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. After correcting the systematical biases of eight CMIP5 GCM outputs, four state-of-the-art hydrological models are driven and validated for each catchment, and the best-simulation model is selected to project future streamflow scenarios. The copula function is employed to construct the joint distribution of flood peak and volume, and then the most likely realizations of bivariate quantiles are derived under different Joint Return Periods (JRPs), with the uncertainty envelope quantified with the area of 90% confidence ellipse by a copula-based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty (C-PBU) approach. Our results project an overall ascending trend of temperature and precipitation over China, and the bivariate flood quantiles and corresponding estimation uncertainty of most catchments in the future period (2056-2100) are much larger than the baseline (1961-2005), despite accompanied by substantial climate model uncertainty and spatial variability in magnitude. Many basins would be subjected to a dramatic increase of flood magnitude by over 50%, while only few basins are projected to experience a decreasing flood risk, suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to a warming climate over China.

We investigated alternate wetting and drying (AWD) as part of an integrated management approach to enhance mitigation, together with combinations of mineral nitrogen (N), reduced tillage, a suitable combination of plant residues and well decomposed manure. To quantify GHG emissions, and the potential for mitigation without yield decline, a process-based model, DayCent was used to simulate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Bangladesh. The four test sites selected were amended with mineral N fertilizer or an organic amendment (rice straw). A good agreement (p < 0.05) was observed between model simulated and measured daily CH4 flux at most of these test sites with no significant bias. The seasonal CH4 emission from a site receiving mineral N fertilizer at a rate of 110 kg N ha(-1) was predicted by the model to be 210 and 150 kg ha(-1) for the water management scenarios of continuous flood (CF) and AWD, respectively. These values compare well with estimates of CH4 emissions using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tier 1 methods for the different water regimes. Our model results suggest emission factors for N2O of 0.4% and 0.6% of applied fertilizer under CF and AWD water regimes, respectively. Based on modelling studies, AWD was found to be an important strategy not only with respect to reducing GHG emissions, but also in terms of cost effectiveness. We also found that integrated management is a promising option for farmers and policy makers interested in either yield increase, GHG mitigation or both. Yield scaled emissions intensity under AWD was found to be about 24% lower than under CF, followed by integrated management.

We evaluate the extent to which farmers in Malawi suffer crop production losses due to extreme weather, and whether sustainable land management (SLM) practices help shield crop production losses from extreme events. We use a three period panel dataset where widespread floods and droughts occurred in separate periods, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate impacts using data collected immediately following these events. Results show that crop production outcomes were severely hit by both floods and droughts, with average losses ranging between 32-48 per cent. Legume intercropping provided protection against both floods and droughts, while green belts provided protection against floods. However, we find limited evidence that SLM adoption decisions are driven by exposure to weather shocks; rather, farmers with more productive assets are more likely to adopt.

This paper takes Nanjing as an example to investigate flooding disasters and social vulnerability in development countries. It develops an analysis framework and evaluation index system of social vulnerability from three dimensions of exposure, sensitivity and adaptability. Ten typical affordable housing communities were selected and individual-level survey data were collected to explore the influencing factors of social vulnerability. The results show that social vulnerability is simultaneously affected by exposure, sensitivity and adaptability. Communities with new construction ages and good built environments usually have lower levels of risk exposure. Those with residents having higher levels of education and social capital have lower sensitivity. The government's emergency operations and residents' response capabilities can both significantly improve the adaptability of communities to floods.

Through narratives elicited during in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, I show that respondents associate various forms of environmental change-ecological, climatic, political, and socioeconomic-with God's plan. Respondents had a sound grasp of the material workings of their lived realities and evoked religious causality to fill in the residual explanatory gaps and find meaning in events that were otherwise difficult to explain. Such narratives reveal both a culturally engrained belief system that colors people's understandings of change and uncertainty and a discursive idiom for making sense of social suffering. On an applied note, I submit that social science approaches to studying environmental change must take into account political and economic contexts relative to local cosmologies, worldviews, and religious faiths, which may not disaggregate the environment into distinct representational categories.

The prevailing view is that while poverty and environmental disasters were push factors in this migration, government settlement programmes were primarily responsible for this population shift. This article offers a fresh perspective on this historic migration by exploring its environmental causes. It shows through an analysis of a questionnaire survey and interviews with Bengali settlers in the CHT that climatic events such as floods, cyclones, and riverbank erosion contributed to the migration decisions of the majority of the respondents. Government protection and provision of land and social networks in the CHT were mediating factors that enabled Bengali migrants to settle permanently in the CHT. This insight challenges the conventional narrative that the settlement was primarily politically motivated and confirms that complex migration motivations cannot be reduced to single drivers.

Understanding the multiple dimensions of disaster and risk, especially how these are embedded in a broader social-political context, and translated into risk management strategies, have now been identified as priority areas under Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and UN Research Roadmap for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030. Drawing on a relational intersectional approach, this study explores the meanings of climate change disasters and risk reduction strategies from a racialized immigrant community's (i.e., Bangladeshi-Canadian) lived experiences in Calgary, Canada. From our relational research, we learned that extreme climate events (such as forest fires/wildfires, heat waves, flash floods, severe colds, hailstorms, etc.) are the most common stressors unevenly impacting the household economy, physical health, and mental and psychological wellbeing of the racialized immigrant community in Calgary. The community's compounded vulnerability to disaster risks is further aggravated due to their intersectional positionality and structural inequality (systematic marginalization) rooted in the lack of explicit anti-racist policy guidelines in Canada. The community members adapt diverse strategies (mostly reactive) based on their family income, severity and frequency of the exposure to risks, social support system, geographic location (residence), cultural practices, and involvement with community networks. While proposing solutions, they suggested that community-engaged tailored disaster intervention strategy could play an instrumental role in addressing social vulnerability (determinants) and enhancing adaptive capacity at the local level. Moreover, this study calls for a more holistic account of the differential vulnerability context to better understand the structural root causes and emphasizes that upscaling land-based practices and knowledge transmission, ensuring deliberate participation of visible minorities, fostering collective action and integrating local community associations into all stages of disaster management should be the priority for the state agencies to support long-term resilience.

Climate change poses a significant risk to food security. Recent floods in Pakistan could serve as an example. In the current climate change scenario, there is a dire need to develop methods that increase crop productivity and reduce the threat of food insecurity in areas with low crop production. A detailed field experiment was conducted to check the effects of intercropping and straw mulching under conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) systems on soil health indicators and cotton productivity at the experimental area of Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology (KFUEIT), Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan. The main plot treatments comprised CT and NT. The subplot treatments were sole cotton (C1), cotton + mung-bean intercropping (C2), cotton + mung-bean + straw mulching (C3) and cotton + straw mulching (C4) under CT, while sole cotton (N1), cotton + mung-bean intercropping (N2), cotton + mung-bean + straw mulching (N3) and cotton + straw mulching (N4) were the NT subplot treatments. Overall, NT increased plant height by 18.4 %, chlorophyll a and b contents by 28.2 and 21.1%, respectively, mean boll weight by 17.9%, and seed yield by 20.9% compared to CT (P < 0.05). The interaction of tillage and mulching increased plant height by 7.0% under CT and 21.8% under NT in comparison with no mulching. Similarly, straw mulching under NT increased chlorophyll a and b contents by 41.9 and 28.5%, respectively, mean boll weight by 26.9%, and cotton seed yield by 23.0% in comparison with no mulching under NT. Intercropping decreased crop yield without straw mulching but increased it under straw mulching. Further, straw mulching increased soil physicochemical properties under NT, which contributed to increasing crop productivity. We concluded that straw mulching under NT might be a promising practice for enhancing cotton yield, productivity, and soil health in low-productivity areas.

J	Yang, WY; Zhang, J; Krebs, P				Yang, Wenyu; Zhang, Jin; Krebs, Peter			Investigating flood exposure induced socioeconomic risk and mitigation strategy under climate change and urbanization at a city scale	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Flood exposure; Climate change; Urbanization; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Green infrastructure; Chaohu city	LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; VOLUME CAPTURE RATIO; PERFORMANCE; RUNOFF	Investigating future flood exposure risk and associated mitigation strategies is vital for sustainable urban development. This study coupled hydrological modeling with future climate and urbanization scenarios from Representative Concentration Pathways and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), to spatiotemporally investigate the risk of flood exposure and the effectiveness of mitigation strategy at the city scale. A highly urbanized (80% of built-up areas) and densely populated (7500 per km(2)) region in downtown Chaohu, China was selected as the study case. Results showed that the current hydrological pattern brought 4.64 x 10(6) m(3) of annual runoff and 292.00 l s(-1) of peak flow to the given area, thereby causing 41.03% of the population to be exposed to flooding threats and putting 51.17% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at risk. Scenario analysis demonstrated that population and GDP exposures to flood increased to at most 61.11 and 71.30% in high-carbon emission scenarios (SSP3-7.0/SSP5-8.5), respectively. The green infrastructure (GI) strategy captured at most 81.43% of runoff volume and 54.53% of peak flow, thereby decreasing population and GDP exposures to at least 18.38 and 33.04% in low-carbon emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6/SSP2-4.5), respectively. According to the uncertainty analysis, population and GDP exposures showed wide uncertainty ranges of 18.38-61.11 and 33.04-71.30% in future scenarios, and the GI strategy effectively decreased the flood exposure uncertainty ranges to 15.56-42.70 and 17.35-43.60%, respectively. In addition, the spatial analysis indicated that the population- and GDP-intensive regions were more vulnerable to flood exposure than other regions, while GI strategy in these regions showed limited effectiveness in mitigation of exposure risk. The data of this study could assist sustainable urban development in response to climate change and urbanization.

The purpose of this study was to develop a tool for dynamic risk evaluation that can be used to fulfil several of the goals in the European Flood Risk Management Directive. Flood risk analysis was performed as a spatial GIS analysis with the FME software. The primary data source for the analysis was a 1D/2D model calculation, wherein 1D models described the pipeline network and the watercourses and a 2D model described surface runoff. An ArcGIS online platform was developed to visualize the results in a format understandable for decision makers. The method and tool were tested for the Norwegian capital of Oslo. The tool developed in the study enabled the efficient analysis of consequences for various precipitation scenarios. Results could be used to identify the areas most vulnerable to flooding and prioritize areas in which measures need to be implemented. The study showed that for urban areas in steep terrain, it is essential to include water velocity and depth-integrated velocity in risk analysis in addition to water depths and pipe network capacity.

J	Contento, A; Xu, H; Gardoni, P				Contento, Alessandro; Xu, Hao; Gardoni, Paolo			Probabilistic formulation for storm surge predictions	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hurricanes; predictions; probabilistic models; simulation models; floods	RESPONSE FUNCTION-APPROACH; MODEL; ATTRIBUTES; FORECAST	The impact of several devastating hurricanes revealed the vulnerability of large areas of the U.S.A. to this catastrophic natural hazard. Therefore, especially considering the uncertainties in future climate and demographic conditions, exposure and vulnerability, there is a strong need to include storm surge predictions in hurricane risk analyses. In general, the models used for storm surge are unsuited for probabilistic studies that require a large number of simulations. This article presents a probabilistic formulation for storm surge predictions that are developed using the combination of a logistic model and a non-stationary random field. The proposed fully probabilistic formulation (i) provides the probability that a location is being flooded, (ii) considers the spatial correlation among the storm surge at different locations and (iii) predicts storm surge at locations that are different from those of the observations used for the model calibration and are not restricted to be alongshore. Such formulation can include the effects of climate change by calibrating the models with high-fidelity simulations that account for the effect of climate change performed using a realistic set of hurricanes. The proposed formulation is used to predict the storm surge in a specific geographic region near the Pamlico River in North Carolina.

The regularity of the precipitation regime, in particular, is a basic factor to sustain equilibrium conditions. An incomplete or biased understanding of precipitation seasonality, in terms of temporal and spatial properties, could severely limit our ability to respond to climate risk, especially in areas with limited water resources or fragile ecosystems. Here, we analyze precipitation data from the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) at 0.05(0) resolution to study the spatial features of the precipitation seasonality across different climate zones in Central-Southern Europe during the period 1981-2018. A cluster analysis of the average annual precipitation cycle shows that seasonality under the current climate can be synthesized in the form of a progressive deformation process of the annual cycle, which starts from the northernmost areas with maximum values in summer and ends in the south, where maximum values are recorded in winter. Our analysis is useful to detect local season-dependent changes, enhancing our understanding of the geography of climate change. As an example of application to this issue, we discuss the seasonality analysis in a simulated scenario based on IPCC projections.

J	Castaneda-Gonzalez, M; Poulin, A; Romero-Lopez, R; Turcotte, R				Castaneda-Gonzalez, Mariana; Poulin, Annie; Romero-Lopez, Rabindranarth; Turcotte, Richard			Hydrological models weighting for hydrological projections: The impacts on future peak flows	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Hydrological models weighting; Parameters robustness; Peak flow projections; Ensemble modelling	SPLIT-SAMPLE TEST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PART 2; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; ENSEMBLE; RUNOFF; TRANSFERABILITY; SIMULATIONS; COMBINATION	Reliable hydrological projections are of great importance for climate change impact studies, especially knowing that these analyses can allow identifying regional adaptation and mitigation strategies for the future. However, the literature has highlighted that hydrological models used under climate conditions that are contrasting to those used during their calibrations can lower their performance and reliability, an issue that lowers the confidence in hydrological projections and adds uncertainty to their analyses. More studies are needed to explore this issue and evaluate potential strategies that might improve hydrological models' reliability in climate change impact studies. Thus, the present study evaluates the robustness of hydrological models under contrasting climatic conditions and investigates the use of weighting techniques to improve their combined performance and reliability. The robustness of five lumped hydrological models is analysed using a Differential Split-Sample Testing (DSST) that evaluates their performance under cold, warm, humid and dry historical contrasting conditions over 77 basins covering different hydroclimatic conditions (two domains, one located in Quebec, Canada, and one in Mexico). Additionally, four basins were selected from the study area to evaluate the robustness of a more complex semi-distributed and more physically-based hydrological model and compare its simulations against the simpler lumped hydrological models. Based on the resulting performance of each hydrological model, five different weighting methods were applied to evaluate the potential improvements in the multi-model ensemble performance and quantify their effects on hydrological projections, particularly on future peak flows. For each basin, these streamflow projections were produced using two regional climate simulations (one per studied domain) issued from the Canadian Regional Climate Model version 5 (CRCM5) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 for the 1976-2005, 2041-2070 and 2070-2099 periods. The results showed that weighting hydrological models, even with the most simplistic methods, showed better performances over historical contrasting conditions than the best-performing lumped hydrological model. Between the different weighting methods, the Granger-Ramanathan type A showed the overall best performance among the different basins and climate conditions, particularly in peak streamflows. Over the CRCM5-driven peak flow projections, the weighting methods Granger-Ramanathan types A and B produced the largest impacts on the projected floods magnitudes and climate change signals. On the other hand, the additional tests using the semidistributed and more physically-based hydrological model revealed that this model showed more robust simulations than the weighted lumped hydrological models on low flows over the four selected basins. Additionally, more robust high-flow simulations were observed over a small snow-dominated basin, suggesting a potential added value in adding more complex hydrological models to simulate conditions under a changed climate.

It is categorised into two major regions, i.e., the Garhwal and the Kumaon, and geographically, the Bhabar and the Terai. Floods, cloudbursts, glacier lake outbursts, and landslides are the major natural hazards that cause the highest number of mortalities and property damage in this state. After becoming a full 27th state of India in 2000, the developmental activities have increased many folds, which has added to such calamities. This study briefly summarises the major incidents of flood damage, describes the fragile geology of this Himalayan state, and identifies the natural as well as the anthropogenic causes of the flood as a disaster. It also highlights the issue of climate change in the state and its adverse impact in the form of extreme precipitation. Besides these, it reviews the challenges involved in flood management and highlights the effective flood risk management plan that may be adopted to alleviate its adverse impacts.

J	Chitra, V				Chitra, V			Remembering the river: Flood, memory and infrastructural ecologies of stormwater drainage in Mumbai	URBAN STUDIES			English	Article						climate change; disaster preparedness; floods; infrastructure; urban ecology	POLITICS; SUBJECTIVITY; URBANIZATION; CITIES; CITY	Mumbai's storm water drainage system is rapidly transforming as incidences of heavy rainfall rise. Its transformation is built on the idea of conserving the city's 'rivers' that were lost to urban development. While this move to recuperate a heritage of rivers seems like a step in the right direction, Mumbai's drainage system was largely cobbled together over time through piecemeal interventions in an estuarine landscape. This article shows how by engineering a history of rivers, the city's planning authorities set in motion an agenda to train the expansive estuarine and improvisational systems into governable riverine channels contained within the state's developmental visions. It focuses on one major channel, the Mithi, to show how the rationality of disaster preparedness, the emergent calculus of carrying capacities, as well as infrastructure are braided into constructed ecological histories to inscribe a new hydrological order on the city. For Mumbai's engineers, these changes introduce new scalar logics and alter the nature of the drainage assemblage. Mithi's transformation is emblematic of how articulations of nature, technology and urban development are emerging from the anxieties of climate change.

It is not, however, clear how much and in what manner the low-frequency variability has changed in recent decades as global warming has intensified. Here, we investigate the contribution of anthropogenic influences to the time evolution of extreme precipitation anomalies in different seasons using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and CMIP5 model simulations and observations over Europe. Our results show a latitudinal dependence of changes in extreme precipitation anomalies for all seasons due to anthropogenic impacts. While the contribution of anthropogenic influences to extreme precipitation anomalies at low latitudes (<50 degrees) is less than 8% in all seasons, it goes up to 26% and 41% at mid (50 degrees-60 degrees) and high (>60 degrees) latitudes. Without the offsetting effect of anthropogenic aerosols, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases alone should have produced larger anomalies than observed. For all seasons, the more extreme the precipitation, the larger the anthropogenic influences.

Therefore, there is a growing interest in research activities focused on alteration of rainfall regime, as it conditions the planning of countermeasures against flood and landslide hazards. The available literature about precipitation tendencies over Italian peninsula offers a limited number of studies about recent changes of extreme events and precipitation intensity. This work aims at adding a contribution to fill this research gap, investigating the changes in rainfall regime observed over the 2002-2021 period in the Campania region (southern Italy). To pursue this aim, a dataset including daily precipitation records collected at 107 stations was analysed both through 11 indices developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices and through the Standardized Precipitation Index in order to detect signals of changes in extreme events and to assess tendencies towards drier or wetter conditions. The Theil-Sen method and the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test were employed to evaluate the trends and their statistical significance. The main results emerging from this work are (i) an increasing tendency in precipitation intensity and in the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall events in autumn, mainly in the northern part of the region and in the mountainous areas, (ii) an upward trend of the duration of the longest wet spell in the coastal areas and (iii) an increasing trend of dry spells in spring and in summer in the Gulf of Salerno. Recent changes in Campania (southern Italy) rainfall regime were analyzed through 11 extreme precipitation indices. The main results are:an increasing trend in precipitation intensity and in the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall events in autumn season in the northern sector of region and in the mountainous areas,a positive tendency of the duration of the longest wet spell on the coastal areas, andan increasing trend of dry spells in spring and in summer in the Gulf of Salerno.image	[Capozzi, Vincenzo; Rocco, Armando; Annella, Clizia; Cretella, Viviana; Fusco, Giannetta; Budillon, Giorgio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Ctr Direzionale Napoli, Dept Sci & Technol, Naples, Italy; [Capozzi, Vincenzo] Univ Naples Parthenope, Ctr Direzionale Napoli, Dept Sci & Technol, I-80143 Naples, Italy	Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples	Capozzi, V (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Ctr Direzionale Napoli, Dept Sci & Technol, I-80143 Naples, Italy.	vincenzo.capozzi@uniparthenope.it		Rocco, Armando/0009-0006-4541-1614; Capozzi, Vincenzo/0000-0002-8279-9922	Civil Protection of the Campania region; Campania Region	Civil Protection of the Campania region; Campania Region(Regione Campania)	The authors of this work are very grateful to the Civil Protection of the Campania region (Multirisk Functional Centre), to the Agrometeorological Service of the Campania Region and to the Apulia Region Civil Protection for providing the rainfall data recorded by gauges of their networks.		84	0	0	2	2	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1350-4827	1469-8080		METEOROL APPL	Meteorol.

The Complex Epidemiological Relationship between Flooding Events and Human Outbreaks of Mosquito-Borne Diseases: A Scoping Review	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Review							MURRAY VALLEY ENCEPHALITIS; ST-LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EL-NINO; DENGUE-FEVER; METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; NATURAL DISASTERS; MALARIA EPIDEMIC; RAPID ASSESSMENT	BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of flooding events. Although rainfall is highly correlated with mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in humans, less research focuses on understanding the impact of flooding events on disease incidence. This lack of research presents a significant gap in climate change-driven disease forecasting. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a scoping review to assess the strength of evidence regarding the potential relationship between flooding and MBD and to determine knowledge gaps. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through 31 December 2020 and supplemented with review of citations in relevant publications. Studies on rainfall were included only if the operationalization allowed for distinction of unusually heavy rainfall events. Data were abstracted by disease (dengue, malaria, or other) and stratified by post-event timing of disease assessment. Studies that conducted statistical testing were summarized in detail. RESULTS: From 3,008 initial results, we included 131 relevant studies (dengue n = 45, malaria n = 61, other MBD n = 49). Dengue studies indicated short-term (<1 month) decreases and subsequent (1-4 month) increases in incidence. Malaria studies indicated post-event incidence increases, but the results were mixed, and the temporal pattern was less clear. Statistical evidence was limited for other MBD, though findings suggest that human outbreaks of Murray Valley encephalitis, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis may follow flooding. DISCUSSION: Flooding is generally associated with increased incidence of MBD, potentially following a brief decrease in incidence for some diseases. Methodological inconsistencies significantly limit direct comparison and generalizability of study results. Regions with established MBD and weather surveillance should be leveraged to conduct multisite research to a) standardize the quantification of relevant flooding, b) study nonlinear relationships between rainfall and disease, c) report outcomes at multiple lag periods, and d) investigate interacting factors that modify the likelihood and severity of outbreaks across different settings.

Annette			A tiered stochastic framework for assessing crop yield loss risks due to water scarcity under different uncertainty levels	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Droughts: aquifer depletion; Deficit irrigation; Distribution regression; Kernel density estimation; Crop yield risks; Climate change; Probabilistic risk assessment	FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEFICIT IRRIGATION; PROBABILISTIC EVALUATION; BANDWIDTH SELECTION; CENTILE CURVES; COTTON MODEL; HIGH-PLAINS; GROUNDWATER; MANAGEMENT	Agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions is threatened by increased droughts (climate change) and groundwater depletion. Farmers increasingly must weigh the short-term economic gains from irrigation against the long-term aquifer longevity needs. Risk-based deficit irrigation is proposed to tackle this trade-off. A tiered risk assessment approach is developed to evaluate crop yield loss risks as a function of crop water supply (CWS) from irrigation and precipitation. Risk is defined as the probability of obtaining a crop yield below a pre-specified threshold. Logistic regression is used to quantify risks as a function of CWS, if the producer can specify a fixed minimum yield threshold. Distribution regression is used to develop the cumulative distribution function of the crop yield assuming heterogeneous model parameter and is useful when the producer can estimate CWS but cannot specify a minimum yield threshold. Finally, the CWS is also modeled as a stochastic variable and the crop yield risk conditioned on CWS risk is computed using the Kolmogorov axiom. The methodology is illustrated using a cotton production case-study in the Southern High Plains of Texas. Logistic regression indicated that crop yield risk was a nonlinear function of CWS. CWS corresponding to similar to 80 % of the total crop water demand was enough to reach negligible crop yield risks. Heterogeneous cotton yield distribution was modeled using Box-Cox-Cole-Green function with location and scale parameters being nonlinear and linear functions of CWS respectively and a stationary shape parameter. Irrigation at lower CWS reduced the risks substantially but the risk reductions were marginal at higher CWS. The conditional distribution of crop yield risk indicated that CWS corresponding to similar to 80 %-85 % of crop water demand was enough to bring down risks.

To generate larger event sets for application in catastrophe modelling, two statistical approaches are highlighted and applied to widespread GB-generated flooding events using a grid-based hydrological model and UKCP18 regional projections. An Empirical Copula method was applied on a national scale, generating over 600,000 events across two time-slices (1980-2010 and 2050-2080). This was compared to model-generated events and showed good matching across time-slices and ensemble members, although lacked some ability to describe the least-rare events. The Empirical Copula was also compared to an implementation of a conditional exceedance model. This model was much more computationally intensive so was restricted to Northwest England but offered the ability to be tuned more finely through choices of marginal distributions. Analysing over 11,000 events, it also matched well with the Empirical Copula and model-generated events but under-represented the smallest events. Both approaches require a broad dataset to draw from but showed reasonable efficacy. For simple statistics, the Empirical Copula shows the potential to be a powerful tool in exploring spatial structure over large regions or at a fine spatial resolution.

Although adaptive capacities enable flexibility and adjustment, more empirical research is needed to better grasp the role of adaptive capacities to accommodate expected climate change effects. This paper presents an analytical framework based on the Adaptive Capacity Wheel (ACW) and Triple-loop Learning. The framework is applied to evaluate the adaptive capacities that were missing, employed, and developed throughout the 'Alblasserwaard-Vijfheerenlanden' (The Netherlands) and the 'Wesermarsch' (Germany) pilot projects. Evaluations were performed using questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups. From the 22 capacities of ACW, three capacities were identified important for diversifying the current FRMS; the capacity to develop a greater variety of solutions, continuous access to information about diversified FRMS, and collaborative leadership. Hardly any capacities related to 'learning' and 'governance' were mentioned by the stakeholders. From a further reflection on the data, we inferred that the pilot projects performed single-loop learning (incremental learning: 'are we doing what we do right?'), rather than double-loop learning (reframing: 'are we doing the right things?'). As the development of the framework is part of ongoing research, some directions for improvement are highlighted.

Inundation area and depth for 100-year flooding are evaluated for the flood volume of capacity greater than 2000 m3/s for both past (1951-2010) and future (2051-2100) climates. This study also evaluates the affected population exposure in the region for both past and future climate scenarios.New hydrological insights for the region: The IMCR inundation simulation findings indicate that compared to the historical climate, the inundation area increases by an average of 1.0-1.4 times, and the critical area (depth >3 m) increases by an average of 1.1-1.3 times. On the other hand, the exposed population in the future, with respect to the SSP5 scenario "Taking the Highway," is expected to decrease on average by 0.7-0.9 times in comparison to the past climate for depth > 0 m. However, keeping the population constant as in the past, the exposed population is likely to increase on average by 1.3-1.4 times in comparison to the past climate for depth > 0 m.

Encapsulated plant growth regulators and associative microorganisms: Nature-based solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change on plants	PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						Biostimulants; Seed priming; Nanobiotechnology; Plant growth -promoting rhizobacteria; Plant growth regulators; Microencapsulation	PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIA PGPR; CHITOSAN NANOPARTICLES; COMPLEX COACERVATION; ROOT COLONIZATION; CARRIER SYSTEMS; ACID; DELIVERY; STRESS; YIELD; MICROENCAPSULATION	Over the past decades, the atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average temperature have been increasing, and this trend is projected to soon become more severe. This scenario of climate change intensifies abiotic stress factors (such as drought, flooding, salinity, and ultraviolet radiation) that threaten forest and associated eco-systems as well as crop production. These factors can negatively affect plant growth and development with a consequent reduction in plant biomass accumulation and yield, in addition to increasing plant susceptibility to biotic stresses. Recently, biostimulants have become a hotspot as an effective and sustainable alternative to alleviate the negative effects of stresses on plants. However, the majority of biostimulants have poor stability under environmental conditions, which leads to premature degradation, shortening their biological activity. To solve these bottlenecks, micro-and nano-based formulations containing biostimulant molecules and/or micro-organisms are gaining attention, as they demonstrate several advantages over their conventional formulations. In this review, we focus on the encapsulation of plant growth regulators and plant associative microorganisms as a strategy to boost their application for plant protection against abiotic stresses. We also address the potential limitations and challenges faced for the implementation of this technology, as well as possibilities regarding future research.	[Campos, Estefania V.

Human actions produce a progressive fragmentation of the vegetation, affecting its quality and persistence. Adequate consideration of this effect in environmental assessment is necessary, but is often lacking; project impacts are frequently considered negligible, despite being cumulative. The aim of this review is to analyse the literature on fragmentation and loss of ecological connectivity in vegetation, to identify the main impacts and how to mitigate them. A novelty is the linking of these impacts to the human actions that generate them, which facilitates their consideration in the environmental assessment. Vegetation clearing results in fragmentation, separating patches whose persistence will depend on their size, shape or isolation. Reduced flow also causes loss of connectivity between rivers and floodplains. Fragmentation and induced connectivity favour the entry of invasive plants. These effects become more significant when threatened species or habitats are affected. Mitigation measures need to be implemented to avoid, minimise, restore and compensate for these impacts; ecological corridors can combine all these types of measures. Monitoring is essential to assess the dynamics of restored areas, and to detect changes in vegetation or the entry of invasive species. Only proper consideration of these impacts in decision-making, and appropriate mitigation, can control the negative cumulative effects that are currently occurring.

Public adaptation decisions impact the distribution of resources and risk and thus, while not always acknowledged, such decisions are inherently social and political, with implications for equity and justice. We synthesize insights from 128 empirical case studies of processes of public decision-making pertaining to infrastructural flood risk adaptation in urban areas. We focus on urban flood risk adaptation efforts because of the growing threat of flooding in urban areas globally, the technical orientation of such investments and the social equity issues associated with urban flood exposure and response. We explore the assumptions about the decision criteria and decision-support needs presented in this research. And we document the extent to which these studies incorporate sources of knowledge on the social dimensions of flood impacts, consider social and political criteria in evaluating intervention strategies and account for issues of equity and justice in the adaptation process. We conclude with a discussion on the potential obstacles in the research community for deeper engagement with the social and political dimensions of adaptation decision support, and ways to address such obstacles.

Here, we perform climate simulations using a regional climate model over the greater Alpine region at kilometer-scale resolution. By analyzing precipitation intensities with short accumulation times, we show that the model can capture the observed percentiles of extreme subhourly precipitation measured at surface rain-gauge stations. Then, by simulating the future climate, we show that the associated increases in intensity of subhourly extreme precipitation events grow with the intensity of the events but tends asymptotically toward 6.5% per degree warming. This suggests that the most extreme intensities scale with the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling rate that represents the ability of a warmer atmosphere to hold more water vapor. It should be expected that these changes will lead to increased risks of flash flooding, land-slides, and erosion over Europe in a warmer climate. Plain Language Summary The evolution of very short rain events in a warmer climate over a large part of Europe is addressed by using a regional climate model at very high resolution. We show that these events will intensify in a warmer climate and become about 6.5% more intense per degree of warming.

Previous studies have observed a variety of self-mitigation and patterns of local migrations among the communities in the city of Semarang. The suburban case, however, is frequently overlooked by local governments, which often focus more on handling city centre problems. In this study, we employed a quantitative approach using statistical descriptive analysis and Discriminant Analysis. In addition, an in-depth interview with key informants provided a complementary qualitative approach, to deepen understanding of the quantitative findings. The results suggested the factors distinguishing the residents' desire to migrate or not were: income, private vehicle possession, community cooperation in maintaining environment cleaning and security, road condition and access, proximity to educational and health facilities and electricity, and the intensity of the flood entering the house. Unlike the urban society, the willingness to move of the suburban society was not only affected by their financial capability, the availability of settlement infrastructures, and the severe level of the flood but also their emotional bonds to the place and the community.

Environmental constraints' sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition to temperature, management practices and climate change	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Review						Environmental protection; Soil organic carbon pools; Intrinsic temperature sensitivity; Apparent temperature sensitivity; Management options and carbon decomposition	MICHAELIS-MENTEN KINETICS; ELEVATED CO2; LAND-USE; AGGREGATE STABILITY; MATTER DECOMPOSITION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; TILLAGE PRACTICES; REDUCED TILLAGE; LITTER QUALITY; NITROGEN POOLS	Intrinsic temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools is the inherent response of their decomposition rate to temperature. It primarily depends on the chemical structure of SOC pool and ambient temperature. The apparent temperature sensitivity of SOC pools refers to the observable temperature sensitivity which primarily depends on environmental constraints (ECs) The Environmental constraints are key indicators that determine the apparent temperature sensitivities of different SOC pools. The ECs are the processes and or factors that slow down organic carbon (OC) decomposition rates and dampen intrinsic temperature sensitivities. These are broadly classified as physical, chemical, biological and biochemical processes those impart relative stability to SOC. The major ECs include; soil aggregation, flooding, clay associated-C and microbial secreted exo-polysachharide, etc. However, the matter of concern is that the ECs are also sensitive to temperature, management practices and climate change. Uncertainties exist with the stability and sensitivity of ECs to various management systems and climate induced anticipated changes. We reviewed in details the various types of ECs and how they are sensitive to management practices like tillage, land use changes, nutrient and water management, priming effect due to carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilization, vegetation composition and microbial manipulation.

Farmers' interest and willingness-to-pay for index-based crop insurance in the lowlands of Nepal	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Area-based yield insurance; Climate change impacts; Double-bounded contingent valuation; Extreme weather events; Stated preference	CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; FLOOD RISK; VALUATION; VULNERABILITY; AGRICULTURE; STRATEGIES; ETHIOPIA; ADOPTION; AFRICA; IMPACT	Farmers in Nepal face many risks from extreme weather events which detrimentally impact their crop production. To support farmers in risk management, prevent financial losses, and facilitate farmer participation in insurance schemes, the Nepalese government subsidises crop insurance by paying 75% of the premiums. However, the uptake of insurance schemes has been poor. This study aimed to find out why by surveying 350 farmers, and identifying factors that influenced farmers' general interest in, and willingness-to-pay for, crop insurance. Approximately 84% of farmers' were interested in purchasing area-based crop yield insurance and were, on average, willing to pay a premium of USD 42.42/ha/cropping season for paddy rice, and USD 29.52/ha/season for wheat. This amounted to more than three times the price of paddy rice premiums (USD 9.96/ha/season), and nearly three times that of wheat premiums (USD 8.59/ha/season) under the current subsidised scheme. This implies that the cause of low uptake is unlikely to be related to the price of premiums. The results further suggest that in order to increase farmers' uptake of crop insurance, the information of the threats of climate variability to future crop failures should be better communicated; and that the current subsidised insurance scheme should be revised.

Severe extreme events can evoke great fear and pose arisk for traumatization. These traumas and the sustained stress caused by the event may result in adverse psychological health effects. Children and adolescents represent avulnerable group due to the fact that they hold less coping strategies than adults and are strongly dependent on their environment.This narrative overview intends to summarise the prevalence of mental illness after an EWE and the related risk factors in order to draw meaningful conclusions about the mental health of children and adolescents in Germany. Therefore, existing literature from the WHO European region and from countries with asimilar income level (e.g. Canada, Australia, USA) was taken into account. Since floods and heavy precipitation are the most frequent EWE in Germany, the focus was placed on them.An increase in anxiety disorders, depression symptoms, posttraumatic stress and behavioural disorders can be observed in children and adolescents after an EWE. The literature provides little information on the prevalence of such mental health effects as aresult of EWEs and their effects, and which risk factors are of importance. There is thus still considerable need for research internationally and especially in Germany.

Study focus: Accurately assessing future flood risks is the premise and foundation of flood control and water resources management. At present, studies are still lacking in assessing future water -shed flood risks that consider climate change and social development in Northeast China and the relative flood risk assessment framework. This study proposed an integrated flood assessment framework containing the AHP, entropy weight, and GCM downscaling methods, which was implemented in the SSRB, a typical watershed in Northeast China, to estimate future basin flood risks under climate change and social development. New hydrological insights for the region: The flood risk in the SSRB will increase significantly in the mid-term (2051-2075) and long-term (2076-2100) future. The areas under the four scenarios with greater than high-risk levels will expand by 28.9 %, 105.6 %, 165.6 %, and 156.7 %, respectively, compared to the historical scenario. The newly added areas mainly located in the lower reaches. Precipitation changes are the primary reason for the future flood risks. The increased GDP under a higher forcing degree will also significantly increase the flood risk in the long-term future in the lower reaches. Based on these above findings, extreme precipitation forecasting and flood management in downstream areas in the basin need to be enhanced. Energy-saving and emission-reduction measures should be simultaneously implemented.

J	Han, XD; Mehrotra, R; Sharma, A; Rahman, A				Han, Xudong; Mehrotra, Rajeshwar; Sharma, Ashish; Rahman, Ataur			Incorporating nonstationarity in regional flood frequency analysis procedures to account for climate change impact	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Regional flood frequency analysis; Climate change; Nonstationarity; Design flood	INTENSE PRECIPITATION; TREND ANALYSIS; STATIONARITY; RISK; DROUGHT; PROJECTIONS; MAGNITUDE; INCREASES; RECORDS; EUROPE	There now exists clear evidence of the impact of climate change on flooding, creating need for new methodol-ogies for design flood estimation that account for warming induced nonstationarity. Current alternatives for nonstationary flood frequency analysis require the specification of a nonstationary probability model (often with time-varying parameters) that requires sufficient data to be stable. Reliance on the trend in observed data often ignores the dissimilar behaviour of frequent and rare quantiles under a warming climate. This, in turn, results in the direction of change to be consistent across both rare and frequent projected flood quantiles. However, results of multiple recent studies suggest that rarer floods are likely to increase while more frequent floods may decrease in magnitude into the future. In this study, we highlight this limitation of existing nonstationary flood frequency approaches and propose a novel nonstationary regional flood frequency analysis approach that captures the differing behaviour of more frequent and rare flood quantiles under a warming climate. The need for longer flood data to model nonstationarity is accommodated by pooling regional information which makes the projections more precise. Data for 105 Australian catchments are used to validate our proposed approach. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the variation of flood quantiles with varying average recur-rence intervals in a changing climate. Finally, a few important statistics of future projections are also presented.

Identifying such changes is important for flood forecasting and projection. Currently, there is a lack of observational evidence regarding trends in flooding mechanisms in Europe, which requires reliable methods to disentangle emerging patterns from the complex interactions between flood drivers. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated the skill of machine learning (ML) for predictions in hydrology, e.g., for predicting river discharge based on its relationship with meteorological drivers. The relationship, if explained properly, may provide us with new insights into hydrological processes. Here, by using a novel explainable ML framework, combined with cluster analysis, we identify three primary patterns that drive 53 968 annual maximum discharge events in around a thousand European catchments. The patterns can be associated with three catchment-wide river flooding mechanisms: recent precipitation, antecedent precipitation (i.e., excessive soil moisture), and snowmelt. The results indicate that over half of the studied catchments are controlled by a combination of the above mechanisms, especially recent precipitation in combination with excessive soil moisture, which is the dominant mechanism in one-third of the catchments. Over the past 70 years, significant changes in the dominant flooding mechanisms have been detected within a number of European catchments. Generally, the number of snowmelt-induced floods has decreased significantly, whereas floods driven by recent precipitation have increased. The detected changes in flooding mechanisms are consistent with the expected climate change responses, and we highlight the risks associated with the resulting impact on flooding seasonality and magnitude. Overall, the study offers a new perspective on understanding changes in weather and climate extreme events by using explainable ML and demonstrates the prospect of future scientific discoveries supported by artificial intelligence.

In this study, snowmelt runoff timing change in the contiguous United States between 1957 and 2016 was investigated by analysing data from 97 streamflow gages. The annual snowmelt runoff timing shift was identified using 'Center Time (CT)' and 'Spring Pulse Onset (SPO)' methods, jointly with the monthly fractional streamflow (MFS) analysis, conducted between January and June. Since snowmelt-derived streamflow timing change is mainly induced by regional meteorological factors, such as air temperature and precipitation, their trends and relationship with CT were also examined. Shifts toward earlier snowmelt runoff timing were found by both methods, CT (8.3 days on average) and SPO (8.5 days on average). Although the results of the CT change are stronger than the SPO change, both outcomes are mostly correlated, particularly in the central and northwestern parts of the country. MFS trends support the outcomes of CT and SPO. In January, February, and especially March, a higher number of the stations indicated increasing trends in MFS. In April, May, and June, their number decreased and the number of gages with diminishing trends rose sharply. The timing difference is highly related to temperature change. Annual average temperature and temperature in the melting period increase considerably. The annual average temperature is significantly negatively correlated with CT in the vast majority of the regions. Although precipitation is not as effective as the temperature, its trends have impacts on snowmelt runoff timing change depending on the region and elevation. These results demonstrate the importance of the impacts of snowmelt runoff timing changes due to global warming on the regional and large-scale hydrology in the contiguous United States.

Sensitivity of organized convective storms to model grid spacing in current and future climates	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						organized convection; mesoscale convective systems; model grid spacing; climate change; rainfall extremes; cold pools	MINIMUM B-MIN; SQUALL LINE; TROPICAL CONVECTION; WEATHER RESEARCH; MESOSCALE; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEMS; PARAMETERIZATION; MICROPHYSICS; SIMULATIONS	Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are complexes of thunderstorms that become organized and cover hundreds of kilometres over several hours. MCSs are prolific rain producers in the tropics and mid-latitudes and are the major cause of warm-season flooding. Traditionally, climate models have difficulties in simulating MCSs partly due to the misrepresentation of complex process interactions that operate across a large range of scales. Significant improvements in simulating MCSs have been found in kilometre-scale models that explicitly simulate deep convection. However, these models operate in the grey zone of turbulent motion and have known deficiencies in simulating small-scale processes (e.g. entrainment, vertical mass transport). Here, we perform mid-latitude idealized ensemble MCS simulations under current and future climate conditions in three atmospheric regimes: hydrostatic (12 km horizontal grid spacing; Delta x), non-hydrostatic (Delta x = 4, 2 and 1 km) and large eddy scale (Delta x = 500 m and 250 m). Our results show a dramatic improvement in simulating MCS precipitation, movement, cold pools, and cloud properties when transitioning from 12 km to 4 km Delta x. Decreasing Delta x beyond 4 km results in modest improvements except for up- and downdraft sizes, average vertical mass fluxes, and cloud top height and temperature, which continue to change. Most important for climate modelling is that Delta x = 4 km simulations reliably capture most MCS climate change signals compared to those of the Delta x = 250 m runs. Significantly different climate change signals are found in Delta x = 12 km runs that overestimate extreme precipitation changes by up to 100%. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.	[Prein, A. F.; Rasmussen, R.

Sectorwise Assessment of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Danger in the Indian Himalayan Region	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						glacial lake outburst floods; hazard; exposure; hydropower; Indian Himalayas; transboundary threats	CLIMATE-CHANGE; JUNE 2013; INVENTORY; RISK; HAZARD; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PRECIPITATION; LANDSLIDES; AVALANCHES; RAINFALL	Climate change and associated glacier recession have led to the formation of new glacial lakes and the expansion of existing ones across the Himalayas. Many pose a potential glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) threat to downstream communities and infrastructure. In this paper, 4418 glacial lakes in the Indian Himalayan Region and 636 transboundary lakes are analyzed. We consider hazard, exposure, and integrated danger levels using robust geographic information system-based automated approaches. The hazard level of takes was estimated based on the potential for avalanches to strike the lake, size of the lake and its upstream watershed, and distal slope of its dam. Exposure levels were calculated by intersecting cropland, roads, hydropower projects, and the human population with potential GLOF trajectories. Then, GLOF danger was determined as a function of hazard and exposure. The study demonstrates that Jammu and Kashmir (JK) is potentially the most threatened region in terms of total number of very high and high danger lakes (n = 556), followed by Arunachal Pradesh (AP) (n = 388) and Sikkim (SK) (n = 219). Sectorwise, JK faces the greatest GLOF threat to roads and population, whereas the threat to cropland and hydropower is greatest in AP and SK, respectively. Transboundary lakes primarily threaten AP and, to a lesser extent, Himachal Pradesh (HP). For Uttarakhand (UK), the impacts of potential future glacial lakes, expected to form during rapid ongoing glacier recession because of climate change, are explored. Finally, a comparison of current results with previous studies suggests that 13 lakes in SK, 5 in HR 4 in JK, 2 in UK, and 1 in AP are of highest priority for local investigation and potential risk reduction measures. Current results are of vital importance to policymakers, disaster management authorities, and the scientific community.

J	Westbrook, CJ; Ronnquist, A; Bedard-Haughn, A				Westbrook, Cherie J.; Ronnquist, Amanda; Bedard-Haughn, Angela			Hydrological functioning of a beaver dam sequence and regional dam persistence during an extreme rainstorm	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						2013 Alberta flood; beaver dams; Canadian Rockies; Castor canadensis; nature-based flood solutions; surface hydrology	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD; STREAMS; RESTORATION; WETLANDS; WATER; FAILURE; FOREST; BASIN; RIVER	It is becoming increasingly popular to reintroduce beaver to streams with the hopes of restoring riparian ecosystem function or reducing some of the hydrological impacts of climate change. One of the risks of relying on beaver to enhance ecosystem water storage is that their dams are reportedly more apt to fail during floods which can exacerbate flood severity. Missing are observations of beaver dam persistence and water storage capacity during floods, information needed to evaluate the risk of relying on beaver as a nature-based flood solution. A June rainstorm in 2013 triggered the largest recorded flood in the Canadian Rocky Mountains west of Calgary, Alberta. We opportunistically recorded hydrometric data during the rainfall event at a beaver-occupied peatland that has been studied for more than a decade. We supplemented these observations with a post-event regional analysis of beaver dam persistence. Results do not support two long-held hypotheses-that beaver ponds have limited flood attenuation capacity and commonly fail during large flood events. Instead we found that 68% of the beaver dam cascade systems across the region were intact or partially intact after the event. Pond fullness, in addition to the magnitude of the water-sediment surge, emerged as important factors in determining the structural fate of dam cascade sequences. Beaver ponds at the instrumented site quickly filled in the first few hours of the rain event and levels were dynamic during the event. Water storage offered by the beaver ponds, even ones that failed, delayed downstream floodwater transmission. Study findings have important implications for reintroducing beaver as part of nature-based restoration and climate change adaptation strategies.

However, various sources of uncertainty arise along the model chains used for the assessment of flood risk under climate change. Knowledge on the importance of these different sources of uncertainty can help to design future assessments of flood risk and to identify areas of focus for further research that aims to reduce existing uncertainties. Here we investigate the role of four sources of epistemic uncertainty affecting the estimation of flood loss for changed climate conditions fora meso-scale, pre-alpine catchment. These are: the choice of a scenario-neutral method, dimate projection uncertainty, hydrological model parameter sets, and the choice of the vulnerability function. To efficiently simulate a large number of loss estimates, a surrogate inundation model was used. 46,500 loss estimates were selected according to the change in annual mean precipitation and temperature of an ensemble of regional climate models, and considered for the attribution of uncertainty. Large uncertainty was found in the estimated loss for a 100-year flood event with losses ranging from a decrease of loss compared to estimations for present day climate, to more than a 7-fold increase. The choice of the vulnerability function was identified as the most important source of uncertainty explaining almost half of the variance in the estimates. However, uncertainty related to estimating floods for changed climate conditions contributed nearly as much. Hydrological model parametrisation was found to be negligible in the present setup. For our study area, these results highlight the importance of improving vulnerability function formulation even in a climate change context where additional major sources of uncertainty arise.

Three units of overbank flood deposits (OFD) were identified in a Holocene aeolian loess-soil profile on the south cliffy river bank at Taixuecun site (TXC). Analytical results including magnetic susceptibility, grain size distribution and geochemical elements indicate that these well-sorted overbank flood deposits were deposited from the suspended sediment load in floodwaters. We identified two episodes of prehistoric extraordinary overbank flooding that were dated to 6000-5500 and 4000-3800 yr BP using AMS C-14 and OSL dating techniques with references to the already-known ages of the archaeological remains. Among of the two episodes, the overbank episode at 4000-3800 yr BP likely had a profound impact on the cultural development from the late Longshan Culture (4500-4000 yr BP) to the Erlitou Culture (3700-3500 yr BP) in the alluvial plain of the Luo River within the Luoyang Basin, providing geological evidence for the legends of ancient floods and their social impacts at ca. 4000 yr BP. In addition, an episode of historic overbank flood event was dated to 1800-1700 yr BP, i.e., from the Han to Wei dynasties, during which the ancient capital (Luoyang City) was subjected to frequent flooding. These aforementioned hydro-climatic events are considered to be regional expressions of known climatic events. The study adds our knowledge of the Holocene extraordinary overbank floods and their relationship with monsoonal climate change and human land-use practices, and the social impact of prehistoric environmental changes on human cultural development.

The refurbishment process is a complicated method of building construction after flooding. This study assesses all building costs in parallel with environmental emissions after repairs in a flood zone, in non-flood situations and when a flood hits the building, to determine the feasibility of repairs. Five types of building materials including common brick, concrete block, steel wall panels, wood, and precast concrete framing were assessed with a full life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) assessment under non-flood, low-flood, and high-flood conditions. The result of greenhouse gas analysis showed that timber was the best choice for constructing the building, while, in case of flood occurrence, precast concrete framing shows better performance by releasing less CO2 after the repair stage. The result of cost analysis indicated that despite timber being an ideal material for use in building construction, it is the costliest option in a high-flood situation due to its high repair costs. The benchmark results show that timber and steel frame were the worst materials to use in a flood zone, while brick was the most sustainable one. The findings of this paper prove that wood as a building material in flood zones is not ideal and that alternative materials such as brick have better functionality in terms of both global warming mitigation and LCC.

Rapid and substantial changes in land-use, land-management and industrial activities over the subcontinent, and warming in the Indian Ocean, have influenced the South Asian summer monsoon. These might continue to be significant drivers in the near-term along with rising global greenhouse gas emissions. Deciphering the region's vulnerability to climate change requires an understanding of how these anthropogenic activities, acting on a range of spatial scales, have shaped the monsoon spatially and temporally. This review summarizes historical changes in monsoon rainfall characteristics, associated mechanisms, and the role of anthropogenic forcings, focusing on subseasonal variability and extreme events. Several studies have found intensified subseasonal extremes across parts of India and an increase in spatial variability of rainfall despite an overall weakening of seasonal rainfall in the monsoon core. However, understanding these changes remains challenging because of uncertainties in observations and climate models. The mechanisms and relative influences of various anthropogenic activities, particularly on subseasonal extremes, remain relatively underexplored. Large biases in the representation of relevant processes in global climate models limit the ability to attribute historical changes and make reliable projections. Nevertheless, recent advances in modeling these processes using higher-resolution modeling frameworks provide new tools to investigate the Indian summer monsoon's response to various anthropogenic forcings. There is an urgent need to understand how these forcings interact to shape climate variability and change in this vulnerable region.

Intensification of fire regimes and forest loss in the Territorio Indigena do Xingu	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Amazon; deforestation; forest cover; fire; droughts; Indigenous people; seasonally flooded	TROPICAL FORESTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAIN-FOREST; AMAZON; DEFORESTATION; SAVANNA; DROUGHT; AREA; DEGRADATION; RESILIENCE	The contemporary fire regime of southern Amazonian forests has been dominated by interactions between droughts and sources of fire ignition associated with deforestation and slash-and-burn agriculture. Until recently, wildfires have been concentrated mostly on private properties, with protected areas functioning as large-scale firebreaks along the Amazon's agricultural frontier. However, as the climate changes, protected forests have become increasingly flammable. Here, we have quantified forest degradation in the Territorio Indigena do Xingu (TIX), an iconic area of 2.8 million hectares where over 6000 people from 16 different ethnic Indigenous groups live across 100 villages. Our main hypothesis was that forest degradation, defined here as areas with lower canopy cover, inside the TIX is increasing due to pervasive sources of fire ignition, more frequent extreme drought events, and changing slash-and-burn agricultural practices. Between 2001 and 2020, nearly 189 000 hectares (similar to 7%) of the TIX became degraded by recurrent drought and fire events that were the main factors driving forest degradation, particularly in seasonally flooded forests. After three fire events, the probability of forest loss was higher in seasonally flooded areas (63%) compared to upland areas (41%). Given the same fire frequency, areas that have not suffered with extreme droughts showed a 24% lower probability of forest loss compared to areas that experienced three drought events. Distance from villages and human density also had a marked effect on forest cover loss, which was generally higher in areas close to the largest villages. In one of the most culturally diverse Indigenous lands of the Amazon, in a landscape highly threatened by deforestation, our findings demonstrate that climate change may have already exceeded the conditions to which the system has adapted.

The present study maps the impact of emerging pressures on museums and historic buildings in the Tokyo Area. We examine a context to the threat in terms of fluctuating levels of visitors as a response to environmental issues, from SARS and COVID-19, through to earthquakes. GIS mapping allows a range of natural and human-induced hazards to be expressed as the spatial spread of risk. Temperature is increasing and Tokyo has a heat island which makes the city hotter than its surroundings. This adds to the effects of climate change. Temperature increases and a decline in relative humidity alter the potential for mould growth and change insect life cycles. The region is vulnerable to sea level rise, but flooding is also a likely outcome of increasingly intense falls of rain, especially during typhoons. Reclamation has raised the risk of liquefaction during earthquakes that are relatively frequent in Japan. Earthquakes cause structural damage and fires after the rupture of gas pipelines and collapse of electricity pylons. Fires from lightning strikes might also increase in a future Tokyo. These are especially relevant, as many Japanese heritage sites use wood for building materials. In parallel, more natural landscapes of the region are also affected by a changing climate. The shifting seasons already mean the earlier arrival of the cherry blossom and a later arrival of autumn colours and a lack of winter snow. The mapping exercise should highlight the spatial distribution of risk and the way it is likely to change, so it can contribute to longer term heritage management plans.

Factors contributing to the adoption of crop diversification in shrimp cultivation and agricultural crop farming zones of coastal Bangladesh	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						Coastal Bangladesh; Crop diversification; Rural livelihoods; Climate change adaptation; Risk perception; Aquaculture; Agriculture; Binary logistic regression	LAND-USE DIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; SALINITY; IMPACTS; AQUACULTURE; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; DROUGHT; DYNAMICS	Environmental stressors, potentially aggravated by climate change, pose significant challenges to households whose livelihoods rely primarily on crop production in agriculture or aquaculture, particularly in countries of the Global South. In this context, diversified farming systems, or crop diversification, have been discussed as one adaptation strategy of smallholder farming households to reduce their livelihood vulnerability and increase farm resilience. In coastal Bangladesh, livelihoods based on cultivation of shrimp, prawn, fish, paddy (rice) and other crops are likely to become more vulnerable with accelerated sea level rise, extreme flooding events, cyclone activity, river bank erosion and salinization. While crop diversification in Bangladesh is still low overall, it has been increasing. To understand the factors driving the uptake of diversified cropping in different farming production contexts and allow for policy measures addressing regionally specific needs, we explore the (relative) impact and significance of relevant factors contributing to the adoption of crop diversification practices for (i) shrimp cultivation and (ii) agricultural crop farming zones. We specifically include variables representing subjectively perceived risks to study their role in climate change adaptation. Our findings are based on a quantitative household survey (n = 1188) in nine purposefully selected unions across the Bangaleshi part of the GangesBrahmaputra-Meghna delta to capture the diversity of the region. Our results show that the prevalence of crop diversification measures is relatively high in the shrimp cultivation zone, but relatively low in the agricultural crop farming regions. In sum, the results show that even though direct economic factors seem to be (still) more important for diversification decisions, our study also suggests that perceived environmental threats and changes can have a favourable influence on crop diversification and should hence be included in studies investigating causes for land use changes. Yet, there are significant differences with regard to the influence of specific factors on the likelihood to diversify in the two respective zones. We conclude that greater uptakes of agriculture and aquaculture diversification could represent a promising and more sustainable approach for smallholders in coastal Bangladesh given appropriate supportive institutional conditions and measures that address specific needs of local communities. A "one-size-fits-all" approach to pushing crop diversification is unlikely to produce adequate and sustainable results.

Possible Factors Driving Groundwater Quality and Its Vulnerability to Land Use, Floods, and Droughts Using Hydrochemical Analysis and GIS Approaches	WATER			English	Article						climate change; land use change; groundwater-quality deterioration; spatiotemporal variation	EASTERN DESERT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLASH FLOODS; WADI QENA; CATCHMENT; IMPACT; SYSTEM; RIVER; PREDICTION; REGRESSION	Land use and climate change always induce significant changes in various parameters of the hydrologic cycle (e.g., surface runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration). The Wadi El-Assiuti downstream area in the Eastern Desert of Egypt is one of the most promising areas for development that is suffering from insufficient water availability and inadequate water quality for different purposes. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the changes in groundwater quality, land use, and climate in association with geology and flooding during three periods within the years 1997-2019 in the downstream portion of Wadi El-Assiuti in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, using spatiotemporal variation associated with groundwater hydrochemical analysis and GIS techniques. About 133 groundwater samples were collected to examine groundwater quality changes over time. Different groundwater quality indices were calculated, and the results show that TDS levels of groundwater in the study area ranged between 1080-2780 mg/L, 672-4564 mg/L, and 811-6084 mg/L, while SAR levels varied within 6.15-15.34, 1.83-28.87, and 1.43-30.57 for the years 1997, 2007, and 2019, respectively. Both RSBC and SSP values exhibited significantly increasing trends over time. KR values were within 1.36-4.06 in 1997, 0.58-14.09 in 2007, and 0.35-14.92 in 2019; MAR values were within 6.9-45.2 in 1997, 20.79-71.5 in 2007, and 17.71-75.81 in 2019; and PI values were within 60.16-83 in 1997, 45.56-101.03 in 2007, and 42.51-148.88 in 2019. Across the entire study area, ongoing land use changes increased from 1.1% in 1997 to 4.1% in 2019. Findings pointed to the significant contribution of the deep Nubian Sandstone Aquifer to the groundwater aquifer at Wadi El-Assiuti through fractures and deep faults. Given the climatic conditions from 1997-2019, these changes may have affected water quality in shallow aquifers, especially with increasing evaporation. Realizing the spatiotemporal variation of the aquifer recharge system, land use development, and climate change clearly would help in water resource management. This study revealed that flooding events, deep-seated geologic structures, and land use development associated with human activities have the highest impact on groundwater quality.

In response to increased storm risks and sea-level rise, coastal communities invest in shoreline stabilization by rebuilding eroding sections of the coast through periodic re-nourishment. While conceptual models of the coastal-economic system provide a capital-theoretic framework to study beach management, empirical analysis of the drivers of beach nourishment policy is limited. Using data from 21 coastal towns in North Carolina, we examine the geophysical and economic factors that reflect coastal vulnerability and influence the frequency of beach nourishment investments. We find that beach towns with access to periodically replenishable sand deposits from inlets and river channels nourish more frequently. Beaches that rely on offshore sand reserves are nourished less frequently. Our results provide new insights into the heterogeneous risks that local communities face with higher costs, limited sand reserves and the growing nourishment demand driven by climate change and increased vulnerability.

Both climatic and anthropogenic activities may contribute to such changes. Therefore, this study assesses: (i) Streamflow and precipitation trends to identify streamflow alterations in the Extended East Rapti (EER) watershed in central-southern Nepal; (ii) relationship of the alterations to climatic and anthropogenic sources; and (iii) implications of streamflow changes to the socio-environmental system. The trends in streamflow were analyzed for pre-and post-1990 periods considering the abrupt shift in temperature trend in 1990. Results showed a general decreasing trends in discharge post-1990 in the EER watershed. Human activities have significantly contributed in altering streamflow in the EER. Human-induced streamflow alterations have affected the water availability, food security, river health, aquatic biodiversity, and groundwater abstraction in the EER watershed.

The worst of the flooding occurred after very high 24-h rainfall totals of up to 82 mm fell on already saturated ground. This followed very high 24-h rainfall totals in the region just two weeks earlier of up to just under 50 mm. In the light of anthropogenic climate change, it is expected that extreme rainfall events are set to become more intense as a result of increased global mean temperatures and the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Here we investigate the change in risk of such extreme rainfall events in the UK in autumn using a new index R-50mm_OND, representing the mean number of daily precipitation totals in excess of 50 mm in October-December each year. Using high resolution regional model datasets and observations we show that extreme rainfall totals for the UK are increasing exponentially as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Observations show that the frequency of extreme daily precipitation in the form of R-50mm_OND has already increased by 60% (95% CI: 44-76) in the UK between the beginning of the 20th and 21st centuries. R-50mm_OND is projected to increase even further between 2019 and 2080, by 85% (95% CI: 73-97) according to a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario of anthropogenic emissions. While higher resolution models (12 km spatial resolution) were able to capture the observed changes, lower resolution models were not. This underlines the importance of high-resolution models for modelling extreme precipitation seen in late autumn and early winter, not just for convective rainfall in the summer. A more specific analysis of the November 2019 event looked at the mean of the two highest daily precipitation totals in October-November in the South Yorkshire region. This found a long-term shift to higher daily rainfall totals for this mean with an increase in intensity of the top 10% of events, suggesting that the South Yorkshire region in autumn is more at risk of flooding in the future without effective adaptation measures.

To guide future expectations about droughts, this study aims to assess large-scale variability of hydrological stores (groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water) and their responses to drought intensities over large semi-arid domains in Australia. Multi-scaled indicators synthesised from in-situ rainfall (SPI-standardised precipitation index), water budget (SPEI-standardised evapotranspiration precipitation index), model (soil moisture-SM), and satellite observations (groundwater storage-GWS, surface water extent-SWE, and terrestrial water storage-TWS) are employed to assess this variability in climatic hotspots identified through statistical rotation. The link between these hotspots and climate modes are diagnosed using gaussian kernel-based SVMR (support vector machine regression), and quantile function of storage (QFS) is used to assess the response of hydrological stores to climate variability. The capability of these indicators to capture impacts of water deficit on agricultural systems is explored by implementing a PLSR (partial least square regression). Results show that (i) drought characteristics and intensities vary greatly across Australia but hotspots of higher drought duration and intensity are predominant in regions below latitude 25 degrees S, (ii) hydrological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-12) are better predictors of hydrological stores such as TWS and GWS, though the latter shows strong but opposite phase relationship with climate data, (iii) influence of climate teleconnections is better diagnosed and predicted with SPEI/SPI-12, and the Murray Darling basin-MDB (r = 0.84, alpha = 0.05) and central/east coast (r = 0.80, 0.79, alpha = 0.05) are major teleconnection hotspots, (iv) SM and GWS losses in the MDB occurred 60% and about 44% of the time, respectively, during the 2002 2017 period, (v) extreme events (droughts and floods) affect the distribution of SWE, and (vi) meteorological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-3) are excellent metrics that capture variability in crop production. Choosing appropriate indicators that reflect the response of freshwater ecosystems (including groundwater) to climatic and anthropogenic constraints is part of a key process to guide investments in drought resilience and sustainable management of water resources.

In the United States, managed retreat is often sponsored by governments through acquiring properties in the aftermath of a major disaster event. This study empirically examined the institutional factors that influence government buyouts of floodplain properties across US counties, with a particular focus on local fiscal conditions and existing flood management practices. The empirical analysis drew on a nationwide panel data set of buyout projects funded through the federal Hazard Mitigation Grant Program over the period 1990-2016. Using a double-hurdle model, the authors found that counties with more property tax revenues and a lower fiscal reliance on property taxes have more postflood buyouts. Results also indicate a negative impact of flood insurance take-up rates and levee protection on a county's buyouts of flood-prone properties. These findings shed new light on the challenges for government buyouts and possible conflicts among different policy instruments in flood risk management.

We aim to explore how flood records from Dartmouth Flood Observatory, a global flood monitoring database, can be linked with a national disaster database maintained by the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, to aid local vulnerability assessment in Indonesia. We focused on physical damage to structures and agricultural crops from flooding and examined spatiotemporal patterns of a vulnerability metric derived from principal component analysis. We identified the most vulnerable areas based on emerging hot spot analysis and detected sporadic hotspots (i.e. on again then off again) of flooding in Jakarta and West Java. Using our derived metric, we identified oscillating cold spots (i.e. a cold spot that was previously a hot spot) of vulnerability in Banten, Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java. The detection of nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal trends in flooding and vulnerability demonstrate potential usability of public climate data and help to outline directions for novel research.

This study explores how inhabitants of two Mediterranean French cities, Frejus and Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhone (PSLR), understand and prepare for coastal flood risk. A constructivist approach was adopted combining elements of the Theory of Social Representations and the Social Amplification of Risk Framework. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 41 inhabitants of these two localities. Local dwellers of the two cities base their knowledge of coastal flood risk on previous fluvial flood experiences. Affective attachment to the coast is expressed differently between localities - PSLR inhabitants describe an environmental history that is part of their personal history; whereas Fre ' jus inhabitants have elected this place to live. Risk attenuation argumentative strategies are identified: social comparison, risk comparison and fatalism. A shared understanding that 'something must happen' before coastal floods are taken seriously was also identified. This is discussed as an example of how the objectification process of social representations contributes to raising the societal awareness of new risks, or to their social amplification.

J	Ojima, DS				Ojima, Dennis S.			Climate resilient management in response to flash droughts in the US Northern Great Plains	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article								The Northern Great Plains (NGP) region plays a very important role in providing water and land resources and other critical ecosystem services to support rural livelihoods. Semi-arid conditions and the tight coupling of livelihood enterprises with ecosystem services increases sensitivity to climate change. The changing climate and social-economic situations across the NGP have further challenged current management practices. Recent climate stresses has indicated that changing seasonality and extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, ice storms) are impacting ecosystem services and increasing vulnerability to rural livelihoods. In particular, the emergence of rapid on-set of drought has been problematic to resource managers and operators due the shortened period to respond to these drought events. This paper provides a regional example for the North American Great Plains to illustrate how emerging climate impacts affect the ability to respond within the social-ecological system capabilities to manage for these impacts. This paper is a contribution to an international effort, the Global Dryland Ecosystem Programme (Fu et al. this issue), to develop regional research and engagement efforts to further understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes and to enable this knowledge to guide further development of adaptive management options.

The coincidence probabilities considering flood occurrence dates and flood magnitudes were calculated using nonstationary multivariate models and compared with those from stationary models. In addition, the "most likely" design based on copula theory was used to provide the most likely flood coincidence scenarios. The Huai River and Hong River were selected as case studies. The results show that the highest probabilities of flood coincidence occur in mid-July. The marginal distributions for the flood magnitudes of the two rivers are nonstationary, and time-varying copulas provide a better fit than stationary copulas for the dependence structure of the flood magnitudes. Considering the annual coincidence probabilities for given flood magnitudes and the "most likely" design, the stationary model may underestimate the risk of flood coincidence in wet years or overestimate this risk in dry years. Therefore, it is necessary to use nonstationary models in climate change scenarios.

This study systematically analyzed the spatial-temporal variations of surface water resources in China since 2000. Water vulnerability in current (2010s) and its trends from 2000 to late-2010s in different regions of China were also summarized. In addition, the correspondingly adaptive measures to counter regional risks to water resources were proposed. We concluded that the runoff of major rivers had been decreasing in eastern China and increasing in western China during 2000-2018. In the arid area of Northwest China, the alpine runoff has shown an overall upward trend since the late-1990s/early-2000s, with a 10%-25% increase caused by the increase of glacial meltwater and precipitation. While the runoff of each hydrological station in the 2000s-2010s was 34.7% lower than that in the 1950s-2010s on average. The increases in precipitation and glacial meltwater with global warming caused a rapid expansion of lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang, thus leading to an increase in total area and water quantity of lakes in China from 1995 to 2015. The mean contribution rates of climate change and human activity to runoff change in river basins of China were 53.5% and 46.5%, respectively, during the period of 2000-2010s. The driving factor of runoff change in many river basins has gradually changed from climate change (1950s-2000) to human activity (2000-2018). During 2000-2018, the contributions of human activities to runoff change were 50%-80% in major rivers of eastern China. The vulnerability in most areas of Northwest China and North China is generally high, with the vulnerability index greater than 0.6. Comparatively, in Northeast, East, South, and Central China, it is lower or not vulnerable. In Southwest China, the vulnerability varies greatly with Yunnan and Sichuan relatively low while Chongqing and Guizhou relatively high. The precipitation increase, the application of water-saving technology, the establishment of flood control and drought relief engineering facilities, and the introduction of relevant policies and measures have helped to gradually reduce the vulnerability of water resources in most areas of North and Northwest China (except Xinjiang) from 2000 to 2010s. Water vulnerability has been increasing in southern China, caused by climate change and the development of industry and agriculture, which increases water resource exposure since 2000. Based on the typical risk factors and vulnerability characteristics of water resources in different regions, this study proposed some targeted adaptive measures correspondingly so as to scientifically deal with the problems of surface water resources in China.

Fluvial Flood Losses in the Contiguous United States Under Climate Change	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						flood; property damages; heavy precipitation; climate change	DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; HURRICANE HARVEY; FUTURE CHANGES; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACTS; MODELS; RISK; US	Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters causing significant economic losses. One of the dominant drivers of flood losses is heavy precipitation, with other contributing factors such as built environments and socio-economic conditions superimposed to it. To better understand the risk profile associated with this hazard, we develop probabilistic models to quantify the future likelihood of fluvial flood-related property damage exceeding a critical threshold (i.e., high property damage) at the state level across the conterminous United States. The model is conditioned on indicators representing heavy precipitation amount and frequency derived from observed and downscaled precipitation. The likelihood of high property damage is estimated from the conditional probability distribution of annual total property damage, which is derived from the joint probability of the property damage and heavy precipitation indicators. Our results indicate an increase in the probability of high property damage (i.e., exceedance of 70th percentile of observed annual property damage for each state) in the future. Higher probability of high property damage is projected to be clustered in the states across the western and south-western United States, and parts of the U.S. Northwest and the northern Rockies and Plains. Depending on the state, the mean annual probability of high property damage in these regions could range from 38% to 80% and from 46% to 95% at the end of the century (2090s) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. This is equivalent to 20%-40% increase in the probability compared to the historical period 1996-2005. Results show that uncertainty in the projected probability of high property damage ranges from 14% to 35% across the states. The spatio-temporal variability of the uncertainty across the states and three future decades (i.e., 2050s, 2070s, and 2090s) exhibits nonstationarity, which is driven by the uncertainty associated with the probabilistic prediction models and climate change scenarios.

The Wadi-Gaza basin is a critical source of surface water in Palestine; nevertheless, climate change and anthropogenic processes are altering the basin's hydrological features, resulting in a series of extreme and disastrous flooding events in the coastal plain at the basin downstream. The Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and the IPTA method that was used to analyze historical rainfall in the basin from 1979 to 2013 refer to a declining trend pattern, which reduces the surge of runoff discharge. Moreover, the future projection for the total monthly rainfall under the ensemble model of CIMP5 for the RCP scenarios of 2.60, 4.50, and 8.50 demonstrate a general decreasing trend in the rainfall with a variation ranging between about - 36 and - 53%. The frequency analysis for the maximum daily rainfall using different computing approaches shows that the theoretical maximum rainfall values for the assessment of flooding events were assigned to 22, 31, 35, 45 52, 59, 66, and 77 mm for the whole basin for the return periods (T) of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 years, respectively. The land cover-land use of the basin shows that 51% is barren land while the other portion is divided between urban (similar to 16%), agricultural (similar to 13%), and natural (similar to 20%) lands. However, the type of soil that covers the basin is classified mainly as clay, loam, and sandy clay. According to the hydraulic analysis of downstream flooding, the volume of surge water that might reach the coastal plain in the event of water storms of 22 and 77 mm is around 6 and 118 million cubic meters, respectively. The area at risk of inundation due to floods in the Wadi-Gaza is between 3 and 17 km(2), covering around 5-29 percent of the Gaza Strip's middle governorate area, respectively.

This study examined the impacts of climate change on water resources and extreme events in the Bang Pakong-rachin Buri River Basin, Thailand using three different Regional Climate Models (RCMs) ACCESS1-CSIRO-CAM, CNRM-CM5-CSIRO-CCAM, and MPI-ESM-LR-CSIRO-CCAM under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the future streamflow and Extreme Value Type I distribution (EVI) was used to analyze the extreme events under projected climate conditions. The result of this study showed an increase in maximum (1.9 degrees C/3.6 degrees C) and minimum (1.6 degrees C/3.3 degrees C) temperatures under RCP4.5/8.5 at the end of the 21st century. In addition, projected rainfall is expected to decrease up to 6.8% (8.5%) in 2050s and then increase slowly such that the decrement remains 4.2% (11.0%) under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) at the end of the century. The rainfall pattern is projected to considerably fluctuate, in particular, a shift in long term average annual peak event from September to August is predicted in 2080s under emission scenario RCP4.5 (RCP8.5). On the other hand, the average annual discharge is expected to increase up to 13.5% (2020s) and 7.6% (2050s) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively with decreasing trend in low flows and increasing trend in high flows. Further analysis on extreme events; strengthened the results from hydrological modeling with an increase in flow volume for the same return period under changed climate conditions. This raises water resources management issues in the Bang Pakong-Prachin Buri River Basin regarding the frequency of flood and drought events in the future calling for proper policy formulation and implementation.

This work identified inland and seaward mangrove migrations along the Jucurucu River (Bahia, Northeastern Brazil), during the Holocene based on sedimentary features, palynological and geochemical (delta C-13, delta N-15, C/N) data integrated with digital elevation models. During the Middle Holocene, in response to RSL rise, the estuary saw mangrove forest establish up to ~37 km inland. RSL stood between -1.4 (+0.36/-2.2 m) and +1 (2.19/0.2 m) around 7400 cal yr BP, and rose to a highest position of +3.25 (4.22/2.45 m) reached around 5350 cal yr BP. That marine incursion caused the inland replacement of freshwater vegetation by mangroves on tidal flats. Since then, the estuary experienced RSL fall, reducing inland tidal water salinity towards the Late Holocene, making that the mangroves were replaced by freshwater floodplain vegetation. Today, in the seaward part of the estuary near its mouth, mangroves occupy an area of ~10 km(2) along tidal channels. Considering a RSL rise of 98 cm up to the end of the 21(st) century, at a rate significantly higher than that of Middle Holocene RSL rise (1.5 mm/yr) and fall (0.6 mm/yr), the current mangrove substrates are expected to drown and/or eroded near the coast, while new mangroves may establish inland, at topographically higher tidal flats in nowadays freshwater-tidal zones. Mangrove area could expand over 13 km(2) of coastal and flood plain. Following the same interaction between RSL/climate changes and Holocene mangrove dynamics, such upstream mangrove migration may be attenuated or intensified by changes in fluvial discharge.

Ontogenetic variation in salinity tolerance and ecophysiology of coastal dune plants	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						Coastal dunes; ecophysiology; ontogeny; salt tolerance; salt stress; plant functional traits; phenotypic plasticity	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SALT TOLERANCE; SEED-GERMINATION; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSES; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; SCAEVOLA-SERICEA; GROWTH	Background and Aims Global climate change includes shifts in temperature and precipitation, increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and sea level rise, which will drastically impact coastal ecosystems. The aim of this study is to quantify salinity tolerance and to identify physiological mechanisms underlying tolerance across whole-plant ontogeny in two widespread native coastal plant species in Hawai'i, Jacquemontia sandwicensis (Convolvulaceae) and Sida fallax (Malvaceae). Methods At the seed, seedling, juvenile and mature ontogenetic stages, plants were exposed to high salinity watering treatments. Tolerance was assayed as the performance of stressed compared with control plants using multiple fitness metrics, including germination, survival, growth and reproduction. Potential physiological mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance were measured at each ontogenetic stage, including: photosynthesis and stomatal conductance rates, leaf thickness, leaf mass per area and biomass allocation. Key Results Salinity tolerance varied between species and across ontogeny but, overall, salinity tolerance increased across ontogeny. For both species, salinity exposure delayed flowering. Physiological and morphological leaf traits shifted across plant ontogeny and were highly plastic in response to salinity. Traits enhancing performance under high salinity varied across ontogeny and between species. For J. sandwicensis, water use efficiency enhanced growth for juvenile plants exposed to high salinity, while chlorophyll content positively influenced plant growth under salinity in the mature stage. For S. fallax, transpiration enhanced plant growth only under low salinity early in ontogeny; high transpiration constrained growth under high salinity across all ontogenetic stages. Conclusions That salinity effects vary across ontogenetic stages indicates that demographic consequences of sea level rise and coastal flooding will influence population dynamics in complex ways. Furthermore, even coastal dune plants presumably adapted to tolerate salinity demonstrate reduced ecophysiological performance, growth and reproduction under increased salinity, highlighting the conservation importance of experimental work to better project climate change effects on plants.

Tools for assessing flood impact are required to support the shift of flood mitigation management from post-disaster recovery and reconstruction to community-driven pre-disaster warning and preparation. This study aims to develop an integrated approach to spatially assess the economic and social losses and ecological gain and identify the geographical factors of locations with high impacts of floods in Brisbane using the datasets collected from both the 2011 and 2022 flood events. Water depth, inundated area, land cover, ecosystem service value, mortality, and morbidity were considered to assess flood impacts. It is found that downstream (above 23,500 m from the upper stream) riverside communities (within 800 m of the river) with low altitudes (below 15 m) are more likely to experience significant flood damage. Flood impacts have bell-shaped developments with elevation and direct distance to the upstream river source and an exponential decline with distances to the river. These findings have implications for formulating future urban land use and community-tailored mitigation strategies, particularly for flood warning and preparation.

The need to reconfigure consistency and variability to best manage changing flood risks in Aotearoa-New Zealand	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND			English	Article						Climate change impacts; flood governance; planning; vulnerability; equity; economic impacts	CLIMATE; VULNERABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; RESILIENCE; LESSONS; SCIENCE; IMPACT; LIMITS	Flooding is Aotearoa-New Zealand's most frequent natural hazard, and there is high confidence that climate change is making extreme rainfall events more frequent and intense. Additionally, there are significant development pressures which could both increase the number of people and assets at risk and the flood hazard. To date, there is no publicly available consistent approach to accurately determine flood risk on a national scale, nor for how this may be changing; although there is a growing legislative requirement to provide quality information over multiple spatial scales. This paper draws on empirical data to gain insights on how to best manage changing flood risks in Aotearoa-New Zealand from the perspective of centrally organised entities. Findings confirm the need for a nationally consistent approach to flood risk management, better understanding of Aotearoa's communities and their vulnerability to floods, equitable access to quality information and decision-support tools, and better understanding of the economic impacts on differing communities, regions and places. The paper concludes that to achieve a flood-resilient Aotearoa, flood governance needs to be reconfigured to achieve national consistency in flood risk management whilst enabling targeted variability at the local scale.

A Case Study Based upon the River LÆrdal, Norway	WATER			English	Article						river; ecosystem; flood; protection; EIA; HEC-RAS; hydraulic modeling; dredging; mitigation; management; impact; fish; wall confinements; floodplains	IMPACT ASSESSMENT; ATLANTIC SALMON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONNECTIVITY; SYSTEM; SCALE; STATE	Floods are among the most damaging of natural disasters, and flood events are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency with the effects of climate change and changes in land use. As a consequence, much focus has been placed on the engineering of structural flood mitigation measures in rivers. Traditional flood protection measures, such as levees and dredging of the river channel, threaten floodplains and river ecosystems, but during the last decade, sustainable reconciliation of freshwater ecosystems has increased. However, we still find many areas where these traditional measures are proposed, and it is challenging to find tools for evaluation of different measures and quantification of the possible impacts. In this paper, we focus on the river L AE rdal in Norway to (i) present the dilemma between traditional flood measures and maintaining river ecosystems and (ii) quantify the efficiency and impact of different solutions based on 2D hydraulic models, remote sensing data, economics, and landscape metrics. Our results show that flood measures may be in serious conflict with environmental protection and legislation to preserve biodiversity and key nature types.

However, the assessments of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and their impact on the water resources over the Nile basin lacked a transboundary perspective. Here we used coupled basin-scale geospatial-hydrological models to project future LULC changes in the Nile basin and its three trib-utaries (i.e., White Nile, Blue Nile, and Atbara River), explored their drivers and projected hydrological impacts under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) during 2020-2060. Compared to 1992-2019, significant increases in the forested area (>50 x 103 km2) are expected to occur in the upstream areas of the White Nile and the Blue Nile in South Sudan and Ethiopia, with larger increases projected under higher emission scenarios. Consequently, it will likely reduce the downstream seasonal river discharge for the White and Blue Nile by up to 8.4% (SSP5) and 8.9% (SSP2), respectively. An increase of 7.4% in the Blue Nile discharge is expected during the flood season if the current urbanization/deforestation rates would prevail in the future. Large decreases (>15 x 103 km2) of unused land are expected in the Atbara River sub-catchment with increases in natural vegetation socioeconomic-related LULC types, leading to a river flow decrease of 15% during the rainy season under the SSPs. The basin-scale LULC changes are projected to decrease the Main Nile flow to Egypt by 3.6% under SSPs and increase by 2.1% if the historical trends prevail. The results highlight a close association between landscape dynamics, socioeconomic growth, and climate change over the Nile basin and suggest adaptive LULC planning and conservation measures.

While arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) take up most of Kenya's land mass, approximately 64% of its total croplands lie within mountainous areas with high rainfall, hence, areas highly vulnerable to water erosion. Flooding of the Great Lakes and increasing desertification of the ASALs are illustrative cases of the implications of recent precipitation dynamics in Kenya. This study applied the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate future soil erosion rates at the national level based on four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project v5 (CMIP5) models under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Results showed the current soil loss rate to be at 4.76 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and projected an increase in average rainfall erosivity under the two scenarios, except for RCP-2.6 (2030s) and (2080s) for the MIROC-5 model. Future projections revealed an incremental change in rainfall erosivity from the baseline climate by a cumulative average of 39.9% and 61.1% for all scenarios by the 2030s and 2080s, respectively, while soil loss is likely to increase concomitantly by 29% and 60%, respectively. The CCCMA_CANESM2 model under the RCP 8.5 (2080s) scenario projected the highest erosion rate of 15 t ha(-1) yr(-1) over Kenya, which is a maximum increase of above 200%, with the Rift Valley region recording an increase of up to 100% from 7.05 to 14.66 t ha(-1) yr(-1). As a first countrywide future soil erosion study, this assessment provides a useful reference for preventing water erosion and improving ecosystem service security.

Within the framework of the European project RESCCUE (RESilience to cope with Climate Change in Urban arEas-a multi-sectorial approach focusing on water), climate projections for the city of Barcelona manifest meaningful increases in maximum rainfall intensities for the 2100 horizon. A better comprehension of these impacts and their conditions is consequently needed. A hydrodynamic modelling process was carried out on Barcelona Metro Line 3, as it was identified as vulnerable to pluvial flooding events. The Metro line and all its components are simulated in the urban drainage models as a system of computational link and nodes reproducing the main physical characteristics like slopes and cross-sections when embedded in the current 1D/2D hydrodynamic model of Barcelona used in the project RESCCUE. This study presents a risk analysis focused on ensuring transport service continuity in flood events. The results reveal that two of the 26 stations on Metro Line 3 are exposed to a high risk of flooding in current rainfall conditions, and 11 of the 26 stations on Metro Line 3 are exposed to a high risk of flooding in future rainfall conditions for a 20-year return period event, which affects Metro service in terms of increased risk. This research gives insights for stakeholders and policymakers to enhance urban flood risk management, as a reasonable approach to tackle this issue for Metro systems worldwide. This study provides a baseline for assessing potential flood outcomes in Metro systems and can be used to evaluate adaptation measures' effectiveness.

The purpose of this study is to reveal the spatio-temporal trend in the long-term time series of extreme rainfall and temperature in Sarawak peatland cause by climate change. Gridded-based Princeton datasets were used for trend analysis spanning 68-year (1948-2016) based on Modified Mann -Kendall (m-MK) test which has the capability of distinguishing unidirectional trend with multi-scale variability. The m-MK test was also used to confirm the increasing or decreasing trend produce by Mann-Kendall (MK), and to discriminate the exaggeration in trend caused by serial auto-correlation due to the high effect of large scale climate events regulating the climate in the region. By using R-based program, RClimDex for extreme climate indices output, extreme climate under Northeast (NE) and Southwest (SW) monsoon showed lower grid point with significant changes under m-MK test compared to MK test at 95% significance level. Here, the exaggeration of trend by MK test has been reduced by using m-MK test which can accommodate the scaling effect in the time series due to inherent natural climate variability. Diurnal temperature range (DTR) was expected to decrease for both monsoons in the central-coastal region as minimum temperature (TN) increased more than maximum temperature (TX). Significant increase in extreme rainfall (R10, R20, Rnn) was spatially observed more during SW monsoon compared to NE monsoon, although with high spatial variability. Significant increase of TN indices of TNn and TN90p might cause increased rainfall intensity in the south and central-coastal region, while high TX indices of TXn might cause increased rainfall intensity in the north. Due to the imminent threat of climate change, this study gives scientists an essential view on the behavior of different extreme climate variables and its potential impact on the peatland area which is susceptible to flood and risk of fire during the NE and SW monsoon, respectively.

The spatiotemporal variations of snow cover on the TP and its response to climate change at different altitudes are still unclear because of the lack of in situ observations on the western TP, and limitations of optical remote sensing due to clouds. Using a daily passive microwave remote sensing snow depth dataset from 1979 to 2020 across the TP, this study investigates the spatiotemporal variations of snow depth and snow phenology as well as their responses to climate change. The results showed that during the past 40 years, the maximum snow depth (SDmax) and the snow cover duration days (SCD) on the TP decreased significantly at a rate of 0.6 cm/decade and 2.9 d/decade, respectively. The snow cover starting date (SCS) was delayed at a rate of 1.1 d/decade, whereas the snow cover melt date (SCM) advanced at a rate of 1.1 d/decade. The decrease of SCD was driven by the advance of SCM, which was caused by the decrease of SDmax, whereas the decrease of SDmax was driven by the increase in snow accumulation season temperature (Ta). The TP showed significant elevation-dependent warming (EDW) (0.04 celcius decade-1 km-1) and elevation-dependent decrease of SDmax (0.12 cm decade-1 km-1) and SCD (4.1 d decade-1 km-1). The EDW explains the elevation-dependent decrease of SDmax (r = -0.72, P < 0.05) and SCD (r = -0.83, P < 0.05). It is expected that the negative feedback effect of SDmax and SCD on EDW may further exacerbate the EDW of the TP, and the earlier snowmelt due to the continuous decrease of snow depth may increase the frequency of droughts and floods. Our findings support the enhancement of EDW on the TP, depletion of solid reservoirs, and intensification of the regional water crisis in a warmer future.

Assessing the effects of climate change on urban watersheds: a review and call for future research	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS			English	Review						urban runoff quantity and quality; stormwater control measures; climate change; resiliency; watershed restoration	LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; LAND-USE CHANGE; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; CHANGE SCENARIOS; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; FLOOD RISK; QUALITY; URBANIZATION; RIVER; BIORETENTION	Considerable efforts have been made to control and manage the hydrology and water quality of watersheds impacted by urban development through the construction of stormwater control measures (SCMs). Climate change (CC) could, however, undermine these efforts by intensifying precipitation and hydrologic extremes. Although the impact of CC on water resources has been well-documented, its impact on urban hydrology remains less studied. CC may complicate sustainable urban hydrology, which can cause a reduction in the efficiency of SCMs with changes in precipitation patterns (Le., changes in duration, frequency, depth, and intensity). More intense precipitation may result in reduced runoff reduction and treatment efficiency, given that SCMs have a finite surface storage volume and surface infiltration capacity. Determining the functionality of various SCMs under future climate projections is important to better understand the impact of CC on urban stormwater and how well these practices can build resiliency into our urban environment. The purpose of this review is to provide the needs and opportunities for future research on quantifying the effect of CC on urban SCMs and to characterize the performance and effectiveness of these systems under existing and projected climate scenarios. A summary of the modeled constituents as well as the stormwater and climate models applied in these studies is provided. We concluded that there are still limitations in exploring the impact of future changes in meteorological variables that will influence the operation of SCMs in the long-term. Previous studies mostly focused on the impacts of CC on urban runoff quantity, and only a handful of studies have explored water quality impacts from CC, such as potential changes in water temperature, metals, and pathogens. Assessing the pollutant-removal efficiency of SCMs, such as bioretention, infiltration trenches, dry and wet swales, rooftop disconnections, and wet and dry ponds, which are common practices in urban watersheds, also needs more attention. Analysis of the cost of adapting SCMs for CC to maintain the same performance as current climate conditions is also recommended for future research.

Interactive effects of salinity and inundation on native <i>Spartina foliosa</i>, invasive <i>S</i>. <i>densiflora</i> and their hybrid from San Francisco Estuary, California	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						Abiotic stress; climate change; estuarine ecosystems; evolutionary biology; functional traits; halophytes; hybridization; invasiveness; plant invasion; salt marsh; sea level rise	PACIFIC COAST; SALT-MARSH; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; PLANT-RESPONSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORDGRASS; WATER; STRESS; POPULATIONS	Background and Aims Sea level rise (SLR) associated with climate change is intensifying permanent submersion and salinity in salt marshes. In this scenario, hybridization between native and invasive species may result in hybrids having greater tolerance of abiotic stress factors than their parents. Thus, understanding the responses of native and invasive halophytes and their hybrids to interacting physiological stresses imposed by SLR is key to native species conservation. We analysed how salinity, inundation depth and their interaction impact the functional traits of native and invasive cordgrass species and their hybrid (genus Spartina; Poaceae). Methods In a mesocosm experiment, we evaluated interactive stress effects of three inundation depths (4.5, 35.5 and 55 cm) and four aqueous salinities (0.5, 10, 20 and 40 ppt) on 27 functional traits of native Spartina foliosa, invasive S. densiflora and their hybrid S. densiflora x S. foliosa from San Francisco Estuary. Key Results The combined effect of salinity and inundation led to synergistic effects on leaf biochemical stress indicators. Spartina foliosa behaved as a stress-tolerant species, with high leaf sodium exudation rate and glycine betaine concentrations that also increased with stress. Spartina foliosa was less sensitive to salinity than S. densiflora and the hybrid but was highly growth-limited in response to increased inundation and salinity. Spartina densiflora was fast-growing in low-stress conditions and tolerated moderate interactive stresses. The hybrid produced more biomass, rhizome reserves and tillers than its parents, even under the most stressful conditions. Transgressivity improved the hybrid's capacity to deal with flooding stress more so than its response to increasing salinity. Conclusions Based on our observations, we predict that established populations of both native and invasive cordgrasses will experience reduced vegetative and sexual fitness in response to SLR. In particular, the combined effects of high salinity and deep inundation may decrease floret production in S. densiflora, a key trait for the spread of its invasive populations. In contrast, the hybrid likely will be able to sustain its invasiveness under SLR based on its ability to maintain growth and biomass production under stressful conditions.

The potential for coral reef restoration to mitigate coastal flooding as sea levels rise	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							WHITE-BAND DISEASE; ACROPORA-PALMATA; WESTERN ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ST-CROIX; MODEL; DYNAMICS; ISLAND; PREDICTIONS; POPULATION	The ability of reefs to protect coastlines from storm-driven flooding hinges on their capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise. Here, we show how and whether coral restoration could achieve the often-cited goal of reversing the impacts of coral-reef degradation to preserve this essential function. We combined coral-growth measurements and carbonate-budget assessments of reef-accretion potential at Buck Island Reef, U.S. Virgin Islands, with hydrodynamic modeling to quantify future coastal flooding under various coral-restoration, sea-level rise, and storm scenarios. Our results provide guidance on how restoration of Acropora palmata, if successful, could mitigate the most extreme impacts of coastal flooding by reversing projected trajectories of reef erosion and allowing reefs to keep pace with the similar to 0.5m of sea-level rise expected by 2100 with moderate carbon-emissions reductions. This highlights the potential long-term benefits of pursuing coral-reef restoration alongside climate-change mitigation to support the persistence of essential coral-reef ecosystem services.

Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of cloudbursts in many cities. As minor cloudburst events become more frequent and extreme events more severe, cities will need to rapidly transform their stormwater drainage and interdependent systems, and the knowledge systems that guide their infrastructure decisions and policy. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of knowledge systems to address these challenges, using three diverse cities (Phoenix, USA; Copenhagen, Denmark; and New York City, USA) as case studies. We found that partnerships between cities - even across national boundaries - can be a particularly important component of cloudburst knowledge systems. We also identified limitations in knowledge systems related to non-stationary climate, the vulnerability of private property and the representation of cloudburst infrastructure in integrated water management, which present opportunities for future research to support decision-making.

In this study, we assess changes in flood risk induced by a combination of climate change and flood prevention sets in the Baiyangdian (BYD) Lake area of China. Extreme storm events are analysed by the bias-corrected climate data from global climate models. A hydrological model is implemented and integrated with a hydrodynamic model to assess flood risk under three scenarios. The streamflow into the BYD was validated against historical flash-flood events. The results indicate that the changing climate increased extreme precipitation, upstream total inflow and the flood risk at the core region of Xiong'an New Area (XNA), the newly announced special economic zone in the BYD area.

The research highlights the severe flash-flood risk at BYD and demonstrates the urgent need for a climate-resilient plan for XNA.

Empowering Indigenous natural hazards management in northern Australia	AMBIO			English	Article						Climate change; Indigenous people; Natural disasters; Participatory action research; Risk management; Vulnerable communities	CLIMATE-CHANGE; REMOTE COMMUNITIES; RESILIENCE; DISASTERS; OPPORTUNITIES; RESPONSES; SERVICES; IMPACTS; FUTURES; PEOPLE	Northern Australia is prone to recurring severe natural hazards, especially frequent cyclones, flooding, and extensive wildfires. The region is sparsely populated (MUCH LESS-THAN 0.5 persons km(-2)), with Indigenous (Aboriginal) residents comprising 14% of the population, and typically the majority in remote regions. Despite national policy committed to addressing emergency management (EM) in vulnerable Indigenous communities, implementation remains unfunded. We synthesise participatory intercultural research conducted over seven years exploring core challenges, opportunities and potential solutions towards developing effective EM partnerships. Similar EM engagement and empowerment issues face First Nations and local communities in many international settings. In search of solutions, we explore developing effective partnership arrangements between EM agencies and culturally diverse Indigenous communities. Observing that government already provides substantial investment in cultural and natural resource management programmes conducted by over 150 Indigenous Ranger Groups (IRGs) nationally, we demonstrate that expansion of IRG roles to incorporate EM community engagement and service delivery can provide multiple cost-effective community and business development benefits for many remote communities.

Trade-offs in destination choices among the urban populations in three Southeast Asian countries	POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE			English	Article						adaptation; best&#8211; worst scaling; climate change; internal migration; labour mobility; location choice		Internal migration of the urban population is substantial with diverse drivers, barriers, and reasons for destination choices. Whereas internal mobility in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries is well-studied under the umbrella of residential, labour, amenity, and retirement migration, such research in non-OECD countries is rare and limited to the economic aspects of migration. In this study, we assess the relative importance of social, environmental, and amenity factors in urban peoples' destination choices within three countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) through an online survey. Concerns about safety and high living costs at potential destinations were among the most important factors in mobility decisions, whereas amenities were the least important. A high risk from climatic hazards, particularly from severe ones such as flooding and typhoons, was also an influential destination disincentive, particularly for people in Malaysia and the Philippines, that is, likely to grow in importance as climate change accelerates unabated. To maintain the attractiveness of highly exposed cities and regions to skilled people, urban planners must minimise these risks, for example, through crime control, flood disaster management, and early warning systems.

Management plans are often designed to prevent or slow flooding with short-term, defensive strategies such as shoreline hardening, beach nourishment, and living shorelines. By contrast, managed retreat focuses on avoiding hazards and adapting to changing shorelines by relocating out of harm's way. However, the term "managed retreat" can be controversial and has engendered heated debates, defensive protests, and steady resistance in some communities. Such responses have stymied inclusion of managed retreat in adaptation plans, and in some cases has resulted in complete abandonment of the policy review process. We examined the Local Coastal Program review process in seven California communities at imminent risk of sea-level rise and categorized each case as receptive or resistant to managed retreat. Three prominent themes distinguished the two groups: (1) inclusivity, timing, and consistency of communication, (2) property ownership, and (3) stakeholder reluctance to change. We examined use of terminology and communication strategies and provided recommendations to communicate "managed retreat" more effectively.

Detecting Climate Change Effects on Vb Cyclones in a 50-Member Single-Model Ensemble Using Machine Learning	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Vb-cyclones; Machine Learning; Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Single-Model Large Ensembles; Internal Variability; Floods	NORTH-AMERICA; CENTRAL-EUROPE; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; SCHEME	Vb cyclones are major drivers of extreme precipitation and floods in the study area of hydrological Bavaria (Germany). When assessing climate change impacts on Vb cyclones, internal variability of the climate system is an important underlying uncertainty. Here, we employ a 50-member single-model initial-condition large ensemble of a regional climate model to study climate variability and forced change on Vb cyclones. An artificial neural network detects cutoff lows over central Europe, which are associated with extreme precipitation Vb cyclones. Thus, machine learning filters the large ensemble prior to cyclone tracking. Our results show a striking change in Vb seasonality with a strong decrease of Vb cyclones in summer (-52%) and a large increase in spring (+73%) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. This change exceeds the noise of internal variability and leads to a peak shift from summer to spring. Additionally, we show significant increases in the daily precipitation intensity during Vb cyclones in all seasons.

Hydrological impacts of climate change on rice cultivated riparian wetlands in the Upper Meghna River Basin (Bangladesh and India)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						haor wetlands; Boro rice; floods; Bangladesh; climate change; SWAT	GLOBAL WATER-RESOURCES; LAND-USE CHANGES; FLOODPLAIN INUNDATION; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; DELTA WETLANDS; SEDIMENT YIELD; FUTURE; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; CONNECTIVITY	Riparian depressional wetlands (haors) in the Upper Meghna River Basin of Bangladesh are invaluable agricultural resources. They are completely flooded between June and November and planted with Boro rice when floodwater recedes in December. However, early harvest period (April/May) floods frequently damage ripening rice. A calibrated/validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool for riparian wetland (SWATrw) model is perturbed with bias free (using an improved quantile mapping approach) climate projections from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) for the period 2031-2050. Projected mean annual rainfall increases (200-500 mm or 7-10%). However, during the harvest period lower rainfall (21-75%) and higher evapotranspiration (1-8%) reduces river discharge (5-18%) and wetland inundation (inundation fraction declines of 0.005-0.14). Flooding risk for Boro rice consequently declines (rationalized flood risk reductions of 0.02-0.12). However, the loss of cultivable land (15.3%) to increases in permanent haor inundation represents a major threat to regional food security.

Storm surge shows the effects of rising sea levels. The recent super storms that hit the United States (e.g., Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Sandy in 2012, Harvey and Maria in 2017) and China (e.g., Typhoon Haiyan in 2010) inflicted serious loss of life and property. Water level rise (WLR) of local coastal areas is a combination of sea level rise, storm surge, precipitation, and local land subsidence. Quantitative assessments of the impact of WLR include scenario identification, consequence assessment, vulnerability and flooding assessment, and risk management using inventory of assets from coastal areas, particularly population centers, to manage flooding risk and to enhance infrastructure resilience of coastal cities. This article discusses the impact of WLR on urban infrastructures with case studies of Washington, DC, and Shanghai. Based on the flooding risk analysis under possible scenarios, the property loss for Washington, DC, was evaluated, and the impact on the metro system of Shanghai was examined.

The natural flows (floods, ephemeral flows) in arid hill regions result in potential hydrological fluctuations caused by climate change. However, the feasibility of eventual storage in remote hilly catchments would force a more sudden change. The current study was conducted in the lower part of the Khirthar National Range in the Sindh province of Pakistan, with the aim to explore spatial runoff storage sites for sustainable development to mitigate the impacts of climate change in arid areas. In total, 83 years of precipitation data were used to estimate water availability, along with satellite imagery for LULC pre- and post-monsoon conditions, delineation of watersheds, and identification of potential runoff storage locations and return periods, using Remote Sensing (RS)/Geographical Information System (GIS) 10.5.1, HEC-HMS 3.1, and Origin Pro 9.0 for statistical approaches. The model delineated two potential watersheds: Goth Sumar, covering an area of 61.0456 km(2), wherein ten cascading reservoirs were identified, and Goth Baro, covering an area of 14,236 km(2), wherein two cascading reservoirs were identified. Different storage capacities were determined for the cascade-type reservoirs. The maximum live volumetric potential storage of the reservoirs varies from 0.25 to 1.32 million cubic meters (MCM) in the villages of Baro and Sumar. The return periods have been estimated at 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 75 years, corresponding to 12.35, 16.47, 21.43, 21.72, 25.21, and 40.53 MCM for Goth Sumar, while Goth Baro's storage capacity has been estimated at 2.88, 3.84, 5.00, 5.06, 5.88, and 9.45 MCM, respectively. All results obtained were authenticated using accuracy assessment, validation, and sensitivity analysis. The proposed potential storage sites were recommended for a planning period of five years. The live storage capacity of the identified cascade reservoirs can be improved by raising the marginal banks and developing the spillways to control inlet and outlet flow in order to maintain internal pressure on the reservoir banks. The stored water can be used for climate-friendly agricultural activities to increase crop production and productivity. The proposed study area has extensive experience with flood irrigation systems and rainwater harvesting to sustain agriculture due to rainfall being the only water resource (WR) in the region. However, the study area has enormous potential for surface runoff WRs, especially during the rainy season (monsoon); the current 2022 monsoon is showing flooding. The modeling approaches of Remote Sensing, GIS, and HEC-HMS play an important role in delineating watershed areas, developing hydrographs, and simulating water availability for different return periods by minimizing cost and time.

Eco-hydrological models that integrate current understanding of the interacting processes governing soil water balance and plant growth may be useful tools to predict the impacts of climate change on crop production. However, the validation status of these models for making predictions under climate change is still unclear, since few suitable datasets are available for model testing. One promising approach is to test models using data obtained in "space-for-time" substitution experiments, in which samples are transferred among locations with contrasting current climates in order to mimic future climatic conditions. An important advantage of this approach is that the soil type is the same, so that differences in soil properties are not confounded with the influence of climate on water balance and crop growth. In this study, we evaluate the capability of a relatively simple eco-hydrological model to reproduce 6 years (2013-2018) of measurements of soil water contents, water balance components and grass production made in weighing lysimeters located at two sites within the TERENO-SoilCan network in Germany. Three lysimeters are located at an upland site at Rollesbroich with a cool, wet climate, while three others had been moved from Rollesbroich to a warmer and drier climate on the lower Rhine valley floodplain at Selhausen. Four of the most sensitive parameters in the model were treated as uncertain within the framework of the GLUE (generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation) methodology, while the remaining parameters in the model were set according to site measurements or data in the literature. The model satisfactorily reproduced the measurements at both sites, and some significant differences in the posterior ranges of the four uncertain parameters were found. In particular, the results indicated greater stomatal conductance as well an increase in dry-matter allocation below ground and a significantly larger maximum root depth for the three lysimeters that had been moved to Selhausen. As a consequence, the apparent water use efficiency (above-ground harvest divided by evapotranspiration) was significantly smaller at Selhausen than Rollesbroich. Data on species abundance on the lysimeters provide one possible explanation for the differences in the plant traits at the two sites derived from model calibration. These observations showed that the plant community at Selhausen had changed significantly in response to the drier climate, with a significant decrease in the abundance of herbs and an increase in the proportion of grass species. The differences in root depth and leaf conductance may also be a consequence of plasticity or acclimation at the species level. Regardless of the reason, we may conclude that such adaptations introduce significant additional uncertainties into model predictions of water balance and plant growth in response to climate change.

Conservation efforts have promoted the growth of populations of endangered species, and the ranges of several such species have expanded continuously. Understanding and predicting the effects of climate change on the nesting habitat ranges of endangered species can aid species recovery and habitat management. In this study, we used multi-scale data and geographic variables with a field survey of sites occurrence of Oriental Storks (Ciconia boyciana) to determine their nest selection patterns. We then simulated currently potential habitats and predicted spatio-temporal dynamics changes in their suitable nesting areas under future carbon emission scenarios in China. Our results show that Oriental Storks prefer nesting at low altitudes in flat areas near rivers. The Sanjiang Plain, the western part of Northeast China, Bohai Bay, and the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain were the areas with potentially suitable nesting areas for Oriental Storks. We predicted that the nesting ranges of Oriental Storks will expand under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs) in the future. However, under the most conservative (RCP2.6) and worst-case scenarios (RCP8.5), the rate of gain in suitable habitat will decrease, and the loss rate will increase. Change in the area of suitable nesting habitat varied among regions. The loss rate of suitable habitat in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain was predicted to decrease in the future, and the gain rate in the area of suitable habitat was predicted to be relatively stable and showed an increase. Some measures that could be taken to enhance the breeding habitat of Oriental Storks include identifying conservation gap areas and minimizing the loss rate of suitable habitat. Finally, scientific planning and management of potentially suitable habitats in protected areas and protected networks are needed to ensure the persistence of breeding Oriental Storks.

However, the terrain is inherently fragile with varied geological, geomorphological, ecological, and climate regimes, that result in frequent slope failure and disruption in connectivity. The risk is further to be increased by extreme events-generated hazards, which are expected to rise in frequency and magnitude with ongoing climate change. Critical scientific intervention, however, can improve the sustainability of road networks. The present study attempts to analyse and quantify the impacts of a major road widening project initiated in 2018 in the upper Ganga catchment, Uttarakhand Himalaya which has destabilised valley slopes along the widened segments. Also, a large quantity of excavated sediments is dumped down slopes, which is posing a threat to aquatic biodiversity. The estimates are based on Google Earth imagery of a few representative road segments recently widened in the upper Ganga catchment, which indicate a substantial increase in the landslide and unstable slope area following the road widening. The increase in unstable slope area is attributed to improper road widening approaches and poor slope management in seismically active Himalayan terrain. Further, the mean velocity plots of Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) indicate that the segments undergoing road widening are coherent with areas of significant earth surface change. A broad correlation between the road width and sediment yield indicates that even a slight increase in road width can result in a large-scale mass removal from the toe of the hillslope, inflicting cascading impact on hillslopes. The study recommends a more flexible road construction approach based on the environmental and geological aspects of the terrain for sustainable road networks. Further, the impact of climate change is looming over the Himalayas, and the relation between climate change and its potential effects on the stability of slopes remains an open issue.	[Sati, S.

J	Bogen, J				Bogen, Jim			Sediment sources and delivery of Norwegian mountain rivers in a changing climate	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						climate change adaption; erosion; repeated LIDAR; sediment budgets; sediment sources	EROSION; BUDGET; MANAGEMENT; YIELD; AIRBORNE; BEDLOAD	The projected climate change for Norway through the 21st century predicts that the temperature will increase significantly. Events with heavy rainfall will be more intense and occur more frequently. Rain floods will increase in magnitude and also occur more frequently. Extreme flooding and heavy rain will significantly impact the sediment dynamics in rivers. In the mountain areas, floods are often associated with erosion, transport and deposition of coarse sediment along the streams. These processes are related to bed load transport and pose a hazard in addition to the elevated water discharge and have to be included in management plans for river basins. This article studies the bed load delivery from sources that contribute the most to the sediment budget in the Gudbrandsdalslagen river basin during the large magnitude floods in 2011 and 2013. More than 100 debris slides and debris flow were triggered in the tributary river Veikleai by the heavy rain and snowmelt during these floods. The volume of the contribution from debris flows and erosion and deposition of the river bed was determined by subtracting digital elevation models acquired during repeated airborne LIDAR surveys. In the river Dorja the supply of sediment from a number of debris flows caused extensive aggradation and channel changes. In their new position, lateral erosion by these channels triggered slides on the adjacent slopes. The contributing volumes of debris flows, lateral erosion, and river bed erosion and deposition were determined from the LIDAR surveys. Relations obtained from studies of sediment transport in modern glacier rivers were used to obtain estimates of the ratio of bed load versus suspended load derived from the Pleistocene moraine deposits. Several monitoring stations using conventional methods for measuring bed load and suspended load recorded very large volumes of sediment delivery during both of the extreme floods. The results of the study may be used to identify necessary locations for check-dams and erosion protection works in order to adapt to climate change.

The nonstationary generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution has been utilised to model the marginal distribution functions of marine variables (wave characteristics and sea levels), within a 40-year moving window. All parameters of the GEV were tested for statistically significant linear and polynomial trends over time, and best-fitted trends have been detected. Different copula functions were fitted at the 40-year moving windows, to model the dependence structure of extreme offshore significant wave heights and peak spectral periods, and of wave-induced sea levels on the shoreline and nearshore sea levels due to storm surges. The most appropriate bivariate models were then selected. Statistically significant polynomial trends were detected in the dependence parameters of the selected copulas, and time-dependent most likely bivariate events were extracted to be used in the estimation of the TWL at the shoreline. The methods of the present work were implemented in three selected Greek coastal areas in the Aegean Sea. The analysis revealed different variations in the most likely estimates of the offshore wave characteristics and nearshore storm surges in the three study areas, as well as in the time-dependent estimates of TWL at the shoreline. The approach combines nonstationarity and bivariate analysis, blends coastal and offshore marine features and finally provides non-trivial alterations in the response of coastal sea level dynamics to climate change signals, compared to former work on the subject. The methodology produces reasonable estimates of design quantities for coastal structures and boundary conditions for the assessment of flood hazard and risk in coastal areas.

Winter conditions affect growth of birch seedlings during the following growing season	TREE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Betula pubescens; boreal soil; carbohydrates; climate change; root growth; snow anomalies	SOIL-TEMPERATURE; CARBOHYDRATE ALLOCATION; BETULA-PENDULA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AFFECTED ROOT; FROZEN SOIL; COVER; PHYSIOLOGY; BOREAL; IMPACT	Air temperatures and precipitation are predicted to increase in the future, especially at high latitudes and particularly so during winter. In contrast to air temperatures, changes in soil temperatures are more difficult to predict, as the fate of the insulating snow cover is crucial in this respect. Soil conditions can also be affected by rain-on-snow events and warm spells during winter, resulting in freeze-thaw cycles, compacted snow, ice encasement and local flooding. These adverse conditions during winter could counteract the otherwise positive effects of climate change on forest growth and productivity. For studying the effects of different winter and snow conditions on young Downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) seedlings, we carried out a laboratory experiment with birch seedlings subjected to four different winter scenarios: snow covering the seedlings (SNOW), compressed snow and ice encasement (ICE), flooded and frozen soil (FLOOD) and no snow at all (NO SNOW). After the winter treatments we simulated a spring and early summer period of 9.5 weeks, and monitored the growth by measuring shoot and root biomass of the seedlings, and starch and soluble sugar concentrations. We also assessed the stress experienced by the seedlings by measuring leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange. Although no difference in mortality was observed between the treatments, the seedlings in the SNOW and ICE treatments had significantly higher shoot and root biomass compared with those in the FLOOD and NO SNOW treatments. We found higher starch concentrations in roots of the seedlings in the SNOW and ICE treatments, compared with those in the FLOOD and NO SNOW treatments, although photosynthesis did not differ. Our results suggest a malfunction of carbohydrate distribution in the seedlings of the FLOOD and NO SNOW treatments, probably resulting from decreased sinks. The results underline the importance of an insulating and protecting snow cover for small tree seedlings, and that future winters with changed snow pattern might affect the growth of tree seedlings and thus possibly species composition and forest productivity.

Traditionally, flood risk management has relied on building protective structures such as levees and dams to protect assets based on historical data (e.g., 1% AEP flood), which encourages development on floodplains, provides a potentially false sense of security to communities, particularly in the context of climate change, and increases residual flood risk (the risk remaining after implementing risk reduction measures). This article aims to contribute to the management of residual risk by drawing on empirical findings from a survey carried out with flood risk practitioners from the public and private sector in Aotearoa New Zealand. Findings indicate fundamental concerns relating to how to best manage residual flood risk, despite its long profile and integration in current policy and practice. Other issues revolve around the use of outdated information to guide decisions and the lack of regulatory power to restrict developments in flood-prone areas protected by hard defense structures. Identified barriers to improving current practice include the lack of national guidance and support, financial resources, public awareness, and some technical constraints such as uncertainties in flood modeling, staff expertise, and data availability.

The Kemi River basin acts as an empirical setting to study the environmental change and the capacity of the management system to respond to it. Hydropower and reservoir development has been a source of a decade-long environmental conflict in the river basin. This study aims to find out how governance structures are adapting to the environmental change brought on by climate change. The study is based on case study research, and it combines long-term monitoring data, semi-structured interviews conducted in December 2020 and January 2021, and Finnish administrative court rulings. The results reveal that the water governance in the Kemi River basin is based on a technology driven aquatic regime, which has been a source of persistent environmental conflict between technology and nature. The flood-risk management is based on adaptive planning cycles and is implemented in a participatory manner, although it is strengthening the conflict in the area, as some stakeholders suggests reservoirs as a solution, which neglects the potential of integrative river basin management.

Discharge and floods projected to increase more than precipitation extremes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						climate change; convection-permitting climate model; discharge; floods; non-linearity; precipitation; rain-on-snow; soil moisture	HEAVY PRECIPITATION; FREQUENCY; SYSTEM; VOLUME	Floods claim a high toll in fatalities and economic impacts. Despite their societal relevance, there is much more to learn about the projected changes in discharge and flooding. Here we force an operational hydrologic model over the state of Iowa with high-resolution convection-permitting climate-model precipitation to evaluate the response of 140 watersheds to climate change. At the end of the century, under the most aggressive scenario in terms of fossil fuel use, we show that the transition from snow to rainfall and approximately 30% increase in extreme precipitation rates lead to a doubling of maximum discharge during the spring and extending the flood season into the fall. Total discharge volumes are also expected to increase. Our results suggest that flood projections based on extreme precipitation increases alone substantially underestimate future risk due to the non-linearity of the hydrologic response explained by long-term soil moisture memory and its feedbacks with precipitation. This study is one of the first to show floods are increasing due to the prevalence of rain-on-snow events, and indeed that discharge might increase more than precipitation.

J	Sandink, D; Robinson, B				Sandink, Dan; Robinson, Barbara			Wastewater System Inflow/Infiltration and Residential Pluvial Flood Damage Mitigation in Canada	WATER			English	Review						extreme rain; pluvial flood; basement flood; wastewater; inflow and infiltration; Canada	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISASTER PREPAREDNESS; RISK PERCEPTIONS; INFILTRATION; INFLOW; EARTHQUAKE; IMPACTS; ADOPTION; INTERVENTION; URBANIZATION	Pluvial flooding in urban areas is one of the most significant drivers of disaster loss in Canada. Damages during pluvial flood events are associated with overwhelmed urban drainage (stormwater and wastewater) systems. During the period from 2013 to 2021, Canadian property and casualty insurers reported approximately CAD 2 billion in personal property (residential) pluvial sewer backup claims during flood catastrophes. There has been growing interest in managing pluvial urban flood risk, notably through newly funded national programs focused on climate change adaptation. These programs have included the development of new guidelines and standards focused on managing the underlying factors contributing to urban and basement flooding. Inflow and infiltration (I/I) has received limited attention in the pluvial flood literature, however. Informed by significant engagement with practitioners in Canada, this paper provides a review of the issue of I/I into wastewater systems and its relation to pluvial flooding. The paper will address concerns related to private property engagement in I/I and urban pluvial flood reduction programs. Both improved technical standards and administrative support are needed to ensure that wastewater infrastructure is less susceptible to I/I over its lifecycle.

They are also generally regarded as an important indicator of human-induced climate change. Even the cause of a global climate change is regarded due to the increase in temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. This in turn also affects the Indian rainfall. Furthermore, it negatively influences the Indian climate, by increasing floods, hurricanes, and storms. So, analyzing the variation in global temperature change has become an integral part to further study the Indian rainfall variation. According to Sir Gilbert Walker, the Indian rainfall (summer monsoon) is a global phenomenon. There are many factors like jet streams, Tibetan Plateau, El Nino, Indian Ocean Dipole, monsoon trough, cyclonic storms, and mid troposphere cyclones which influence the monsoon. Despite an increase in temperature, the monsoon rainfall has shown a decreasing trend. Even, in recent years, extreme rain events (flood, drought) have increased. Thus, to enhance the Indian rainfall variation (especially monsoon rain), it is important to explore the global atmospheric changes and observe its relationship with the Indian rainfall.

This study conducted a Budyko-based framework for quantifying the impacts of aridity index and other factors on annual runoff in 355 catchments in the United States. The aridity index is the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation, representing the dry conditions in Budyko framework. Other factors are the influence of everything else except the aridity index, and are represented by the parameter w in Budyko-type equations, which is a time-dependent variable in this case. Then, the impacts of aridity index and other factors were decomposed based on the annual variations in the Budyko spaces. The results show the current Budyko-type equations, which use time-varying parameters, can improve the fitting capability for most catchments in the United States. Aridity index is the main driver causing the increasing trend of runoff in the US. Other factors, on the other hand, are the main reasons for the decreasing trend of runoff in the US.

To achieve this goal, the grain-size analysis and morphoscopic description helped to detect cyclic facie sequences with sediments sized over 200 mu m mixed with silt, bioclasts and organic matter. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses displayed over 90% of quartz and isolated mica, feldspar and heavy minerals. Additionally, the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results display the interplay between terrigenous (>Ti and Al) and marine influence (S, Cl and similar to Ca) over the last similar to 3,500 cal. yrs. BP. The geochemical tracer fluctuations detected suggest five distinct deposits including beach, washover, lacustrine system, aeolian deflation that rest on top of the Pleistocene palaeodunes, which are tentatively associated with the sea-level variations, extreme marine events or with local floods. Although the multiproxy data record refers to a study in Bilene-Mozambique, it is interesting to understand the mechanisms and variables related to the evolutionary dynamics of coastal barrier lagoons generated by sea-level fluctuations and climate change, especially in the SE Africa.

Community perceptions of flood risks and their attributes: A case study of rural communities of Khipro, District Sanghar, Pakistan	URBAN CLIMATE			English	Article						Community perception; Awareness; Concerns; Preparedness; Flood risk	HAZARD; REGION; COMMUNICATION; VULNERABILITY; EXPERIENCE	Globally, the frequency, regularity, and severity of floods are all increasing due to climate change, and climate change's effects on developing nations are significant. In 2022, the worst floods in Pakistan's recorded history occurred. One-fifth of the nation experienced significant destruction, which led to significant economic losses and fatalities. However, the resilience of the local population to withstand the effects of calamities has not received enough attention in rural villages along the Indus River. This descriptive cross-sectional research examined how three communities in high-risk locations in Khipro, Sanghar District, Sindh, Pakistan, perceived and responded to flood dangers based on their past experiences. A survey was conducted with a total of 50 individuals in three villages. To measure flood risk perception, three variables-awareness of floods, concerns about floods, and preparedness-were used. Descriptive statistics, the chisquare test, and Pearson's correlation were applied to find correlations and differences across variables. The study adds valuable knowledge about how people perceive the risk of flooding and how factors like age, education, differences in monthly income levels, low-risk awareness, and preparedness influence that perception in rural areas. This study's findings can be used to evaluate flood risks and adopt local adaptation strategies in flood prone areas.

Remote sensing technology can provide practical help for urban flood disaster management. This research presents a review of urban flood-related remote sensing to identify research trends and gaps, and reveal new research opportunities. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the systematic literature search resulted in 347 documents classified as geography, disaster management application, and remote sensing data utilization. The main results include 1. most of the studies are located in high-income countries and territories and inland areas; 2. remote sensing for observing the environment was more popular than observing the building; 3. the most often applied disaster management activities were vulnerability assessment and risk modeling (mitigation) and rapid damage assessment (response); 4. DEM is often applied to simulate urban floods as software inputs. We suggest that future research directions include 1. coastal urban study areas in non-high-income countries/territories to help vulnerable populations; 2. understudied disaster management activities, which often need to observe the buildings in more urban areas; 3. data standardization will facilitate integration with international standard methods for assessing urban floods.

Anticipating the consequences resulting from such glacier changes is key to design and implement adequate mitigation measures. Here, we focus on the future evolution of potential ice-dammed and supraglacial lakes in High Mountain Asia, as such lakes are responsible for the majority of glacier lake outburst floods in the region. We identify 11,129 potential lakes at present, with a total maximum volume of 2070 million m(3). We find a strong correlation between large modelled lakes and historical outburst floods. By accounting for the evolution of glaciers under different climate change mitigation measures, we project that the number of potential ice-dammed lakes could increase by between 15 and 18% until 2080, with a concomitant 45-55% increase in their volume. Our findings thus suggest that a temporary increase of glacier lake outburst floods is to be expected in the coming decades. More than 10,000 locations in High-Mountain Asia are identified as likely to host ice-dammed lakes, responsible for most of the glacier outburst floods in High-Mountain Asia, using a combination of a digital elevation model and a glacier model.

Ensemble Climate and Streamflow Projections for the Assiniboine River Basin, Canada	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						ensemble modeling; land surface hydrological model; climate change; extreme runoff change	LAND-SURFACE SCHEME; MODEL; WATER; GCMS	The Assiniboine River Basin (ARB) is subject to an exceptionally variable precipitation regime of the Canadian Prairies, ranging between record droughts and unprecedented flooding in just the past decade. To assess the impact of a changing climate on hydroclimate variability in the ARB, we used the bias-corrected simulations from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) to drive MESH model for two 60-year periods, a historical baseline (1951-2010) and future projection (2041-2100), under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 to simulate ARB flows at eight hydrometric stations. The precipitation is projected to increase in every season (similar to-10-38%) except for summer (similar to-1--5%). Minimum winter and maximum summer temperatures have the largest seasonal trends, increasing by 2-3 degrees C in the near future (2021-2050) and 5-6 degrees C in the far future (2051-2080). These climate changes produce higher winter river flows while peak runoff shifts by several weeks to earlier in the year. There is a shift in the magnitude and timing of extreme water levels. The ensemble of climate projections from a single model and one RCP to the variability and uncertainty in the future hydrology supports adaptation planning in the industrial sectors of Saskatchewan's economy.

J	Blondin, S				Blondin, Suzy			Let's hit the road! Environmental hazards, materialities, and mobility justice: insights from Tajikistan's Pamirs	JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES			English	Article						Material mobilities; climate mobilities; infrastructure; mobility justice; Tajikistan	CLIMATE MIGRATION; ADAPTATION; IMMOBILITY; DISASTER; IMPACT; GOJAL	This article draws from the expanding field of climate mobilities, which explores the nexus between climate change, environmental conditions and (im)mobility based on the 'mobilities paradigm'. Environmental hazards collide with transportation infrastructures, for instance through the adverse effects of floods, heat waves, and ice thawing on roads, and may for instance disrupt or hamper everyday mobility. Frequent disaster-induced mobility impairments may render individuals unable to commute between places and decrease their socioeconomic opportunities. Emphasising the material aspects of mobilities, this paper argues that an analysis of mobility systems helps to develop a deeper understanding of (im)mobility inequalities and injustices in the context of environmental risk and climate change. Sheller's mobility justice perspective is taken as a way to critically address mobility disruptions and to reflect on the interconnection of different (im)mobility patterns. Empirically, the paper draws on a case-study of Tajikistan's Bartang Valley, where disaster-induced mobility impairments reduce the residents' capacities to circulate and access food markets, healthcare facilities, and job opportunities. Overall, the paper is an invitation for the fields of environmental and climate mobilities to consider the impacts of environmental conditions on infrastructures, matter, and things that enable or hamper human (im)mobility.

Renaturation processes in the Baltic Sea include removal of coastal protection measures thereby facilitating exchange processes between peatland and Baltic Sea water masses with inhabiting aquatic organisms, which suddenly face new environmental conditions. In this study, two Baltic Sea and three peatland benthic diatom strains were investigated for their ecophysiological response patterns as a function of numerous growth media, light, and temperature conditions. Results clearly showed growth stimulation for all five diatom strains when cultivated in peatland water-based media, with growth dependency on salinity for the Baltic Sea diatom isolates. Nutrient availability in the peatland water resulted in higher growth rates, and growth was further stimulated by the carbon-rich peatland water probably facilitating heterotrophic growth in Melosira nummuloides and two Planothidium sp. isolates. Photosynthesis parameters for all five diatom strains indicated low light requirements with light saturated photosynthesis at <70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) in combination with only minor photoinhibition as well as eurythermal traits with slightly higher temperature width for the peatland strains. Growth media composition did not affect photosynthetic rates.

In this study, statistical downscaling using established machine learning techniques is compared with the proposed extreme gradient boosting decision tree (EXGBDT) technique. The Cauvery river basin in southern peninsular India, which is known for its frequent droughts and floods, was considered in this study. The ACCESS 1.0 CMIP5 historical GCM simulation was used for downscaling the local climate with the help of daily observation data from 35 stations located in the study zone. An intercomparison of model performance in predicting daily weather variables such as precipitation and average, maximum, and minimum temperatures over the upper, middle, and lower Cauvery river basin was performed. The findings show that mean-variance is around 15 % and bias is negligible for the proposed EXGBDT model, which is better than other models under consideration. The NSE and R-2 values range from 0.75-0.85 for both training and testing periods. The intercomparison of monthly mean values of observed and downscaled data for different sub-basins and parameters suggests higher model efficiency. The lower variance observed in the comparison of CLIMDEX indices suggests that the EXGBDT model performance is better in representing the local climatic condition.

Assessing the effectiveness in managing stormwater is crucial to maintain urban resilience to flooding risk. A method based on a stormwater management model (SWMM) was developed for assessing the control of stormwater runoff volume and the percentage removal of suspended solids by implementing a Sponge City strategy. An interdisciplinary approach was adopted incorporating Low Impact Development (LID) with urban green infrastructure and grey infrastructure paradigms in a typical old residential community in Suzhou, China. Sponge facilities for reducing stormwater runoff included bio-retention cells, permeable pavements, grassed pitches, and stormwater gardens. The simulation results of SWMM show that the stormwater pipe system can meet the management standard for storms with a five-year recurrence interval. The volume capture ratio of annual runoff was 91%, which is higher than control target of 80%. The suspended solids reduction rate was 56%, which meets the requirement of planning indicators. Thus, the proposed method of spongy facilities can be used for renovation planning in old residential areas in China. Implementing spongy facilities with a LID strategy for stormwater management can significantly enhance urban water resilience and improve ecosystem services.

We strived to understand here the patterns and drivers of social vulnerability to natural hazards in Namibia, which is the most arid sub-Saharan country with large social inequalities. We used a total of 12 indicators that characterized social, economic and demographic settings of the 14 districts in the country. Further, we evaluated the countrywide pattern of most relevant natural hazards, including wildfires, floods and drought. We identified the main factors driving social vulnerability in the districts, and we evaluated how the socio-economic fitness of populations coincided with the distribution of high-hazard areas. We found that populations with the poorest socio-economic performance were mostly distributed in the country's northern districts, which are also exposed to the highest frequency and severity of natural hazards, particularly to floods and wildfires. This coincidence of highly sensitive populations with high exposure to hazards renders these populations particularly vulnerable. That the frequency of natural hazards increases with climate change, and implementation of programs enhancing the social resilience is insufficient, underscores the urgency of actions targeted at the priority areas identified herein.

J	Zuccaro, G; Leone, MF				Zuccaro, Giulio; Leone, Mattia Federico			Climate Services to Support Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas: The CLARITY Project and the Napoli Case Study	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						H2020 CLARITY; urban climate adaptation; municipality of Naples; multiscale planning; climate hazard; impact modeling	MEAN RADIANT TEMPERATURE	Climate services are emerging worldwide as an essential tool to bridge the advancement in climate science and meteo/earth observations with a variety of operational fields in the domains of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA). It is multidisciplinary study area with promising applications in the field of urban microclimate simulations, supporting climate-resilient redevelopment actions at both the city and neighborhood levels. The CLARITY CSIS (Climate Services Information System, available at ), developed within the H2020 CLARITY project, is an innovative hazard/impact modeling tool that takes into account short- to long-term climate change scenarios and urban microclimate variability. Disaster risks associated with climate change, such as heat waves and floods, are concentrated in limited periods of the year and therefore not adequately represented by annually averaged values. To this aim, new datasets have been extracted from Regional Climate Models to estimate the frequency of extreme temperatures and precipitation events until 2100, and a novel modeling methodology has been developed to capture the effect on the urban microclimate due to specific built environment features. The wide amount of data generated by satellite earth observations and made available at pan-European level through the Copernicus datasets (e.g., Urban Atlas, European Settlement Map, etc.) has been processed through specific algorithms and GIS spatial analysis tools to extract detailed information related to key parameters linked to urban morphology and surface types. In addition to the "screening service" available at the pan-European level through the CLARITY CSIS, an "expert service" workflow allows increasing the resolution of hazard and impact simulations at 250 m, by exploiting detailed land use datasets provided by local end-users and assessing the DRR/CCA potential of city-wide adaptation plans, as well as of specific district redevelopment projects. This paper will present the features of CLARITY CSIS and the results of Expert Services implemented for the City of Naples, focusing on the methods adopted to implement hazard/impact assessments and how information from climate services is tailored to support the integration of different DRR/CCA strategies within urban plans and projects.

Flooding-induced mortality of loggerhead sea turtle eggs	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; conservation management; marine turtle eggs; sea-level rise	MOVEMENT-INDUCED MORTALITY; CARETTA-CARETTA; CHELONIA-MYDAS; GAS-EXCHANGE; SAND CHARACTERISTICS; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; MARINE TURTLES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; HATCHLINGS	Context. Marine turtle eggs incubate in dynamic beaches, where they are vulnerable to both saltwater and freshwater flooding. Understanding the capacity for marine turtle eggs to tolerate flooding will aid management efforts to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise and increases in coastal flooding. Aims. Evaluate the interactive effects of flooding duration and incubation stage on the hatching success of loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) eggs. Methods. Groups of 20 eggs from multiple clutches were incubated in plastic containers in a beach hatchery. Eggs at six stages of incubation (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 weeks post-oviposition) were excavated from the hatchery and exposed to saltwater or freshwater flooding for seven durations of time (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 24 or 48 h). Containers of eggs were either submerged in a bucket of water or left outside of the bucket (control; no flooding) for their designated duration, allowed to drain, then reburied in the hatchery. Following hatchling emergence, the hatching success of each group of eggs was evaluated. Key results. Freshly laid eggs and eggs on the verge of hatching exposed to any flooding and all eggs exposed to extended periods of flooding (24 and 48 h) suffered complete mortality. Eggs at 20-80% development exposed to short periods of flooding (1-6 h) maintained high hatching success that was statistically equivalent to control eggs, while eggs at <20% and >80% development exhibited significant decreases in hatching success. Conclusions. Marine turtle eggs in the middle of incubation can tolerate saltwater and freshwater flooding for up to 6 h. Outside of this period or when flooding is longer, disruption of gas concentrations and osmotic gradients in the egg chamber can lead to embryonic mortality. These findings have reinforced concerns regarding the capacity for marine turtle populations to continue to function as rising sea levels and increases in coastal flooding alter the hydrology of nesting beaches. Implications. As current and predicted climate change threatens the suitability of the incubation environment used by marine turtles, corrective actions to maximise hatching success need to be taken before the eggs are flooded.

Rationale and methods for a cross-sectional study of mental health and wellbeing following river flooding in rural Australia, using a community-academic partnership approach	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Floods; Disaster management; Mental health; Vulnerable populations; Climate change	NATURAL DISASTERS; IMPACTS; RISK; VULNERABILITY; ANXIETY; TRAUMA	Background Climate change is associated with greater frequency, duration, intensity and unpredictability of certain weather-related events, including floods. Floods harm mental health. There is limited understanding of the mental health and well-being effects from river flooding, particularly over the longer term and in rural contexts. This paper describes the rationale, aims, objectives, study design and socio-demographic characteristics of the sample for a study measuring associations between flood experience and mental health and wellbeing of residents (particularly those most likely to be negatively impacted and hard to reach) in rural NSW Australia 6 months following a devastating flood in 2017. To our knowledge, the study is the first of its kind within Australia in a rural community and is an important initiative given the likelihood of an increasing frequency of severe flooding in Australia given climate change. Methods A conceptual framework (The Flood Impact Framework) drawing on social ecological approaches was developed by the research team. It was based on the literature and feedback from the community. The Framework describes putative relationships between flood exposure and mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Within a community-academic partnership approach, a cross-sectional survey was then undertaken to quantify and further explore these relationships. Results The cross-sectional survey was conducted online (including on mobile phone) and on paper between September and November 2017 and recruited 2530 respondents. Of those, 2180 provided complete demographic data, among whom 69% were women, 91% were aged 25-74, 4% identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, 9% were farmers and 33% were business owners. Conclusions The study recruited a wide range of respondents and the partnership facilitated the community's engagement with the design and implementation of the study. The study will provide a basis for a follow-up study, that will aim to improve the understanding of mental health and wellbeing effects over the longer term. It will provide an important and original contribution to understanding river flooding and mental health in rural Australia, a topic that will grow in importance in the context of human-induced climate change, and identify critical opportunities to strengthen services, emergency planning and resilience to future flooding.

However, this assumption is challenged by climate change and urbanization. Many studies tried to update IDF using time covariate which lacks physical significance. More importantly, the stationary (ST) design method is not applicable for nonstationary (NS) design where the distributions of extreme precipitation change over time. For the annual maximum precipitation (AMP) in Beijing, we utilized local factors (urbanization and temperature) and global factors (ENSO and EASM etc.) to develop NS models, with the average annual reliability method first employed to update the IDF curves. Short-duration (shorter than 6-h) AMP of most stations show upward trends, whereas the AMP with longer durations exhibits downward trends. The NS modeling reveals that the 18-h AMPs is mainly affected by global processes (ENSO and EASM). The predictive accuracy of the optimal NS model outperforms ST model by a remarkable 219% during the validation period. In addition, the ST design rainfall tends to overestimate rainfall for durations longer than 12-h. Interestingly, the gap between NS and ST design uncertainties diminishes as duration/return period expands. The above findings provide new insights about impacts of local and global physical processes on the variation of extreme rainfall.

Factors influencing flood damage mitigation among micro and small businesses in Kampala, Uganda	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION			English	Article						Flood damage mitigation; Influencing factors; Protection motivation theory (PMT); Kampala	RISK; PREPAREDNESS; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTION; EMOTIONS; BEHAVIOR	With the trends of increasing flood risk due to climate change and rapid urbanisation in many parts of the world, property level mitigation efforts have become more relevant in flood risk man-agement. However, the flood mitigation behaviour of business owners is an understudied aspect of risk reduction. This article employs the Protection Motivation Theory framework to identify critical factors that determine the flood damage mitigation behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises in three neighbourhoods of Kampala, Uganda. We conducted a sample sur-vey of micro to medium-sized business owners in two informal areas and one formal area in Kam-pala. Our analysis established that businesses of all sizes adopted structural measures and that micro-enterprises (0-4 employees) were more likely to implement non-structural measures than small businesses. Financial losses, risk aversion, and perceptions of flood likelihood all showed positive relationships with flood damage mitigation actions. Many businesses indicated that relo-cation is an inefficient and costly measure, though one that is easily self-implementable. Informa-tion-seeking behaviour and receiving flood-related information stimulated businesses to mitigate, though few businesses have regular access to helpful information regarding flood mitigation mea-sures, especially concerning non-structural measures. These insights provide a basis for crafting business resilience-building policy and strategies considering increasing climate change-induced flash-flood risk in Kampala and other similar contexts.

This paper aims to explore public perceptions on flood and extreme weather warnings as well as factors that influence these perceptions in Greece, a characteristic example of a country that has suffered several climate-related disasters in the recent past. To this end, a survey of 427 residents of the country was conducted between April 2021 and June 2021. The collected data were analyzed by using both descriptive and inductive statistics. The results showed that certain factors affect participants' views on early warnings, including demographics, perceived knowledge on floods, flood risk perception, and perceived self-efficacy. The above factors present statistically significant correlations with the perceived reliability and effectiveness of warnings, as well the degree to which participants perceived the expected phenomena as a threat to their well-being or a signal to take preventive actions. These correlations are described in detail in the present study, together with certain exceptions that exist. The findings are a strong indication that public perception has the potential to impact early warning systems' actual effectiveness, leading to certain practical implications for their improvement, particularly in multi-hazard, climate change-sensitive areas like the Mediterranean region.

In this study, a multivariate nonstationary hazard assessment of annual extreme rainfall events, extracted from daily precipitation data observed at eight meteorological stations in Haihe River basin, China, was done in three phases: (1) Several statistical tests, such as nonparametric trend tests, log likelihood ratio (LR) tests and Change-point (CP) tests were applied to both the marginal distributions and the dependence structures to decipher different forms of nonstationarity; (2) estimation of the time-varying parameter for the marginal and joint probability distributions by maximum likelihood method; and (3) calculation of hydrologic design quantiles at different average annual reliability levels (ARR) during a certain design life period in terms of hazard assessment. According to the results, the attributes and their dependence structure belonging to several stations show nonstationarity because of existed trend in model parameter or change point. In the process of hazard assessment, the nonstationarity of dependence structure would produce less impact on ARR-based designed quantile estimation than the nonstationarity of marginal distribution on the one hand. On the other hand, it would add more uncertainty of quantile estimation for hydrologic design.

Life cycle greenhouse gas benefits or burdens of residual biomass from landscape management	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change mitigation; Bioenergy; Biomaterial; Biomass residues; Riparian vegetation; Floodplain management	BIOENERGY PRODUCTION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; OPTIMIZATION; EMISSIONS; BALANCE; ENERGY; TIMES; FLOW	The use of residual biomass for the production of bioenergy and biomaterials is often suggested as a strategy to avoid negative effects associated with dedicated biomass production. One potential source is biomass from landscape management The goal of this study was to find the lowest net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of various applications of residual biomass from landscape management. GHG balances of thirteen residual biomass applications were calculated and compared to their respective conventional counterfactuals. As a case study, the potential contribution to climate change mitigation through the use of residual biomass available from vegetation management in floodplains of the Dutch Rhine delta were quantified. The greatest GHG benefits are achieved when using woody biomass to produce heat (-132 kg CO2-eq./tonne wet biomass) and grassy biomass to produce growth media (-229 kg CO2-eq./tonne wet biomass). In contrast, composting grassy biomass for fertiliser replacement on agricultural fields results in the largest GHG burdens of 62 kg CO2-eq./tonne wet biomass. The findings imply that residual biomass from landscape management can contribute to both GHG benefits and burdens, depending on the application. Higher benefits were found for bioenergy than for biomaterial applications. Biomass applications should be chosen with care and consideration of their counterfactuals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The Invisible Flood: The Chemistry, Ecology, and Social Implications of Coastal Saltwater Intrusion	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; land use management; salinization; saltwater intrusion; sea-level rise	SEA-LEVEL RISE; SALT-WATER-INTRUSION; ATLANTIC COAST; SALINITY; FOREST; MARSH; WETLAND; SALINIZATION; MANAGEMENT; DROUGHT	Saltwater intrusion is the leading edge of sea-level rise, preceding tidal inundation, but leaving its salty signature far inland. With climate change, saltwater is shifting landward into regions that previously have not experienced or adapted to salinity, leading to novel transitions in biogeochemistry, ecology, and human land uses. We explore these changes and their implications for climate adaptation in coastal ecosystems. Biogeochemical changes, including increases in ionic strength, sulfidation, and alkalinization, have cascading ecological consequences such as upland forest retreat, conversion of freshwater wetlands, nutrient mobilization, and declines in agricultural productivity. We explore the trade-offs among land management decisions in response to these changes and how public policy should shape socioecological transitions in the coastal zone. Understanding transitions resulting from saltwater intrusion-and how to manage them-is vital for promoting coastal resilience.

The main purpose of this paper is to apply the classical probable maximum precipitation and probable maximum flood methodologies leading to a new concept of risk level charts, which provide hydrograph time to peak probable maximum discharge after the beginning of precipitation, base time and peak discharge values. Dimensionless hydrograph methodology is employed for flood hydrograph analysis. The applications of probable maximum precipitation and probable maximum flood methodologies are presented for Algerian meteorology stations' annual maximum daily precipitation amounts from 23 different locations at Hodna drainage basin in the north-eastern of Algeria. Classical probable maximum precipitation frequency factor is obtained for each meteorology station record, which are then converted to pointwise probable maximum flood amounts that are helpful to construct practically applicable flood charts. A new relationship is provided between probable maximum precipitation and the frequency factor for the study area. The efficiency factor is calculated for each station to understand whether there is a further possibility for extreme precipitation, and consequent flood occurrences.

How Land Use, Climate Change, and an Ageing Demographic Intersect to Create New Vulnerabilities in Hong Kong	LAND			English	Article						vulnerability; extreme weather; climate change; resilience; ageing	RESILIENCE; LESSONS	As extreme weather events seemingly increase in frequency and magnitude, we are accumulating evidence about how the intersection of circumstances creates vulnerability. The specter of elderly residents in Brooklyn, New York, trapped in their apartments for days due to flooding from the storm surge brought by Hurricane Sandy, provides us a troubling lesson. As vulnerability emerges from the confluence of multiple factors, changing social, natural, and other factors combine to create unimagined problems. Hong Kong is a case in point. The city has seen much of its new development occurring on reclaimed coastal land. At the same time, there has been a significant demographic shift as the city's elderly population has been its fastest growing demographic. The social transition also means more elderly persons living alone. All of these produce conditions that render the population increasingly vulnerable to coastal flooding. Yet, there is not enough systematic effort, in major cities, at identifying these vulnerabilities. Hong Kong is emblematic of coastal cities the world over, in that it has yet to come to a full realization of such emerging risks. Future research must be able to analyze intersectionalities.

Earlier studies show that extreme hourly precipitation increases with daily mean temperature, consistent with the CC relation. Recent studies at specific locations found that for temperatures higher than around 12 degrees C, hourly precipitation extremes scale at rates higher than the CC scaling, a phenomenon that is often referred to as "super-CC scaling." These scalings are typically estimated by collecting rainfall data in temperature bins, followed by a linear fit or a visual inspection of the precipitation quantiles in each bin. In this study, a piecewise linear quantile regression model is presented for a more flexible, and robust estimation of the scaling parameters, and their associated uncertainties. Moreover, we use associated information criteria to prove statistically whether or not a pronounced super-CC scaling exists. The techniques were tested on stochastically simulated data and, when applied to hourly station data across Western Europe and Scandinavia, revealed large uncertainties in the scaling rates. Finally, goodness-of-fit measures indicated that the dew point temperature is a better scaling predictor than temperature.

J	Gharakhanlou, NM; Perez, L				Gharakhanlou, Navid Mahdizadeh; Perez, Liliana			Spatial Prediction of Current and Future Flood Susceptibility: Examining the Implications of Changing Climates on Flood Susceptibility Using Machine Learning Models	ENTROPY			English	Article						climate change; machine learning (ML); geographical information systems (GIS); flood susceptibility mapping; natural hazards	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; INTELLIGENCE APPROACH; FREQUENCY RATIO; CATCHMENT; REGRESSION; IMPACT; VALIDATION; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION	The main aim of this study was to predict current and future flood susceptibility under three climate change scenarios of RCP2.6 (i.e., optimistic), RCP4.5 (i.e., business as usual), and RCP8.5 (i.e., pessimistic) employing four machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), and Naive Bayes (NB). The study was conducted for two watersheds in Canada, namely Lower Nicola River, BC and Loup, QC. Three statistical metrics were used to validate the models: Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, Figure of Merit, and F1-score. Findings indicated that the RF model had the highest accuracy in providing the flood susceptibility maps (FSMs). Moreover, the provided FSMs indicated that flooding is more likely to occur in the Lower Nicola River watershed than the Loup watershed. Following the RCP4.5 scenario, the area percentages of the flood susceptibility classes in the Loup watershed in 2050 and 2080 have changed by the following percentages from the year 2020 and 2050, respectively: Very Low = -1.68%, Low = -5.82%, Moderate = +6.19%, High = +0.71%, and Very High = +0.6% and Very Low = -1.61%, Low = +2.98%, Moderate = -3.49%, High = +1.29%, and Very High = +0.83%. Likewise, in the Lower Nicola River watershed, the changes between the years 2020 and 2050 and between the years 2050 and 2080 were: Very Low = -0.38%, Low = -0.81%, Moderate = -0.95%, High = +1.72%, and Very High = +0.42% and Very Low = -1.31%, Low = -1.35%, Moderate = -1.81%, High = +2.37%, and Very High = +2.1%, respectively. The impact of climate changes on future flood-prone places revealed that the regions designated as highly and very highly susceptible to flooding, grow in the forecasts for both watersheds. The main contribution of this study lies in the novel insights it provides concerning the flood susceptibility of watersheds in British Columbia and Quebec over time and under various climate change scenarios.

The ecological system in environmental sensitive areas of China (ESAC) is stressed by water resources, and the ecological effect of dry-wet evolution is even more profound. However, the applicability of different potential evapotranspiration (ET0) assessment methods and the response mechanism of ET0 to climate change remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the reliability of ETTH, ETHarg, and ETPM derived from Thornthwaite (TH), Hargreaves (Harg), and Penman-Monteith (PM) formulas using the monthly average air temperature (Tavg), maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature, sunshine duration (SSD), wind speed (WIN), and relative humidity (RHU) from 1961 to 2018. Further, non-parametric trend analysis, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, wavelet analysis, and seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess were used to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution of ET0 and the moisture index (MI) and its relationship with climate change in ESAC from 1961 to 2018. The results are as follows: (1) The P-M formula has excellent applicability in the research area. Under the background of average temperature rising at 0.035 degrees C yr(-1), ETPM decreases with a rate of-0.59 mm yr(-1), which indicates the "pan evaporation paradox" phenomenon. Using 1993 as the node, ETPM changed from a significant decrease to an increase. (2) WIN, SSD, Tavg, and Tmax significantly promoted changes in ETPM, and RHU and precipitation (Pr) were mainly reduced. The determinant factor of ETPM change was Tavg from 1961 to 2018. (3) MI change was mainly influenced by Pr, SSD, and ETPM. Pr promoted the change, whereas SSD and ET(PM r)educed it. The linear combination of ETPM and SSD could explain the change in MI. Our findings verified the applicability of PM in areas with severe interannual precipitation fluctuations, revealing the evolution of dry-wet pattern changes and their driving mechanisms in ESAC, which can deepen the cognition of the law of long-term land surface water cycle and effectively guide the formulation and implementation of regional drought and flood disaster response measures.

Despite its importance, there is limited research on the effect of climate change on the future of Ukraine's agricultural sector. We investigate how weather affects the yields of Ukraine's five major crops: winter wheat, spring barley, sunflower, soybean, and corn. Using panel data on village-level surveyed crop yields and fine-scale weather data from 2004-2020, we estimate flexible statistical yield models to characterize the impact of temperature and precipitation changes on crop yields. A simple linear model of the effect of average temperature and precipitation on yields suggests warming is beneficial for all crops in Ukraine. However, a more flexible model of the temperature-yield relationship implies that the yields of two cold-season crops, winter wheat and spring barley, respond negatively to temperatures above 29 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. We find no negative effects of high temperatures for the three warm-season crops. We conclude that both average temperature and exposure to high temperatures affect Ukrainian yields.

The catchment has high biodiversity, with substantial endemicity (e.g., lungfish). Freshwater and estuarine ecosystems are closely linked to the land and are affected by human disturbance, including climate change, flow management, land clearing, habitat damage, weed invasion, and excessive sediments, nutrients and pesticides. They require holistic integrated management of impacts, interactions, and land-sea linkages. This requirement is additional to land management aimed at reducing pollutant delivery to reef waters. Despite advances in research and management over recent decades, there are substantial deficiencies that need addressing, including understanding of physical and biological processes and impacts in ground waters, large rivers and estuaries; ecological effects of pesticides; management and mitigation for invasive species and climate change; and explicit protection of nonmarine waters.

Application of machine learning algorithms for flood susceptibility assessment and risk management	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article						flood risk; Hyderabad; hyperparameters; machine learning; RCPs	REGRESSION; HYDERABAD; REGION; MODEL	Assessing floods and their likely impact in climate change scenarios will enable the facilitation of sustainable management strategies. In this study, five machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely (i) Logistic Regression, (ii) Support Vector Machine, (iii) K-nearest neighbor, (iv) Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and (v) Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were tested for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), India, to evaluate their clustering abilities to classify locations (flooded or non-flooded) for climate change scenarios. A geo-spatial database, with eight flood influencing factors, namely, rainfall, elevation, slope, distance from nearest stream, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature, normalised difference vegetation index and curve number, was developed for 2000, 2006 and 2016. XGBoost performed the best, with the highest mean area under curve score of 0.83. Hence, XGBoost was adopted to simulate the future flood locations corresponding to probable highest rainfall events under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), namely, 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 along with other flood influencing factors for 2040, 2056, 2050 and 2064, respectively. The resulting flood risk probabilities are predicted as 39-77%, 16-39%, 42-63% and 39-77% for the respective years.

A trend analysis to investigate the rainfall pattern can detect changes over temporal and spatial scales for a rainfall series. In this study, trend analysis using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator was conducted in the Kelantan River Basin, Malaysia. The Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test was applied to evaluate the stationarity of the rainfall series. This basin annually faces onslaughts of varying year-end flooding conditions. The trend analysis was applied for monthly, seasonal and yearly rainfall series between 1989 and 2018. The temporal analysis results showed that both increasing and decreasing trends were detected for all rainfall series. The spatial analysis results indicated that the northern region of the Kelantan River Basin showed an increasing trend, whilst the southwest region showed a decreasing trend. It was found that almost all the rainfall series were stationary except at two rainfall stations during the Inter Monsoon 1, Inter Monsoon 2 and yearly rainfall series. Results obtained from this study can be used as reference for water resources planning and climate change assessment.

Extreme rainfall events alter the trophic structure in bromeliad tanks across the Neotropics	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AQUATIC COMMUNITY; HABITAT SIZE; PRECIPITATION; DROUGHT; TURBIDITY; RESPONSES; DRY	Changes in global and regional precipitation regimes are among the most pervasive components of climate change. Intensification of rainfall cycles, ranging from frequent downpours to severe droughts, could cause widespread, but largely unknown, alterations to trophic structure and ecosystem function. We conducted multi-site coordinated experiments to show how variation in the quantity and evenness of rainfall modulates trophic structure in 210 natural freshwater microcosms (tank bromeliads) across Central and South America (18 degrees N to 29 degrees S). The biomass of smaller organisms (detritivores) was higher under more stable hydrological conditions. Conversely, the biomass of predators was highest when rainfall was uneven, resulting in top-heavy biomass pyramids. These results illustrate how extremes of precipitation, resulting in localized droughts or flooding, can erode the base of freshwater food webs, with negative implications for the stability of trophic dynamics. The amount and frequency of rainfall structures aquatic food webs. Here the authors show that in tropical tank bromeliads, lower trophic levels are more abundant in stable rainfall conditions, while biomass pyramids are inverted in conditions with periodic droughts.

J	Babovic, F; Mijic, A				Babovic, Filip; Mijic, Ana			The development of adaptation pathways for the long-term planning of urban drainage systems	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						adaptation; decision support; urban drainage	CLIMATE-CHANGE	Cities must adapt their drainage systems to cope with the effects of land use and climate change on growing flood risk. However, the development of robust adaptation strategies remains a challenge due to the deep uncertainty surrounding future conditions. To address this problem, an Adaptation Tipping Points (ATP) approach was utilised to investigate the impacts of future rainfall with respect to increases in both depth and intensity on an urban drainage system. A set of adaptation pathways was generated to assess how the drainage system could be adapted using a range of infrastructure solutions. The most effective combination of adaptations to increase the system's ATP was an increase in system storage followed by green infrastructure solutions to add additional capacity to the system. The methodology enabled no-regret adaptation by proposing a set of selected interventions that can be incrementally implemented to achieve maximal combined effect. The resulting pathways effectively communicate to decision makers how short-term solutions allow for long-term adaptation and sustainable development. The ATP approach proved to be an effective tool for decision-making that provided a structured approach for the long-term planning of urban drainage systems.

Due to climate change, it can be assumed that such events will become more frequent in future. Even though such extreme flood can happen at any time, the consequences and impacts can be significantly reduced by appropriate technical and non-technical measures. However, such measures always require a comprehensive understanding and knowledge of previous events and comparable processes. Therefore, this special issue aims at collecting the scientific evaluation and its implications of the 2021 extreme summer flood. This editorial serves as an introduction for an article collection published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe, providing an overview of the current state of integrative assessment of the 2021 summer flood in Central Europe.

In Taiwan, industrial water conservation is an imperative climate change adaptation given the elevating incidence of floods and droughts brought on by climate change. This study extensively hand-collects data on water usage, the existence of CSR committees from CSR reports, and the annual reports of companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Taipei Exchange companies during 2017-2020. Our findings support the stakeholder theory that the existence of CSR committees likely set water use reduction targets and facilitated water usage reduction. Moreover, this relationship is stronger in water consumption industries. In summary, the memberships in water consumption industries and CSR committees are complements rather than substitutes.

The incidences of droughts and extreme floods followed by destruction have been appearing across the globe along with extensive effects on economic and public health sectors, including the human lives losses whereby, Africa is among the greatly affected regions. Several studies aver that weather-related extremes are likely to increase due to the rising impacts. This article aims to emerge the effects of a warning climate on temperature and precipitation patterns in African tropical regions for pre-emptive adaptation practices. It was conducted using nonparametric Mann-Kendall's test and Sen's slope estimator coupled with the downscaled global climate models (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 GCMs). The study shows that the annual precipitation in Lusaka keeps decreasing though the rainfall season showed an increasing possibility. The projection under ssp245 showed a slight rainfall decrement but increased by the mid-century under ssp585. Besides, the rainfall in Kigali, presents an excess increment resulting in increased extreme events. The projection showed up to 40% annual rainfall increment by the end-century under ssp585. However, both the regions present a slight trend increment in maximum and minimum temperature. Henceforth, the results of this study may prove useful in climate change mitigation and adaptation practices on rainfed agriculture, hydroelectricity, water supply systems, and resilient hydraulic infrastructure provision in the region.

To evaluate the pressures of natural disasters in this climate-change-sensitive basin, this study projected flash droughts in the headstream area of the TRB. We used the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model to describe the hydrological processes of the study area, Markov chain Monte Carlo to quantify the parameter uncertainty of the VIC model. Ten downscaled general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) were used to drive the VIC model, and the standardized evaporative stress ratio was applied to identify flash droughts. The results demonstrated that the VIC model after Bayesian parameters uncertainty analysis can efficiently describe the hydrological processes of the study area. In the future (2021-2100), compared with the plain region, the alpine region has higher flash drought frequency and intensity. Compared with the historical period (1961-2014), the frequency, duration, and intensity of flash droughts tend to increase throughout the study area, especially for the alpine area. Moreover, based on variance decomposition, CMIP6 model is the most important uncertainty source for flash drought projection, followed by the shared socioeconomic pathway of climate change scenario and VIC model parameters.

Streamflow forecasting has become crucial for effective risk management strategies in the region. However, this task presents significant challenges due to rapid climate changes and the presence of numerous newly constructed upstream dams, which disrupt the natural flow. In this paper, we develop multiple deep learning models (incl. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer) to predict streamflow with different lead time forecasts based on observed meteorological variables and climatic indices (i.e., discharge, water level, precipitation, and temperature) from 1979 to 2019. The results indicate that LSTM obtains high performance for streamflow prediction in both dry and wet seasons while Transformer is not recommended for long-term prediction, especially in the dry season. The proposed deep learning models capture well the fluctuation of river flow in the MRB during the period of high-dam development, especially LSTM (NSE = 0.8). The models' performances are enhanced with the adding of temperature for short-term prediction while precipitation was the most sensitive variable for long-term one. Such proposed models are essential for government agencies to plan mitigation and adaptation strategies at different periods, which can range from days to years.

Climate change could impair riparian vegetation dynamics through more intense and frequent climatic extreme events such as flash flooding. However, it is still poorly known how climate warming can also impair vegetation recovery through control on cellular traits after such extreme events. Here, we analyze how Mediterranean riparian tree species (namely Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus angustifolia, and Salix atrocinerea) recover after wounds caused by intense floods using 239 X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) images taken on 30 trees. The XRCT imagery allowed to characterize wounds-related macroscopic parameters in different sections along the stems in three dimensions. Then, we quantified the annual wound closure rates by dating dendrochronologically each wound and measuring the annual overgrowth on the wounded area. Finally, we used linear mixed models to investigate how wound closure rates are affected by climate conditions. Our results show that wound closure varies between species. A. glutinosa and F. angustifolia presented higher wound recovery rates than S. atrocinerea. However, the statistical analyses suggest that F. angustifolia and S. atrocinerea tend to recover much less(more) during drier(wetter) years than A. glutinosa. Our results suggest that A. glutinosa could be more stressed under climate change in the Mediterranean region, where the cooccurrence of drier conditions with extreme flood events may increase.

Yet, detailed knowledge about whether and how firms take adaptation action against flood hazards, including potential adaptation barriers, is surprisingly thin. We respond to this gap by offering an empirical analysis of small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), one of the front lines of future environmental risk. Drawing on qualitative interviews, our study has two main aims: first, to understand if adaptive action occurs more intensively among firms that previously faced high direct impacts, and second, to shed light on other internal firm characteristics as well as external conditions that determine firm decisions to undertake flood adaptation measures. We find that the majority of firms cope reactively to prevent severe flooding effects. Interestingly, experience with past events, including those of high impact, do not directly lead to long-term strategic adaptation. A lack of business capabilities and financial capacity, combined with insufficient support systems, largely hamper proactive adaptation. This leads to increased risks and selfreinforcing effects, which quickly endanger the future business viability of firms. Future research on adaptation to climate change should seek to improve understanding of adaptive capacities among SMEs, which are quite different from those of large international corporations.

The community is at the nexus of large-scale Arctic social and climate change resulting from economic shifts, permafrost melt events, and high temperatures. In this study, we approach Indigenous knowledge of climate impacts to water by investigating the role of the river Alazeya, which has enabled human life to thrive, given rise to the Indigenous governance of landscapes in the past, and today serves most of the Indigenous peoples in the region for their culture, food security, and well-being. To do this, we offer an ambitious system-change analysis of the socio-ecological context of the river basin and community by exploring oral histories recorded in the community between 2005 and 2020, combining them with relevant scientific literature and weather data from Russian measurement stations to detect and point to key messages of impacts. Our results confirm that the speed and extent of climate warming have increased since 1985. The flood event of 2007 in the village has especially been seen as a major climate change-induced catastrophe. We focus on the drivers of change from local history to present. We also investigate alternatives for future development of resilience and support for the Yukaghir culture, traditional ways of life, and language.

Using spatial socioeconomic data and remote sensing, we estimated the potential economic damage that can be caused by the flooding of local streams and rivers along the Nakdong River (the longest river in Korea). For the analysis, a river risk map including return periods (50, 80, 100, and 200 years) and spatial inventories (residential, agricultural, industrial assets, and human lives) was employed to determine flood-prone areas and assess the damage within the inundation areas. A quantitative flood analysis was conducted using an object-based method to estimate the expected annual damage. We then compared the estimated damage for each tributary within the designed return periods and found no correlation. Numerous tributaries with low-defense targets were considered high-risk, while those with high-defense targets were assessed as low-risk. The dataset used in this study covered four damage categories. Among them, flood damage to residential assets appeared to have the highest value, whereas flood damage to industrial assets had the lowest value. The results demonstrate that the Korean government needs to tailor its flood defense policy based on quantitative risk assessments to effectively manage flood risks, especially given the increasing risk of climate change.

Land use/land cover (LULC) is an important anthropogenic factor that has a significant impact on runoff changes. Quantifying runoff variation characteristics and determining the effect of changes in climate and LULC on runoff is important for water resource management and application. The mathematical statistics analysis and soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) were combined to perform a comprehensive analysis of runoff based on meteorological and hydrological data from the Datong River source area, and the effect of changes in climate and LULC on runoff was quantitatively calculated.New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicate that under the warm and humid climate, there was a slight change in the inter-annual runoff, while the distribution of runoff within the year was uneven due to the control of climate factors. Climate exhibited a positive driving effect on runoff, while LULC reduced the runoff and contributed 125% and - 25%, respectively, to the change in the runoff. Rainfall is the most important climatic factor influencing runoff change. It is recommended that the flood tragedy induced by short periods of high rainfall be taken into account during the process of water resource management in the basin.

However, due the dynamic nature of urban areas and uneven distribution of meteorological stations, it is difficult to study rainfall pattern in the urban areas. Hence, in this study, trend and pattern of rainfall have been examined of Mumbai city using rainfall regionalization approach. For this, K-means and fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering approaches have been used to examine the pattern of rainfall. The innovative trend analysis (ITA) and five tests of Mann-Kendall (MK) family have been utilized for anaylzing the rainfall trend. Result shows that both K-means and FCM techniques have identified two homogeneous rainfall regions in Mumbai exhibiting two distinctive rainfall patterns. The ITA curve shows that in the lower cluster, the data points are below 1:1 (45o) line, but in high and moderate cluster, they are above the line. This shows that there is a positive trend in the rainfall, but it is not monotonic. Further, the MK tests utilized in this study also shows positive trend in the rainfall in Mumbai. The result of this study may help in management of water resource and in urban flood mitigation in Mumbai city.

Risk communication is an effective mechanism that affects risk perception and can significantly reduce flood risk. This study quantifies risk perception and communication in flood-prone rural areas of District Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan. The rural communities were divided into two zones based on the distance from rivers, i.e., Zone 1 (households within 0-3 km) and Zone 2 (households within 3-6 km). After a thorough literature review, indicators measured on the Likert scale were selected for risk perception and communication. Using Yamane's sampling, 420 samples were collected using a household survey. Chi-square and t-tests were used to identify differences between the two zones. Linear regression was performed to identify the socioeconomic determinants of risk communication and perception. Results showed that the people living away from the river had higher risk perception and received better risk communication than their peers. The main reason was attributed to their past flood experiences. The study also found a strong correlation between flood risk perception and risk communication. Hazard proximity was also found to affect risk perception and communication. People with higher risk perception are likely to seek risk communication information and engage in flood preparedness and mitigation measures. This study provides an insight into the need for risk communication for improving the effectiveness of flood risk reduction.

Cumulative impacts of a gravel road and climate change in an ice-wedge-polygon landscape, Prudhoe Bay, Alaska	ARCTIC SCIENCE			English	Article						flooding; landforms; permafrost; road dust; thermokarst; vegetation	PERMAFROST LANDSCAPES; SHRUB EXPANSION; NORTHERN ALASKA; OIL DEVELOPMENT; THERMAL REGIME; GROUND ICE; TUNDRA; DEGRADATION; VEGETATION; SYSTEM	Environmental impact assessments for new Arctic infrastructure do not adequately consider the likely long-term cumulative effects of climate change and infrastructure to landforms and vegetation in areas with ice-rich permafrost, due in part to lack of long-term environmental studies that monitor changes after the infrastructure is built. This case study examines long-term (1949???2020) climate-and road-related changes in a network of ice-wedge polygons, Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, Alaska. We studied four trajectories of change along a heavily traveled road and a relatively remote site. During 20 years prior to the oilfield development, the climate and landscapes changed very little. During 50 years after development, climate-related changes included increased numbers of thermokarst ponds, changes to ice-wedge-polygon morphology, snow distribution, thaw depths, dominant vegetation types, and shrub abundance. Road dust strongly affected plant-community structure and composition, particularly small forbs, mosses, and lichens. Flooding increased permafrost degradation, polygon center-trough elevation contrasts, and vegetation productivity. It was not possible to isolate infrastructure impacts from climate impacts, but the combined datasets provide unique insights into the rate and extent of ecological disturbances associated with infrastructure-affected landscapes under decades of climate warming.

J	da Silva, LBL; Alencar, MH; de Almeida, AT				Leal da Silva, Lucas Borges; Alencar, Marcelo Hazin; de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira			A novel spatiotemporal multi-attribute method for assessing flood risks in urban spaces under climate change and demographic scenarios	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						flood risk; MCDM; A; nonstationary modeling; MAUT; climate change; population growth	DECISION-MAKING; TIME PERCEPTION; PREFERENCES; SIMULATION; MULTICRITERIA; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS	The combined effects of global warming and population growth induce policymakers to enhance flood risk management practices in order to reduce substantially the causes of floods and to mitigate their future and multiple impacts simultaneously. This way, this paper puts forward a new multi-attribute and non-stationary decision model for managing flood risks in urban areas under climate demographic changes, which we call the Non-Stationary Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (NSMAUT). Under expected utilities, our model inserts time dependency into the decision-maker's (DM's) preference statements based on his/her trade-offs regarding psychological distance induced by delayed prospects. The NSMAUT analyzes flood risks under five attributes, linked to environmental, financial, human, mobility, and social concerns of society. By combining climate and demographic scenarios for this century, our findings make use of statistical, graphic, and risk performance measures that increase the DM's perception of risk in order to control and monitor the dynamism of circumstances of risk and thus to facilitate on what he/she should base future decisions on adapting cities for future adverse events arising from flooding. A numerical application in a Brazilian municipality from 2021 - 2100 is used to validate our approach. Moreover, the model can be replicated in other urban contexts.

The government is expanding a new drainage pump station to minimize flood damage, but the river level has not been adjusted because of torrential rains. Therefore, the river level must be adjusted to operate the drainage pump station, and it can be adjusted through the reservoir of the drainage pump station. In this study, we developed a method for operating drainage pump stations to control the river level and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A stormwater management model (SWMM) was used to simulate the Suyeong River and Oncheon River in Busan, Korea. The rainfall data from 2011 to 2021 were investigated. The data were sorted into ten big floods that occurred in Busan. The model was calibrated with actual rainfall data. The water level of the Suyeong River and the Oncheon River was the highest in most simulations. The simulation results showed an average decrease of 3018.2 m(3) in Suyeong River flooding, and the Oncheon River needed to be supplemented due to structural problems. As a result of the recombination by simply supplementing the structural problems of the Oncheon River, the average flooding of 194.5 m(3) was reduced. The proposed method is economical and efficient for reducing urban stream flooding in areas susceptible to severe damage caused by climate change.</p>	[Choo, Yeon-Moon] Pusan Natl Univ, Ind Technol Inst, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Kim, Jong-Gu; Park, Shang-Ho; Choo, Tai-Ho; Choe, Yeon-Woong] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea	Pusan National University; Pusan National University	Choe, YW (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Busan 46241, South Korea.	chooyean@naver.com; koreaws@empas.com; sangogo@nate.com; thchoo@pusan.ac.kr; ywchoe@pusan.ac.kr	Choo, Yeon Moon/JJC-2061-2023		BK21 FOUR Program by Pusan National University Research Grant, 2021	BK21 FOUR Program by Pusan National University Research Grant, 2021	This work was supported by BK21 FOUR Program by Pusan National University Research Grant, 2021.		25	4	4	5	22	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4441		WATER-SUI	Water	OCT	2021	13	19							2741	10.3390/w13192741	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192741			15	Environmental Sciences; Water Resources	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources	WH6LB		gold			2024-04-22	WOS:000707785500001

Moreover, it has been widely acknowledged that the frequency and intensity of typhoons (or abnormal low-pressure systems) are likely to increase over time due to the potential impact of climate change. A risk analysis covering different loading conditions has been a tool for flood risk management in these contexts. We propose a Bayesian network based generic risk analysis tool for flood defense systems such as a levee, dike, and seawall. On the other hand, this study explores various failure modes of flood defense structures for the use of risk analysis. In this study, the proposed modeling framework is applied to Saemangeum seawall in South Korea. Based on the literature review, various failure modes for Saemangeum seawall was identified, and the selected failure mode is then translated into nodes in the Bayesian network framework. The failure probability was estimated quantitatively by computing the limit state equation, which is composed of a set of random variables. Moreover, we investigated a Bayesian network model to assess the impact of compounding risk associated with revetment erosion of the seawall from sea-level rise informed by climate change scenarios. A further discussion on the role of the uncertainty for overall risk is provided.

A more humid atmosphere will lead to enhanced moisture transport due to, among other factors, an intensification of atmospheric rivers (ARs) activity, which are an important mechanism of moisture advection from subtropical to extra-tropical regions. Here we show an enhanced evapotranspiration rates in association with landfalling atmospheric river events. These anomalous moisture uptake (AMU) locations are identified on a global scale. The interannual variability of AMU displays a significant increase over the period 1980-2017, close to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling, at 7 % per degree of surface temperature rise. These findings are consistent with an intensification of AR predicted by future projections. Our results also reveal generalized significant increases in AMU at the regional scale and an asymmetric supply of oceanic moisture, in which the maximum values are located over the region known as the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP) centred on the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Increasing atmospheric temperatures are expected to have various impacts on the global water cycle. Here, the authors show that there is an intensification of atmospheric rivers, that causes enhanced evapotranspiration and thus atmospheric moisture uptake in many regions of the world.

In parallel, all regions of the world are projected to urbanise further. Consequently, sustainable development challenges will be increasingly concentrated in cities. A resulting impact is the increment of expected urban flood risk in many areas around the globe. Adaptation to climate change is an opportunity to improve urban conditions through the implementation of green-blue infrastructures, which provide multiple benefits besides flood mitigation. However, this is not an easy task since urban drainage systems are complex structures. This work focuses on a method to analyse the trade-offs when different benefits are pursued in stormwater infrastructure planning. A hydrodynamic model was coupled with an evolutionary optimisation algorithm to evaluate different green-blue-grey measures combinations. This evaluation includes flood mitigation as well as the enhancement of co-benefits. We confirmed optimisation as a helpful decision-making tool to visualise trade-offs among flood management strategies. Our results show that considering co-benefits enhancement as an objective boosts the selection of green-blue infrastructure. However, flood mitigation effectiveness can be diminished when extra benefits are pursued. Finally, we proved that combining green-blue-grey measures is particularly important in urban spaces when several benefits are considered simultaneously. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

J	Choi, HI				Choi, Hyun Il			Spatial Assessment of Damage Vulnerability to Storms Based on the Analysis of Historical Damage Cost Data in the Korean Peninsula	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						vulnerability assessment; damage vulnerability index; storm-induced disaster; damage cost; risk analysis; damage mitigation	FLOOD; RESPONSES; INDEX; AREA; RISK	According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reports, climate variability and changes increase the possibility of extreme weather events causing climate-related hazards and the risk of natural disasters. A storm is one of the most common and serious natural hazards that pose significant human and economic damage costs worldwide. The Korean Peninsula is also at persistent risk of hydro-meteorological disasters induced by rainstorms and typhoons due to geomorphological features and climate change impacts. This study has, therefore, proposed the damage vulnerability index for a spatial assessment of the damage vulnerability to storms, based on the IPCC's vulnerability assessment concept. The damage vulnerability index is aggregated from the potential indicator for the potential damage targets, estimated by the population and major facility densities, and the risk indicator for the expected damage risk, estimated by the risk analysis for integrating both frequency and severity of human and economic damage cost records. The damage vulnerability index can assess regions vulnerable to the disaster damage induced by rainstorms, typhoons, and both, respectively, over the 231 administrative districts in the Republic of Korea. It is expected that the proposed damage vulnerability index can provide realistic and practical information on sustainable damage mitigation plans for the nationwide administrative districts against storm-induced disasters.

This article reviews the status, values, and threats of wetlands in the GBR catchments, as well as the management, protection, and challenges and opportunities for their restoration and rehabilitation. At present, wetlands in the GBR catchments have low rates of area loss and are generally well protected; however, they face major management challenges owing to the intensive land use of the catchments, especially for grazing, agriculture, horticulture, and mining. Major threats to these wetlands include water pollution, invasive species, changes in hydrology, and increasing temperature and salinity resulting from climate change. In recent years wetlands have been considered primarily for their role in improving water quality to ameliorate contaminated terrestrial run-off to the GBR, with little attention given to their intrinsic value and other ecosystem services. Financial opportunities for wetland restoration in addition to government-funded schemes include water pollution offsets, payment for ecosystem services, and nitrogen markets. Wetlands need to be protected, managed, and restored for the ecosystem services that they provide to the GBR, but also for their intrinsic value as significant features of coastal landscapes.
